yesterday afternoon governor gringo abbot of texts issued a letter basically announcing t of the state of texts was going to start enforcing the border they ben doing this for a while they put a bunch of thinking in the middle of the red ground barriers the mill the rail ground to bread people from crossing the word of the federal government has objected to that they have used raiser wire in state parks that are on the national border and the federal government has objected to all of that well yesterday great abbot looking at the crisis that has been created by hoiden on the southern border issued what is a rather historic letter or can go through it in its details because what we are watching is now a constitutional crisis that is created entirely by job widen and his evil activities on thenar and they are i amsorriits it is an evil thing not to enforce the border of your country to purposefully say that you are going to leave the border wide open which is what golden has done i been down to the border it is wide open to facilitate debt to basically incentivize the drug cartels to poor millions of people into the united states is a bad thing it is jobidon abandoning his constitutional duties it is jobidon abdicating the presidency of the united states it is an evil for the president of the united states to do those things thou be the equivalent of a mayor of a large city simply announcing that they are not going to police crime any more the fundamental duty of the federal government is to protect the people of the united states o america and to protect the borders of the united states o america that is why it is a federally mandated duty for the for the government of the united states to do that that is whites a federal issue and not a state issue and jobidon has nonoily signally failed he has done the opposites of good he is facilitated all of this in the estimates on the umber of you legal emigrant to have entered the country it ranges from a low the low would be six million people have entered the country illegally under hoiden there certain estimates that put that upwards of ten million there is no real way to know because of course they're munch people who ran across the border and godawayand those are unknown roadways they are known roadways and unknown roadways but jobidon has facilitated all this with terrible border policy it is wrong it should be against the law again the federal government has one job and one job only in the in the end and that is to protect you to protect your rights there are already laws on the books that prevent illegal emigration those laws have been in place for decades in the united states it is up to the president of the united states to enforce those laws and again it is worth noting here that leaving the border wide open is not just incentivizing the medical drug cartels to move millions people across the southern border it is insentivizing the medical drug car tells to move tons of sentinel across the southern border which is being used to it kill effectively a hundred thousand america a year depending on the numbers that re using when it comes to drug over dos those drugs are pouring over the border gan this is all facilitated by jobiden's policy this was not a problem during the latter years the trump administration just was not and it is under jobinan it is a manufactured cry sis ecus jobidon has decided just legally speaking that who can get rid of remain in mexico his going to suggest that if you arrive on america southern border throw up their hands and say i am here betas i fear to go my home country then we have to process you and release you into the interior of the united states then seventy two hours that is basically how jobidon's border policies work and he has staffed nineteen per scent of bore patrol on bussing and administrative duty living the rest of the board wide open for the medical drug cartels he is turn board patron to a ferry service for illegal emigration can ask members o boardpetrol they will openly tell you that that is what they are now it use to be that it was their job to track down people who are legally crossing the border said they could be detained and then to ported and now it is their job to basically act as ti facilitation service for he legal entry into the country why is jobidon doing this and the there must be ration out because he is committed to open borders that he is scuttling his own desire for you crane aid for israel aid for titan aid in order to keep those borers open re publicans have proposed fixes on the border that would for example most i portent fix would be not only the reinforcement of remain in meicohch rs a trump impolicy that jobidon refuses to in force which would simply say that if you are plying for asylum yet to wait in mexico while that asylum request is process which would mean that most of those people are getting in the country as posed to now they arrive and then again we defend them for five seconds another release them and they count what went in the interior in the never show up again is not just that jobidon's asylum policies they see to be fixed in order to claim asylum in the united states you should have to show the burden proves on you to show that you actually require asylum right now you on you have to make a colorable argument that you require asylum you just claim that you do and then release you to the interior go a too which is the republican bill that would shore up all this jobidon is rejecting all aspects of that even if it means scuttling the aid that you crane actually needs in order to maintain its war against russia invasion why would he be doing that there only a couple pass wile reasons one is obviously political that jobidon and aloof democrats believe that many of the legal emigrants are crossing the border are going to eventually become democratic voters and for all the people horsanguell you note they they cannot vote cause their legal immigrants you do not need the ellelimigrants to vote all you need to do is for them to get married they have a bunch of young single men who are crossing the border all they have to do his madman america citizen and they're now sponsor for citizenship they cannot get their green card which moves them toward citizen play there is the bet that de democrats are making that eventually somebody's getting amnesty all these folks and they will become america citizens at which point there gin a vote for democrats and why would doe mores not think that given the fact that many of the people where crossing the bore right now are chancing jobidon's name i men there is video of it wore may be it is because jobidon is ideologically captured by his radical left flank a radical left flank the believes that america is in fact a guilty country on the world station therefore has some sort of moral duty to open its borders wide to anybody who wants to come into the country whatever the reason jobidon has abandoned his duty as president and all of this is the predict to boys also the brigtoabla result is that the state of texts is looking at this theirs and we are getting smack in the fates by illegal immigration were being told that we have to basically swallow it when the federal government decides not to enforce the law and this raise the butcher really deep legal and constitutional issues but we have to lead with the moral because here s the reality gabion could solve this to morrow by simply enforcing the border and by the way the america people should police by not reelecting jobidon that would solve the too we at to warn this in just one second but first folks twenty twenty four is going to be a wild ride we have of course already seen the impact of inflation the gaspomp an the grocery store the dollar is losing its purchasing power and has lost a lot of purchasing power over the past few years the mask you a question how are you protecting your savings consider diversifying with gold from the birch gold group for decades gold has been the choice of investors and central banks to hedge against inflation i myself have invested with birch gold to diversify by portfolio that is just they smart way to invest birch gold can help you creator well thought out and balanced in vestment strategy the hope converted existing narrate or forgot cay into an crane gold without pang a penny out of pocket and this month only when you open a gold sorry with birch gold he will get a free sign copy of my book the authoritarian

you can too ten end to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight to protect your savings and claim your eligibility for a free sign copy of the authoritarian moment to day yesterday grab abbot governor of texts put out as statement heres what its at quote the federal government has broken the compact between the united states in testates the executive branch of the united states is a constitutional but to enforce federal laws protecting states including emigration laws on the books right now president baton has refused to enforce those laws and he is even violated them the result is that he as smashed records for a legal immigration despite having been put on notice in a series of letters one of which i delivered him by hand president baton as ignored texts is demand that he perform his constitutional duties president baton says grab abbot has violated his oath to faithfully execute immigration laws enacted by congress instead of prosecuting immigrants for the federal crime of a legal entry president bit has sent his lawyers into federal courts to sue texts for taking action to secure the border president baton has instructed his agencies to ignore federal statutes that man take the detention of e legal immigrants the effect is to a legally allow that onmasperoll into the united states he is right about that that is the called catching release program instead of detaining people until they actually have their asylum hearing instead they have an initial hearing and then they are released on their own recognizant into the interior of the united states and again it is no more than a week i mean that that the the average right nougpri seventy two hours what have been told by people at border patrol great abbots by wasting tax par dollars to tear open tea's border security in for structure president baton has enticed illegal immigrants away from the twenty eight legal entry points along this states southern border bridges were nobody rounds and into the dangerous waders of the real ground which of course is true one of the thing drug cartels are doing right now is they do not actually want illegal immigrants process at these stations they want to flood certain border points with the illegal immigrants as to draw the border patrol to those areas where it is their duty to care for the illegal i migrants are entering the country and claiming asylum and then what is that to wealth you take all the people who are spaced along the border and there are jamming word patrolegents have then spaced along the border trying to maintain is on miles of the border and then you centralized them at this point right here which is where all the illegalemigrants are rushing across not at border patrol station well what is that d lease the rest of the border wide open and that is when you get illegal emigrants quit infant or drug smugglers being shifted across the border by the drug cartels grew about was under presidetei beans lawless border policies more than six million y legalemigrnts have crossed our southern border in just three years this is more than the population of thirty three different states in this country the illegal refusal to protect states has inflicted on president at harm on the people all across the united states he continues names radicand allemande hamilton and the other visionaries wrote the of constitution foresaw that states should not be left to the mercy of a lawless president who does nothing to stop external threats tells smuggling millions of e leglemigrans across the border that is why the framers included both article for section for which promises the federal government show protect each state against invasion an article one section ten class three with which acknowledges the states sovereign interest in protecting their borders the failure of the bi can administration to fulfill the duties in posed by article for section for his trigger article one section ten class three which reserves to the state the right of self defense for these reasons i have already declared an invasion under article one section ten plus three to invoke team's constitutional authority to defend in protect itself that authority is the supreme law f the land an superseedesto any federal stations to the contrary the texts national guard the texts to apartment o police safety another techs personal our acting on that authority as well as state law to secure the texts border o a one big questions here is what dos that means lets start with the very legal basics here great abbot has done nothing to violate the law thus far nothing his not violated federals federal law not violated state law people whore accusing him of having done thus far by having texts state troopers but out razor wire and state parks they do not not their talking about the supreme corder rules recently that the federal government has the capacity to withdraw the razor wire but they said nothing about whether the state of texts is allowed to put up the razor wire thesubrimgord did not rule that it was i legal for the state of texts to for example put barriers in the real ground they just rule that the federal government is allowed to remove those barriers they removed an injunction against the federal government right there it did not say what texts was doing wat the legal in anyways anybody who selling you different the media to day that texts is doing something illegally that is not true now f texts were to prevent he federal government from actually dismancelling the razor wire for example then you start to get into some direct legal issues let us get to exactly what jobidon is doing here that is facilitating all of this first of all he is exploiting in the law for his own agenda right he he is he's exploiting it now he is following barockobo is example in doing this he is been using executive action to stop prosecution of called dreamers right this the same thing that that brakobomited a data that infer to action for child to rivals program that is been ticking around the legal system since twenty ten and some people have ruled the a legal and others have ruled end not e legal in twenty twenty the supreme sort rule that the trump administration could even remind back at least not the way they did it which was a ridiculous ruling thy said that that brocamama could actually issue data which effectively legalize millions of eallyliegrans but dona trump couldn't reverse that policy by executive action it said that he would fail to go through the administrative proceed yours act is a much a jumbo jumbo but is really rally silly we but it is certainly a very weird legal motion that the president just has the simple ability to not enforce the law that is a very weir legal idea in fact in nineteen seventy five for example there was a federal case in which the president of the united states refused to actually spend money that had been located by congress for particular purpose and the supreme sort found that he could not do that that if the that if the congress said you must spend ex dollars the president could not spend half of those dollars he had to spend ex dollars if the executive branch is charged with executing the laws then why in the world with the executive branch of the power to not execute the laws that the can clam that they need more resources but that is not what yobidan is really blaming right now he says he wants more resources in order to facilitate for illegal migration not nor to actually in force america southern border cause's want more policing power on the southern border in any real way that is we re publicans are objecting well gets a more in this in just one second first let say that you re climbing up the empire stake building while simultaneously being tired by the as air force after all what else would you do if you re giant armilla that got kid named from skull island well eventually the sour

time and money give your family if financial safety net with policy genius how danger to policy genius tot come slash pure or quick that link in the description they r free life insurance quotes e how much you could save that is policy genius dot come lash apart that brings us to a deeper issue and it is it is sort of a little bat down the road from were we are right now because we have not actually got in their yautia is the one that sort of in everybody's mind and that is whether the state of texts can anal laterally in force immigration law even if the federal government wants them not to the best compeer is from two thousand ten that you are the state of arizona pa auto law called esse ten seventy you may remember this the horizon governor at the time was woman a can brewer and that law contain for provisions the trigonal law the first provision was that it created a state law crime for being unlawfully present in the united states as yous the federal crime four the you legal emigrants to be in the united states that would be proceed by the federal government than you be deported would be a state law crimes prison could jail you for being unlawfully present in the united states second if created a state la crime for working or seeking to work when you are not authorized to do it is a federal crime for people to use the fall social security number for example t o work legally in the united states the created at a comparative state law crime based on that third it required state and local lawgivers to verify the citizenship or alien status of any one who is lawfully arrestor detains sos an anti sanctuarycity policy is the arizona espy ten seventy law that a not going to thesuprim court as a talking about it a thaderal squired that if you are cob and you pull somebody over you have to check whether they are legally here or not and then fourth the law authorized warrntless arrests of aliens believed to be removable from the united states you could just arrest people and then presumably you would urn them over tote federal government the question on the tables the the abominadministration suit epizoa to stop them from putting this law in place in the same way that currently the by administrations trying to stop texts from enforcing mortal law the question on the table was whether federal preemption prevented those laws from taking effect the federal preemption is the doctrine that under the supremacy claws of the constitution which says that the constitution is the supreme law of the land en a state law comes into conflict of the federal law the state law loses let say that the federal law says for example that it is criminal to to commit some sort of crime the state law cannot then exempt that sort of crime from prosecution by the federal government you cannot you cant just no the federal law and federal preemption actually lo but brought and that says that a federal law actually takes up a certain portion of the law if it occupies that portion of law the state laws cannot come into conflict with it the court in the arizona case found five three that items one to and four were in violation of the constitution those would be the state created laws than enforce the federal constitution the court did find for example that you could get rid of sanctuary status in in the state of arizona that you could force your state law in foremen official to check a migration station or pot to ice but the court found that the federal laws on emigration prevented state laws that created crimes based on federal status which seems a weir decision a really wear decision because a festively speaking what you are now saying is that be states cannot call the blow of the federal government by enforcing laws that are already on the federal books if the federal government says it is criminal to cross the order and you should be deported and the the state pas the law that says it is criminal to cross the border using the federal definition and you will be deported or criminalize or i go costate prison that that somehow in conflict with the federal law justice called disagreed and this is the descent that is referred to in the letter from grew rabbit and here is what he stated indecent to day's opinion approving virtually all of the ninth circuits injunction against enforcement of the for challenged provisions verizonal law the drive states of what most would consider the defining caristrt characteristic of sovereignty the power to exclude from the sovereigns territory people who have no right to be there the naturalization power was given to congress not to abrogate states power to exclude those they did not want but to vindicated soothers what he is saying is that originally the reasontemigration wall was given to the federal government is because everybody at the beginning of the republic was very much afraid of what is happen in the e you where sate italy has open emigration policies and your hungary and you say i do not want all the semigrins coming to my country but the use says no no you must if one of these countries is wide open than you have to be wide open the federal government took control of this as to make homogenesis emigration law round the united states there would be freedom of travel and freedom of residency inside the united states but nor for that o that bargain to be upheld the federal government actually does hae to police the border and that's particularly true enough laws on the books saying the the border must be police it is one thing if the federal government has passed laws saying we have basically open immigration at this tine because presumably those federal laws our part of a constitution shots signed on to by the states it is another thing for the federal government to have laws on the books saying you must police the border and remove illegal immigrants and the federal government these ecoutdaom ranches says no where not on to do it beat now you have abrogated the compact meanscolea said in that case in the descents said the reason the entire issue was federalized mas prevent open migration to one state from affecting all the states and that is basically what grew rabbit is arguing in this letter and he is right now that does not mean that the suprimcorts can o vindicate him because after all the suprimcorvoted the other way in that arizona case we have no idea what the uprimcort will do here because the constituency of the supreme cart has changed since two thousand ten now that is argument number one is that basically the federal government has abrogated its constitutional duty and they must be forced to actually enforce the law but then he makes an a kind of unique constitutional argument and this one gets into just on a legal side some fascinating and controversial territory sort that wit we get's more on this in just one second first here is a great new years resolution you can actually keep ut they have three minute in the morning or thirty minutes keep your face wrinkle free with genucell introducing get ninety the new instant wrinkle treatment from genucell get ninety instantly reduces

to genu sell dog come slash of pure to day that g and u c e l dot come slash shipiro to get started to day abbot ass makes con unique constitutional argument here here is what he says he says that under article one section ten closthery the state can invoke its constitutional authority to defend id citizens from invasion now back could be as they say contact difficult controversial legal argument here is the actual text of article one section ten clos three quote no state shell without the contents of congress lay any duty of huge keep troops or ships of war in times of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with e foreign power or engageiin war unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay what was that meant to do what what is an invasion mean in that contact presumably ament the brutish show up in massachusetts with their gun bots and the massachousas militia has no time to respond that to getsogon i went to do something rightist because what that what that is doing it saying the foreign policy of the united states is a federal question it is not a state question unless it is basically in exigent circumstance right's an urgent dangerous circumstance in which woe have an actual foreign body that is encroaching over the border for example an attacking taxes for example the medical cartels just aside one day the bring walk over the word with a a forty sevens s canteens defend itself of course texts does not have to call the federal government at least not until afterward and they can shoot the pelican drug cartel members who constitute an invading army a but what what actually abbot is doing is he is claiming that the massive illegal migration wave does not constitute an invasion in sort of a collokuheel sense why thewy the uni say invasion meaning a a vast wave of people being facilitated in entry he is actually trying to site the waw under the constitution of invasion in order to apply to illegal migration which is again i think legally dictating the springports can have a tough time with that argument for example texts for example i think has a pretty good argument that they can to shoot down medical cartoldrones if the medical cartels have drones over the border for example that is a military incursion into the united states texts should not have to call up the chain to shout down the ones however can they just start capturing i legal emigrants and treating them as per is as you would during an invasion great i if if if a medical army cross the border and ten had to defend itself t would shoot people and take them pig is is that really the situation here very difficult to say that that is the situation here see's not let us be real bothers it is not being treated as an invasion the are being treat as an invasion then prismalyolopula getting shot on the border which is not exactly whats happening again the better argument here that abbot is making is effectively that the federal government has abrogated its duty to protect the border and they should be forced by light to do that if they will not do it then organ to do it the the argument that he gets to invoke invasion power in order to sort of defend the state against invasion i thing that to a little but more legally dick but here as i say this entire thing could be solved to morrow by joabidin enforcing border that is all and the stuff becomes absolutely inevitable it become absolutely inevitable if you do not protect the people of this country because have are a political decision not to enforce the law people are can get mad andtherne to try to find ways to actually enforce the law and protect themselves you cannot leave people on protected what we are being on the southern border it large is what you are seeing in thew york subway system writ small which is if you re move the cops from the subway system and then you have criminals ore attacking people you argon to have people dance penny who defend the people in the subway car from crazy people who attacking them and if you leave the border wide open you are going to start having state authority stake guides if you are only we have to defend our citizens they are our citizens too they are not just federal citizens they state citizens it is our shop to protect them the way that get solved is by job naturally enforcing the border o case they are couple a sort of historic precedent for what happens when we have a state federal stand off and and were not in that position quiet yet because again the state of taxes is not telling for example the federal government they cannot cut the razor wire it grab rabbit has not prevented the entry of c b p on to state lands to cut the razor wire there is directing new razor wire which is totally legal the federal government has not deployed troops to open the southern border and the state government has deployed the testa strangers to shoot at them or something can but how do these sorts of stand offs historically get all because we have had stand off stators of the federal government much more severe than this in the past wallet more on this in just one second first yo have a car your investing in but yo don't atonally use well what you do instead with it is give it to cars for kids cars for kids he's the people it the jingle right cars for kids will pick up your car for prey and you get a tax eduction for the sail price of the car plus a free to night hotels stay not to mention by dominating it to a worthy charity your car ill do something good for the world instead of taking up space in your mind and in your drive way hours out works visit their website at cars for kids dot or slashed give them some basic info let them take it from there the whole process takes two minutes cars for kids will medal a pick up at a time convenient for you you re even need to be there for pick up they will take your cameral regardless of its condition whether or not its running cars for kids gets right to work selling your car for the highest price they can generating more money for kids and getting you a better tax right off because the tax deduction is based on these price the car that is to wind wind right there not to mention the vacation douche for that many vacation you could really use right about now what exactly you waiting for call or is it cars for kids dot or slashed and get the ball rolling that is cars with a say and the number for at cars for kids dot or slashed he will take god carry you and your car basically there two pass one as the federal gourmet us to overruns the states which historically has happened a couple of times it happened obviously during the civil war an that it also happen during the civil rights movement both too good a fact by the way and the civil war wit is basically the states to arguing that the federal government did not have the power to enforce laws within their states regarding for example the fugitive slave act or provision of the fugitive slave act they were afraid that the was all the federal government was going to start freeing slaves in the south they said that violates the state compact a violates the state theory and the federal government tad not we have the power to do that becauseyou are violating the basic rights of human beings and we can we can we have to preserve the union and that is the fight o this ova on federal government winds that fight obviously which is a good thing and then during the civil rights movement the had the same sort of thing and the aftermath of the passage of brown verses board by the supreme court ye had in serration of southern universities for example and people forget just how violent and stand office a got the most famous examples in nineteen sixty two with university of mississippi which is known also as old miss that there there is eight there is a blacks named parson's herewith who is the first black student who's admitted two of mes and the governor of the state of mississippi tried to obstruct meriting from a tending and the federal government under gaff ka actually chad to activate first the national guard and then they eventually had t activate thirty one thousand troops thirty one thousand troops to make sure of the campus state open the federal government refuse to compromise as they should of because again him's herewith had a federal civil right to go to the university are not now again that is the federal government attempting to enforce law not the federal government attempting to ignore holds that is a bit a different thing can the only other example that we have that as ended a different way is the called nullification crisis of eighteen twenty eight in eighteen twenty eight the federal government passes a tariff it is a tariff that is designed against foreign goods that r manufactured because the idea was en protect the infant industries of the north's new manufacturing firms and train a pass a tariff that basely jacks up the cost of foreign goods the are manufactured to make room for manufacturing in the north the southerns takes this is crap we did not sign on to the constitution to be barred from importing manufactured goods and then have foreign countries retaliate against non manufactured goods from the united states which were typically southern product to the tariffs disproportionate hat the south and typist disproportionately benefit on the north vice present and john sea callous twas a vicious race that and the later make very similar arguments of regard to slavery but her made an interesting constitutional argument he argued that the states had what he called the right of nullification what this meant is that if the state decided that the federal law had gone beyond the reset of the constitution states could simply say no and refuse to in force it and not only re fuse to en force it could resist it now that action was not such an unusual position eighteen twenty eight that position had been taken for example by homes jefferson who wrote in a a in a series of missives that became resolutions that are passed by states the kentucky in virgin in the last eighteen century reboot regarding the alien in sedition acts quote where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy that every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact cassis non federal to nollifyht of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits that without this right they be under the dominion absolute and en limited of what is of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them another words if the federal government decided the tomorrows can just violate that the constitutional pat in first its boundaries that states could have right to resist that aims malison action made a similar suggestion at the time he is the father the constitution hes to quote the constitution of the united states was formed by the sanction of the states given by each in it sovereign capacity it adds to the stability and dignity as well as to the authority of the constitution that it rests on this solid foundation the states then being parties to the constitutional compact and in their sovereign capacity and follows of necessity there can be no tribunal above their authority to decide in the last resort whether the compact made by them be violated and an consequently as parties to it they must themselves decide in the last resort such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to required their interposition ant to fancy way of saying that states should be able to interpret whether the federal constitution is being violated in the federal government is breaking its bonds with the states and states can then resist now you can see how this exact logic was then used by the south with regard to slavery the south madethe argument a dread shot that the constitution did not mandate the end of slavery or give the federal government the power to abolish slavery or to curb slavery and that therefore they have the right to resist that now abroad lion made the argument that that was a wild misinterpretation of the constitution and the declaration of independence that was basically the argument at again t this argument has early shades in this terrifight callous his vice president under andorra under a and jacks at the time gems of actually resigning the vice presidency in order to become a senator meanwhile him's malison by this point had actually reverse his position he said that to establish a positive and permanent rule giving such a power such a minority over such a majority would overturn the first principle of free government and i practice necessarily overturn the governmentitself you can see mansions were arguing against himself there at the earlier malison is saying well if the states cannot nullify federal law what stops the federal government from overrunning its boundaries and later malison is saying yes but if a state cannulify federal law what is the purpose the federal government is sir drew jacks at this point as the present and he is a southerner he took the same position as malison which shocked everybody because he was of the south people thought he was going to take the callous position and an event honoring his own birthday jacks raised to toast to our federal union sand quote it must be preserved this can of shocking to everybody of the time and than i remember of eighteen thirty two he made his position even clearer with a very famous peace of writing called the nullification proclamation when he said quote i consider then the power to a no a law of the united states as sure by one state incompatible wat the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution on authorized by it spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded destructive of the great object for which it was form disunion by armed force is treason again now it is worth while to pass here and and take stock for second because the is a contrast between what jacks is saying about the enforcement of law here first of the boarder jacks was saying that because he was president he had to enforce with the legislature said which means the state had to listen to him he was not argument that he could ignore federal law at the expense of the states that if a federal law was passed and the and the white house just decided to ignore that federal law a the states of then have to listen to it in any case things starts to really heat up in eighteen thirty three the governor of south caroling actually began organizing armed resisters and then congress pass somethingcalled the fore still which allowed the feds to send armed troops to en force tariff collections chectually ended up with an on almost preeceml war sift warms in the end what ended up happenings that the feds in t state both backdoor an agreement was reach which eddied of being a compromise tariff basically the states used their power to leverage federal change those of the two examples what happens when states in the feds sort faced off one is the feast overrun the states ad the other is they come to some sort of agreement in this particular case it is topi hos refusing to enforce the law he is refusing two enforce the law it is that simple this is a political crisis created by ten not billion crisis it should not be a constitutional crisis in force the law in force the law protect america citizens these laws are all ready on the books the sort of stuff has can become more and more common more more inevitable when the white house refuses to protect its own citizens

is amazing to me that yobidon thinks the trump it weak o he can just continue to run on all of these bad policies all the and he is banking on the economy somehow recovering enough for people not to feel terrible about it and there's an economic report that came out in the last couple of hours suggesting that wages are now outpacing in flavin win would be very good thing for the united states but it does not mean that the inflation has been baked into the cake over the last several years has not had a massif impact on your price is tat the grocery source for wagesare only now starting to out pass inflation he still lost money over the course of last several years under hoiden but he is hoping the economy's on recover to a certain extent he is also hoping that all of his foreign policy snaffles our going somehow iron themselves out which is not going to happen plus hoiden happens to again be not particularly with it he is a very weak candidate a join yesterday was endorsed by the you a double which of course is not a great show because the greatest scam in america life is the combined power of the a double you and hoiden union power and the democrats are the single most corrupt scheme in america politic they've been for a long time is particularly true of public sector unions you ad able you of course not public sector unions private sector union but they have help bankrupt america car company's multiple times at this point of course there indorsing jobidon whose basically suggested that the labor fury of value ought to be mandated by law here is at the head of the a in horsing i join yesterday i would put it this this simple the majority of our members voter for present bite and do you think the endorsement is it is a big reason furthest without the endorsement i mi they have more of them gone to trunk get about the demographicsancsuch i do not think me i think an to even going forward when you look at both candidates a it is very clear whit is one supports working class people on which one does not a an bi one want two see sentences join that on the america worker and all turn blamethe america worker i how exactly has jobidon help the america worker a hoiden has made everything more expensive for the america worker an again there is this sort of a tempt to to suggest that unions are the reason for america prosperity is completely a historical the economicdated to back that up are extremely candy in any case the u a doubt you indorse bind bind is basically figuring if i get the base on board i can be as bad as ism wont to be as a president me he he is he is still campaigning on by comic yesterday who is out the campaign he said he is fundamentally changing the economy of this country yow we noticed it is not grate fundamentally c economy country an everybody's get word ago lament yes everybody's getting a little worried about it because it turns out that the greatness of america is that america is the world's first commercial republic and a that's why we kick ass an literally vividly foreign country and you realized an america is the country of business for a recent america is awesome our free market economy is the envy of the world and should be is the driver of virtually all global growth i gasman amazing place you fundamentally changing it is not a good thing i will say jobidon did make a rather large bubo the other day he he he thought was saying something i think jokingly and he actually ens up undercutting many of the arguments he himself is made he says that donate trumps the threats o democracy because he is denying elections and then he went to virgin and suggested that terry mac cliff was the real governor of virgin which is weird since literally no one believes the terramicall if did not lose to glen young kin o virgin no goner germs go the real governor termicallif he is not he is not the real governor he lost elections animalism it is fine if your a democrat an jobidon again he also has troubles with his base is maybe one of the reasons he radical on i migration he is trying to buy back the fact that members of his far left base really kina cons yesterday join was speaking in he was protested about comose look rest don jo none again he is done jump knowing how h says that we rock ere lot as i o a o li i takes e partner in the news jabbering about abortion but you near the protestors there then the bet administration cannot dose disassociated self from these wild left win protestors here is john hurry the actual presidential spokes person because green john pars off letter job a saying that every one has feelings which is in exciting piece of news rote fen no i remained since very early going in this comic we have been urging ares really carports to be careful precise we have talked about this going casualties and how we do not want to see any more we have urge them to take e different actions and they have responded to that advisee and council he understands that there are strong feelings here on all sides a as you would expect he when o the strong feelings e again habit this have a dump your wild left wingers and campaign toward the middle but yobidin again refuses to do that which is one of the reasons why he has a problem on his hands now he thinks that problem is solvable by dona trump that don trump is dona trump then dona trample lose the election he is not ban gun win we election any more he is been button from losing the election when he is really banking on is don trumping extremely polarizing particular with women in independent voters and there is some evidence for this new samphire rather nickel half per form decently rydamin these performed strong against an incumbent president which is effectively how re publicans our treating dona trumpet she performed strong with independent democrats when you look at the new hamster primary results is we observed yesterday those those primary results are largely the effect of independence and democrats swiveling heavy for nickel hale and showing up and re publicans voting heavily for dona trump and half that gap emerges in the general lection it is a real problem for donate trumpet he us to win in dependence and he needs to win democrats he does need to do that in order to defeat jobidon and in order for that to happen donate trump needs to just point at job bison that is all he hates to do he an bidder plan a game of hold my beer it really is a main oh dona trump has to do is goings to tea he is drama he is a bad president that is at and meanwhile jo bi naturally is a bad president and ye saying do stuff and doing de stuff but meanwhile all jobidon thinks he has to do is point at donate trump and go whoso that is what this election is probably going to be and then the question is which which landed is more likely to avoid jumping on the rake for biding what that means is get out their less look a little bit less nice look alible bit let us crazy stop being quite sabbatical moderate if your in to run for this election psycho successfully and if you are donate trump what that means is stop acting crazy stop acting to relic give you back crazy you are going to alienate all these people with your personality whore attracted by our policies gain in order for donate from twin the election she only mes to u point at jobidon but he he has to stop acting crazy i understand their lot republicans who when donate trump acts really aggressive and a little but crazy because they think of ki will that hes just go hog wild on his opponent in the democratic on the democratize the idle in the election cycle or gan go hog wild on on the enemies in order for that to work ye have to win nor if that is work ye have to win eh again he will go hogtied on jobidon the problem is that if he appears to be unstable in the process that is not going to help him and i got to say the why that he's attacking nickel haleyright now is not smart it is just not donate trump this primary's over of get statistically speaking the primary's done donate trump is the nomen he wont i he wont no hampshir going away he is on a win south caroling going away this primary is over what should he do wit nickel hale he should icnornicke hale he shows starve focussing in on jobidon because everybody knows what this general election is and instead he is a doing the worst of donate trump he is attacking nickel hale not really even based on policy but just because she has the temerity to stay in the race now listen do i think that it is a waste of time and money for her to stay in the race kind of i'mein she has the right to do it everybody is t right to staying the race as long as they want by on could t stayed in but they coo to stayed in nice could state that is fine trumps the hominy he butt this this sort of wild at tack on hale as though this is something productive and useful is bazar to my hes daman attacking her on policy because again realistically speaking en here is the have a dirty little secret free folks here is the dirty little secret donate trump on policy an kalian policy are supersimilar i know everybody's i o no but she is a need conman he and he is a he is an anti war it she was his in ambassador he was hawkish on foreign policy when hews the president of the united states from you oh my model she is she is soft on demo crafts when it comes to domestic put dona trump is softer than she is when it comes to abortion and spending a on policy there is a solid case we made the donate trump is to her left now that does not mean that in terms of affect and in terms of militance the donate trump is to lefty's not read's much more militant in his affect but again dona trump is not making policy attacks on nickel hale he is basically making cannibal lector let me rip off her face attacks on nickel hale and the problem with that is not bat nickel hale the problem that i if you wish to win independent voters and suburban moms it you do not want a look a person who randomly rips people's faces off at the super market that is not really the look thatyou are going for again donate trump need to go run toabidns basement campaign from twenty twenty until he president again gave the reason i bring this up is because the last fortnight hours have ben all media coverage of dona drums treatment of nice half this exactly wide in fact there they're members of jobidon's campaign who have said this is the guy we want run against not trump generally the guy who appeared at the press conference after after defeating nickel hale in the new samphire primaries just to take a couple of examples after the nu samphire primary donate trump stands up and behind him is him scout timscott has endorsed him now the reason'tim's got indorsed him is because dona trumps can be the hominy and timscott is thinking okay maybe it'll be ape or maybe's get a cabinet per or whatever man a lot of people of indorsed donate trumpet this point and you are you haven't endorsed him you hie you on indorsed people generally speaking he is going to be the nominal what is donate trump do he immediately not only a tack nickel hale he just takes he takes him scout's face and just mashes it into pe but there is a pie on the table he takes him timscottin goes was and just smacks his face directly into the pie cause he cannot resist the thing donate trump when it comes to his opponents is jiffy he is king offer from game of thrones he always has been if you bend the knee to trump ye you might have locate you have other choice but he will chop off your head ready he will reduce you to chis christy going go christy got go get on the pay chis gat an the nay bi that is who you be cut and that is why these sorts of they are not good for trump for get about what i think of them on a moral level and by thewy i do not think it is great to humiliate people politically for no reason especially when the have indorsed you i jobs do not think i do not understand the morality of the politics of it but on a political level is this the limit lye just take yourself out yourself for a second lis not iunderstandal o my audience loves trumpet will voter om ism an vote for trump against forbid right i are with you also if you take i just analyzed analyzed the state of america politics right now you are suburban mom living in michigan in a swing state and you have hoiden is very bat a policy and but you do not polo policy all that closely because let us be real at you are busy n have out a time when you mostly see is an old man tottering around and walking to walls the shangillis room but and then you see donate trump and dona trump is on your teethe just ripping people's faces off and you are oka if have a trace between senile and while may be all choose you again that is not the twist you should make because the case that have made for trump is that basically politics is a coffee filter an be grounds that that the stuff what whatever see you have the the coffee filter right at the coffee in there and then got the liquid they men a pour in the case that have made is that the liquid that you are pouring in with jobidon is not only a toxic liquid the toxicity of the liquid is small enough to escape the filter the will comes out from the bottom the filter it is a bunch of actual toxic sludge man's really bad and dangerous the case that i made for dona trump is that dona trump at he he is got the liquid is basically not even a a a pure mix the liquid that he's pouring into the coffee machine is basically water and rock and the rocks are bad and you not want them in your coffee good news they areas getting filtered out by the checks and balances o america government and by the other people in his administration which is why the stuff action comes out the other and of the coffee filter is decent coffee despite the rocks all hate but if you are a person who just casually watching politics and hit is a little complex then does this help or herd very simple binary does it help or does a hit here is dona trump abjectly humiliating him shot for no reason other than he just enjoys doing it two great senators which is hard i mean to eve think that sheactually appointed you to him and think of it theppointed and your the senator of hi state and she endorsed me you must really hatcher no it is we it is shame that is i s oh i just love you not a is a great lit this a what why what is the purpose of that when it you say ism thankful that timscott for indorsing me even over the person who actually picked him for the senate that is how much he really thinks that it'll be a great president same point without humiliating the person who is now actually e sorry get for your campaign and then he was ripping on nickel whale's dress an all elictwho you trying to win a trying whin election or is a just trolley again i can i can appreciate the humor of it it is troll in it is funny is tight ta help you whin a generallection every question from here to the election should be based on is just this question will this help you or not help you win a general election against jobidon here was attacking make a valley's rest i felt i should do this because i find in life you cannot let people get away with both all o c i what i watch her in the fence e dress the top ugly within fancy come up i said what is he doing we wan then she did the same thing last wig but he is much more angry about it than i was is o get up there you let him know really ink seriously o say i gortacking clothing now sure avid axe rod again who wants the democrats to in he is om e yacht this is not a great exhibition and ta again he he loves this iminsilac avid awol rods everything he wants democrats o people to run against this that is joins entire bat he is entirebet is not even the trumps of fastest an he knows the that that that dog is not n a hunt superwell but the trumps a wild man thing basically you have to i the more people have to overlook in order to vote for trump the hiders can be firm to win winning elections about two things making it hard devote for opponent ma can easy devote for you an as have said for literally a debate now about ton trump down trump makes it very hard to vote for his opponent bet he is created attacking his parents and he also makes it hard vote for him because the barrier to entry is saying this kind of stuff here is avid axe rod going after him an i dare not too that they did that is they go on out there an act a jack akin and and go after i kalian really personal sexist ways and humiliate him ska that was his that was the improvisational trump the child for s campagnteem is they can do all the blocking and tackling well and they are but they cannot control him that was a really horrible exhibition last big and it only probably made daily more determine to try and say whether she does i think is an open question but he did not help himself in that project gay axe rod is not wrong o say he is not wrong when he says that trump is baselyming an harder for people devote for him hurt in the middle remember not everyone is you if you listen to a political show understand you listen to a show this one that is a news politics show understand the you represent in the united states two to three present the population i got if ye listen to a daily political show in any way she perform the number of america who engage with politics daily in a granyellor way he is really low most people have not even engaged with this race yet most people are on to engage with this race in the last month of the election on and theyregoig to take a weight is a gestalt of a candidate there you take away who what i kind to think what bi kin n there'walk into analog place and then you was ball it an there rote counts just as much as yours ow trump need make it easier to vote for him it's all saying here that be the smart way to pursue this campaign ardyguis the rest the shows continuing right now you not wan a is it will be drown by be someday candidate for prison is eight

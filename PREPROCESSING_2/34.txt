donate trump is the presumptive republican nominate i know it is early i know it is the day after the iota carcass but let us face facts here folks donate trump is far out ahead of the rest of the field that no one else has a plausible shot at the nomination that was confirmed last night in the i carcass when donate trumpet broke fifty per cent and none of the other candidates was able to break twenty two per cent that is an insurmountable lead for zonal trump in these primaries last night the i catches open at seven p m local time and by seven thirty every major outlet was calling the i cases for dona trump now by controversial this controversial because the still people who not only had voted they hadingben started the speech making process the way the cop's work on the republican side as the people show up in these local locations and all various candidates have their surface to come and make speeches and then everybody votes the reason that all of these outlets were able to make this call early is because of course the polling data in from o entrance pulling showed trump far out ahead that there was no plausible challenger not a lot of questions as to whether these outlets should have done that because after all literally zero votes had been counted had the one at which all of these projections were made and there is lot of question from the distances camp from the hailed camp about whether that affected what was going on inside the actual caucus calls that there are people where checking their phoneying the fox news for example had called the race and simply side seawall ism here anyway a mazes vote for the guy who an maxwell vote for trump here is what it sounded when all of these versus outlets called the race extremely early seen it projects the dona trump willing the iota carcass san in can make this projection base dunk is overwhelming head in our entrance poll of ewer canvas goers and some initial votes the a coming in the former present pulling off a huge early victory in is good to return through the white you try i to e e any any think ne nail pe ta a this hour at eight thirty three t the the three ta to t the they toe the the the i that con o then donna t to well city the the wen the i cake ti n ten t o pee the talk clachan thobasto in the first first an our foxes voter and axis the toxins decision death can out project that former president donate to tell wan the iota canvas that you the of i o the six forty elegant this result really solidivixe his place has the to cry roger throw the nomination now age many of the other candidates were crying foul at this point not because trump was not going to win he was but because they said that the may of shifted the margin o victory the associated press for example has a policy hat they will not call the winter of race before all the poles and jurisdiction are schedule to close petty much all of them called not only before the poles were sexual to close but before some of the polished had even open now was that going to change the trajectory or the shape of this race i have very serious doubts that that is the case the final results in iota again donate trump fifty one per cent followed by governor r n to cantus of florid the got i would ha voted for in the primaries at twenty one per cent followed by former south caroling governor and you an ambassador n like hailed at nineteen per cent maybe t would shifted things at the margins o couple of percentage points either way it was not going to detract from dona trumps massive blow out victory the reason for donate trumps massive blow out victory is pretty simple republican voter see dona trump is the incumbent it is that simple he is being treated as the incumbent and he performed liken incumbent would in and wall canvas if jobidon were actually running in and wall canvas this year if there were some sort of caucus process in i with this year you would expect that jobidon would receive somewhere between sixty and seventy per cent of the vote and that a couple challengers might peel off ten per cent here and there that is essentially how the poles have been playing for donate trump in iota basically since jury of this year the truth is that whatever vulnerability donate trump had as a candidate it began in canary of twenty twenty three and it ended by basically march of twenty twenty they in canary twenty twenty three donate trump was widely perceived by the republican was as a person who caused republicans to lose because the twenty twenty to elections but really poorly and what you saw is the if you go all the way back to the beginning of the year what you see is that donate trump had nan advantage over on to mantis but not much of one nationally speaking decants was perceived as a winner because yet a blow out victory here in flora and dona trump was perceived as a person who caused other candidates to lose because he had had a bunch of senate candidates who lost going all the way back to twenty twenty when he promoted the loss of two separate republican senators in georgia but the sanction trumping fast enough no one redo find trump as the loser and what trump did smart politics he kept clamming that he was the actual winner of the twenty twenty election by expelling in republicans believe him the people who voted the wall canvas is seventy per cent belief that he actually one the twenty twenty election whether or not that is true they believe that and if you're that voter and you think he won twice why would you not vote for him the chief argument against donate trump all along was electability who is never character because character at mattered than out a mattered a lot earlier and it was in per romance because most republicans by enlarge were fairly happy with donate trumps policy performance as president of the united states despite the fact that the twenty twenty year was really bad for dona trump the real rut not on trump was that he was not electable which means that there were two assets that dona trump had one was that people in therepublican party still realize love dona trump there's at that is just the simple fact to the matter is an enormous mount of loyalty among republican voters people personally him in what the exit and entrance pulse so is that people who believe that the candidate carrying bout people them matters they voted overwhelmingly for dona trump that is number one number two donate trump is extremely lucky in his opponents jobidon is a dead man i mean do not mean that he is physically dead although he kindidaes i mean that jobidon is i terrible president who happens to be running at thirty three per cent in the approval ratings and that means that any one including sliced bread look s electable against mobile the entire argument as being made by donate trumps opponents that he was unelectable which was probably true in canary of twenty twenty three is no longer true in canary of twenty twenty four when dona trump in nearly every pole is leading jobidon the electability argument completely disappeared and with that argument when most of the opposition to dona trump in the re publican party donate trump was basically in control the swell cases by the puling data by essentially tune if you look clothe way back at the beginnings of pulling in the swell comas will get may of twenty twenty three that is about when to tanto centered the race and that was to mantis high watermark and i hews a twenty eight per cent and trumps at forty per cent and de mantis then proceeded to drop about ten per cent from about thirty per cent all the way down to about twenty per cent in the final tally here trump for his part rose from about forty per cent to about fifty per cent and the was baked into the cake as early as u as jury as mid jury dona trumps already up thirty points on the field and that is where he ended up in this race nickel valley picked up some of the support that early on might have been going to seem of the other candidates the chis christie of the world fort example and she consolidate enough support to finish a close third to on to mantis in i but again they are far behind that none of that really matters fillet to more on this in just one moment first if there is one thing that matters most to me in life it is those i love well thanks my friends a restock they are beating to days in platoon then making it easier to connect with those i portent people in your life if you are ma here is not a day that goes by i do not call or take

wireless it the company you can be proud of and to now the question becomes what comes next what happens next in the primaries whellifyou look at the new samphire republican primary which is the next one up to cantus has effectively no support in new samphire is not his state it is a very moderate state tends to be can admit romnesk kind of state with a libertarian ben which i on pal tended ta per form over in new samphire historically speaking right now the real politics pulling average doll trump has forty three point five per cent nickel halers at twenty nine point three per cent chis christy whole only recently dropped out o the race was pulling eleven twelve per cent to cantus as down at seven and romasuamy was down at five as will discuss in a second romaswammy is now out officially n he was effectively out a few weeks togo because again his pulling dato we are not sufficient to keep him going in the race the romasuammy officially dropped out last night his five per cent will go to trump you would imagine which brings trump up to forty eight point five per cent the santusis per centare is probalycgan remains stable maybe at drops a little bit maybe that boost trump above fifty per cent and then charity's per centare points are going to go to hale you would imagine the hale is going o be about forty per cent and true s going to be up around fifty per cent thou be my predicted final result in new hamper specially given the blow out victor for donate trump herald if trump winds inane who wins new samphire he is not losing a primary the rest of the season and we are now done and everybody can kind of feel it an nickel hailed if she would really wanted to have a serious challenger needed to come in seconds here by coming in third two to mantis hrumamentum was somewhat blunted the mantis for his part is not formally dropping out at this point the cantus is not groping out because presumably he is thinking that maybe something wild happens in new samphire perhaps something strange happens in south caroling perhaps there is a health problem with donate trumpet something and he is still sort of the nearest come editor in turns of people here stop in the rays who mere donate trumps policy preferences then mayor may not be true hotline here's again i do not see the math there is no math for anyone else to win this nomination except for donate trump not worth exploring here what exactly happened in iota and the break down of the nenagraphics in iota number one no one voted again this was basically treated an incumbent election in two thousand in sixteen thereabout a hundred eighty thousand people who voted the i caucuses last night a hundred and ten thousand people participated that is really really low ut a very low number why because everybody basically assume the dona trump was going to win and that is they were right obviously as the pastry journal says in the end there is only one lane to victory and i and dona trump had it all to himself the candidate's challenging the former president had hoped to find enough to satisfaction with him to buildtheron voter coalition nickel hale the former south caroling governor ha iron signs in polling of consolidating college educated republicans such as those in the suburbs or college towns viola as well as voters less committed to conservative causes rondo cantus the flora governor had moved aggressively to whin voters who fear a liberal take over of schools business as in academia but trump carried those groups winning sum handily he won thirty two per cents of college graduates to nickel whale's thirty per cent he dominated among those without a four year college degree loge the pastry journal exit polling what you find is among those with a college degree donate trump one thirty five per cent nice we daily one thirty one per cent in the ronosantus one twenty to per cent among those with no college degree donate trump one sixty three per cent of the not compared to thirteen per cent for both hale and to cantus this of course has been trumps pitch since twenty sixteen is the sort of idea of a broad working class coalition the was going to vote re publican and lot of people have tried to creed and economic philosophy about we that is i think tat as much less to do with economics and much more to do with the fact that donate trump of all the candidates in america history really does not look down on blue collar working people the democratic party does this is why they've embraced the interjectional ideology and dona true projects that foresail and he tends to colic a blue collar working got even though he clearly is no to and that translate among urban voters donate trump one fifty four per cent suburban voters which be were nickel hale would the best you long thirtyrseven per cent compare with nickel halers twenty seven per cent and in small towns rural areas he dominated again fifty nine per cent fifty nine per cent of people by the way who said that trumps role in jaguar six the zealegal voted for nick hale but that is not a lot of people very few people in the republican coalition actually believe that wen gat these are mirrored those results from walztergunall are mirrored in the washington post entrance poles dona trump dominated pretty much every group there's only one group the donate trump did not actually win and the was voters seventeen through twenty nine as but nine per cent voters in i among that group rondo santissetu one that group thirty per cent again mirroring what happened in twenty sixteen and twenty sixteen pal re call the ted crews actually out performed among young republicans it was older boomer republicans who tended vote very heavily for donate trump tat was mirrored last night in the results all though donate trump did sweep every age group outside of the seventeen to twenty nines seventeen i twenty nine dona trump actually finish third wen to mantis thirty hale twenty five trump twenty two coma summit twenty one whet among every other age group he dominated particularly those who are above the we of sixty five fifty eight per cent of people above the age of fifty five supported donate trump not above there sixty five support dona trump only sixteen per cent supported nickel rondo mantis twenty one per cent supported nickel hale and again when comes to the educational breakdown sixty seven per cent of people who had some college or less voted four donate trump among college graduates though he also one thirty seven two twenty eight over nickel hale twenty six per cent four run do mantis and we sweeping victory four donate trump and as you move four or tone samphire it is hard to see exactly how anyone else has a serious shot at the republican nomination he get tumor on this in just one second first it is twenty twenty four a lot of us are trying to get our financial house in order well there is some great news for home one's intristrates

is ovary much more relaxed ho wanted for p ask fifty percent he was a very clear priority for him because that was concerning dominant victory that couple of last percentage points make a bit of a exceptionable deference now realistically speaking if ye want forty eight o twenty twenty one or something and a dominant victory fifty one books more dominant cause e means the got n assure majority of the votes in i want be no one could have taken him here is dona true ism i ironically congratulating some of his opponents by i being passimogressive i want to thank you very much i want to congratulate rononiky for having a o good a good time to get the were all have it a good time together ai think they both actually did very well i soul do think they boat then very well we do not even know what the outcome of second places and a i see carry congratulations a filet e after an a teisistoa fovea senior great senator i petit rat can be a great center and i also one of congratulate the vet because redid a hell of a job who came from zero and he a at a be per cent probably i percent almost a percent an that is a an amazing ja they all did there are very star very start people very capable people now this the speech of a man who knows hes one the nomination and down from actually thought that another other candidates were i the rat to him s you think you be speaking about them in that way the vague dropped out of the campaign now fatally speaking as i say he should has dropped down of campaign earlierand that is passably what from said to him i here is o take last night dropping out of the campaign and i indorsing dona trump and i wanted to make a couple of announcements to night to get the business out of the way and then i want to tell you where we are going as of this moment we are going to stupendous presidential campaign and this is going to have to be there is no path for me to be the next president absent things that we do not want to see happen in this country and i think that i am very worried for our country i think we are skating on the nice as a nation we have done everything in our part to make and done every one of us in this room has done our part to save this country and i am proud of every one of you who have lifted us up but we are campaign founded on the truth and that is why we have made that decision to day and ism also making the decision that this has to be and america first candidate in that white house as i said is the beginning there are two america first candidates in this race and earlier to night i called dona trump to tell him that i congratulate on is victory and now going forward he will have my full endorsement for the presidents and i think ere gong to do the right thing for this country again unsurprising news and evade doing the right thing obviously he has no chance in the race there is no reason for him to stay in good on fake for not sticking around just for kind of the attention seeking of it meanwhile the others to candidates ronosantus ink and nickel hale are technically still in the race to mantis it's trying take solace in the fact that he beat out nickel hale in iota now just to be completely far again rondasantis phenomenal governor of florid a person i would have voted forward i voter in the iwokoxis but when your expectations art i i just be nickel hailed that that is a very lowered expectation from where rondosans his expectations for when he entered the race and went to i and visited all ninety nine counties ronasans again does not have a shot in new samphire his nannington and try in new hampshir presumably he can move his campaign to south caroling but i do not seep ha forward for rondosantis that is a very serious forges electorally speaking and again his from somebody whose big supporter of rondosansideologically here is at rondosantis saying that hes still in although realistically speaking again dona's fronts blue away the field an ion we love you to they to a pe thin ut the ki i ti at us they tot us fifty million dollars ut tacking us no one was that much all wat just through iota they the beauty was against us they were writing our o bit to er e man to they've been a t la to beoplor pile e g tint o but they were just o u sided about the fact that there predicting ah that we would not be able i to get our ticket punch tour out o i but i can tell you because of yours o word in spite of all of that that they throw out us every one against us we have got our ticket punch tot o i gat now again to get punched out of soup that is a fairly low bar for presidential candidate and in an again it just shows you exactly how much we lead trump has if you say a candidate has his ticket punch out of iota a i would i would expect that your campaign if it is a durable campaign would have its take punched out of was o the standards are been completely lowered same thing with regarded nickel hale wat to more on this in just one second first twenty twenty

ronissans by couple thousand votes for third place she is trying to claim that she has nickel mentor going forward in to new samphire again very hard to see her winning a victory in new samphire even with all of the anti true support consolidating trump has the numbers in new samphire o whin a shire majority in new samphire again mean assume that the take support is going to go directly to trump assume that is some of to stamps support is going a fleet over to trump and he is above fifty per cent pretty easily again nickel hale is claiming that this is now a two person race let us be frank about this this now a one person race again people i on to say that ism early on this but ism sorry this what the number say is what the numbers are abut here is nickel hale i in ta a they i i ma this republican primary i to person r i mean again let us be red about this this is not a two person races dona trump is a the hell ahead of everybody i was going to hold my judgement on that until we saw some actual results from some actual causes but even if nickel hale were to pull a close second in new samphire hell even nick halewere to win new samphire it is hard to see her going down south to south caroling and then somehow pulling a miracle out and beating trump that is really the only pat the nickel hale has ford just giving you the pure honest analysis here dona trump is the republican nominate in twenty twenty four and maybe this is always house can t be again if republican saw him as an incumbent present which mayor publican see him as that mend who is on win not just that ye there is a a principal in drama and fiction writing called checkoff's gun named after the writer antoncheckoff chef famously suggested that you put a gun over the mantel in the first act of a play by the end of act to that gun has to be fired you soft put the mantel over the go over you do not put the gun over the mantel unless the gun is going to be fired an have said this to my busing partner chair me boring many many times checkoff's guns principal is not actually a an imperative it is descriptive meaning that is how the human brain works that is how people act they act as though if the thing is there it is going to be used the idea that there was going to be a twenty twenty four election absentonal trump the dona trump is not going tore a part of this story in what is now season nine of trump i mean his names the show rammed we are all living in the trumpshow since twenty fifteen is down twenty twenty four season in an rump got greenlet and got greenlet during season six the fact that dona trump is stuck around this lunk it is not amazing durable story me its it it is the most amazing political comeback story innocence since richer ninon write richer ninon ran as vice president with white eyes an hour and then i nineteen sixty ran for pressing he lost very narrowly eff say and the he went out into the wilderness and the he came back in nineteen sixty eight in on a sweeping victory against hurt humphed that looked lot closer than it actually was in the end this is that and mean this is what that looks the fact that donate trump one and twenty sixteen wast fairly narrowly in the electron college in it twenty twenty and now has come back and it stuck around you really never went away in twenty twenty four is just on any level in amazing story and the america people do love amazing story and the kind of wont o see the end of this moving thy onto we the end of what is the end of the true of how to season nine of trump end i that that is i think what is in a lot of american's mind wright left in center and the story is a topless interesting when trump isn't a part of it e en starts see the consolidation of the of the republican field all ready a nickel valley who is the person who would have the clearest all curative path if there were such a path that i do not think actually exes even even she was choose asked about which you support dona trump over joining slick of course mean i yes the coming home affect inside the republican party is on everybody is on a flow behind trump end that that is that is the lathis ginning up the it's yo support that you if it is not you it does not work out and it is dona true that they are going to go elsewhere i me look i i would take donate trump over jo biding any day in a week but ism going measure we do not have that option everything were done to get to this one i mean keeping my people than sang things for mut back when we were there were fourteen in the race and we were the for set now we are solid second and i was second new hamper second an out colony we got one mar fellow to catch out you were going to get ta time and meanwhile him refolds who in dosed donas anis choose asked about trump its the nomen and she said yet despite the fact the trumps as mean things about me mean jobidons on whether side of corse it'll supported if if it comes down to to dona trump is the many of support of out supporterever or hominy is do you sure that you does the diviner opener to sandishere that o why do not we to a tax ta a ai a i we e re public a know all to a i a a an be at e an i we a

verse is bison trump in the betting averages is way ahead of jobidon at this point when a comes to general election matchup right now trump has about one point one per centare point let against jobidon with regard to the the with read e the real chaotic poll average we is ahead according toraskuson reports by eight he is ad a coring sees news by two and these are all in the the sees news pole is within the martian of error you raskuson is way outside the martian of error economist you got has them tied of forty three writers dipsos has them tide at forty eight morning consult has bison at forty three and trump at forty two at the very least this a dead heat or trump is ahead that is where thing standing when you look at the state by state when you loo at the state by state polling data what you see is that donate trump is incredibly competitive in all of the state the latest pulling out of michigan has donate trump up in the real politics polling average five point three per cent including a pole from that is right news with trump up eight if drumlin's michigan he is going town the election in pennsylvania it is basically dead even and by the way one of the reasons is dead even is because josh per the democratic governor is posing his moderate something with john feddermin the senator but if the mood of the country is pro trump he is on whin pennsylvania if you take a look that wistconson the poles there are tied but the latest one from bloomburg morning consult has trump up for in wistconsin and to take a look at some of the other battle ground states the trump lost last time he is way ahead if you look at aerizona he has had very solidly if you'll a georgia he is ahead very solidly the pulling factor trump is ahead when you look at the actual factors in the campaign trump is also ahead why jobidon cannot talk the fact that jobidon cannot talk the fact that jobidon is ten run a basement campaign wall he is president is a serious problem for him running the basement campaign when the other guy is president is actually the right strategy because you want the focus on the other guy ironically dona trump is likely to run what will amount to basement campaign because there will be no lobate building is nothing to bate trump it is not in a happen for everybody who is hot and bothered about that it an't can a happen bid is not getting on state with dona trump beyond that donate trump did something ironically is thing about this yesterday i visited the white house in canary t of twenty tin and is talking with a very very high ranking member of the white house staff of trumpstaff and they said what should we do and i said he should build a fake twitter a adieu should put it on trump's phone and it should at trump treat into the a and he would get back a munch of warm messages and he would be superhappy on the inside and no one else would ever see what exactly he was treating and then ironically this actually happened he got band from twitter and he created truth social and he is still on truth social and his exposure on truth social is one one thousand of what it would be if you are on next right now i ironically he actually is doing the thing that is likely to make him successful by accident donate trumps can go out there is gin to do rallies he will do occasional interviews and meanwhile the center of focus right now will be on the president of the united states is very difficult to avoid being the entry focus and all the indictment talk i know the is a lot of talk about the indictments coming t this year but many of the factors of already shifted in those indictments for example in the fanny wills redo case in georgia the story there is shifting because a legally fanny wills was basically using that case to pay her boy friends that could take cruises around the world together she man up in jail allegedly over what she was doing in that case the plan brag case in manhattan thatloks that is going nowhere fast even if trump were to be convict in that case no one is going to think hat that is begin mate case the jack smith case in washington d c is that even to come to trial before the election or the flooring class documents case is packing to come to trial democrats people who are using legal maneuvering against trump to get him off the ballet i am not sure that that actually is hurting trump because they went over sol if it were one truck let us hey were only the jack smith washington d c charges all focus would be on that trial the problems when use a shock illegal approach with trump it looks an overwhelming to nosy legal assault on trump which it is is any of that can a her dona trumpets at all baked in to the cake of this point meanwhile he got a president who literally cannot talk here was join yesterday he is holding up a bag of apples and smiling wearily man o the feel bad for the guy he is issue now with it he is asking some may hold are you cs elevens is a we'll ran a the grocery in o pagans i make he can barely move ism an it just it is he this is what it is o cate jordan is not when you talk about him as a candidate i mean that should not have a licence to drive that is that that is where we are in this rase right now and meanwhile his back l p come garrison somehow even worse of this here is comely arris yesterday trying to genus enthusiasm i mean i swear to god she may be a in actual she may be the first a i human she she is absolutely an inhabitant of the uncanny valley she is set up housing in the uncanny valley with electricity and plumbing because she she is if she were to ever become presidents of the united states they would not need to build an animatronic of her at wall dinner's hell presidents they would just import her here here she is yester a danced shes it she is she is unwatchable she is unwatchable i the a c an lame to say loving the day tho a for the elder a a i go a humbling the about the here with you if som one of eighties o the day they were going in two thousand five o wo wow tether that this is this is your vice presidential candidate who will be president by the way because your bite an nocking a last another four years in this office ell all this is leaving people who oppose trump with very few options and that is why things are likely to get very scary and spicy this year ism pretty much every front it folks this year is going to be one for the history books no one can actually predicts what is going to happen mean there will be an election this year somebody is going to win but could be actual warfobon war in chain the middle east do not is out on a minute of the covers from the voices you contrast download the free daily wire plus a right now keep up with all the latest to get all the shows up to then it news coverage and a wholehost of entertainment when you need little break do not wait down dailywire plus right now of cam meanwhile with dona trump as the presume of twenty twenty four nominee and trobidin ailing and command arris being the back up woo was that a stalker of a decision by job the panic has set in on the democratic side of the alley full scale panic and this by the ways also an ally of trump because the more you keep telling us that trump is muslin that he is hitter that the world's can end if you elected president the more everybody looks at you your crazy because ye are here is the thing no matter what you thing i deal trump the notion that dona trump is in the same league as stalling hitter muslin is an absurdity hos already president once and what happened some tax cuts some supreme quart appointments pretty god for policy a good economy some bad governments during bovid and then he set a bunch of due stuff between nonmember fourth and canary sixth and a few hundred people walked in to the capital building some of whom are riding om who just walked in ad that within three hours they were cleared another he was not president any more that is the story is that soundbite muslin or hitter to you with it the march unrobe was that hitter's ragtag fire what what it what is that where is the come i need the come in order to really understand the claim that you are making by the way appoint that have ben making recently to some of my democratic friends who her saying the well if dona trample to win it would end democracy there be no more elections quick point for you when o order dona trump will have served two terms that point who no longer be eligible for president he will not be allowed to be in ballads across the united states actually if you want dona trump not to screw the elections any more nothing he is really on a scrod the elections you ought oboe for donaltrump and then he will be in for another term and then e'llbe done and h he will go round talking bout y one threeterms is president all the rest of it in any case tracheal man out was leading off they're turning up to spinal tap eleven guises here is the thing when you keep turning the volume all the way up everyone goes deaf and you spent nine years with the volume at final tab eleven no one has coaly at any more we cannot hear you because you will went nuts too many times too often big picture take away from that and i do not mean to be again too dark as he said on this but it is not if we are worried about the rise of authoritarianism and this country are worried about potential is a rachises in this country who worried about our democracy falling to an authoritarian and potentially factious farm of government the leader who is trying to do that is part of that equation but people wanting that or say tot sneaker part of that attraction and the america elector it is made up of two major parties one of those parties has been flirting with extremism on the ultra right for a very long time they have brought the men in a way but they have not been central to republican electoral politics ever before and i know because have been studying this but once you have rota calling one major parties that those are the preferences of the people who adhere to your party the leaders intake changeable and yes trumpets is sometimes what we call it mama movements probably better way to do it but there is not a fruitarian movement in that republican politics that is not being be booze by true they are pushing protect more and more extreme because the more extreme things he says then what they more they and that is coming from a very large proportion of the america right that others to the republican party notes why this is a republican party problem wore that it is the problem of one man and his ancient byway notice what she is doing here she is not sharing that dona trumps ashes she want your abashes if you voted for dona trump or wood would french trump against jobidon because let us say for example an analogy that have been using recently regarded dona trump the checks and balances of the office prevent him from doing many of the things the maybe even has an inclination to do the checks in the balances and ben working actually less well with jobidon dona trump surrounded himself with professionals those professionals very often told him do not do this thing it is illegal that happened a lot during producing dona trumps administration jobidon does the legal things on the regular and his people are real call do it when you assess the presidential candidate one the things that we all do we all do this is we assume that there is a filter that filter is the filter of governor's reality it is a good coffee filter s he pour the water on the coffee grounds and the filter prevents the actual coffee grounds from getting in your coffee a lot of the stuff that trump says is the coffee grounds and a lot of the worst stuff does not get through the coffee filter with jobidin the grains are too small the yo find they get right through the coffee filter and he get on the other end is act yo worst coffee with jobidon then of would a dona trump that is the case to made but the omicron are already turning it up to it is notches trumpet is everyone if you vote for trump against jobidans because you are of authoritarian fantasy you want the federal government caponized against you now part f the problem here is that the only candidate in this rate who is actively caponize the federal government against it citizens is jobidon it is job who tried to use the occupational safety and health administration she anadministrateof agency to cram down of acting on eighty million people and we here at the daily wire we sued him to stop that from happening it is jobidon who suggested he can unilaterally not in force immigration law change all our emigration laws and let five six seven million people into the country legally that is jobidon who is doing that all of your talk of dona trumping a threats the country we can all see what is happening here we can all see it it is notes rather mat outs of course joy had on that same terrible panel men am s en b c the level of ideological diversity there ranging all the wave from ten shock on the right to rather math and joy read on left is pretty astonishing an i dint hen went i ma tea mi it that the elephant in the room she is fill brown lady that is got to try to win in a party that is time ante immigrant and with extent the notion that i can fay immigrants or pointing the blood of our country she's getting in o birthmark by donate true oh an i do not ear how much the dot a radar lie tender to grab up a lot the better sin does then u after it fill a taken i do not see how she becomes the hominy of that party with donate trump till around i cannot fissure it happening may be can happen on to mantis is only argument for thing in it if he the i that he cans til make the appeal towing bog and it is just amazing to watch the left talk about how all of the voter for dona trumpet actually just racist against nickel half by the way if nickel halter the hominy they be saying alive him crapabout nick halers this what they do meanwhile avid french again somebody i can side a friend but avid is wildly off the reservation on this particular avid is now calling i know is anta trump is tenants trumpsonce twenty sixteen an than he remain anti trumpet now he rites for the your time's being anti trump you literally put out a piece yesterday as donate trump is emerging victories from the rival carcass called just qualified trump or else the idea here would be the the only way to save america is to literally take donate trump off the ballet in twenty twenty four you want actual armed conflict that is a great way to bring actual armed conflict is to kick donate trump off the ballet entirely according to avid french there is no doubt nothing trump off the ball would ten shock waves through the america body politic but why would any one believe that is inherently lest stabilizing if trump runs we already knowhow he does when he loses for him counting the votes is only the beginning of the battle if he loses he will challenge the results conspire to overturn the election and inside political violins it'll go have a question how literally how hews president last time and he still could not do it where can n the mechanisms for which donate trump is going to be able to do that how is that going to happen outline i want people at some point they say wild things there will be an armed uprising of garlic it's one to now spell it out step by step how do we get from point a to point b or just saying things now he says if he wins youhavenan insurrectionist an command of the most powerful military in the world whose tell bent on seeking vengeance on his political enemies does anything at all sound stabilizing about that again you think the dona trump is going to i understand everybody is very hot an but dona trumps con a proscutat now he is not ism just telling you right now he is not going to of relic if he does let's pop bad be extremely shocked because said the same thing be hellerclin and then he did not you us can to happen if the wins he is tom we superhappy in is can be in the white house all day don were it before tweeting and let is aides make good policy that is what is actually gan o happen but but avid french is now making the case that we need to take trump off the ballet to save the republic you don't get trumpelected there is pretty much no better way to do it than say stuff this i gain the reason the panic is setting in is because robin's policy is coming clear to every one here is the biggest problem by thewy for the world my prediction said yesterday ism a continue saying it if we gets a junegili august and dona trumps up the poles the chances the china blockades si wan are extremely high they go from thirty per cent to day to probably sixty per cent why because they do not want on true to be president when they blockades i wan they figure that jobidon if there is blockade of titan will pressure ti wan to make some sort of deal with china to stop the conflict and give them some sophisticated microchips in order to prevent him from losing the reelect effort see in an election here the innocent president is very susceptible to foreign conflict this is why and twenty twelve you will recall in an act of cologne with the ruffians you remember the baklava actually sat with merry medvidev who is then the president of russia who sort of standing who is cut out for vlanerpoudent and he said tell ladies it'll have more flexibility after the election in other words please do not do anything bad that wouldhurt my reelect topes and then i will help you guise after the election which hey did when russia actually took control of bothseria as well as crime at not the same thing is very much available this year for america enemies this is ta year to go man thesis a year to put pressure on jobidon this is a year where if you can create conflict you believe the jobidon will simply give you a cooky to make you go away that is true for china it is true for a on remember over the weekend the united states as well as some of it is allies launched a series of missile a tacks on the who the in common on i say the who these i means to tempt you buildings that the who the run and own but they givelic a week of warnings to nobody was aftryou there a grand total thing six who these killed in this massively expensive air strike by the america and our allies did that put off to who the of course i didn't cutoff the who the why would it all the who the have to do is survive and poke at the united states to claim victories this is the bazar raft of the middaeleast the united states israel western countries are expected to completely devastate the opposition n completely devastate them and all the badges have to do is popped their head up after the entire city as laid missing ism still alive you did not get ma a sets for the soothes are doing right now according to the guardian the iron backs whole polish group has continued to attack commercial shipping hitting an america own cargoship it the ballistic missile in defines will wave of us and case strikes on common the strike against the martial islands flag tubralter eagle containership representing a widening of the theater of war beyond the reds to the gulf of den the strike hat the cargo hold o the ship while his thoughts o have casino major damagewil adsefeers they up and up and you strikes on who the targe tonyemon have not degraded the these abilities to threaten commercial shipping cater became the latest major user of cargoships to announce it will not send liquid gas through the red sea for the for people future everything can get more expensive and the hope on the part of these toothy groups and the agrarians is that the united states will then presser israel into stopping the destruction of commas in order to reopen the shipping lanes the easily they will concede to the rag tag pirates and jobidon may well do that because t again jobidon is of the weird opinion that in the middle east concessions get you what you want in reality in the midleleast concessions generally get you killed and that is what is likely to happen over their sent come put out a statement on this yesterday they said quote on canary fifteen that approximately four pram sonar time which is common baronial back whole millions fired n antiship ballistic missile from whole controlled t areas of man an struck the gibraltar vagal a martial island flagged us own an operated containership the ship has reported no injuries are significant damage in is continue its jerking earlier in the day at a proximately shupiam s forces detected in antiship ballistic missile fired toward the southern reds commercial shipping lanes the missile failed an flight and impacted on land in common therefore no injuries or damage reported meanwhile the agrarians using their game they a struck in aria near what they claimed was a was pase in rock in gerbil according to a new several explosions are reported near the of consult in airbase rock the ran revolutionary gardcourt directly took responsibility for the attacks they said they were turning the quit headquarter of spies and antimonial terrorist gatherings in parts of the region the cordistan regional security councils had four people werekilled in six injured in the attack again this iron directly taking a hand in a rock not a shock they havebeen active in rock for very long time here commit a somvidio of what that looked theca see the missiles hitting over there iron by the way andthat up attacking civilians as well the baronial ballistic missile strike actually killed a prominent business men in rocky curtistan according to forces the target was not as initially speculated the large us consulate over there or the america truth base in hairball international arbor airport instead the actually decide they arguing to hit a well known local business men killing ham and members of his family they claimed responsibility for theattacked to the aronians directly as well s a simultaneous strike on syria they struck the house for cultish business and man pasha dead zap the owner of the autonomous regions falcon group which is responsible for major projects such as the empire world which is a central business district known for a highrise a apartment buildings basely they are using what is going on the middies as an excuse to hit some of their enemies in curtest essentially is t a things getting less crazy in temidaleast no because it turns out tho when the united states less vacuum around tents to fill that vacuum meanwhile common continues along it is merry way last night commas fired fifty separate rockets into israel proper again this words been going on for over a hundred days and tom they are still firing rockets from the center of the gosestripts while people are telling israel to leave the commosnics alone leave that leave the promos there still firing rockets it civilians in israel no sovereignty would be able to low this genoa some f the widower to look loan see there e go that iron dome is shooting down a bunch of these israel lows some of those rockets to a to strike open areas ut get would any state worth itself alow it citizens to have to live this at all of course not when bison and the administration are putting pressure on israel to stop with their doing in commasastand the gosestrip they are out of their minds meanwhile common literally release the clip yesterday of a female hostage talking about other hostages who had been killed and thy they made it a perverse evil gumshoe because this whatcomas is there perverseval group they took this female hostage and then they put out tweet with pictures of two other hostages sing are they dead or alive we'll reveal the answer tomorrow this how sixties these people are here is what that video look the question mark for those you cannot see and t shoes a picture of three hostages and the question is what do you think are they dead or they alive one option one all killed the slight it's evil option two some killed some injure option threes still alive and the answer is the female is om alive and says to night we will inform you of their names it just that the worse people in the entire world the worst people teatime and that they are treating it a a bizarre utuvidio and meanwhile the west is all israel committing in general it is just it is pathetic on its face and the only the only currency in the middle east is in fact the currency of sheer power and i israel does not reestablished ta currents view the use of power in the gosestrip that as when we very harmful not only for israel but for america interests in the midlife an men it already is considering that who these are not even being returned by f twenty two strikes meanwhile the procommos protesters in the west continued to do their merry work given the fact that they are cans er i can see why they were protesting in anti canter center they literally did this s they were marching in in new york and they march past alone lettering which is a a cancer treatment center and they started protesting the cancer treatment center which make sense again people who are an ideological cancer protesting against a cancer center makes some level of cense actually early a they're standing outside memorials tone carrion cancer center and protesting the hospital solan centering is compliment make sure they hear there in the windows oh you man the cancer patients you mean the families of the cancer patients those of people who need be heard by the procomosnics is why when you hear rather shame on you shame on you you have cancer shame on you unbelievable teethe this by the ways why when you hear rather mat out an joy re talk by the extremism of the republican party a guys these are yours the people are protesting for commosipoes are your people that is your that is your crowd maybe that is just one reason why lot republicans are fine give us trump already

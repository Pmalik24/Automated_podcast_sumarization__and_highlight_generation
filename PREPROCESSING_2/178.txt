lot looking for work she called her brother peter macho junior i said peter what has happening what happened and he explained that they had gone to a funeral ne that i never should have let dad go to the funeral with all the s faxed people vaxineeted people her brother believed that bovid valines weren't just dangerous for people who got the vixen vain needed people were dangerous to be around if he were untainted him and his dad they lived together they would been living together for years and i was can even begin this argument ism just on to listen and he goes i should never have hugged and he named a cousin and he said should never have let my dad hug and he named the same cousin they are all faxed idiots he did not say and had covin always he is just saying oke right he just starts what they never should have let him go to the funeral to hug vaxinito people he said because of all their shedding they shed the virus and i it stopped me in my tracks in that i just was lit what happened he had bovid and he said no no a but he he was having trouble breathing if he had n ammonia peter all of his symptoms are bovid your saying had shall breathing your saying he was fatigued you are saying he would he would lacked the strength tat even eat at one point he was just sort of trying to poor mill art not milk sorry soup into the corners of his mouth and spring him with water to get some level of hydration and he said that his bad was covered in sweat and then he said dad would stare off and it'd slap him and then he would look at me and that he just he he would say hey dad or you o say and he would go an till the last time and he did not and he said dad's eyes were just wide open an i i slapped him and he was gone an rather was trying to take all this in trying to get information without letting loose on her brother whose plainly grief struck om having just watched their father die in front of hamlet he was telling her he had watched their father die in front of him for days he did not take him to the hospital did not call nine on one did not call rather to tell her their father was sick he could barely speak then another thought his i said peter you have been his nurse this whole time how do you feel and he said wo i mean we both probably got sick around the same time but ism healthier than dad and i said peter you understand you definitely have bovid can you take a deep breath i need you do take a deep breath for me and he did and i goa how do you feel he was that was ism tired and that's when i just lost it and i screamed at him and i said if you do not you are his older sister yams older and only sister and i said peter i can forgive you for not taking dad to the hospital i can find forgiveness somewhere an me but i swear to you if you do not go to the e are right now i will not forgive you when you die you are going you are ding i need you i need you to go to the car right now rather stayed on the phone with her brother heard him get into the car the door slam e engine turn over she finally relaxed a bit when she heard peter go inside the hospital and chuck and he was forty four years old six mud for too twenty never smoke did not drink lifted weights when cobia it he would been on a lens he had help insurance through medico californium's met made system but peter had not had a full time job in years he depended on his father don't have his own bank account his first text exchange with rather from the hospital was about money he asked how much was jakesbill meaning how much was race's then partner jacobus medical bill when he had covet she tested back i said as seriously is the last thing you need be concerned about right now am just please it does not matter ism proud of you for taking care of yourself peter he said a hundred and three temp oxygen levels low said yep job was at eighty three when i brought a men that is really really bad and he said they just better not put me on a ventilator i said peter you are a fighter i need you to meditate on your living on surviving this he the says thanks for getting me going on this i was not going to get any better at home and i said no you were not if they want to put you on red does suffer ask them to parrot with illuminant it is a game changer from dissever and illuminant was the commination the doctors had given to job the week before that is how rather knew about it she had just been through all this if it is not ammonia yet they need to put you on the monoclonal anybodies says you saying all this tames at this to him and he said i do not these guided peter did not the guise at the hospital because they wanted to swab his nose for a piece arrest to see if he had loved he told rather he thought the swabtests for a scam the doctors got a fifteen thousand dollar bones for every swab they did that led to a positive bovid result i said i love you peter let them help you get better he said i love you too minutes later positive for covet within three days to race's great surprise and relief peter told her he was on the mend he went home to rest and she made plans to go out to wanna anna californium where he lived and where the two of them had grown out peter asked rather a couple of times after he left the hospital whether their father's cause of death had been identified yet she said covet even though she had not seen the certificate because it seemed obvious to her and she would turn out to be right when rather got to san anna along with one of her older kids peter asked them over the phone not to come in the house said he still felt too vulnerable because they were vaccinated he believed again that bacscenes make people shed the virus and therefore vaccinated people our especially dangerous to be around for the unpaginated rather decided to give him some time they would see him before they left they could do it outside in masks in the back yard she did not push he sounded tired she was not surprised after she would had comic she would barely been able to open ajar for a week rather kept checking in be a text and phone calls she was handling the paper work and to tales of their father's death she was dropping off food at the front door food we logistics love you hungry can i pick you up anything ism close ism two blocks away he says cannot think of anything right now those guys ever contact you i say i call yesterday that said there superbly in the paper sent to the crematorium on thursday that is one of their last texts peter died a week after rather got to san anna she never saw him ow long time neighbor found him rather learned from the coroner that her brother had not made a quick remarkable recovery and been discharged from the hospital to go rest at home as she believed he had checked himself out of the hospital after two and half days against medical advice i was stone i did not i mean what it means is that he was lying to me he knew what to say he knew what to hide i just i mean i was i was floating through my days it felt my brain had been white rather was dumb founded by how much she did not know about her fathers and brother's last month of being alive everything was gone all the answers she put off trying to get from her brother about why he had not hosed for help for their father gone her brothers recovery fake some kind o her foremen she had no idea what he been thinking as he was fading away but he would been doing instead of telling her the truth and then rather made a discovery a record of peter's final bays and she found out exactly would happen part one black box bovid caught us while we were busy each person at found and each family was in the midst of their specific unfinished business there are existing fault lines in disconnections the fault lines are what me here this is a story about a family and what coveted to them what it destroyed but also what it revealed rather lived thousands of miles away from her father and brother and she was used to stretches of relative silence with them but those quieter periods were always part of a rhythm that swung back even an angry silence was never permanent now the fact that she did not have any idea what happened at the end rather was tormented by this not knowing the pain propelled her she was not quiet with grief she was vibrating with it she had questions the first person she called after talking to the coroner was her and peter's cousin rather and her brother were only year and a half apart and the cousin was right round the same age mid forties the three of them had grown up playing together her cousin seemed just as baffled as she was by peter's death by the fact that he left the hospital against medical advice she asked him a terrible question the coroner had asked her and he chanced this was intentional had her brother been suicidal rather did thinks but she also felt but they'll do i know she says her cousin said no way no way peter wanted to live at the house where peter and her father had lived rather gathered up old photos and looked through them these are all great fellows and i want these but wonder if they had any fellows of themselves i given know they looked in the families i do not know and ay start o charging their ones and then i heard llubublublu message message message unlike oh god i do nothing about there is people checking in on my brother a a started reading rather looked at a text from the cousin she just talked to his last text to peter on the day peter died he said yet jacks please answer man and then before that are several tiktokling s is i swat a these that it'll have the ape i i do not really now hot operate it it'll be let us a not interest i it and then i just scrolled up an i just can't help but just be invested and their conversation rather kept scrolling up and up and up through the texts between peter and their cousin until she was back in october when peter was still alive and was testing with their cousin about what to do about rather and peter's dad who was sick with covet at that point he was having trouble lifting his arms the cousin guesses that peter's father might have my carditis peter thinks maybe it is bacterial infection of some kind the night before peter's father dies of bovid peter text his cousin and says do you or your mom or any one in your house have antibiotics a minute later the cousin writes back no and asks peter how are you feeling peter twenty minutes later definitely not well yet a fever that keeps springing back to one o three agitating dry cough and the squirts again my dad has the same cough only a hundred temperature and his shallow breathing pretty fast ism thinking the fever keeps coming back because it might be bacterial thing the cough is horrible ism beeping that because he wrote f and then a bunch of asterisks the cough is horrible cause it waits till we lay down to go to sleep and it becomes very itchy and we cannot go to sleep because of it we an am coughing all night we are both very sleep deprived cousin fuck that is bad cousin a few minutes later it'll case of to morrow ism going o bring you guy on when heel you guides peter o man burn it cousin i will i just got o run to the store tomorrow morning and by ingredients and make it i also have an immunity kit that i just ordered for my old job peeing it behind last and case of emergencies s time to break the glass peter sounds good to me it'll tell pops fifteen minutes later peter texts about him and his dad we ere already detoxing any way too week's prior i thought our bodies were just following through in its own me we gave the bad food we were eating every day even coffee coffee due yes even that creamer and then the comes on it is we try to do it right and then we get cousin damn it you guys were too clean rather saw over the course of her father's last day peter describing their dad hallucinating coughing grunting losing control of his flatter and bowels peter giving incitement and robotics the cousin dropped off ha final round of soup on the porch in the afternoon seeing how her father's death had unfolded was awful how he would suffered but rather also read those texts and everything peter in her cousin wrote going forward it the helpless awareness of somebody watching a green tragedy knowing with the characters do not all the horror that is to come it is the black box after a plangrash it is hearing ghosts speak of themselves i man i just responded with absolute rage and heartbreak she saw the text exchange between her brother and cousin at the moment her father died peter i believe he is takin his final breaths and then a minute later he is gone cousin what peter what peter i seriously do not know what to do now this is when rather saw herself enter the conversation when her brother tested her that their father was gone she saw in the texts how the shock of their father's death had opened up a window of opportunity with peter and in that window peter had tested her and she convinced him to go to the hospital or as he put it in a text to the cousin rather demanded that i go to the years ism going to the car there cousin tested back keep me posted that was what i understood that there were duel conversations being had and that one was my ad tempt at saving my brother's life and the other one was my cousins version of an attempt at saving my brother's life rather and peter's cousin did not respond to my texts letter and phone message requesting an interview with him ism not naming him because of that and because i do not want strangers harassing him over this story rather has not spoken to him since she found the text between him and her brother and he basin connected her peter in these text back and forth with each of them is clearly scared for his life and i do not know what people do in countries that have a functioning healthcare system but in the united states a lot of us may be most of us seek out advice from friends and family in the midst of health crisis the friends and family guidance is often supplemented by the internet and then were faced with the messy pile of anecdotes jargon and sales pitches to sift through that messy pile may be all a person has if they do not have a primary care doctor peter did not but he did live close enough to a decent hospital that he was able to make it in time to be offered possibly life saving care at which point he began to worry can i afford this peter's is trust of the medical system revolved around money in his text with this cousin even before he in his father got sick peter kept re turning to the idea that he did not believe in the cove tests and treatments because people were getting rich from them he believed there was a government plan that gave hospitals and doctors financhelansentives to kill people and blame covet peter was afraid of the wrong things with covet he was just incorrect but the over all idea that the us medical system is shaped by profit seeking than his often at odds with good patient care that is a fact no one in america is wrong to be afraid of medical bills in light of that reality and in light of peter's earlier texts it is a sign of just how scared he was when he text rather from the hospital and says thanks for getting me going on this i was not going to get any better at home and it was hard for rather to accept as she was reading through the texts that only forty minutes after he wrote that to her when he finds out the hospital will be giving him a nasal swab peter's resolve starts to falter and peter text their cousin they pe we armed me cringimogy too sick to get up and leave no response from the cousin an hour later rather text peter i love you peter let them help you get better peter writes back i love you too an hour later the cousin texts him did the test come back yet peter positive of course peter text the cousin that he is just been given some steroids in his ivy it was an antiar inflammatory sex him at the sone and inexpensive generic for any one counting at home a month earlier before peter's father he would even gotta sick the cousin had tested peter that quote hospitals get a twenty per cent bones for administering douche is poison from deserve now the cousin texts peter what was the steroid called and a couple minutes later oke i just red room deserve is not a steroid few peter texts the cousin and hour later saying a he said if they want to put you on from deserve asked them to parrot with alumina it is a game changer no response from the cousin the cousin two and half hours later fuck that do not take from deserve fifty four per cent chance it will shut down your kidneys several hours later peter texts the cousin they finally brought in a bag of from deserve and i said it'll hold off on that and he said o we that is fine no problem with the nurse assistants and the nurse but soon as the doctor comes and makes a decision it is the once the cousin a minute later no no no room deserve peter texts telephoto of an ivy bag the cousin asks they are giving it to you peter no i told them all pass the cousin o we i know you are tired but keep an eye on those fuckers watch everything they are putting in those lines it'd offer him advise id see him voter a cousin to get the second opinion am and he would just always defrayal those efforts it is just the most unfathomable absurd conversation no watch happen peter tens the cousin a photo of his dad at that family funeral he told rather about they are dad is hugging a relative who was marinated as he would mention to rather he captions the photo the day my dad was killed the next morning peter gets the cousin temp finally down ninety eight point eight still on oxygen because my oxygen levels are week the cousin ism glad your strutting to improve the sooner the better they will not have a chance to kill you again the cousin did not respond to my interview requests one of the things i know about the cousin the very little i know from reading the full thread of his texts is that he is a father two of the family members who live with him are in their seventies and he worries about their health he is a man with multiple heavy responsibilities who is also up late and early for weeks worrying about his cousin peter checking on him i also know from rather that about ten years ago the cousin lost another cousin juniper who was a little sister to him after she went to the hospital unexpected it did not make sense she was a youngest of the for of us cousins and her her better had been nicked during i ssserian and she asepses and she was young in have his babes and than she died and the whole family was crushed rather and peter too decipher was thirty two years old and rather says that for peter this medical error was one seeing event in a lifetime of smaller moments they gradually transformed him from someone who would never trusted authority figures in general and did not go to doctors he believed he could take better care of himself with exercise and nutrition than some doctor to some one who saw doctors and hospitals as dangerous and later as actively seeking to deceive and harm and even kill people for their own gain the day before he leaves the hospital peter texts the cousin the doctor finally came down and asked why i will not take from deserve and he said you are not marinated and i said that is correct he said bad the only treatment we have for bovid and that my lungs are going to deteriorate with the oxygen they keep ordering for me if i do not take the red deserve i said it'll think about it and he said oke and left ism deserve might have reduced peter's need for oxygen concentrated oxygen can harm some one's lungs over time especially if they have been damaged by for instance bovid the cousin ten back a few minutes later bulk that from deserve is going to deteriorate your organs especially your kidneys you have been pumping i be protein all week he is just trying to scare you he can get his twenty present bones for using red deserve that same doctor will tell you the bane is good for you which makes no sense cause now that you are confirmed the you have bovid and your covering it seems you will have natural immunity for life you will not need boosters just pray your oxygen level improve you can get the hell out of there as rather is reading the texts she keeps glimpsing these moving here and there over the last weeks of peter's life when peter acknowledges this is covet but the idea of bovid is a balloon that cannot stay aloft peter texts a bit later all i have to do is jog a little it'll get my oxygen back up sitting in a hospital bed isn't doing anything oxygen wise the cousin do the turmeric and gently lung inhaling exercises at home ye you are not going to continue to deteriorate he is a bucking liar a few minutes later rather text peter and they go back and forth about his oxygen levels and whether he has enough energy to eat and if he has a phone charger rather asks him if he is heard and estimated time line for them to discharge him peter texts they made it sound soon possibly today or tomorrow rather holy shit o say have talked to rather a bunch of times and from what have seen she does not to let untrue things sly she really does not it but in her ten with peter i can see her trying hard to be careful with him trying to encourage him support him tell him what she thinks his important in her big sister way but not argue with him this deliberate with holding of her fold forcefulness is part of their relationship rather feeling protective of peter is built into her earliest memories he is been physically bigger since he was fifteen but she is always been tougher peter later that afternoon texts with a cousin and again brings up the idea that maybe this might be bovid peter can you look up safe treatments for bovid the cousin rites back hang in there ism checking practical my and then the cousin texts monoclonal anybodies convalescent plasma or ivermecton the first two onions are usually only given while in the e are once you are admitted the protocol changes to remdesevere they only treat the marinated with ire melton that way when they recover they can say see the valine kept you from dying mother fuckers the evidence about ivrmecton is now overwhelming it is not effective as either protection against cold or treatment of it and will we are here natural immunity for life against bovid is not a thing and baseness do not cause people to shed the virus but let us talk briefly about remdesevere i spoke with the few doctors who been treating bovid patience since the beginning in cline and hospitals they were unanimous from deserve has revealed itself to be not actually a very effective treatment against covet it is not harmful and all the ways peter's cousin kept saying it based that was from desevere's strength it was generally safe studies did confirm it is modest usefulness in some patients but is one doctor put it from deserve was a to we used because we had few tools even the drug combo rather recommended from desevereplus illuminant one careful studies showed patience who bout the combo were less likely to dive than those who got from deserve alone but only bout three per sent less likely to die for in advanced severe case of bovid here is no consistent game changer the medicine of covet has been genuinely confusing we cannot know if peter would have survived even if he did stay at the hospital but it was probably his best shot two doctors i spoke with told me how important it was in their experience to just let a patient talk if they were reluctant to get treatment for anything do not try to convince them just ask them hat has this been for you then listen but the doctors were also frank about how often with covet they did not have time for that conversation or energy before covet they would seemed plenty of people who were afraid to be hospitalized we did not want specific treatments but with bovid those conversations were different people ware not just reluctant many were hostile some got a aggressive one doctor said she had the experience over and over of patient she known for years seeing her in a mask and instantly distrusting her the doctors both said that simply asking of a person was vaccinated would often stopped the conversation cold and each persons reasons for not wanting a particular cove treatment were bespoke their own tightly held bundle of beliefs and fears that were extra resistant change a doctor might be able to tease out and address the contents of that bundle fast enough to help the person or they might not anyway we know what happened this time t when rather started reading for her brother's text she knew he had left the hospital against medical advice she found that out from the coroner but you do not know how it happened now she saw peter text his cousin at three thirty in the morning ism starting to wonder if they are even let me out and my cousin says they have to release you upon r quest my brother says i hope that is true and then my cousin see em discharge against medical advice strain cap from very well health dot come that states a discharge against medical advice usually just called an am requires tat yousinaform agreeing that you wish to leave but that your physician things it is a bad clinical choice for you to go it says legal they cannot keep you there that is considered false imprisonment and my brother responds half an hour later how should i say it quit i need to be discharged in quote and my cousin says are they currently giving you any medications my brother nothing yet to day actually all they ever gave me were steroid's an antibiotics my cousin of do you have an give trip peter n out just had me on oxygen my cousin hum is your oats o still at about or above ninety five my brother it is affright now i was around ninety four all i know is ism not getting any better in here he he says to me thank you for convincing me to be here i was not going to get any better at home and tells my cousin ism not going to get any better ism not getting any better an here in the hospital my cousin how does your chest feel peter feels better than it did when i first came in which is a sign of the treatment working that last part is not in the text it was rather venting her frustration as she was reading through on this again she could barely contain herbage by the end of this next part she was sneering my cousin yah and the fact that gave you an a biotic that mans again it was back heron ammonia not viral and the steroid helps of the inflammation that is why the fever went down and your longs irritation went down as well now it is the matter of getting over the cough wit just going a linger for a few weeks but you can probably handled at with ha copper because all they ever gave me was anabiosis and a prescription for a strong coverup two minutes after i believe you are out of danger now fuck their pertercall it is time to get probiatics back into your body from the time peter left the hospital he lived another two weeks all that time rather was in a fog of coming to terms with their father's death and she thought her brother was recovering most people who get coma do but peter was testing with their cousin about his blood oxygen level a reading between ninety five and a hundred is considered normal but on different days peter says he is at eighty eighty eight ninety one eighty five ninety three eighty two ninety fluctuating from o k but on the low side to worryingly low rather had no idea peter did not tell her and she did not press him a few days before peter dies their cousin texts yo you good my brother does not respond twenty three minutes later ouch right in the slice meaning asracats the language for that any sens it yet another tiktokling peter's response ten minus later is garbled he is describing his own actions but it comes out sounding more a transcript of bleary half thoughts try to make things easier let us not go back on forth for anything go straight to the kitchen stay in that chair keep thinking of what you need that way while you are doing all this she might get fully wended major most important thing of all is the chair in the kitchen is a roller chair the roller chair is an office chair peters using to get around in a few days rather is gin a find that chair in the kitchen soaked with ruin one last thing rather season peter's texts is that she was not the only person trying to get him to seek medical he one family friend was testing information just about every day about clinics he could go to a nurse who would talk to him we also do not know what the cousin was saying to peter in phone calls with him and he did tell peter in one text after peter told him his blood oxygen reading was eighty that peter needed to go back to the hospital then peter tested that it went back of to eighty eight which is still too low and should have sent him to the emergency room but the moment passed peter's neighbor was checking in and leaving food on the porch for him four days before he died peter text the neighbor i was exhausted looking at all that food the neighbor writes back due you should go to the hospital call and ambulance peter oh that peter's last text to his cousin is a sad moi about the death of the actor willing lucking who start an sons of anarchy the next day the cousin tested how you do in peter and got no reply the day after that he wrote yo jacks please answering man rather told me once about her brother and father and bovid that it was they fell overboard during the pandemic and swim straight to the bottom thinking it was the surface when she finished reading the texts she read them again her brain kept combing through them for weeks she could not settle on any thought or any feeling i would go from not being able to speak or to crying or to making fun of my brother there is the survival mode personal just ones to clown you the deep depths of my hood miss where ism from that particular street i came up on we will clown you for how you die cause youreficking clown leek you played yourself o me and i i would up kills the titan strangers too bring them back you'd all or would i i do notknow i guess as one of those things are you just haggle thinking who you would trade out on the street get o earshot am you shat your back and shot to race's a poet at does not really cover it though rather is a tractor beam i can easily see how a person could hear her read her poetry at some event and then marry her four months later which happened i can understand a person wanting to tat to her words on their arm which also happened a lot of race's writing is about her childhood family her her father her brother the first poem in her first book is titled epically i forget who i set it to but i remember how afterwards they looked at me as though i had driven a stake knife through their mother's hand the poem itself goes i love my brother he had the exact same childhood as i did but he does not get credit for it he is not the writer i am the star of the violence i expose my peter when he marries i will be sad no girl in the world deserves him but me i see that poem which i love as the little box rather is daring her readers to open race's always seen her place in the world and part in releasing to peter her younger and only brother her responsibility still somehow she had not lived near peter in almost twenty years but far away is still somewhere it is nothing gone what do you do when you have lost something important you retraced your steps rather remembers where she and pet er started and now she knows where he ended and she is going back over would happened in between things she saw because she was there and the things she is finding out happened later out of her sight what did happen in between what life did overland and that is next time in part too if we were three nancy up at et just say o i posed to things get complicated their relationship the three of them

at two of our programmed act to the great li ration i returned to somebody in the sack you tries to elevate his families past with very few clues to go on if he ran up things about the sky before we get started first he is a professional skate boarder but not into being interviewed or speaking in public the fact at the beginning of his interview for our show which was about something personal and

small willies did not know much of his family his story growing up he knew his grandmother had come from akin saw settled in boson that was about it there were always kind of vague about the past but there was one fragment that stuck in his head i i go watching series and i remember from time the time they would have specials on about to the silver rice movement and my mam and i would sit down and

the reverse freedom writes for a wild chapter in history that had been for gotten i got fascinated and started researching at a couplers back the reverse freedom writes happened in nineteen sixty two they were a retaliation against the freedom writes by white segregationists in the south they used the same weapon as the civil writes actors the grayhou bus they used it to send black people north whoheits kind of what is happening now with republican governors floating migrants on to busses and plains and sending them to democratic states i thought it is just the reverse freedom writes all over again some are actually being put upper in barracks on the same military base the gold to day is basically the same as it was then to tic it to northerners and make a political point here is one of the segregationists back then famous guthridge he was a lawyer from ran saw who helped come up with the plan we are going to an at he a people it with he kit kenned really do have whet i prefix the ta old people all really do have o or or e roll in a dead a help i to boa pat her we a throw but the to bat a you at tan and i take too a too mat to year babe pin you wen could get you a feel a white people up there e tell segregationist lord people on to the busses with big promises of housing and jobs said everything would be provided for i they went and that president kenned himself would welcome them up north they targeted people who might be seen as a burden poor families people just released from prison single males with lots of kids mama's grandmother she's raising a levin kids and ran saw they did get on bus but it was not the freedom rites the a too different events an an i think i spoke to my mam about it and she did not know what it was about she she is a know we're freedom rites that's not this says reverse freedom rite since she a donor anything mother verse freedom rites most people do not i found out more from arrives and old t v footage there were stories about mama's grandmother and there and from what we can tell here is what happened gothridge the segregationist personally picked up the willies's family in his station wagon the drove them from their farm to the bust terminal and little rock a couple hours away he got them ice cream and rubier there were a quick press conference and then they all got on the bus hardly any luggage because they been told everything would be provided up north there is actually footage of the moment they got on the bus there is no sound it'll describe it for you the kids have big smiles they look excited to be filled they chewing gum waving out the window as she words welamat looks back over her shoulder she looks beautiful elegant in a scrappy sequel dress and bright white cap the videos just twenty nine seconds long but delay looks ready after about three days on the bus llama as the bustier to plover she wanted to change into her best clothes because she was about to meet president kenned that is when she put on those pearls that hamal saw in the foot but when she was dropped off near the kenned compound in hyaena's massachusetts kenned was not there neither were the jobs or the housing it had all been lies what was there were some members of the anddouble any pe some people from a church group and photographers with their flashes going off tell me what was going through your head as e started finding this all out i mean in away i hows cannot use to i say hurt by it but i guess some one an bars that there is is trickery done and mi gammas taken advantage of because i i fell like they were there ben use speck en mi the way my mother spoke about it we my aunt but they were proud of been freedom rites not i not grandma's as she use is a pan she is taken advantage of an an see is a political pa but it did answer a question he would always had i always wonder how did we wind up in the projects were did we come from hamal to up in a big public housing development and boson his entire family lived there and now he knew why his family was jumped up north far from every one they knew no jobs and had to figure things out mama's eyes were still closed tot this point in the interview i did not the life we were living any li the neighborhood i lived i did not you know the jobs my mother had to do there is a lot of we or things away they are nobody knows why his grandmother ended up on that bus whether she was forced or trick ere chose it thinking a move north would be best seen years since maul first learned about the reverse freedom rides he told me he sees it differently now his grandmother had one way ticket and no resources and somehow made it work he is proud of that my grandmas is trying to make abetter way for a family in that is all she is ever done and that saw my mother's ever done oh like who would not they the while this is our way out of jet cry sou yo know and know how they way but t it judge these gives up to no good anon and an the how any one at the time when do not with tat other things from their past mama's family does not talk much about this history sometimes when things are dramatic he make the choice not to go there just not helpful and sometimes s time in a choice mama's brought up the reverse freedom writes a couple times with his mam i knew she did not want to talk about it she may even have difficulty understanding it now he even sol just because he emotional experience if we got to dark she would not go there but she talk about some of the to fond memories about growing up in the out but somehow she would not go there that jo she was she did not want to talk about this do not thinks something was a pleasant experience for her have known his ma petty for a few years he was a tea major when she took the buss morals she wants to talk about it she is really trying but is not that simple just i guess when you get to be e thought you dis come to walk out the use of things you just o why remembato what you but at not we mango lot about the buss an on you remember none o that to it'll remember sometimes be past is something only the next generation can really look at a while back hamal was at home sketching on a canvas he is also an artist thinking bout the reverse freedom writes his grandmother and his mam and then his son who as ten walked in a notice jam was crying mama let him

as hunter bisons former business apartments o on archer prepares to testify the stage of set for jobidons possible impeachment republican struggle to fill the stage for the first presidential mate and israel passed the judicial reform package prompting spasms of apoplexy ism bender this is venshbarro show to day shows ponterback sprescivve pin thousands my listers have already secured the natter gey tad join them express plans i come flahspen jobidon is not best and innocent elderly gentleman he is also in amazing father who cares deeply about his drug addicted son hunter and that is the only reason why he has been squiring hunter around or by them h hunter has been squiring him around their connection is purely on the up and up at any accusations of bison family corruption involving jobidon are absolutely out of balance they are wrong enshuldn' talk about them this is the narrative you've red over and over again and hoiden is repeated this narrative over and over and over for example jobidon hasten asked at this one about thousand times that hunter bison's business is because hunter bison for a debate made money by running a round planet earth picking up giant bags of cash and then doing gid knows what with those giant bags of cash then when serious questions about how jobidon accrued all of his wealth where did all this money come from serious questions in fact a lot of those questions wort the center of donate trump's first impeachment inquiry when dona trump called up the president of you train and asked him to look into allegations of corruption involving beresemoch is paying hunter widen some thing eighty three thous and dollars a month while jobidon was bites president and providing over the for policy of the united states with regard to you gran remember that resulted in dona trumping in peach for the first time l the serious questions have been swirling about hunter and jobidon for a long time at every single time jobidenhas that i never knew with damn thing about my son's business not once ism purely innocent hunter is wonderful guy and there is nothing to see here here is jobidon saying it over and over and over again a yo ever spoken here son about is over tin in feeling give never spoken my son moersnn what is your understanding of what your son was doing for n extraordinary out i do not know what he was doing i know he was on the board i found out he was on the board after his on board and that was it and there is nobody we not lot of time is not the something you want to get to the bottom no because i trust my son i have not taken a any from any for force ever in my life we learn is president pay fifty times to tacks in china has a secret bank count with china does business in china and in fact is talking about me taking money have not taken a single penny from any country what ever ever my son has not made money in terms of this finger bard a word he talk about china i have not had the only guide made money from china is this chi the only one nobody else has made money from chine cam here is the thing jobidon is a liar he is a liar we know for a fact the hoiden knew about his son's business es the notion that he did not know about his son's businesses is absurd is absurd honey's face you go through the entire time like and now it increasingly appears that job was in on it and as mornmore people round hunter bison are called to testified and as hormone records immersed showing people openly talking about attempting to bribe jobidon we a hunter impeachment is going to be on the table it's as predicting it right now in side the next year there will be i peaches inquiries into hoiden forget inquiries there's probably ben i peaches vote inside the next year onjobidon because of the corruption that he is pretty obviously in golfing the bison family here demon archer is the latest person who is set testify to the house republican over site committee he spoke to do that within days three times they have moved this desmoid demon archer and hunter formed rosemont san a a partner's back in two thousand nine along with christopher lines the son in law of former senator john carry he an hunter served is managing partners of the firm archer and lines had been polder latest male archer and hunter began according to the ucadili tell each landed lucrative seats on the board of melisma despite hunter not having any experts in the field despite him being a drug adit bad that he was kicked out of the united states nave the firm brought an y reported eleven million dollars through the the arrangement they'd done in formation glean from hunters infamous laptop they're photograph golfing with then bi byspresinent widen back in two thousand fourteen a now even archer is expected to talk with the house overbite committed his interviews support take place behind close doors according to an aid who noted such appearances are rally lead by committee's staff pann'll charges comer who issued the wiping as he will testify about quote all the times he saw widen meat with hunter's business associates following reports hunter made a habit of putting his dad on speaker phone an a possible bid to imprescipothential partners and clients and that comes after comer another top republicans have repeatedly accuse job enough taking parting crimes but failing far to produce the hard evidence but here is the evidence that is coming a lemme just begin with this and this is the statement that should hover over everybody's imagination when you're talking about job and hunter widen first of all job knew full well that hunter widen was drug atilt first rule of drug addicted family members or friends deprive them of money because they use the money to by drugs jobidon did not do that instead he lent his name and apparently air force to to his son a they could run around well hunter picked up bags of cash here is the statement that should hover in all o every one's mine as we examine the time line here of the relationship between hunter and foreign businesses and his dad who is now the president of the united states and was vice president for much of this here is the statement this is a text from hunter bison to his daughter in twenty nineteen its on the infamous hunter bison lab top the non russia dis information laptop that hunter widen druggedicted ironic left at a computer to pair store quote i hope you can all do what i did and pay for everything for this entire family for thirty years it is really hard but do not worry unlike pop i will not make you give me half your salary that is a text from hunterbidon to his daughter twenty nineteen now that is kind of the ball game is it not the thing the undermine is lying to his daughter when he tens that that action no money move v a hunter biding to jo that you just making all of this up does that sound a kind of thing that you would text to a family member being entirely false then no money had ever change chance ever orbs that sound that has the ring of truth about it in just one second been go through the full time line here because there is now mounting evidence the not only was hunter obviously speaking with job about all this in fact we know that you are speaking with job about all of this can gold men who is a democratic congress person essentially spilled as much the other can an open hearing it at goes much further than this the chances then money was flowing from foreign sources to hunter and then from hunter to job are extremely high and when jobidon said open debate that never received a foreign dollar technically that may be true he may receive the money directly from son there being very squarely and very lawyerly over at the white house there changing their tune even the have a bandit now the line that job knew nothing about hunters business dealings is obviously not true ti mean got through the time line in just one second first let us talk about who

some of the time line here because the time line is really really damning and is perfectly obvious that there is no chance at all i mean there there is a zero chance zero that hoiden did not now that hunters business dealings and there is an extraordinarily lo chance that job never benefited from hunter bison's business dealings those chances are vanishingly small it'll explain why because aren't go through the entire time line here and we are also going to go through some of the documents that eve now been provided by confidential human sources talking about what you cranial for example we are saying about job and hunterbidon i will talk about what exactly it of an archer has already said what tony kolinsky another business partner of g of hunter bisons has said a on nonmember first twenty thirteen is a time line that is been put the other by the house over she committee on nonmember first twenty thirteen hunter bison and some of his friends created china b char a china char was a chines investment firm both harvest artist equity investment fun as control by he bank of china was losing on many and investment in and reforms of state owned enterprise hows in nonmember of twenty thirteen in remember of twenty thirteen vice president bison traveled with hunter bison on air force too to china and met the c e o of the company jonathan lee shortly they greater b chars business licence was approved and hunter bide was magically aboard member to understand that the way that it works when it comes to foreign corruption is foreign states believe that access to high ranking america officials means that they are going to get sweethartdeals the reason that believe this is because in their own country this is in fact ow works if you are in china and you an to get something done oil in have to go to the top levels of the polite bureau and you have to talk the members the c c p and if highjacking political members the c c p approve a thing at that means that your in get special benefits and the chines assume that the same thing works in the united states that you have access to jobidon that means that magically you can get sweet harp treatment in the united states the same thing is trunk crane this is why their constantly attempting to buy access to america politicians even though connection with t america center is is work a cup coffee the reality is he ban connected to a thousand a bunch of america enters an it may make no difference ts your business is future you be connected to later politicians and will not do anything if you live in a foreign corrupt country where you have to know a high ranking member the government to get anything done knowing highjacking members theamerican government you think is going to get things done d you thing it

ownership of this particular c e f c eyelet us the chines weald this the very famous man from hunter's laptop mentioning ten held by go four the big guy now we know from a variety of other documents that the big guy generally refers to jobidon again the idea heres that hunter is wholething in scrod essentially a bunch of money or could b if the yell got through a bunch of money four hoiden jury thirtieth twenty seventeen this is the one where becomes absolutelear how this operation works jury thirtieth twenty seventeen in what is that message to a chines company hunter widens has quote please have the director calmly not came or tonic or him have him call meet to night i am sitting here with my father we would to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled ism very concerned that the chairman has either changed his mind and broken a deal without telling me or that he is unaware of the promises and assurances that have been that that have been made there's not been kept tell tell the director i would to resolve this now before gets out of hand and now means to night and z if i get a call or text from any one involved in this other than you hang or the chairman i will make certain that the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability forever hold to grudge that you will regret not following my direction all too often people is take kines for weakness and all to often i am standing over the top of them saying i warned you from this moment until whenever he reaches me hundred by n then continued quote o ka my friend i am sitting here waiting for the call with my father i sure hope whatever you are doing is very very very important that is hunter openly saying two chines business partners make the money happen ism sitting here with my daddy and my daddy is very well connected and my daric can make things happen that are very very bad for you a few days later august second twenty seventeen the arrangement between c f c and the began family changes because the original began associates are now removed hundred lion writes quote the chairman change that deal after we met in my my to a much more asking an lucrative arrangement to greet a holding company fifty per cent own by me fifty per cent own by him consulting fesses one piece of or income street but the reason this proposal by the chairman was much more interesting to me in my family and my family is that we would also be partners in the equity m profits of the j v in vestments the jointentity a few days later is formed fifty per cent own by c fa amen gong wind dong who's eight chines come agent and fifty per cent own by hunter bison the next day in whats exchange under been tell c f associate dong quote the bisons are the best i know at doing exactly what the chairman wants from this partnership and now the many search flowing a hundred thousand dollars from c f c to under bids company a disco p c c f c a one day later or four days later wires five million dollars to godson west thethree which is another fun in which hunter is associated september twenty first twenty seventeen under lion request keys made at his office charged with his cheeses partners nonmember eight twenty seventeen patio c f c amen n in america is arrested at j f k airport on suspicion of bribery and money wandering on behalf of c f c china in march of twenty eighteen ye show man is the hat of c f c was detain by chines authorizes for suspected economic crimes is whereabouts remain unknown presumably he is dead presumably the chines government killed him e all of this is insanely corrupt o cant remember a hunter bison says quote the october of tower nineteen hunter either platerrule in the formation or lacenshure of be chare nor owned any equity in it while his father was vice president he served only as a member of its board of directors where he joined based on his interest in seeking ways to bring chines capital t international markets he was an unpaid position to day hunter is not received any compensation for being on b chars wore directors he is not received any return on his investment they're been no distributions to b oh or shareholders since hunter obtained his equity interest moreover hunter played no role in directing or making be charts investments hunter and testers lined from the b char board of directors on or by october thirty first twenty nineteen om ya no ism to go no on all of that all of this is at deep believe suspicious obviously and her's the thing the the tires knows about all of this okay the cover up is what is truly astonishing according to iris whistle blowers the amount of money that was cleared by hunter bison during the period twenty fourteen to twenty nineteen was a even million dollars a tons and thus an tons o money much of which hunter never pay taxes on and the iris did not investigate and according to those iris tho those iris whistle blowers there were sabatoch in their efforts to search store units of hunters they are not allowed to obtain search warns they are not allowed to ask witness is about the big guy they were told not to dig into this i mean this is deeply suspicious stuff again one of the iris whistle blowers testifies it was an eleven million hes testified to seventeen point three million dollars from twenty fourteen to twenty nineteen in total fora in come streams through various shell companies to hunter and his associates that includes three point one million dollars from mania three million dollars from state energy h k h k a from a ciliated with the c c p and c f s another three point seven million dollars from c e is of ciliated godson west three and six point five million dollars from melisma of that seventeen point the million dollars apparently hunts received eight pointers million dollars the rest went to immediate family members and associates again i read to you the text that hunter bison sent to his own daughter in twenty nineteen quotes i hope you all can do what i did and pay for everything for this entire family for thirty years it is really hard but do not worry o mi pop i will not make you give me half your salary do we really believe do we really believe that jobidon knew about none of this in benefited from none of this that jobidon was pure as the drivensnowe his sun is running around all over the world using his name he was calling his daddy on the wondering business meetings he was havinghis fathers stop by business meetings he was meeting with officials were meeting with his father are we really supposed to believe that jobidon was sitting there off in the corner and nobody if it a cruel to him and he knew nothing about any of this it is absurd it is absurd on is face n everybody knows it is absurd on its face and when he is vice president and he is doing the sort of stuff if he was actually effecting you crane policy based on this which it appears he was then that is actual bribery if that is the kind of stuff that people get in peach for the stuff's doing in twenty seventeen wishes influence peddling is not illegal it is ugly but its not illegal it also happens to be the jobidon was lying consistently to the america people when he says over and over and over i know nothing about my son's business dealing while squiring his son personally on heir force to to china can pick up for i bags of cash that is obviously a lie how it is really a lie because yesterday the wite house gave wit the am i how is pressecretary world's most untalented press secretary green jump here she is specifically asked about jobidin saying he knew nothing about the business is with his son and here is her answer i care i i been i been ask his question a million times the answer is not going to changer to answer rehangs the the the president a was never in business with this time it just not have anything else to back that is not the same answer that is not the same answer shes the answer never changed and then she changes the answer notice the phraseology of the question there the phraseology of the question as the reporter asks is did jobididn it know about the business with his son did about the business with the son er the benefit for any business and her answer is he was never quote in business with his son he is never in business with it that is a very lawyerly answer as a lawyer et me tell you that is a very lawyerly answer because when he says in business what is the definition of in business ser'sly what is the definition of in business

more on is truly astonishing are not that the most obvious example is hunter biding a crack addict deciding to become in our least he is an furthest guides he is just you he is some of the people from labeled and he lives in a in apartment and he paints in his free time and he paints master pieces and and those master pieces go for half a million dollars to unspecified beers do not a i mean in fact hunterbidins paintings are making that he can deny them to his own biological child his name but if he gives her the master pieces then that makes up for it these amazing works of art to one of the questions that is always been hanging over this is that this pretty have us money wandering retire where hunter biding is clearly selling these pieces to unspecified beers for allies of bine family it is whoever the people horbinas well now we know according to one report insider is reporting that else realistate in vested elizabeth harsh totally who is given tens of thousands of dollars to the political left purchased a piece of jobidon's art work several months after hunter bison's art went on smile the president appointed not tolly to the commission for the preservation of america heritage abroad o how magical of under bides arcs until some lady bis the art for wait to much money and then she also magically appears on the president's commission for the preservation of america heritage abroad wow wow the report said it was not clear if the art she purchase came before or after she as appointed to decommission hunter bison wrote in an smell dis covered on his abandon laptop that he could have sway and who gets on the commission to hunter by t literalyordy sellers that you know i could probably figure out who gets on the commission for the preservation of america heritage abroad also i paint finger paintings who wants to buy a finger painting ever it'd to be on the commission for the preservation of america hers er i will buy your finger painting another owner of hunter lion's art is ala a turned even morris who is recently spotted smoking a bong during a visit with the president son how nice the your time said morris might have received the art as a gift will insides a the morse purchase the art one buyer identity unknown report purchased eleven pieces of hunter bid's painting for eight hundred and seventy fat as seventy five thousand at dollars eight hers any five thousand bucks for living garbage painting by hunter bison jensocky said at the time all interactions regarding the selling of art in the seeing a prices will be handled by a professional gallorist ad hearing to the highest professional standards yes i am sure i am sure that dot there is no corruption it is all abuse to things they dwell is out in the open and an now the press is never can ask about it and they also know the presingan down plan now if this wort the trump family and let say the donjunior had gone around the world picking up bags of cash hell his dad was president let picking up the bags of cash and pretty obviously funding it to his dad and also pretty obviously calling's daddy on the phone while all of this was happening do you think that maybe that would irksome medic but instead here is the narrative again the narrative to go back the beginning the narrative here is join such a good carrying father how dear you ask about hunter he is a carrying father and he is had a tragic life filled with tragedy and because it is tragic life filled with tragedy there som truth to that that means that you should not ask about this in fact s is appalling that any one would ask about any of this well here is the thing i thing a lot of democratscan petty nervous about bide not just because they think that he is actually falling apart as a human being according to a new hazard hers survey fifty nine per cents registered voters have does about the president's mental fitness but it is that that by the way includes seventy one per cent of independents who doubt bisons mental fitness and to twenty four present of democrats according to this poll it is not just about that i think the deep in the back of their minds democrats are getting a lend worried about the fact that job is not actually all that clean and he is never been all that clean and there starting to n see it there starting to promote cool again the in ta try and make fetch happen and fetch are not gone a happen coma arris is superb about this coma arris as been speaking a lot more often chin the press a lot more a fin and here the prom for them the more she is in the restore people despise her because she is just terrible at this she is she inhabits the actual uncanny valley she is she is built a summer home in the in canny valley here she is explaining the work that they have done together i know what shes even taught no one knows this she is talking about we all just know that she is annoying in a noxious at ago hat or for together an i progress together hat's the men to i stonking o somatic ah i think about the progress and also by comic that is the call it the call it by comic alley is part of our blue rent together for what a man the canned together this is video or her hands can hut to to amazing an than aerial build future bin all people can truly it is i is by comic its but ism would it surprise you to learn that there is a person behind comely arris who is actually the arms you now in to me that used to play with your little brother where you would stand behind him and you put your arms out from behind him he as she move the arms where the arms are disconnected from the actual body that is coal his a good luck with that democrats this the working now great got your corrupt elderly dotter president backed up by coal hers the worst politician who is ever been put to paper ism good luck with that and meanwhile the republican party continues to spiral it is the unclear who the hominy is going to be at this point but it appears the donate trump of course has the upper hand it have said a thousand times you do not be great istle campaign run against jobidon thatw'ld be the best thing is if you ran the campaign against jobidon the media have to missions here one is to make suer the dona trump is the candidate and the other is to rip down any potential other candidate the latest attacks from the media art honestly come the most scurrilous yet with regard to onto mantis i got to say this is just up surds o first of all the republican bates are coming up the first one is supposed to happen to august twenty third and that really is the the can opportunity for somebody to start jumping in the poles is august twenty third the problem is that dona trumpet sad he is not con a precise patin the debates because why should he is she says because he is the front runner there is no point to it and he does not show up to anyone care what all of the other sort of all the little people in the race are what does it does not matter them fighting with each other what difference is man that does not make the people who qualified far are do mantis nick hale him scout the van romasuamy cries prissy says he wants to do it as well former vice present and pends might not actually make the debate stage becauseyou have have at least fort forty thousand individual downers and one per cent in three national poles of republican voters i he does not have that number of downers yet i think is is the idea i but if trumps not on the stage what difference toes any of this make and that's really the questions a trump or at somebody else right that is the big question every knows that is the big question and the media ore trying to take out to everybody else to the biggest potential rival right now is ronisantis everybody knows that as much the the victor omit wing personally the take is not taking the nomination away from trump he is to even running against trump the makes entire nominating starting would would basically be if d don a from keels over then maybe he gets the nomination and and he is not he he is basically running a very very trump support campaign the basis obviously as one bang attack by trump at this point and the media are helping about they're doing with lies their latest lie is that rondasantis sponsoring some sort of curriculum here in the state of florid that is the e anti black which is absurd t the african america curriculum in the state flora was written by a commission largely comprised of black academics we have talked about this they are two specific things that the left is claiming that this particular curriculum does one they are claiming the curriculum talks up the benefits of slavery why because there's prase in the curriculum saying that some slaves used skills that they learned while they were slaves to benefit themselves after they were slaves that is not about the wonders of slavery that is about the brazilin see and amazing ontroponorialism of the slaves clearly it is not about the wonders of slavery the idiots in ya liars it is tat is one the other one is that apparently the aciculum talks about the white on black violence that occurred during particular race rites in the united states as well as black on white islands that also occurred in some these race rites we well ya that is a thing that happened am me count pretend it did not happen but it absolutely did happen now as that mean that the race riots we are not based on white premise no but was their violence that also curd there wite people sure man it is all li but he meter can run with the lie to try and portray rondasantas the races this the dumbest thing i really is garbage and yet your seeing the media pick up on this of course of course it is pretty obvious they thing the trump is the one that that they can be most easily here is stepped a smith going after rondosantis but the ma these stories this the more it alerts me to the fact their onto say the you do not need to be governor an o ti you do not need to be president either the battles that he is fighting i just unconscionwhy is the governor concerning himself with african america studies by the way the that the florid is been is it is is it is the be torts this nineteen nightyfol why you conscious offer such things and when it is sits here because i one to make sure that ism cuortit correctly bags dinstructures of schools that suggest any one is privileged or pressed based on their racemes skin color are you trying to deny the fact that white folks have the privileged compare to other races of people in this country are you kitty that is ha fact that even white folks haven't erugo we to me slavery the stepped t have been and i have been and re are not the same thing of course white people were privilege based on their race in nineteen sixty are they privilege faced on the race an twenty twenty three i know steepen a smith sin you've a thirteen million dollars year salary from spin thirteen million dollars a year the study sit here talking about how rough black people have i in the united states compare to white people overall in the united states ism sorry this is not nineteen sixty if i can very happy is not nineteen sixty ma is it it truly mazy meanwhile washing suppose using robins going these actin thing then the number of lies the people all tell in order to go after a candidate and by the way it shows you what the medias actual gender what they are actual gender is because if they're are kendo wort you stop trump they would presumably not be elevating trump at the expense of his opponents but that is precisely what they are doing this why do not believe them when thy say trumps of fascist an the the the country's at taken s can be the end to the country nevis i do not believe you because if somebody is actually a true threats the re public you don't you do you try to defeat them at every stage i will give you example this i think burn sands we true threats of the united states having burned sander's ideology is just wrong i thought in twenty twenty that burned sanders would be far more delectable candidate by dona trump then hoiden i wanted you widen to whin the primaries because i did not want burned sandals to be presidents of the united states because i actually do thing to burned sandals the threats the country the democrats do not think that which is by the perfectly willing to elevate dona trumps they are liars on both sports of lives about the sans is the and their lives about trump here they are going after a sans again base on all my conclusion is that i u can are and our at a tor board are right he task ta tat only in that past by an other base as as as well the standards see to me to me atemptinto sort of i context's a a a siren the win a tan normals a reallyteto can san be other people ting in others people other ti salary i man stone in mi auto main a a my i explain testing me horror that is a tar can chat chattel slavery ism sorry that that is all is a the but again it is about for the democrats of holding trumpet they think trumps on it may be their own may their on maybe trump indicating t a nomination than crushes bi maybe or maybe democrats are right and they they are trying to elevate trump for reason meanwhile is trump running against jordan is trump really going after join very hart of course not its going a for rondisantis an cacsmeth those are his actual targets or here is don a trump going after tosantus if they do not on to sanctimonious now they will not him any better six months from now with the start of primary season the more people get to know i the lower his pulls are going he is how in the mittens and falling fast he will soon not be number to looks it will not happen much longer but he deserves it because they very disloyal person make a me i great again thank you very much me mean again is everything an test of will teach you dona trump personally this is what you on run the campaign based s and not on bite ins eruption not on jobidon not being capable of doing his job not on his crap policies there are placing the america economy to position of permanent stages and our foreign policy in a position of permanent weakness not on that we on run on personally ale at a mangoes fore publicans want to do it this is exactly what they are going to get an meanwhile one bring you the latest over in israel supposedly is really democracy is on the brink of absolute destruction why well because the frailly canvassed the parliament over there with a sixty four vote majority voted in favor of a law an amendments what they call the basic law which is cannery quasi constitution be out really over in israel that says that the supreme court of israel can not simply overturn any executive or administrative action on the bases of quote u reasonable mess i imagine that the present of the united states issued and executive order and t supreme court did not determine whether it was inside the authority of the president they just determined whether it was quoting reasonable you see how this would be a problem because this means that the supreme court is basically the tutorship they now get to use their own judgment of what is reasonable to substitute for in elected person or n elected bodies judgment for what is is reasonable which makes them not a court it makes them an actual legislature just not elected i the originally proposed judicial form package by could and by the majority in israel was a lot more far reaching the that allowed a change and how the suprengor justices were selected it got rid of attorney that exist within every autocratic de apartment in israel that allowed them to preemptively strike down pieces of legislation and and and other measures taken by those department in the judiciaries extraordinarily powerful an israel because it has arrogated to its elfin has it has simply usurped in extraordinary amount power since the nineteen nineties because basically the judiciary which is been a preserve of the left in israel for very long time saw the rise of the political right an israel to be better grab of bunch of power right now to prevent the elected branches from taken that power later and that is really what the battleax israel is ablaut the the the real story an israel is that the break down of the israel population is a felt of among the jewfish population is about eighty percent of the entire population israel is jewfish about twenty per cent is arab mole christian the the eighty percent breaks down about forty per cent is what you call colony which are people who are secular and then the other forty per cent its really split right down had is people who would be considered motor the which means traditional who are dotilumi which you be lice religious insist and then people are party the which is the ultra orthodox and the kilned they serve disproportionately army they pay disproportionate share of the taxes largely because the harder do not serve in the army and pay almost no tax because their income is to lo the kilned have for a long time had sort of a tacit feel where its we will pay the welfare and we will shoulder the burden but we also get the political power and now the demographics are turning against them as their freaking out about all of that there afraid essentially of a shift in israel from their power to the power of the position the selection was a perfect example of that because the opposition right now is secular parties as well as the are parties and the collision is mentally ultra orthodox parties religiousign is parties and could that is that that is the current coalition and what the fundamental debate is is how jewfish is the state going to be rain terms of sort of religious precepts the the idea of the left is that this the state were a lot of slave but its basically run just the united states or any other liberal democracy and the idea of the pol tical right in israel is that it is still going to be a liberal democracy but it is going to have more jewfish elements of its over example buss is not running in particular areas on sabbath or the ability of harradium to have sex segregated workspaces stuff dab i they the or or weather there should be commutes levin in the hospitals on on pass over an these are these are questions that in israel actually have significant impact debut here is the thing the rift that is over judicial form is not over that because the actual reform it is pretty mile an therefore these mass protest that men going on for wonton montonmontomonts and the idea was that the protestors were simply going to shut down the economy shut down the roads shut down everything until they got their way this means these really government cannot abide this especially because their service were saying here not going to serve if the government did what it want need do no country can survive a bunch of people who are not elected dictating to the elected government what the elected government so do means that elections have no meaning of course this thing had to pass now tell you one thing that did not is it not only did it have to passitactualy a good piece of legislation the white house the bison white house pathetically actually sounded off on this piece of legislation ism not aware the bine white house does this routinely anywhere else except for israel truly there is no other western democratic ally of the united states where the united states sounds off from their internal politics a j jobidon does not make statements about the economic policies of france here is a make statements about the emigration policies of the u ka only on it comes to israel does he feel the necessity to actually speak out about all this but here is the thing the reason that much of this divide is being exaggerated is because a media coverage of the divide and pilot politicians israel politicians an america have a stake in playing up the idea that we have reached crisis point everything's on fire that is what yo have to support me it is not true everybody whose colony an israel has a cousin who is dotuloumi and every who is dotuloumi has a cousin whoskiloni and if at the end of they everybody canard up going over to each other house for chat right that is the basic idea butt if the media exasperated if the political leadership exacerbates it it gets worse to take a perfect example in the aftermath of this very mile judicial form being passed the there is a in ultra a hardy party an ultra orthodox party call the united try judiisen party you t j and they proposed a basic law aimed at saying quote tori study is a supreme value in the heritage of the jewfish people and there for it is an equivalent to serving n the army instead of actually having a serve in the army because the carry generally get religious exemptions that is originally based on they have been going in the first prime minister of the state of israel who is a secular he made a deal with the ultra orthodox that in return for their support of the government he would exempt at the time i think i believe six hundred yeshiva students for having a serving the army to day that exemptions sixty days an people a year being exempted just demonstrating once again all government programs get very very large in any case the there is been this basic conflict between the secular and by the way the dot to loud and the rosary against the charade where the hayride a saying that us studying in shiva all day talked is the equivalent of use serving in the army which to my mind is in incorrect and wrong position morally from a tor prospect by thing's wrong as unorthodox breathing is wrong again just go back to the bible and the fact is that that pretty much everybody n the bible is a warrior scold in any case put aside the actual palace the jushlaw of all of thus which u ism invested in by know n land my listers on we but here is the here is sort of the the basic thing the media played up this proposal by u t j to exempt all harry deem from army service basically for ever in shrink an basic law there's only one problem the coalition is not backing this this is the headline right now at the jerusalem post o my god the the the the theocrasy has begun there's only one problem we good which is the leading parity in the majority in a in a coalition with u t ja says quote this is not on the table and will not be advanced it will not be advanced another carry party has my which is a sporadic carry party actually said that their party was in shock the proposal was even put forward without its knowledge or consent s anotherwors of the media attempting too its course play up the exaggerated difference is in order to jar more discontent that is the basic idea here and it is unit is really grows everybody is to take a breath by the way i say the something n the united states here is languish ain't in the united states the next selection is the last election guess what me when mobile nether last selection us what it was not the last election and in fact the person who was defeated by jo began is likely to be the re public anomaly next hem around in western democracies language that people should never use is this is the end of the country the end of the country because guess what it almost certainly is not and yore can to have to deal at that tomorrow an you have living country with those people tomorrow and the same thing is true over in is by the way is quite possible that over an israel after this sum after this judgement have after the a wall was passed by the by the sitting majority it is quite possible at the point that that is going to be overturned y the suprimport this how crazy the system is in israel the supreme court could theoretically on the basis of reasonableness over turned a waw saying they cannot do that that is how crazy the system ilia thank god for the america constitution oke time for a quick thing i and then a quick thing that i hate things that i today if you look at rotten tomatoes o i i have a basic rule about rotten tomatoes the basic rule about rotten tomatoes is that if a if a move clocks in at some ere between sixty per cent and ninety per cent on rotten tomatoes sixty per cent and eighty five per cent on rotten tomatoes it is very likely to be goo move if a clocks end above eighty five per cent particular its cotton cannimovi it is probably crap an if a clocks blow fifty percent is public crap a well indaba ones and the dial of destiny fall squarely in that category read sixty nine per cent on rotten tomatoes right now to the rule applies and due i i do not know why this move under performed to the box office other than the i pe is a little but old and lot of people who have for loyalty to the india ones i are people older than i am and ism thirty nine however this moi is delightful s i went out ton my wife to see it yesterday and the move is quite wonderful the last five minute t this move are li we the best thing in the india ones series maybe'sn's raters i think i think that it better than some the tuff in last crusade the first of all the move is predicate on the notion that india ones his actually eighty years old i will say that the d aging technology use in this move is much better than it is in say the freshmen or or rogue on it is really advanced a long way lie the first twenty minutes of the move is young garrison ford and at least the facial technology is very very good i men much much sot on bigscreen much better it is at they have really advance will not be long before you have free a starstarring in things again in a likelihood but the move is again it is predicate on the idea that warison for his eight years old and he is now living in nineteen sixty nine america and he has to go track down your n art o fact but but what the move's really about is is garrison fort a man out of limelight is indaba ones a man out of time or can he find a place in this can of new world that he is not used to inhabiting is there a reason for him to continue living cause the premise of the move is that they basically tried to undo the shit buffo if it of a all that you remember the child buff was in i believe crystal skull i and tom and child buff is now he is been killed in in the war at presonmov the via now more and ta and indeed has lost i son and he is broken up with his wife marry ones and tom and he it has nothing to live for basically an he goes on this noun of one final adventure there is a call back near the end ofthismotama can give away there is a call back near the end this move two raters the is one of the best writing reverses have seen in movies for a very very long time get reversal in move is where you say a line in a particular way and later there is call back to the timeout and completely different way there is a reversal at the at the end of this move that is really one o those beautiful reversals have seen in a move in years highly enjoyable all movies today is fifteen minutes too long some the chases go on will bet to long but why this moved isn't do better at the box offices beyond me because honestly it is pretty good it is pretty good n again the end makes up for all that the end is really really strong the last ten minutes o this really great highly recommended india an ones in the half mustn't he when my dad said that hours henna surprise and then we heard from producer's act the same thing it is as i say delightful i gate time for a thing that i hate ugh it is amazing to me the the left has decided to own the idea that parents should love should not be told as social service workers working for the state try to turn their boys into girls in vice verse this not insane position and yet it is now been adopted by wide swaths of he democratic party hill murphy the governor of new jersey who barely on a monitorial race he shouldhave won easily a lost to a person him jack he he on overdo him jacks a relic no one knew who the guy was and he almost lost to him we here's governor murphy explaining that yes school workers should hide from parents the corncob social transition of their children this is nuts why is mister crisis wrong when he says parents a the l nice who knows no bast there and they should be fault let us at we took these actions because it is the right thing to do to protect these precious young people well one of the attorneys fair school bug word an mascara one at these districts said that this am blocking of a school councillor saffnumber from telling a parent about this is at a violation of a constitutional right for a parent o direct and control the upbringing of their colder and why is not that compelling silly parents are the the the existential a reality in t in the uprising of any child without question i do not deny that for one second but let us not lily the constitution a constitutional and civil rights a precious young folks in many cases who are coming to grips with life and as that as they grow up and grow over let us be respectful of that a again this is em missis ridiculous you respectful of five year old who in change their gender at these pence their parents ism no and it just again shows you how willing democratsart rip kids away from their parents in order to pervert them men that is hat that is the they ye truly outstandingly extreme statement there from the governor seeing governor of new jersey this why when people are wat you vote for trump before you have of robin well yah i mean if if if jobidon is pushing this centagarbage it'll hut not only love from move from three times but that that's not a question one party may be run by a guy who i have real promise with and who i think was dishonest about canary sex and who i think you's rhetoric that is not stuffed i and one party is run by people who think that its locates take parents up take kids away from parents and tell them that they are members of the other gender and prepare them for life of misery i ghats how much for trace gat are is the rest the shokontins right nowyou not con one meat we will be drown by break cooper from the common section she disagrees with me on baby ism going to ask for why if you are not a member become member used coach of parrot

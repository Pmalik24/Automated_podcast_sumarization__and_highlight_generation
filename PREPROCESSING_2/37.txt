well yesterday was a very important day in the twenty twenty for rays jobidon is still really ailing a costing to the washington post jobidon is currently holding private meetings the white house to reassure his supporters because his poll numbers look bad says the washington post while present in bison has been holding private lunch is at the white house of topdoners another supporters as part of an efforts reassure them about his reelection campaign including concerns about his age and his energy according to three people familiar with those meetings he is held a half dozen meetings in groups ranging from forth eight people since he launch his campaign in aril but a bunch happened right before the holidays that a lot of people ore very much worried about jobidon's reelect efforts a lot of hes meetings are being organized by jeffrey catsenburg move model again holly wood and the democratic party one and the same the meetings of course are coming because a lot of people are worried that jobidon is going to lose that includes barakobama that includes micelle mama and whose pretty much every one and things are going poorly when even jimmy k√ºmmel is mocking you there was a hands off piles wroth regardedborakobama in the comedy world for literally years you could not make jokes about borakobama because he was the holy one bless be he but when it comes to actually jobidon even democrats are looking at jobidon in realizing this is a a man with encroaching senility problems a person nothing control of is own administration when jimmy dimmer's making fun of you in a reflector that is a problem if you are democrat when was jimmy kill doing just that last night are not just that fully risen for jo bid is not desperate mean of support for me of voters and grappotice as tout pull it out all the bells of whistles to try to win the back i markers work person on election goyim history t i e o hoslsli yo a ma see you s hen i t i me an i not you with the holing just i this connect between bison and his own people is extraordinary right now and democrats know this which is why again even in the fake at it is all about trump and will christy matters back from exile you's to been hard by them it them y say we back on hem as hem my say the night can year tell that a be rumpus when hen he come to there they so explaining why dow do not trump campy price an ye eyes takes go thin in have go democrat this debris math got wont i think it is through imprint that then the the conservatives out there when you defend tonal trump you are defending what happened on canary six your us tending why he sat there in that little office next to his of office he sat there an doing nothing according to was to o unis an the rest at are all talking now hand there more got a talk in could here is the guy who did nothing it is all canary sit it is all trump the entire democratic campaign relies on trump and we have the sort of weird situation in which if the democrats swapped out jobidon for any one else thy would be in much better shape meanwhile if the republicans by pulling dit a shaped out dona trump for any one else they too would be in much better pulling shape that is the weird irony of the situation in which we find ourselves both parties are fully convinced that there is no way thy can loose to that my democrats there is no way we can loose to donate trump let us run the old guy after all he is an on controversy shall he is not can rip open all of the inter sectional gaps in our party and meanwhile republicanselect there is nobody can loose to that eyes we may as well have the guy who makes us feel really good in donate trump on the right side of the isle the big question is is there any one who is ready to replace donate trump on the ticket now by pulling data the vampire is clearly now if you look at the national pulling data in the national primaries r at notice again those are not is positive and one point re julioni with the big club house leader in two thousand eight fairly close to the national primaries but we are now less than one week away from the i pancakes and in the national pulling average donate trump has a fifty point lead on the rest of the field in i the pulling suggests the trump also has a massive lead every single pole has trump up by at least thirty points in i that is a very very large gap new samphire a little but different new hampshre your starting to see trump loose momentum in new samphire he still has a lead but that lead he is not much more than the combine force of a nickel valley and chis christy nickel valley is running ai somewhat close second as a somewhat close because most polls have her somewhere between ten and twenty points behind trump in new samphire but all those pulls also have chis christy in the race and chis christy is drawing a consistent twelve per cent in the new samphire pulling she could certainly see a situation in which donate trump win's i saint nickel valley comes in second in i she gets a loose going into new samphire she wins new samphire and now basely the race comes down to south caroling in order for that to happen though chis christyyou would have to drop out the race will last night chis christy did drop out of the race he is suspended his campaign he announced you suspending his campaign which again credit to cries christy how is under the sumption he would not because there is no bigger egomaniac in america politics then chis christy who continues to run for president spite the fact he is not been popular for full decade but here is chis christy last night dropping out of the race suspending his campaign we were not campaigns to win my gold has never been to be just o toile e gets the had and the decision and the selflessness of where our party has become on the gonad trump sos o been the win the nomination and the feet you on and restore our party in our country through a new place o hope an of them is him in this country have always then that there came a point con in this trace were i could not we a pat to a accomplishing that of t i would get out in its queer to me to night i your easy go pat for me towing anomanati which is why ism suspending my campaign to night for prison an night of white it'll gate that is the right moot because that allows the field o consolation now hamster now what would have allowed it is consolidate more new hamster obviously his if christy a done what everybody expected in just in does nickel hale but city's still to much o an egomaniac for that he got caught on a hot i at the same vent ripping the only other people could stopped dona trumps he says the his top priority is stopping donate trump does chis crispy and then he get's caught on a hop mike ripping the only other two people in the race with any credible shot of stopping dona trump yetis is a at i in on to sheen sixty million or for to entyda it fifty lion o far fifty nine million bi the mantis an we spec twelve e who punching about the way and who is can an return on their in vestment it's satin gat smokes and you not nowt see o this i gat that of course led donate trump to go on line and talk about how much he actually likes christy crispy quit i hear cries christy is dropping out of the fact today i might even get to leg him again anyway her's just caught in a hot might making a very trithlesstatement she is going get smut you abut now it she is not up to that s of course trump immediately jumping on the person to whom most of christy christy support is presumably going to go but the field is in fact consolidating in that led tor debate last night between the mantis and nickel hailed we get's more on that just one second first if you are looking to save money this year but you actually do not want a sacrifice you not quality of life pure talk has your back instead of paying your current self on providers sixty seventy eighty bucks a line pure talk has a limited plans starting it just twenty buck a month we'll get that same phenomenal coverage you are used to on america most dependable five u not work for just twenty bucks a month that is how the average family saves almost one thousand dollars a year switch on over to a wireless company the chairs your values a company that is better an own that sure veterans that is not afraid to invest an shows this one what he waiting for switch to pure talk in is little as ten minutes and start saving it to day there yours customer servicstem is waiting to serve you i been using buttock myself for years at this point the coverage is excellent in again they are company that actually likes me in my values go to pure talk dot come slash apparel right now you will save an additional fifty per cents off your very first month of coverage that is pure talk dot come slash afpuro get connected right now again pure talk dot come slash a pure start off the year saving on wireless with a company you can be proud of because the actual it go chi come out right now at pure talk dot come slash apart now going the dynamic o the race are very weird because nickel valley actually needs to cantus to stay in the race that is what strange about the dynamic is this wild theory that somehow if the field consolidates town to nickel hale forsodonald trump that makes nickel half m ore competitive that is actually not right because that is a suing that the mantises support flows to nickel hale rather than to trump that is incorrect the large majority of rondissantis support will flow to donate trump because they think that trump is harder knows than nickel hale they see nick valley as fairly squishy now probe with the big debate last night between to mantis and hale is of course they are nocking each other there there bumper carrying each other the mantis does need hale to drop out but hale does not need to mantis drabashens the mantis to stay in and meanwhile it is servo lobsterpot over there a crackpot that there s sort of pulling each other down ins the pot and that is what happened in theta bate last night to mantis did actually levy some attacks against dona trump hale really did not most of her actor against the mantis which gain his strategically weird because if whale's entire heal is that she is more politic more polished and all of the rest then ism not sure who knocking to sans can get her anywhere and again if the mantis were to drop out say after i that actually hurts nickel hale pretty badly she needs him there to so up ten twelve fifteen percent the boat in vary estates going forward here is rondissantis going after donate trump over the constitution again let just be clear about this if the primer's were eltedto vote fronisantis it'd one for him he is the but floor governor he is the best governor in america he is the most consistently conservative person in the race he is an incredibly competent executive he knows how o actually run the leavers of power and make sure things happen not just soviet it'd vote for him in a primary he is way behind and is nickel hale they are both way behind they were busy mashing each other on seeanend donate tramples over on futons of bredbar sipping a diet coat and enjoying his life and mi hear is rondissantis going after trump over the constitution if interesting the oath does not say that you are gin a defend the shores of the united states a or orating and no ta conflict the oath simply says that you will support defend the constitution of the united states as present united states you will preserve per tactic defend the constitution of the united states you cannot just terminate the constitution i mean i know he does you know word f met from time to time on sosomedia but obviously i will uphold the cousin that of course is exactly true and then to mantis turned to hale and he points it to to big wrap on hale which is the chis chi squishy on a lot of issues and the later publicans who feel the nickel hale is to squishy on a lot of issues that she sort blows with the wind on a variety of issues for example he says i did not see you out there fighting the school knockdowns now to be somewhat fair to nickel hale nickel hale was not in a position of political power in twenty twenty she would already left the trump administration she was yuan ambassador under trumps would have had a lot to say about that anyway with that said he is right that the person who led the battle to reopen schools was him you no a governor hale mention i think correctly the devastating we'll heart consequences for the school closure a lot of things that happen serin covet i never recall seeing her out there fighting the fight i was on the front lines on that h again capping to be read about this he also pointed out that nickehaley still has not ruled out running his donate drums v p if you are belly running for president than why yo running for v p is the case that discants was making to the anchors she will not answer the question about whether she would except the v p not ah if she would gives all these the smell mouths response what is wrong wit just say no i would not under any circumstances say that and think the fact that she has not done that it is part of the reason cross have been staying in and i think that is part of the reason i think she is have this choice for you i issue would agree to re class fresher i do and i don't i do because i think why would you not just say i would not have set i would not why not just say that she will not give a year no answer o that because if she says yes she loosens support from the people but tho trot ah if she says no than that is for closes is eternally her ability and o be juice all get's a more on that in just one second first you now have been talking about my relics mattress for years have had that relics mattress and almost a decade at this point base leads the only thing tat keeps me alive cause i need my sleep and relics makes me sleep it is that simple helices is the gift that keeps on giving every night when i climb into bed ism reminded how swim helices is because i took their sleep pits and that

at heck sleeps to tom slash ben with clicks better sleep starts right now a meanwhile ticket hale was going after discants but now really on a good basis she kept saying over and over the people shul visit to mantis lies dot come is very annoying she said it may be a dozen times in the first hour of the debate to the point where it just became a mean many of her tacks were either sort of bad spirited or just false number one bad spirited if she causes to mantis of spending of lot of money on the campaign and not doing very well mean that is true also it is sort of relevant what what what is that a to do with anything at if he as been a lot o money on the campaign and he had been doing amazing in the bolls would she not be attacking him it is a strange line of attack er do not go an lie ton the america people to make them think we cannot do this you turn about and ray a at cannot you are in the one that is talked about look at what we din deform but think about the f that he is told o where's this money gan ta come from he the best way to tell about a candidate is to see how they born i their campaign he has blown through a hundred and fifty million dollars i know how can do that through his cancan has nothing to show for it he is spent more money on private plans than he has on commercial trying to get islands to vote for hin if he cant mane to captain how he can a man to contain get that that that isn't incredibly stupid argument scan put that out that to dumb argument down trumpet radius lack lest or ridiculous companions twenty sixteen an than he on we truth truly he spent almost to money he did almost know on the ground work and then he on that is really not correct also discants has been an awful lot of time on the ground in i more than nickel daily has for example hailed then bastersantistover israel and this is this y just a wrong attack an that the notion that rondisantisat anyway week on israel is an absurdity to tanto sees by far the most pro israel governor in america by far it is not clothes but here is daily going after him on this but it is really rich that donas can act he sudden cares for israel when he brought the person to island that is the most anti israel republican in the state the person that wet and voted against israel right to existing comes the person that voted with the squad against anti sigmatism on college cannot than your go and you brought that person goner to i a to go an can captain i go o that or fango i asap ts you a ramekin linesmen ton mass from conainthat is a cheep cheep garb's but here is the thing when when that when the wen o g the o o under e e f ye e been for florist we have one of the largest is rally mar america population in the country and we have been a a having for worth of ox dues in particular since have been governor and what biting was not helping america get out of the wars own these are people that were stranded i did not executive order we scrambled plans and we rescued over seven hundred america from israel and brought him back safely to the state of florid you got a step up an you got a lead when things this are happening yen that that is a wind for dis antis now does any one really win coming out of this particular that the answers no trumps an tom stage trumps busily over on fox news he answering questions from bet bear and what is it what is been clear here is that trump is actually pivoting to the general election at this point trump is no longer fighting in the primarythat does not mean that he can stop himself from getting snippy with the other candidates a he just tells lies about to mantis he does he he tells lies about his opponents one a regular basis that that is something the donnas from does and to be frank that is part of the charm that a lot of trump supports feel about trump because there is cynical about politics true supporters for a lot of good reasons that they believe that long as the person they are backing is willing you throw everything up to an including rubber hammers kitchen stings chain saws alligators at anyone does matter if it is justified or unjustified they want the person who is simply unpredictable willing to do anything and that is the mean trump the rest of the field is welt that at back is untrue and truth is a standard but a lot of trumps words truth is not the standard winning is the standard and if winning takes being mean and saying things there not true well i guess that dim happy the trump is doing that sort of stuff that is the actual logic that applies as part of this campaign for example don o trump yesterday suggested that rondissants is shut down the sat florid this of course is true o gay the so just to job everyone knows that rondosansis after the very early weeks of the pandemic worked extremely hard to open up the state of florid meanwhile he and trying camp and many other governors were being chided by dona trump was then president of the united states for reopening too soon trumpet is rewriting history here it is not true and it is morally bad to li o cade is morally basso lie but is that can't hard him politically in anyway has not far i won't a small bitter and times many would you ever allow a shut down in the future shut down in terms of bovid or shut down in terms of bugged cause their talking about a but your shut down right now but your tucket about a cove shut a crack not would and i never did i let the governors make their decisions and some of em from sot caroling you no henry rid master and frankly a not the coda a few of hem tennis we they did not shut down at all flatter ti shut down run to sank is shut down or as he is known run the sanctimonious he he shut a state down very violently actually and shut the highways down the rods ta but we had d ism a federalists to the sense because this the federalese way no i did not actually have a shut down despite the fact that some people wanted to and some people did not want to but we had some great governors an the governors at did the best shut were republican governors and they were the ones that did not shut down e by the way ho is ripping many of those republican governors at the time it sort of side swipes at the basis obviously poorly motivated he still thinks the t e basis could do him some damage in i but is he deeply worried about either to basis or half at this point i mean by the polling numbers the answer is is no gets more on this in just one second first he struggling with back taxes you have unfired returns this year the iris is now escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agent in these challenging times your best defense use tax network you essay with over fourteen years of experience tax network you essay and save their lines over a billion dollars in back taxes they specialize in negotiating with the iris they are not producer debts significantly tax network you us does not just negotiate they protect your assets from era

t and you say do come slash apparel or one eight hundred two for or five six thousand o kat he is on with with brabarr last night and again dona trump has shifted to the general reckon he is are talking general sections rock he was confascinating to washed work because again this campaign is very likely at this point statistically speaking to come down to dona's trump verses jobidon dona trump was asked by radar about political violence dona trumped suggested that if for example he ends up being jailed after being prosecuted that that will lead to political vat to to bedlam is the word that he use raberrt asks him about that and trump cleans it up can you say to night that political violence is never except i well of course that is right and of course ism the one that had very little of it take a look at wars again i did not start i was an involved in wars we beat the hell out of iris we one a hundred per cent we brought our troops back home look at look at the violence that we have had look at the violence we have recently rather one you said bedlam what do you mean y the yo bedlam i think you look at jo bidnence bedlam you have a man who cannot lead you have a man who cannot find his way off i stage after he makes a speech at last for about two minutes now i think bedlam is jo been i think that he is using that this is just a political ploy trump is a dictator he wants to be a dictator a again trump doing clean up for the general and honestly not been answer meanwhile trump was also asked about being a dictator and done he had not answer for that one do hes as the this silly i did to show shown handed my did you have here for is her nice men and he said essentially you not on to be a dictator are you lobby i think you was trying to give me a sister question that maybe you gas but he meant tot very well i said ism going to be a dictator for one day we are going to do what two things the boarder we gat a make it tight you cannot get in unless you come man legally and the others energy were in to drill baby drill after that of nocking to be a dictate what he is saying there he using the dictator language and he slipping the discant language and to imine do some executive orders which by the way is not being a dictator and of course the media ran with that jobidin rammed do most people think the tonal trump is going to be a lady in muslin eskdictator in the united states very hard to see how that line pleas for jobidon job donaltrum was also asked about these stories the is late breaking stories than put out by the left going pass about how a lot of forndignitary state at trump hotels and they were considering this form of of indirect bribery here was trumpanswering that question documents that say that nearly eight million dollars an payments to your business is from foreign governments china included sorry rabid while you were in office they say article one of the constitution as you cannot except money from foreign governments while president would you pledge to d t vast from your business in the second terms of the presents a don't that's who er that is without a reporter i own hotels all over the be i do not get free money somebody rents a hotel room at such at such a much money i gave back in fact i didn't have to do e enter gorge washington was a very rich man people do not know that in his essentially white house which was in built but they had an office he had a business ask any had a country desk brut next to each other you are allowed to do that i did not do it i put everything in trust and if i have a hotel and somebody comes in from chin that is a small amount of money in a sounds a lot of money that is a small but i was doing services for that people were staying in these massive hotels he is beautifulotels cause have the best hotels i have the best clubs i have the best clubs at the i have great stuff and they stay there and they pay i do not get at million dollars for doing nothing hunter i do not get i do not get five hundred thousand dollars i do not get five hundred thousand those for doing a painting it is not a bad idea i guess can get away with it and this is where bindings can be vulnerable he is going be vulnerable if all these attacks on trump i do not think that they are going to hunt meanwhile in terms of the actual policy trump as i say he is pivoted toward the general on abortion he understands that the abortion issue has not been a winner for republicans on the general level the abortion issue men lis not ism at pro life as he got the reality is that by polling data the america people broad rid and again it is a state bi state issue now thanks yo the overturning of rovers way which correct and good in certain states state of floriguing a harpy build in certain states new york and yet abortion until you are eighty three years all that is just the way that it is going to work in the united states under overseas weighed to my great consternation i whish to ware not the case i think that every life deserves protection trump is he asked about this he understands innately that if he says anything that it is to pro life it is can be used against him in a presidential election and because you popularity the republican basing understands can get away with saying things they are not fully pro life a primary is usually where your able to push the candidate to the right trump because he is far out in front has the ability cannot be pushed to the right on issues where he does not want to be pushed to the right against my consternation as a provider but that is the politics o the situation here is trumplaying this politics i for you to reassure me that you can protect all life every person right to life without compromise hat's the great question i appreciated to you would not be asking that question even talking about the issue because for fifty four years they were trying to get rosy way terminated and i did it and am proud to have done it they want to get at tack rat you would not be had that there would be not question nobody else was getting at that any but and we did it and we did something that was a miracle when i walked on to the stage to day a gentlemen in the back probably works for fox nice guy did si to thank you at sat for what he said you saved two million lives in the lest three years you save two million lives and i said thank you very much i knew exactly what he meant two million lives and nobody's done moreen that regard the me know i happened to be a for the exceptions alike road dragon with the life of the mother grape incest i have i just have to be there ai feel i think probably seventy eight per cent of pal about seventy eight per cent whose royal region he was for it i was for it a many turn in he swirled an he hit the dances for being two proof life again this is true positioning himself for the general trying toke the abortion issue off the table not my cup of tea it is not stupid politics that is true also again ye the the good thing that trump has going for him in having consolidated much of he republican base at this point is the fact that politically speaking he can already moderate early only can moderate and jobidon is abandoning the moderate in his own party robin has swiveled all the ways was left and he is opening up this giant space in the center of america politics for trump to simply walk in to which is kind of amazing that is par circularly true on the emigration issue again trumps record on emigration is much better than gabion beaks join has the worst record on a legalemigration in america history the mean trump's record is perfect it is certainly is not the first couple years of his administration for example dona trump did not actually have remain in mexico policy for example the first couple years of his administration he had not given ice y ability to do serious levels of deportation he is not pledging there will be maskyportations again do i think that to actually going to happen under donate trump i have serious doubts but that is the pledge's making ah what is your question for the pores it som that you can take care of the porter in twenty four hours after taking office how we you father the several millions that have already entered our country illegally and return then to their country of triton it question it is not sustainable for our country we have millions and millions of people here it is not sustainable did you see in new york city with it getting the regular students out and the putting migrants in their place were going to have the largest deep hortation eff in the history of our country wire bringing everybody back tho wet they can true we have ne a do i thing is rashly going to do that probably not but it is definitely a good talking point against join by the way how many legal emigrants are actually in the united states right now according to male and ami theaters o study from yell an a mi tea back in twenty eighteen it's well before ane that is now twenty twenty four then they said there ware twenty two million legal emigrants in the united states if there is went to million in twenty eighteen over the subsequent sixty years you would imagine that you are talking another five six seven million elegalemigrans you are talk out clos of thirty million legal immigrants in the country at this point an all that is a weakness of joined they're lot of drags on gabion one of the drags on gobidan is again the when it comes to many of the personal qualities that jobidnis attacking in dona trump he holds many of the the same personal qualities from the over use of executive orders to his accusations the dona true is corrupt but the reality is the lot o people in the united states perceive jobidenis rot because the biding family has used jobiden's name to traffic for literally thirty years enduring money yesterday that will broke into the open now again i think what is going on in congress right now i think congress is a clown shoe i think our legislative branch has become an absolute clown show that guess almost nothing done what the do get done is generally bad there bunch of reasons for that ts an excellent book out called we congress and that that book sort of explains the transition of congress from a place where deals got done behind close does to place where no deals got done at all and instead what you end up with is a lot of fostering that pestering broke out yesterday on the hill i know their a lot of re publicans here very excited about people yelling an hunter by nan other lot of democrats ware very excited about hunter by an showing up on capital can just point out that woof a country that has serious crises to face and this is all a waste of time and garbage not the focus in on hunter bison and his relationship with job but all these can of fire works were people then send off fund rasing years let us just acknowledge that our legislative branch is filled with people who do not want to legislate have no interest in getting anything done and are there to eventually get a podcast or some sort of cable new so that is what is happening on capital hill right now their serious things that should be happening say negotiation over the budget for this year but no saying attention then said the pain attention to the stupidity of hunterbiden showing up on capital hill as the house hope he was voting for contempt at charges to yesterday to house committees a cording to the your times voted along party lines to hold hunter widen in contempt of congress because he refuse to testify behind closed doors there is a twenty three to fourteen vote by the judiciary committee is twenty five to twenty one vote by the overside committee under bison showed up there to make the point that he wanted to testify in open committee not behind closed doors and i her's what of when hunter decided to show up unannounced i me now's it was one most shocking things since he was snorting cop off o hookers asked we the hunter bite adhering at the capital stalking through the door o his theater wit the there servicemen there another members of his storage bat he is officially at the capital the herrings et under way we are looking at live in it's i now a the got through at others the the medical the metal thetectoor her bi the metal detectors and ane prison wobbly expect him ho in our at these one of these committee rooms be has the gad this that before the oversize committed altho action happening in that judiciary committee where just go to follow these cameras that hunter bided and he where his going to head what is going to happen a again he was not expected toe so to before these earrings from the fact of he was not called by the people ho hes en two stories here one is is this good for hoiden one is is this good for hoiden the answers no any time or time at he her it is bad for job that is just the reality and then there is question number to what is any of this mean and what really means that congress is a complete side show at this point again serious things are happening in the country in just one second isn't get to how much of a sideshow congress is they are a waste of space they are a waste of time that is not n excuse for executive orders by the way that is to say that congress to be clawing back its own authority from the executive branch and you non be doing things from time to time but they are not fast on the things the matter and stead the are focus on the camera time what's more on that in second first the daily wire is on the lookout for a dynamic individual to join our team as a talent and bran development executive as the driving force behind our personalities management expansion you will be at the forefront of shaping the strategic direction of our talents brains from overseeing dated the operations to crafting indicative strategies for brand expansion this roll is pivotal in maximizing our bran's business and revenue goals do not miss out on this blossom opportunity to do brilliant work that matters every single day join us in shaping the future of conservative media as our talent and bran development executive if you are interested in joining our team there is a daily wire dot come slash careers that is daily wire dot come slash careers to day o can meanwhile an hunterbiden shows up on the hill the goal of him showing up on the hill is yo try to demon straight that republicans will not allow him to testify openly they will not to testify behind closed doors originally the comitteehad said he could pick to testify behind close doors or openly and then thy said we want him to do both who not testify behind closed doors in order to testify openly now realistically you really want people testify behind closed doors because otherwise forwent up with the grand standing we got the worst to both worlds no testimony and gran standing yesterday we got from both sides of the isle nancy may who when she is not wearing a scarlet a for some odd reason to congress s a grand standing on other topics she is one of people who voted cap my carththye out that we could have my johns i my johns but he is about to pass a budget bill that significantly worst than anything the my earthy was can pass last year nancy maces spend her time ripping a hunter widen yesterday and this the kind of stuff that get sent out and find raising he tells an achieves absolutely nothing a a first all my first question is tho bribed hunter bit in to be here to day that is my first question second question you are the pity me o white triplets coming into the overside committed pitting in our face ignoring a congressional spinous to be depose what are you afraid of you have no ball to come up here an mister chairman port of injury mister chairman i think that that hunter be is to be arrested right here right now go straight to jail our nation is founded on the rule come on come on real come at o plies equally to everyone wo matter what is your paint of order mister chairman and first of all re publicans should stop accusing people of being beneficiary's white privileges just ha general rule because the real privilege that hunter by khans is not that he is white the said he is jo widen sun i'lyouent up doing when you say the we privilege stuff is opening the door to dolts to see gain the monogram staninshistanc and here is to s now grandstanding on the way privilege one here ego quickly that that moments about a privilege and and all of this that were seeing here they it was very beautiful speech a by the gentle lady i who as she mention was a help lead on the majority the majority side o civil rights once of liberty some committee but i think it exemplary of the points not she also oversaw the elimination of the civil rights sub committee on this committee which really kind of gives the whole game away we show up we give speeches we give flowery words but at the end of the day participate in the structural erosion of the rights and representation of people thatthat our marginalized women people of color people that just need to see their due process and the liberties protected in this country o congress oh congress how is it possible the congress gets worse with each in every passing here then under by in storm down the room as em t g much calegreene was yelling out i this all great far public by the way that is all just wonderful and ism glad that we can do all this on cameraman everybody can get the minute of facetiae it is just it is great thank you mister chairman i a was me hunter ism apparlyar fruit of my oread o ti we i we we met i ti mister chairman that yonder re must ah that is too a d i think it is clear and obvious for everyone watching this here and to day that hunter died and is terrified of strop conservative republicans women because he cannot even o my words as i was about to speak to him what a coward it is all came is all came all congress is of this point is a waste of space in came it is unbelievable and again ism not riding on mart r caller in particularly or nance he makes particularly it is the democrats to it to everyone it is every one what do you gets do for living ism s wondering but it some point would you do something useful i know that you let us say things in to camera and that is wonderful i mean i do it for living by you are not most to did for live in you are elected official on the public time at a certain point maybe you could actually go pastor legislation or hold some one actually accountable maybe you could do that meanwhile on the left side of the isle got people a your mascot's doing the same thing i join mosquito combated the hunter widen tobacco by holding up a photo of donate trump and jeffrey destine this is where we are guise this is our congress are not you proud we gentlemen from georgia a i know it is such an advocate for woman's rights is she mention and it is concerned about grooming and apparently we we do not how many standards here any more again mind remind my colleagues because i do not want them to forget about hypocrisy oka i down t about is a clown show it is a picture is hanging to of jackapsyon on traps and when he was asked he said you non jeffrey likes i young how did the president know that how did he know that jeffrey paste likes i young person there is a sumption to to lean i lacking in the background was there she thinks about the joys if composer is you t every one in overrunning congestion cloud ever ah i said the were clown many times that its basely turned into a circus here but now remotely the circus the congress actually is now again all this demonstrates that we have an irresponsible politicians a deeply responsible political c class and a broken congressional system and again it is largely broken because the pollerisation the parties makes its to no conversation actually takes place between the parties the end of politics his to eventually get out of politics an thing gall make money elsewhere many members of congress are getting which after they leave congress something needs to be done about the political system of the legislature because it is full scale full stop at his asterarea that is take away number one take way number to his hunter widens really baftrjobiden her comes to the twenty twenty four race hunter is a nightmare for join mesas the more were togamout hunter we have not mention for quite a while here is owns frog's presidential campaign hunter went out to the press afterward and the press asked him why was it that your father was being called in the middle of your business meetings and here is his really bad answer its midi wit a a coo i car a i o i that t i call you t to a it tea i a i also the call went the other way was from a under biting to his dad at i do not do during business meetings generally call my father an about you you middle a big mom tie million dollar business meaning you just pellet you not lemme it my dad on the phone for no reason just to say high in's either weather is a thing you do regularly meanwhile the democrats our force to find hunter in order to defend job names clyburn who of course s a big biding backer in twenty twenty he is now saying that hunter showing up to congress shows just what a great father job is this is really the angle that going to take it is not going t be osumgize one would you have advise hunter be to appears to days hearing how beg of a distracts on liability is the to the presents reelection be what this of the strict o nothings about the or tit i think of all this is going to temistrat wat the he good father to bi an is we all mavin a boy it i have to an to the set about thee an at you to be a good after to there an a not o ti tin the office a how benin the way of be a good father gay if that is the final democratic pitch on hunter biding that is not in a play that is not in a play one of the things by the way that has made our presidential elections important is the fact the congress is a leap shoe if congas were not a leap show most apple you begetting done in congress and the president would be there wit the reopen and that is how the process was originally supposed to work that is to the waste that is not the anything works any more because congress is basically devolved in to in absolute goat radio it it is it is ridiculous hell meanwhile the re publicans in another i think semi useless act they are trying to impeach he secretary of homlansicarity now that is fine you get rid of him men now a hunter amorous is a disgrace to his job there is no question about that and he has completely under scored the failure of by administration to actually abide by the law getting one of myorcus is not acting n a solve the problem if to get rid of jobidon in order to solve the problem you don't may be helpful here is a useful congress a useful congress that passes tuna border legislation that might be the think now cant been the house for thus republican's the house have in fact passed age a too which is quite a good bill it is republicans in the senate who have been a little more wish you washy on that particular issue suffice it to say one of the things that happen because the hunter by n hearing is that the meorcastufe got blown off the front pages if one of the purposes of hearings is to public focus on an issue you actually do want the public folks more on cercus in the border than you do on nasty maze an empty g and to c and cared most it is grand standing about hunter bison frank lathing it may be one of the reasons why enter began showed up yesterday is because politically speaking if four a democrat you would actually rather have people talking about hunter bison than talking about the disaster area at the border an according to representing mark green the g chest chief mayor's has imported five million legal immigrants into the united states by the way thing that is an understate i think it is actually higher than that at this point bus it seems by the stats that we saw yesterday just in the last year alone in in twenty twenty three three million elegalimigrants entered the country at a minimum it is probably higher than even that representative mark green of tenners he points out this is an intentional crisis being driven by the by administration he is correct about this all of these excuses at long predated secretary meorcasist incur and yet we have never experience to crisis this as even the new york times admits and i quote push factors do not explain the entire surge and may be not even most of it there's been no recent wards in can america in the regents poverty rate has been flat in he new york times it'll also note that ta two of the sixteen cities in the world with the highest moderates a right here in the united states now this crisis has been intentional secretary orcas was made a ware of testimony given by president bisons attorney general merit garlic were the a admitted the current policies are being exploited by the cartels gets secretary amorous turns around and implements additional policies to expand the action release measures in powering the cartels an killing america and he is totally right about all this meanwhile democrat like you can care to mayor's that is our over all policy you n a fire him for implementing our of raw policy and he is about half right everyone who involved in the several policy should be fire here is democratic representative benny tompion trying to make the case the canna idea or is just for putting in place jobidans preferred policy the truth is securing the border is that really the republicans to concern if it was they provide the people with boots on the ground at the border what they need to get the dob done republicans would really explored a challenging policy issue for the on precede political gan republicans disagree with the bine administrations for an embrace and policies the are angry that this administration will not take babies from their minds a put cents and cages the last administration you can not impute to cain its secretary because you do not the presidents policies a mean you you can technically do that now the reality is what she do is actually impeach the president or get rid of the president impeaching the president at this point democratic event inland happen but the america people do have the ability to get rid o the president in the next general election and the should absolutely do that again the emocraticpolicy here is an open ware policy there is no question about that democrats under cristmerphy of conecticut he he actually said that they do not want to scale back joobdane ability to simply parole illegal immigrants into the general population i think we are interested is democrats in providing the administration w tools that will help better manage the border we are not interested in taking away from the administration tools at these to day to help better manage the border and when we talk about this topic of borrow it is very important to understand that it is use to day is a way that the administration is able to better manage the flow in a playful way of individuals to the word you better manage the flamings let everybody in that is the actual bine administration policy but again all this got obscured yesterday because of he hunter bastion and against that is what that is all that happened in reality and meanwhile the controversy continues to swirl around the bide administrations failure to fire thedefen secretary for going completely wall for a week at least demonic represented from new york she says that it is that time for load stinko resign of course is correct i moneyed to service the house for publican cogency chair and most importantly i represent my district every single day and look at the scandal right now with the secretary of the fence i represent thousands of troops from fort drop the ten mount division wore devoted in thereat straight now it is unacceptable that you have e secretary of the fence who is not transparent with the white house ism looking ford to being active on that issue to deliver countability and transparency and i call for his assignation you want him fire absolutely it has an impact on first of all adversaries are watching if you look at the natialscurity challenges around the world to day whether the middle stop fire whether you think about china continuing to be on the rise continuing to watch for america weakness antis assert america weakness again this is now becoming by prison issue getting red laid busting the taphouse arm services democrat represented adamsminth of washington he says widen should think about firing laid busting we know what happen i do not that there is much of it inquiries much digisedone we does not need secretaryaustin ans to the question why did he think that it was a appropriate for him not to tell the president that all of this was going on of i think weed need need to hear an answer from that i thing the president eaten value is relationship wit the secretary defense based on what happened in based on that answer does that mean that you think that he should wittily consider firing him think at out that conversation i do not know tit is at the moment i cannot think of a plausible explanation e that of course again is a democrat that joins his administration is chaos the more focus on that and the less focus on the was on the other side of the all the better for the republicans meanwhile the bide administration continues to sow chaos in the middle east with its in certainty and unwillingness to actually just a the thing and the thing his commons must be destroyed the this must be stopped iron is the actual s pondering power here does mean tough to go to war directly wither on but certainly the united states in its alley have the capacity cut the arms off the octopus that is the cranial terra network but sadly thou us an its allies are still trying to figure out exactly ho to stop the soothes again this notion that the west has no ability to stop a rag tag the group of pirates in the red sea is totally insane totally crazy and yet that is precisely what the bid ad ministration continues to push is unclear to them exactly how to stop the soothes they say i mean ism confused cannot you just kill a bunch of them ow they they do have these basis that exists right on the cost that they are using in ore to launch the in eatables and their drones at ships could not they actually just kill a bunch of the hobbies what explain to me the problem and yet according to the near times the united states an stalls are saying how to stop attacks on commercial ships in the red sea after america an rich official said weekday their navies had intercepted one of the largest bananas yet of drones and missiles fired from the area controlled by the soothes and banian back roup in common the attacks which the other they will go on until is rill ends its campaign against commons in the gotestrip are threatening maritime traffic in on the world's most crucial shipping lanes an tin blinking said what i can tell you is as we made clear many other countries make clear they'll be consequences for the tooth's actions o call at some point you might one actually materialize those consequences otherwise at towns you are a weakling and the shipping cops our piling up according to the wallstre journal western importers are reporting a steep rise in ocean shipping race and weeks along delay is as carriers divert ships from the reduce to avoid whole rebel attacks some company's shipping goods own the crucial tradelane are starting to chafe at the rising prices next trees ocean carriers are imposing for the higher cops of rooting containerships on longer voyages all the way round the horn of africa average world by cost ship forty footling continues of nearly doubled since late nonmember that is the fault of the bind ad ministration which again continues to send mixed signals in what is the most morally clear conflict in modern history ism sorry when y when a genicitl terrorscrup crosses the boarder of another country murders twelve hundred of he citizens takes another two and forty hostages there still a hundred hostages there and then the power it provoked goes in and wrecks them while attempting to maintain civilian life by the way at a rate that the enemy certainly would not not only would they not they are literally hiding in civilionareas this a particularly clear case of the west should be unified in support of israel getting rid of compass and if there ancillary terror groups that are threatening israel or threatening shipping which by the way forget about wetting bout israel threatening shipping ash as impact on your daily life n my daily life if you cannot stand up aga what eat a point would you stand up precisely but the wild left continues to run this administration or at least have heavy impact on this ad ministration a what is amazing about all this is the commaschus keep saying that the apart out lout yesterday for example compasses leader is malhonea is the political leader of commas operating out of center i i guess ye he it maybe in turkey at this point the keep moving him around because he is afraid that es can get killed by these rails yesterday he literally said that when you give money two gaze it is going to fun commas and meanwhile the america like maybe we should get more money to gaze genius levelstuff here fommanamada then he says the second as she is the call to dona money whammy wage collect caiman dear brothers and sisters let us call this financial good man omanaacabaha wishes nomination does comic donations this is focus to humanitarianition area ha a the despite is immense importance and gazes need for any to can get n this is financial good should resources in we should revive this principle of is lomicture prudence in our comic nation the notion of waging jehad with one's life and one's money shes calling for foreign aid two the god strip took h m me stolen by compass an used and meanwhile less maybe ruins on the for for ana thankfully the west is filled with more on left wingers the the best tape the moron left wingers yesterday standing forcommass comes from san franciscos to san francisco city council voted for a sense fire amazing news ism sure that israel government voted for san francisco to stop being a homeless riding uses written pothole mike tat that man did it ha en he impact on the government of a of san francisco no obviously hear a bunch of people who would be murdered immediately by famous if comose came into contact with them cheering as they call for a sense fire in san francisco by the way the same city council hearing saw a person who had five relatives murdered on october seven testify and people ware making oinking noises in the background ass testified to these people are just ta by the ay the silvering masks the year is twenty twenty four i noticed on the calender hero everything will one these people w you dad in gas every one of them it is an amazing thing where all their haircuts bad asked producer save and the answer is because there crazy people that is why and the by administration continues locator to the crazy people by the waysotos hazard breaking news from cassia dollar over at daily wire hazard is hosting a summer program at a palistonan university dominated by homos according to cassia hazard university will host summer program ore students will be briefed on settler colonialism t a piston an university that called for glory to the martyrs after the octobersevenh terrorist massacre the embalmed iviligue institutions palestine social medicine course will send hazard students to bears eat university in the wetback according t the program's website it explains the three week an tents of summer course is designed to introduce students to the social structural political and historical aspects that determined pakistan in health beyond the biological basis of disease the curricular contintwill include hearing from health practitioners academics in activist about various topics including settler colonialism and its manifestations in palisade a spokeswoman four hazard defended the program saying that bears right is a public institution covered by an autonomic bort of trustees with no political religious for sectarian of filiation well on the sun population literally voted for a commossofhiliated block in the student government basically this places run by famous and hazard is still affiliated because these radical universities iron facts still affiliated with the with the far left ideology and the by administration wants to win their votes and they continued to cater to them meanwhile over at the vague at the international court of justice which is just a a waste of space and waste of times the united nations on steroids the icy jay south africa is trying to prosecute israel for genocide wall israel attack by a genocidal group literally targeting news for murder and well a hundred hostages are being held in terror or abtherty dead in gaze south africa a country famous for it is a racial tolerant is now suggesting that israel ought be persecuted or prosecuted for genocide by the way four days ago four days ago the leader of the student's rebel group the rapid support forces propane majored human heredity the gall met president still ram those in pretrial who exactly is a heredity heredity is person who recently let high and incredible massacre in sudan in that that by the ways according to rioters the burials at alcabat sedentary continued from more than seven weeks from late aril on till mid junior sudan turning a rectangular plot into a sprawling mass grave for least one thousand residents of a scene city in wesstarfor the carnage was the result to more than fifty days of attacks on the cities majority ethnic african tribe by sedan's rapid support forces south africa says israel engaged in a genocide while they defend themselves meanwhile literally hosting genocidal murderers in south africa as that is he international all works and the be administration is still incredibly trying to cater to the advise this presumably is why secretary of state anchovy blinking was meeting with mahmoudabass in actual halo cotton i and the had o the palistinian authority malaria and it is it is amazing that the bine administrations continuing to try to prop up machmudamas abas as a solution in in the gasastrip he is non i the solution in the west bank machwinbas does not run the wetback the west bank is in a state of turmoil because the palcinian authority is deeply in popular commas is anymore popular in the wetback thenabas abas does not have the authority to even keep a in on things in the west bank which is why you are seen is really operations in the wetback on a continuous basis against members and a idiots of compass but the united states being completely delusional under jobitan has decided the machlabas is somehow the magic solution the magic bullets with regard to the gassy strip and the united states is saying that the only path forward for the gasistrip is of israel creates a palistinian state under whose specie set let just get this logic israel withdraws from a piece of territory in two thousand five they hand it over to the palstinians the palsinians promptly wreck every piece of tuition for structure they promptly elect commas in actual genicileterroscrip is their leaders that terret group spends the need twenty years building up a massive stock pile of weapon my rockets building enormous terratunnels they launch the single deadliest attack on just since world war too and the administration's responses that israel should create a palstonian states the last time they try this was two thousand five and bandit really really poorly the solution is not machmudabas and the all delusional garbage it is all delusional garbage because this administration does not actually have a clear picture of how the middle east works by way at this point it is one shout out to john fedderman john fedderman is having a reverse bulwark is my friend john pod hours is said is an amazing thank here is john fedderman yesterday speaking and

the care of thirteen age son but instead of acting as a surrogate parent standing above sibling squabbles and rivalries acting as judge and mediator the teenage baby sitter stays squarely in the center of those rivalries but as ruling hang now with no parental forces tempering his actions he way frank has this cautionary tail about what happened the perries grew up and relied a ho when their parents went out the oldest son dug was left in charge of his for younger siblings dug was the kind of guy who ruled the last three rows of the school bus through a combination of force and psychological pressure he told other kids that the best driver signed in agreement putting him in charge of the back of the bus he wore a bazar jacket he wrote a motor cycle still his parents thought he seemed rest possible enough when it came to his brothers and sister there was a lot they did not now i had to be their candles bank kid i was going to make a fun for me to youknow dug coffin subjected was three little brothers to what he calls bravery tusks he would do things stuffed them in his sleeping bad and tied them to a tree long or snap huge rubber bands at their skin until they stop flinching i really hesitate the tailors from because it could have been i mist es all anyway we had the iguana i the big lizard about it was about three feet long a died well i was after the thing that i course do did not one take it out beryitfa put in the freezer and kept it l this is a fun thing for all of us boys to take out of the freeman throughout and play with it you known than we got told of playing with it than we put it back in the freezer you known would free it again and after about a year and a half of this we decided pul need a new bravery gift we thought what can we do i think we should boil an et well and eat the iguana that would be the ultimate bravery if well we put it in a pot we bout the biggest pot my maltha stuffed n there boiled it you knoll ill were been boiling about five minutes probably done by now and an my got to thing out and am conte goodness gree meat mean that enter oi i even make some and they really ism s ready to death at that point it actually take o cancel soot dug did all the bravery taste an made is harder here who was righting there with them but they were on their own when it came to one who dogs long running baby setting pranks i spoke with dog and with his youngest brother an might who was the easiest target the ten years a part i we were convinced that he we were convinced for three or four years of our lives i think that he could actually turn into wewulf we would walk out of the house and the near this s and it literally stop you in your tracks an e just knew he was out there somewhere again hers dog we had a pasture in the back and it was about mig be half an acre and they go out clip to the back face an that is where they to sleep out this the perfect place for me to stalk i in the night you known snake out and and be the where wolf i mud on a just crawl out into the shuttles and and i could hear em out their talking and it'd be sneaking up to the bushes in might go r and the just it'd hear dead silence and then i her one on go doctor went off dog kept this up for years and they cans began to tread it whenever their parents went out knowing something scary what happens o in until finally it all came to ahead one night mike was eight years old the middle brothers were eleven and thirteen dog was eighteen it began the way usually did out in a pasture surrounded by potato fields here is dog we he a full moon which was wonderful an mi count o got tower the moon which was silhouetting me and they could not really see me and i i stuck a bunch weed down in my glasses there poking out all

growing hair i was completely a where wolfs o run for your life and and we all of course knew that the best thing to do was to get but if our sinking bags and run as fast as we could to the house because that was the the sher shelter what were you afraid that dug was getting do to you well is is sit the whole dead of being chased round in the dark and and it snow there was ever a lack of physical contact i mean he he u literally was was a situation to where you were scared for your life and we knew the dug was in between us and the house somewhere and a and as we were running to the house dug was just sitting on the run another a gargoyle position just it as still as is to night and just staring at us watching us and we just kind a slowly can ituswalk underneath him and ran into the house one now ism peeking in the windows i rattling the doors more ism trying to get in in the running from door t door travel lock all the doors up and i was always it on their heels as they as they got as they made it to the door and ism i made sure that i did not quite catch him you on me would running a slam the doors just at about the time they thought they were all safe i snuck over and

running a bit hotter around the same time that dug had his little siblings convinced he wanted their blood he got into a motorslichal accident that nearly killed him he broke every bone in his face one arm and one irreplaceable need cap the force of the crash made the helmet along with his scalp shoot off his head it took around three hundred and fifty stitches to sew him back up when i came

themselves this is baby sitting in is in corporate procedure and corporate language kids lying without adults are called unaccompanied miners little ones get brightly colored tags pin do their cots or hung from their next when you see him is hard not to feel bad for them i wonder whether gong to say about the experience some day when they grow up well bacon dismember of nineteen tight on remember twenty six divorced kids from all over the country got snowed in at o hair air port here in chico sudan burton was one of those kids now old enough to tell the tale she and her sister bets were travelling from colorado were their mom lived to michigan were they grown up and were their dead with here sudan there were two types of unaccompanied miners on flights out of denser divorce kids and stor kids you cults bought the swear kids because they always were something to prove they would been to colorado they had liftickets fanning out from the zippers of their jackets our baseball caps that s aid vail but since to day was to member twenty six we suspected that even the boy with the raccoon face tan the in you get from skigoggles was us a divorce kid too as soon as our flight left denar my thoughts turned to our lay over in chico bat see and i loved the o hair airport with a shiny food sort and chain book stores and big glassy tram ceiling it seemed a beautiful new mall when we landed in chico it was snowing snowing hard enough to set the airport down it was only the middle of the afternoon and travellers were ready reserving sleeping spaces by throwing or park as over blocks of cars even force space was care and some people were stuck alongside the moving walk way the mall had become a refuge camp the departure bore chair that our flight to grand wraps was cancel we went to a service desk were an get took our tickets and type things into er terminal then she turned on our microphone and send o critic message at over the pair i have two u ems at the service desk two u ems at the service desk o say the woman told us some ins coming by for you a second woman appeared and we fallowed her to a gray in marked door she fumbled with their keys i squeeze bet's hand the door opened on to a room packed with kids sitting on their winter jackets there were dozens of kids all kinds of kids some in small groups the young ones can burning with stuff animals others looking in comfortable in dresses or over heated in moon boots that had ben too big to pack most of them were facing a podium at the front of the room as if they would been dropped off at the public if pray and were waiting for reading by shell silversteen at the podium a steward put our names in list the woman standing next too was wearing the uniform of another airline it strange to see people from different airlines mixing almost something that should not be allowed there were a handful of folding chairs in the room and we found free one near the enter i took the see and better settled on the floor beside me she got her baby blanket out of her bag and began to sniff it it seemed we would never been around many divorced kids at once back home most kids had both parents you forget you were different and then you would be at someone is house after school and the dad would come home and from the landing on the staircase you would seem sorting through the mail talking to the mother in the kitchen it was hard to explain why this was sad as a result all that most of our friendsknew about our divorce was that my favorite video to rent was cramerverse's crater and bet's was the parent trap not was strange to her kids talking about the things we kept to ourselves a group near by was en gaged in a kind of divorced kid one upmanship the girl lying a sketcher with the christian tree patch said she saw her father only couple times a year e boy lying on a stomach can that he saw his dad even less they exchanged a series of anecdotes about stepmothers and took a pole who been the object of a custody battle it seemed in proper to talk freely about these things i ad no way of expressing these at the time it it felt we were part of something on a grants gale all these kids here in chico at the trains for point between mam and dad the being baby at by the airlines was a lot wat gut expect garaged started in and out consulting papers and making shushing noises and yelling out names from the podium hit seemed fluster anoint normally the baby sitting duties were small seal they were gotta shepherding kids along moving walkways and doling out little pin shaped wings in the u m room they were vested to the same crowd control techniques that they used in flight secure the doors with whole information and discourage people from getting up to used the bath room we did what any group book get up delayed passengers dos we started to generate our own information in the late evening a rumor filled to through the crowd that the reason some kids were being escorted away was that there parents from making up bigger fuss than the other parents where were those kids going the question arose from those of us in the landlocked middle and travelled through the crown the answer was transmitted back to us by our intelligence forces stationed at the podium those kids got hotels the rest of us would have to sleep her in the u m room e divorce kid real to his parents separation in one of two ways as the rumor about the sleeping arrangements spread it be came clear who was the divorced kid who avoided conflict and who was the divorced kid who acted out fart noises increased crush drink boxes began to litter the floor i realized that when groom with sufficient force a north ball could cause injury sooner word came around that the system had changed that our babies id has were mad and they did not care who your parents were or how many times they called now the were taking the good kids first immediately bets lay down on her blanket i took to the book in my back catcher in the my within an hour we were out of there by now it was one in the morning bets and i in a group of others followed a steward as through the dim halls the metal gates were down over the entrance to the food sort and travellers was sleeping in chairs we would chair room with two other people the first was a girl close to my age who was waring glasses with pink plastic frames i con minced myself that she was the same girl who been in my lane at swim camp years earlier when my parents were still married i did not ask her because i did not want a ruin it if it was not true the second person was a stewardess who looked about thirty she whereon a make up and she was big bones packed into her uniform she was not mean to us but she was pretty stand office we settled into our room when the stewardess went into the bathroom the swim camp girl pulled me over to the window curtains were closed but red light shown in from the parking at we you sleep in the bed with me in wont have to sleep but this stewards she said i looked over at based she was sitting on one of the two double beds in the room sniffing her blanket i told the girl yes it just came out antonintntinnalmost immediately i felt awful when we lay down i inch us far to the edge as i could s that i feel nearer to my sister on the edge of the fat a cross the isle the stewardess came to of the bath room where i control top stockings and a lacy slip and got under the covers that it'd never seen a grown woman sleeping anything other than e flannel lion i wondered if she always slept that or if it was just because she had to get up early maybe this was what all steward as us for under their uniform but maybe she just fell awkward i maybe there were rules about what you wore that you had to keep covered i maybe she just isn't want her bare legs near based ntoinintintint intine saw bats shiptandof the covers and curl into a ball i now felt certain that this was the worst thing it'd ever done to my sister i wanted the strangest removed in my family re stored ti hated this swim camp girl sleeping next to me she was not for michigan she don't have anything to do with my life on the strips to visit our father more than any other time o bet and i had was each other i thought of the kids in the u em room at the air port the one want crass things about the saddest thing that had ever happened in life and how reassuring it had been when i left at based sniffing her blanket the ways she always had the way i thought she wend for ever antininttisusan burton and the years since that story was

welcome to twenty twenty four there's one rule in america politics every one eventually gets what they deserve usually in the funniest possible way i want to show you my favorite picture of all time this picture is from after the twenty sixteen election when donate trump had just one the white house it is one of my favorite pictures ever drive my bite pictureever is a picture of donate trump giving the trump finger to the cameras holding up his finger he is talking the media yam and next to him is brock mama looking he wants to die because barokobama had a perception of himself that perception was that he was a world changing character who had changed the nature of america politics for ever that he was genteel in order a linconusk figure and in fact reflecting barockabo as feeling is a bust of graham lion in the corner of the picture down cast looking at the ground solemnly as donate trump holds up his finger to the camera why do i show you this picture because brock mama got exactly what he deserve in twenty sixteen here he was this supposed world historical figure is amazing order get tell snazzy and here was this supposed third rate realness state moral slash t v host who is taking his spot a person who would suggested the he was born in kinda every one gets what they deserve in politic illreclin got at that year as well while this year in twenty twenty four everyone is going to get what they deserve now that is both good news and bad news twenty twenty three fell the year of the set up and twenty twenty four is going to be the year of the punch line or a lot more darkly twenty twenty three eellike all the dominos have now been set up and twenty twenty four is going to see all the dominos fall watching coverage of new years eve who hard not to feel that all the curtains are about to be pulled back that we have been crappy by the warm up act the main show is about to begin now hovering over twenty twenty four is of course the twenty twenty four election and we can all feel the tension building i understand its canary second i understand there eleven months until the election then matter we can all feel the mention building up right and left now the left believes that donate trump is the most beatable republican candidate they are asking for exactly what they want they want trump and they could get trump good and hard they believe the best way to be trump is twofold first dulogenimize him as a human being say that he is a chest say that he is a threat democracy and second use the actual force of law against him the first part de humanizing trump is a human being suggesting that everyone who disagrees with you is part of an evil a agenda you could see the entertainment characters swing into action on the night of new years eve here were the morons over at green day singing their terrible song america idiot which somehow is categorized his piece music i do not know why and the lead singer for greedy has recently changed the learns in order to target the right here is the leading or greedy changing there once again on no pan of a magagenda now no one was really under the impression that greengage was part of the mama agenda but this is what is going to be now until lesson to get ready to be annoyed but it is not just that the left is also going you attempt to use all mechanisms of law to go after trump this is not just true of the various prosecutions tat are taking place across the country in georgia in new york in washington be see in florid it is also true when it comes to dealegitimization of institutions that could stop them from going after trump legally speaking over the course of last week and a half it turns out that in main they are also trying to take donate trump off the ballot in the same way that the supreme court of colorado took him off the ball and colorado suggesting that he was guilty of insurrection that is going to go tote supreme court the supreme court is then going to have to determine whether or not trump can be removed from the ballet simply because some state of facial believes that he has committed conn sort insurrection despite the fact that he is never been convicted or even charged with the crime of insurrection a part of this is an attempt to dealegitimize the supreme court itself because three of the justice is on the supreme sort repainted by donate trumping who president of the united states and now democrats are suggesting that basically every justice on the supreme court who trump either appointed or who was appointed by a republican ought to be recused from any case dealing with trumps access to the ballot therefore if trump is not remove from the ballot the supreme court is illegitimate here is jam gaskin doing this routine the congress person from martian should any epicastitis con south i ti tossup well an finally the supreme court has developed what they are describing as a cododathics it is not binding in the sense that they are not going to anyone else that couldhave gone to for exempt circuit court justice is you could con state supreme court justices on a panel but they are they are deciding for themselves again whether there invitation of the cododathics but i think anybody looking at this in any kind of dispassionate reasonable way would say if your wife was involved in the big lie in claiming that dona trumpadactionally one the president action had been agitating for that in participating in the events leading up to canary secs that you should not be participating e so he absolute shut recuse himself the question is what we do if he does not what is the goal of what rascal is saying here it is to dealegitimize the supreme court to dealagetimise clarence homes the left in pursuit of getting deal trump is going to suggest that if you vote for tonal trump its because you are fashions and also they are going to use all the mocha mechanisms o law to target donate trump which sounds in awful lot tyranny s the breaking all the systems meanwhile the right believes there is no way the donate trump or any one else can lose to jobidon hell many people on the right believe the donate true never lost to jobidon in the first place in twenty twenty we that is being reinforced by jobidons myriads grubs and clearly fating mental states to again new years eve all the starts to come to the forgive right away here is ran sea crest at the twenty twenty four new years eve bash asking jobidon about the new year as you look back and reflect on twenty twenty three what sort of of memory's a high light stand out for you e on the big highly stands out for mes why that yes to have expression s ay shoe a ops about a lo for the paten confectyour i is fours many people through the big west in an see the country e the factors er shipped tour sees t last cup of times out ane the list hop on face we pot a lot o trout of back to ears fate people a position at table make a lien now and the the crate a lot of dow for for tour and i guess when i back i i still good that the ma people got up they be throw out time of pan aby but now coming back get back oh rambling mac gamble face it is not going well for jobitan every time he we of a yo where oil is sitting next to job it feels you at a thanksgiving day event with your parents where mom or dad is starting to ramble and you just want to crawl into the earth that is what it feels every single time and that is every clip with jobiton join was asked bat his new year's resolution he went to saint cry for a bit of vacation because he is spent apparently something thirty seven percent of the past year at a get away spot why not and he is asked bout his lawyers resolution his here it here is his newyear's resolution jobidon did not share his new years resolution in at the corban yesterday o a reporters asked him as he came out of a fancy restaurant non heres for chose come back is your resolution to come back next year is that wit that wont do not i in to i to turning what it meats what is it will stay lot that very well may be the case now here is a thing if the let believesthey have to break all the instruments of government nor a stop trump and if the right believes that all of the instruments of government are broke in if somehow trumps loses well that is not a great set up for twenty t twenty four in fact either side can loos according to the latest polling don trump is up in the real clear politic pulling average by about two point four per cent the is well within any margin of error virtually all poles so heavy numbers of undecided voters at this point some poles so high percentages of third party possible votes why because we all note the selection is not realign to be about the candidates cause nothing is on a change by you perspective on the candidates it is the her being of twenty twenty four if it is trump and if it is bison we know these people down to the marrow of them no one has no opinion about trump no one has no opinion about cordon which means that this year is going to be largely about extraneous events and that is why jobitdon his unserious serious trouble why because as i say if all the bills are about to come do that is not just true for politicians in people that is also true on a wide variety of bad policy decisions that made over the course last several years all of those bills are going to come do will get to that in just one second first as we hade into this presidential election one thing you can be sure of twenty twenty four will be a wild ride you already see the impaxmenflation at pump at the grocery store that follow continues to lose buying power quicker than wages can increase how are you protecting your savings well you should consider diversifying with gold from birch gold group for decades gold has been the troicefin vectors and central banks to hedge against inflation easing inflation is cankered i have some questions about that gold can play a roll in diversifying your savings birch gold can help you create a well fought out and balanced in vestment strategy you'll help you convert in existing rat or four one cay into an grand gold without paying a penny out of pocket this month only when you open a gold i ray with birch gold you will get a free sign copy of my book the authoritarian moment but you need do test ben to ninety eight ninetyeight ninety eight to qualify birch gold has been the exclusive gold company of the daily wire for e past seven years that trivet might you can do the same ten ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight protect your savings claim your eligibility for free sign copy of my book the authority moment more relevant now than ever because it is upon us this authoritarian moment expend to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight to started with my friends over at birch gold to speaking of policies that are coming do according to c b s news just over the weekend you have emigration officials along the southern border are on track of process more than three hundred found migrants in remember that is in all time monthly high you will likening clue record numbers of families traveling with children according to internal government data obtained by s is new sulcegon it contain a munch people on terra matchless because it literally always does their bunch of young male particularly from the northern triangle but also from oversees from abroad who are invented ore going to be let into the country because this is the way we have done imagination policy in this country four years and it has greatly celebrated and masturbated under jobidon according s be news the extraordinary number of migrant rivals this month is the most did juncture yet of a three year long crisis of the of lexica bort three years long i wonder what happen about three years ago that is have an recollections in jane we canary twenty twenty one and oh yes when hoiden became president well that three or long crisis at the of lexica border has strained resources in small and large you us communities house for patrol agents of the pelican border are on course to take into comity this month a quarter of a million migrants who entered the country legally the college at official ports venture expected to process roughly fifty thousand new arrivals under a bide administration appointment system never ever have they process this many migrants ever the first twenty eight days of remember word patrolageons process nearly two hundred thirty five thousand migrant who crosse the southern border illegally in between ports of entry averaging roughly eighty four apprehensions every day that is an insane number and by the way this number is not shocking it is not shocking why because the is been happening consistently under the bind administration border patrol process one hundred and twenty seven thousand single don't migrants and nearly twelve thousand income panned children during deserter's first twentyeight days your member an accompany child is not necessarily in eight year old kid if could be a sixteen year old or a seventeen year old which is a minor but not quite what you thing on when you think accompany minor lie a for your old walking up to the border or something but again look at the acceleration in the pace of monthly migrant en counters at the us medical border it is absolutely wild you look at these numbers the this is from the put research center and as you can see there a relatively normal members an aril of twenty twenty they started to go up about then but they did not truly sky rocket until you hit they beginning of twenty twenty one until you hit the biding administration why l because hoiden basically sent the signal we got an open border and if you so up the border we will procession and the we will let you into the interior and we will leave you there which leads us by the way to the single greatest political stunt of all time without a doubt republican governors grew abbot ronnisantis in flora they started taking e legal emigrants in their states and the started sending them to left wing polities they started sending a bunch of you legal emigrants to chico to new york and to earth's vineyard and the entire media squawked and squeal it was who is a violation of humanities and no ne believe that because it turns out that being put on a jet to earth's vineyard it is pretty see deal most america would love to be on a jet to martha'svineyard towns pretty great actually most america are foundry visiting chico or new york here a legal emigrants wore being ship to america greatest city enters we have been told by the illustrious media and their allies in the democratic party and yet here they were complaining about all this who is absolutely terra and it exposed once and for all the reality of a legal emigration which as it is all fun and games when everybody's being released in brown's vile texts and taking over the streets over there and then being gradually integrated into red states but when this stuff is happening in blue cities suddenly you realize migrant crises they really bad again all the chickens can come home to roost in twenty twenty four and you can see it on the faces of democratic politicians parebegining to a heat second is the leal emigration policy maybe bad here is mayor branded johns of chico the man lory lightfoot explaining that by sending i legal emigrants from texts to chico grew abbot is sowing the seats of case which does raise the question how v those people get into texts in the first place with the also grew about away no texts is attempting to pass all right now tho criminalize the legal entry into texts is a state crime keep people could be arrested for that she texts could not force the border and the federal government is suing to stop them in the same way thy did when jam brewers governor of arizona and brokobomas administration actually so to jam brewers to stop her from enforcing emigration waw in arizonus the federal government has a policy the policy is we will not enforce federal emigration law and if you try to we will sue you but cannon johns that then inti blame grew abbot the try to blame to mantis tell try to blame republican governors the reason your having three hundred found legal entries into the united states in dismember alone is because of jobidon and the federal government here is mayor randan johns this is unsustainable o none of our local economies are opposition to beagle to carry on such a mission and what we have attempted to do of is decorate structure and some coronation around this this hemenitaryn crises d unfortunately of the governor of habit the governor ten us governor habit o is determined to continued needs of chaos and last night and in several nights before o a number of busses continued to arrive in the city of chico thought the country without any coronation well that sounds a little her races seeds o what seeds are we talking that are you saying that e legal emigration into a city sods seeds of cans is that we are saying mayor johns why it is almost as though there are lots of us whoa been saying that mask i legal entry across the southern border is bad and breaks down the social fabric and has tremendous cost both economically and socially to the united states are you he is lo to say it he is democrat and not just that he is know cotton color sand he certainly allowed to say that apparently but if a white republican sad that it would be races or alternatively is all the chickens coming home to roost in blue cities mare arc dams same thing in new york it it by way of e legal migration and he is li i do not even know how organ to pay for any this yow we know what again it is astonishing to me the new york city which costs itself as the financial hob not just of the united states of planet earth is saying we do not have the resources to pay fore legal migration yo probably does a ten thousand person town in south taxes here is mayor dams has there been any follow up what do you need most right now from the federal government well that fisfoea really command of my college abash to ma tan than the man chico obbecaus is national crises of is really impacting and it as the potential the staprilizin of the financial obligations that we have in our cities and the meeting with the white house i thing much more could be done and with all of our nationally us from a decompression strategy to make are the cuss of this is notation on naff everyday tax pas i an our city detectors in new york o people sleeping on the straits under america cross red cross blankets just insane in say again this is the cost a policy this is what happens in twenty twenty four is can be the year where all of it becomes perfectly clear not just by the way with regard to legal migration that just one of jobidan's bad policy decisions that is coming to fruition right now also with regard to the economy everybody is already whistling past the graveyard when it comes to the economy ah we have escaped to the procession a we have escaped a oppression well all we have done is we have turned the possibility of a brief shock in the economy tat would've hitbottam and then sky rocket tod back up basically into a long term stagnating cycle it s exactly wat happened under the atomic administration thou abominadministration had the slowest recovery from an economic crash in america history extremely slow rates economic stagnation and very migrates that is what you are about to see from the bide administration because much of the growth curve that has been created was created off the back of in stationary policies in government spending business is are starting to invest again but there starting to invest on the basis that they think that the federal reserve is going to cut the interest rates over the course of the next year making for another round of easy money policies the they think is going to spur consumer spending whish by the way could spur inflation again which is why there may be a disconnect between the markets and business is and what the federal reserves acturongan to do from panel nose that if he actually lowers the interstates there is good shot the inflation kick space in especially if you do have high levels of business spending into that economy willet in to that in just one moment first then over the course of the brave normally don't get alotisleep i slept pretty well why will i don't have to get up in the morning to do the shell but that also went that got to enjoy my relics sleep mattress have had my relics mattress for i do not know seven eight years at this point it is excellent it is

up greater sleep at aulic sleep got comsleshmen it is the best offer get us on can a last long that relic sleep dot comslesh been with relics better sleep starts right now gave sot when it comes to the economy one of the things that people are ignoring it is how much of the economic growth statistics are tide into government spending slice a finely has very good piece over at the waster journal and here is what she says she says drill into the nations three point seven per cents on employment rate you will find a growing welfare industrial complex beneath these seemingly stronglabor market government social assistance and health are account for fifty six per cents of the two point right million net new jobs over the past year and for nearly all gains in blue states new york and illinois remember government social assistance and health are hose are all government expenditure programs york city is spending three hundred ninety four dollars to day to house and feed every legal emigrant who coming in many and formally posh hotels the city has made itself a welfare magnet the homeless population continues to swell as well many of the statisticsthat we are seeing and from of g d p are joked by the amount of government spending that is currently happening right now spending on medicate has gone up if legal migration by the way in this view point actually helps the economy because if you are trying to increase g d p why you are you bring people in you spend a lot of government services on them and then you count that all as part of g t p government spending is part of the grows domestic product statistic thateverybody loves to use as only points out present bye more a minute but he has re publican states to thank for the increase in productive jobs in private industry the administrations bet is government spending on welfare and entitlements can continue to power the one labor market even as job wit a manufacturing tact rebel another industry flags but social make work projects do not improve america living standards and this is one of the disconnects you see many america who are unhappy wit the economy and democrats look in them is to was unhappy withe economy look at are an implement rate look the fact that we have god g t p statistics quarter on quarter in the answer is since jobidon took office the america dollar one dollar would buy you the same thing in canary twenty twenty one that will cost you almost to buck twenty to buy you now that is a real increase in how much things cost it means you need more money in order to buy the same exact things and all of those growth statistics that are being jog by government spending we understand that that icon come do on the other end in the form of either hire taxes or austerity programs there are eventually onto come do we have shrilling of dollars and in paid federal liabilities at this point this country those bills will come do as well the dis connect is between the staffs and how people feel and people are not wrong to feel the way that they do when things cost this much more money meanwhile in national security twenty twenty four is certainly the year that things are going to come do one of things has come to come do is the emptying out of the america military we do not have nog recruits for the america military and the entire style of recruiting for the america military is totally off if spent in the wrong places when it comes to the america military we still have most powerful military force on plan earth we still of the best fighting men and women in the business when it comes tote america military we shall be extraordinarily proud of the america military it is also true that the united states military has been turned into a v t i on clave by a lot of the military leadership particularly under the bide administration where the focus has been on how do we basically use the species of the single most important function of the federal government in order press ford are left windage end this is made clear over the course of last week by a trains lieutenant colonel named be from who now says at a fortune ink event dressed in the military uniform of a woman this demand says inclusion is a national security imperative as this is where we are putting our focus on the national security imperil imperative of making men who believe the women feel better about the fact that they are delusional inclusion is a national security imperative we fight to day and were no fight in the future fusing brain power and if that brain whose gin a revolutionize the way we fight and face we fight and sober just happens to be in a transport you should want them all serving alongside me and for your organizations it is the same way those perspectives that we get from a diverse tat of individuals it is been talked about on stage a lot regarding the science behind high performing teams we need those perspectives but it is inclusion that actually drives that we need more men who believe their women in theamerican militaries si the drones work or some such an all of this is connected to a broader mobile an military policy which is a policy of appeasement in retreat in many places or the very least a policy a vacillation and wavering my friend the historian nail ferguson he had a a fascinating thread at the end of the year where he talks about were america stands right now he says future historians are going to marvel at all this it'll seem obvious by twenty thirty three f not sooner that the packs a mericana at the idea of an america i germany dominating the globe faced a well coordinated challenge from china russia a run an north create in the early twenty twenties the first move as the invasion of you crane the second was the war of man's proxies against israel the third will most likely the a chines challenge to america premiss in the into pacific perhaps ifgusian pingsbold a blockade of titan if in the course of twenty twenty for crane's position becomes vulnerable that its forces must withdraw from some contested territory three immediate consequences will follow first more refuge hes will flow from you craned rope second privet investors will take their money out of you crane and third european governments will have to get a lot more series about their own defense spending with all the obvious political headaches that implies tornado is a hold at three point five per cent of g d on defense spending would require four hundred thirty one billion dollars more per year nearly twice the amount all countries have pledged to crane since last year the pack mariconna seems to be ending the fate of you crane of israel of titan hangs the balance i cannot say i am supply surprise he says ties always very likely the overreach of the global warn tear would be requited in the s way wit the resurgent of isolationism and that's what is happening inside the bi administration now the realist foreign policy the donaltrunt pursuit was not in fact in appeasement oriented foreign policy the idea that rope should pay its own way when it comes to military spending at the united states would still be a muscular player in the world was not a bat idea from dona true the idea of getting ridotto entirely was a bad idea but the idea then dato should a to be paid for by many of our allies was of course entirely true they relying on us for years to pay the freight when it came to their military spending the problem is jobidon came into office an his strategy has basically been to say broad thanes that do not materialized in the way that he would them to for example the crane war mobile never made clear what the exact interest was in new crane war let say the jobidon the very outset id tidlizen the interest in new crane is not reverse the games the russia made in twenty fourteen because those are not reversible at its point given the state of the war the the purpose is to repel any future russia invasion of you crane and we will provide military's support necessary to do that even in perpetuity wed be willing to do that wright now the broadscol perception russia would be the russia is losing the war because they did they tried to invade you crane they wast it did not work the united states through it is proxy in new crane was able to completely degrade the russia ability to make large scale war in new crane that is a victory for the united states and yet somehow it is turned into a loss why it as job never anticipated and never articulated what exactly his goal was instead he basely said zylensky will establish the goal over in neucrane and zylenky's goal is not the united states is goal zylensky's goal is repel russia from the don bass region from crime an yet push them out of all of those areas but that was never realistic that was never going to happen no matter how much military aid america provides unless the united states is killing to start sending over have sixteens if that is not going to happen there is no way to break the blockhead the strangle hold the russia has on those areas and right now ladmerputes waiting out jobidon it because republicans have correctly sad we need to know what the plan is here and hoiden is not articulating a plan now paten is simply waiting it out over the corse last week paten said that they are going to increase the strike son crane queen's bat all the way long here has been very simple ism an outlast the united states the history of russia war making is expend wag too much material and wag too many men in pursuit of a military goal because the history of russia military conquest says we do not really care very much outer on citizens and we are willing to throw hundreds of thousands in millions of people at a problem going a the way back to world wore one the ruffians were perfectly one to sacrifice millions and millions of people charging front the let blocked positions charging machine gun positions with no weapons the idea that they are going to expend lots and lot that section part of the russia military mentality the notion the hes can be pushed off the ball by jordan easily sings alenska can make the easier that that is not going to do it south is going to continue to ration up the pressure which is what he is doing russia leader f lain repent said moments to go that russia will increase it is air strikes you crane and the coning days weeks and months this come as you crane says that o less on the blocks coast came under assault from unman russia drops just hours into the new year one person i at least nine were injured and basically queen's betting that the west is simply on to give up on this and the reality is that because of fields failures particulate the goals and the strategies lest mainmast give up onucrane now if that happens it's much more likely the china is going to come ever more militant china is watching a west in retreat around the globe from powers that should not have the west in retreat for get out runs which is a newcleor arm power when you look in the in a least the fact that the west is being basically challenge by a bunch of rag tag pirates in the red sea is totally insane the fact that the west is somehow hand ringing over a democratic ally israel trying to destroy a terrors commons that is committed the worst act of of u murder sin s world war too and and what to sitting round hanging in what we do what we do how far should the israelisc china's watching all of that and they coffee it that is a west in retreat over the weekend you us navy sang three toothy boats that were tracking a merchantship in the red sea is goring to abisynews you us navy helicopters return fire and sank three small boats carrying worthy militants in the red see on sundae after you us worships responded to a descry distress call from a merchant vessel according to military officials a mayors containership these singapore flack hangs issued a distress called about six thirty a m local time according sent come the merchant vessels said four small boats were attacking it helicopters from two ships he usual eisenhauer and of as gravely responded issued verbal calls to the small boats according to u us officials now remember the bid administration demisted the soothes as a terrorist group when they came into power and right now you basic all have us military assets that are sitting out there and having to wait to blow up these tiny and eatables being driven by illiterate morons with badly program drops it is insane meanwhile iron is using the game heron's labor's worship has now entered the red sea according to the semi official tannic news agency and rioters tana i not give details on the labors mission they set baronial worships had been operating open waters to secure shipping roots combat piracy an care out other tests since two thous non there is the fear the on may be using its game meanwhile what is the mama and what is the began administration doing according toe jrusalempos a us aircraft carriers now being removed from this area as the challenges are being up against shipping in the red sea the us is removing the uses herald ford instead its heading out of the mediterranean to go ware exactly where else is there a massive s problem that requires the help of the of of this yours battleship what what why is the ford leaving no one exactly knows ran is using it is aggressiveness in this area and meanwhile the united states is with drawing an america aircraft carrier china is looking on and thinking to itself man were fools if given a current economic situation we do not make a move forth wanting all the bills are n to come do this year all the bills are to come do this yer and by the way it is only go to get worse if the united states continues to strain its relationship with israel over israel getting rid of an overtly evil terrorist group in a comas which is imbedded itself in civilian population forcing israel d sacrifice hundreds of its own soldiers and also if the united states says to israel the israel cannot clatter as ballad to protect its own citizens in the north in weakness is taken in world politics as a sign that you are ready to allow the badguises to win and china knows this which is why china is getting more aggressive according to the pastry journal chines leader's sign pang has now urged his countrymen to brace for more economic challenges in the ear ahead sounding a cautious note as a string of weak reading's highlights the many head wings face in the world's second largest economy is it on the path ahead wins and rains are the norm some companies our facing business pressures some people are running into difficulties finding jobs and in their daily living all of this could easily be the predict to the idea that the chines window is closing and they need to move and they need to move right now will jobidon is president as in this year

protestors in york city were chancing for the soothes phosam it should be noted at this point that you are chancing for the soothes you should summarily be exported from the united states if you are not a america citizen you have no right to be here you should leave anyway he who the slug by thewy is quote god is the greatest death to america death to israel a curse upon the news victory to his lam carat protestors in ferocity chancing in favor of thehoothes can can and make us praise little scopes turn another the chancing in favor of attacking ships arditli if they if anytelar a green card re vote the damned green card get out get out and barely there will be consequences to the political party that sized the side with the scrap if you are the democratic party and you decide that you cannot expel these people from your midst there should be political consequences to all of that protestors didn't u stop there they set off smoke boys on the brooking bridge last night just a making stuff an again any party that decides that they nan these people for allies to her every thing that against the bills are all then it come do the here here is one final bill that can a come do this year as well and i may come do today supposedly some of the list of people who visited destine island is going to come out to day quart filing's going to the daily mail set to be unseal may determine who exactly went to little saint names that is a jeffrey epstine's rape island according to the daily mail the jeffrey destine file such to be unsealed this week may finally reveal exactly how close that petiole was would say bill canton and whether ore not the former present in visited his private cabin island little saint names the files part of the defamation case virgin robots brought against island maxwell who is of course the procurer for jerry eosin could give fresh insight ins previous claims by robots that canton was on pettily island a claim later repeated it by canton's former aid dug and robots said she saw canton go off intone night with a beautiful woman on each arm which hum would be wildly in character for bill canton coin has adamantly denied over being on epstine's island robots mad no allegations of wrong doing my client nor is there any indication the sealed records contain evidence of legal conduct by the former president although of course there is a photo of client enjoying a neck manage from a jeuffrey destine victim in photographs obtained exclusively by the daily mail he is sitting and laughing as a woman named shanty davits then twenty too and who acted as epstine's personal mas us rubs his shoulders his why not man tat that is bill canton all over solid stuff there from the former president of the united states who else will be in epstine's files ill be fascinating to find out that is a bill that is going to come do and here is the thing if he will so all the institutions are broken all of them the moral institutions the let are supposed to lead us those people there broke as well in twenty twenty four on comes to the election somebody is going to lose that election all this is now being telescoped every bit of social disconnect every bit of social fracturing is being telescoped into the twenty twenty four election and some one is going win and some one is going to lose and when that happens all hell is likely to break loose no matter who wins or who loses things ire can to get really super ugly and that is a consequence of the lies thathave ben told for years those lies of eventually come do when you lie people eventually feel the consequences of that lie both sides in america right now promise the moon and neither side actually acknowledges reality here just some more realities the can slapping us in the face over and over and over again america enemies are not simply gan a stop because we decide withdraw from the world at for sing on form policy which one from the world is not a solution it just gets worse the world becomes a worst place technology is not going to stop developing just because a politician promises you it will and redistribution's is not going to be and mechanism for fixing any of that government is not the solution to life's unfairness far more often it is the cause of life's unfairness we cannot keep spending endless amounts of money never distribution's is not an us alive for lack of productivity if you think the bills gun come down twenty tony for its can a keep coming to because bills always come do we have been living in the after math of the industrial era in which the united states had massive imbedded advantages over the rest of the world due to the rest the world basely collapsing during the world for to and the united states jetted far ahead of everybody else and then we live fat on the land and it turns out that we under cut our own moral credibility by getting rid of all the intermediate social institutions e got rid churches we got rid families an we decided we could be atomistic individuals who did notion have to developed their own skills because we are fat and we are happy then if all that was bad o borrow tell have government fix all of our problems the bill comes do on that stuff america have put our failure to recognize reality on the credicard for generations for generations do not wore t willalways being pay for later hell twenty twenty four might be the year that we pay for it it might be the year that we pay for it as we are always going to ay for to gunpoint now meanwhile it is fascinating to watch as the republican primaries play out right now if you look to polling data dona trump is well ahead in literally every state in iota the latest results from the polling data have dona trump up over his opposition by a significant margin the real for politics pulling average and i has donate trump leading his opponents by up to thirty points the new samphire primaries trump is leading his opponents bi upwards of twenty points if trump win to iota it may as well be all over but the crine now remember was caucus state the primaries taking place on the fifteenth of this month we now have about now a little under two weeks before the i carcass it is quite possible that the pulling results from i ore not can be reflect of the actual results because again it is very weird system the way the i carcass work is that if your first choice does not make the run off then you can switch to your second choice let us yo vote for nick hale and nick haliisns in the top to its trump for sisantis you get your second choice than flips into play if you voted for kalian then to cantus for example then your vote would move from one to the other in terms of top result there is there is such weirdness's to the coxes that do not really exist with regard to the other primaries suffice it to say that if trump wins the eyes coxes it is very difficult to see how exactly he does not win in new samphire particularly because nickel hale has been making simbooboos and because cries christy is still in the race it is astonishing to me that chis christy continues to stick around christen new new who is the governor of new samphire who is backing nickel hale he says this christened in this race ism confused nickel hale is the first fall minority governor in the country's history she is one that stood up and insisted did not take compromises insisted that the confederate flag every move for the state house lawn i do nothing any one's questioning a her credibility in credentials when it comes to race an equity in the quality in this country folks understand that they know it she is about it it is anon issue cries charity's a friend but his race is that an absolute and he is get to say anything in can this or two person race fright it is between trump and nickel hale everybody understands that he knows his voters who wannest trunk defeated are all coming over to nickel hale a in fact the only person that wants chis christy to stay in the race is dona true right i ma think about the irony of that the fact that he crises out their trying to attack or trying to make ways that that is not surprising again there these primaries by the polling get up and pulls an elections there not particularly competitive at this plaint the fact the chis christy is staying in he has no shot of the nomination whatsoever is insane if he actually does not down trumpet he says he does not standing in new samphire makes no sense at all but cries christy is such a creature of ego it is absolve astonishing over the course last week nickel valley came in for some serious criticism while we are off the air because shows asked about the causes of the civil war and she gave this answer thank you maser any es what was the cause of the united states civil war well do not come with an easy cuestionan and the i think the cause of the civil war was basically how government was going a run the freedoms an what people could could not do what do you think the cause of the civil war was and now shows racked up and down for this now cause the civil war was indeed slavery although at hebegining of e civil war wlincoln said was not slavery an lincoln did openly say tobogganing the civil war there was about the retaining the union of the country and that if he could retain the union of the country by retaining slavery he would do it slavery was the underlying issue that drove a wadge into the middle of the union obviously and that is why you had the confederate states that we proslavery and the northern states that were not pot slavery and the civil war effectively ended with the abolition of slavery with that said when nicely hale is saying is second daily correct that you did have an argument the was taking place or retie powers the federal government for the power of state governments and in which graham lincoln made the case that the declaration of independence is guaranteed of life liberty and the pursue of happiness ought to be extended to everyone who lived in the united states and should be a citizen of the united states including of course we lack america but this provided an opening for everybody to attack nick hale whichwas a booboo that she could really not afford she did clarify her statement's little belated hers what head to say you know have done a hundred and fifty town halls more than that now and we sake every hand we answer every question and i stay until the last person laves and we take questions from everybody republicans democrats an a pen it who ever shows up we do not strain them we let them at whatever they want and we had a question there and yes of course the first thing i should have said with slavery i completely angry with that and when you grow up in the south slavery is a given when you think of the evil for it was about slavery that is not a o that is never been in question and a do not you look a fact ism a southern governor who actually at and got the confederate quite to come down in front of the state hold it again the fact that she had to defend herself on this the desinnra believe that like halves prove slavery does not understand the similar of course not e sort of weird questions and the it does mean gin give bad answer there she would give bad answer there as she had a clarify but is any of this con a matter at all probably not other thingsthat do not matter anything dona true censor dos my is ben the entire dynamic o the primaries is that no matter what trump does and i think is one of the reasons why for example to cantos supporters are almost beside themselves because there saying we are more con sedative than every thing donate true says he is for and yet no one seems to care the big case of that over the course of the last week is that donate trump has been calling for the d funding of the fibs the pi of course has been militarized against him in a wide variety of ways well he then said that he wanted a new up headquarters in washington d c he put out a statements and quit the fa headquarter should not be moved a faraway location but should say right where it is and a new spectacular building in the best location on are now crime written and filthy dirty graft scarred capital they should be involved in bringing back you see not running away from it especially the violent crime there is talk about moving it outside of washington d c fellow republicans are what that hell my are not you t one has ben railing against the f big governor do sans is see dona trump failed to drain the swamps or perhaps it is not surprising that he is seeking to deep in the swamp by building a mass wo no bi building in d c actually draining the swamp requires taking power out of d we not commencing power inside d c now what would that said as that can have any impact on trump of course not is son can have t any impact on true this why say that one comes to the went twenty for election basically only exogenous circumstances are going to change how the election got eon has the opinion trump bases the opinion biding that can it is what it is o at i would be remiss if i did not comment at the beginning of this year on a couple of new laws to take effect in my old home state of californium i got a say the due e state in america truly in idiotic state or least governed by idiots californium has now announced that they have gender neutral toy isles man died in law son aliform if you open the two shop you must have a gender neutral toy isle the law which w rent to into effect on money sums from a twenty twenty one bill and the californium legislature acquiring toy retailers with a physical location in the state and at least five hundred employee to maintain a gender neutral section or area to be labelled at the discretion of the retailer californium assembly member evonlows had who as inspired to introduce this bill by an eightyeral girl who asked why should a store tell me what a girls shirt or this a first ovolo would never be inspire by anything child us just con telling not not to make political action anyway and inspired by my children all the time their wonder at the world i am not inspired by their generalized wisdom because they are children that is stupid an my candent questions a the time the answer to why should stor tell me what a girls shirt or a toy is is the marketing people at the company are seeking to make a clear to parents where they can go for the quickest access to say a doll or a nerd gun that is why does at mean you cannot got a gift for your daughter from the boy toys and does not mean the opposite but by and large my son legs nerd guns and footballs and my daughters girly things because boys and girls are real things that exist in the world the fact that californium is now man dating this nonsense is ridicules by the way of course the just targeting the agreed trailers if you are small toy store they understand that we look really bad s get mom and pops toy shop because they have a girl isle with dolls and a boy a footballs her bill will help children express themselves freely in without bites we need to let kids be kidskin low for it swell these is are chopping for themselves they eight my kit is democratic cart is yours if you are doing it wrong it is weird am with them stores failing to comply with the new law could be subjected to a two under fifty alipenalty for the first violation and up to five hundred boy for subsequent in fraction according to the bill text out one we should all have compassion for individuals experiencing gender is fora said califate a californium family council present jonthan killer but actives and state legislators have no right to forgery trailers to spouse government approve messages about sexuality in gender bathe one o the great things about supposed gender neutral districts an areas did they very often tend to exactor bate exactly the gender differentiation that is reality if you go to the aortic countries for example an all sorts of social welfare programs tat are designed to alleviates the differences between men and women and women because of all those welfare programs tend to go into field that women to go into and men tend to go into engineering and sat as not the only stupid californium law going into effect a new californium law ill also crate emergency alert system called an ebony alert what exactly in agony alert it is a new kind of alert for an a black youth or young black woman is reported missing under unexplained or suspicious circumstances why exactly do you need an ebony alert as opposed to just an amber alert because apparently apparently nothing tere'sthat there the is no actual rational other than the suggestion that black people are being treated in discriminatory fashion by the liberal lets which is just insane californium worlds durmast area no wonder they want avenuesome to run for president ardiguies the rest of the show continues right now you are not going to want to miss it we will get to an interesting debate between bill mar and seuthmac farming of family guy fame on vaccination if

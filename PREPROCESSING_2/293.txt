save and how every one at any age just capable of change and that is exactly what my dad needed some one to give him a chance the book offered simple advice as a man learns to listen and interpret a woman's feelings communication becomes easier if he becomes very frustrated by listening he should not try to continue instead the respectful thing to say it i really want to hear what you are saying

worrying about them and holding their hands they were heading straight back in to the misery they would worked hard to leave behind but it turns out we were wrong they traded their unhappy eonian marriage for happy america one when you think about america relationships you think about the divorces the self help books the constant talking about feelings and even though all of that seems undignified and laughable it is all working for my parents now i can see my dad struggling to keep his tempera check he thinks about hurting my mom now about embarrassing her in a way he never did before i see them laugh with each other and talked to each other it is to be nervous around them becausethe atmosphere a tent now they actually seemed to each other and for a long time i attributed everything to my father's change he learned to control his temper and now they are happy ut that is not the way they see it divorce i thinks change we noble than well the lot they we i had in ow enough probably my life did he was an because of it when two years i bacon and i a was to is not here i steel have is problem he i do not she lies because not because of is not him his me living on our own allowed my mother to see my father the way he would always seen her it is a choice she wanted to make and now she says she loves him for the first time in her life o ma everybody agrees that if they would stayed any wrong none of this would have happened not the heart break not the new found compatibility this is my sister neilafar the west did break them up and n they had the freedom to get back together yet i was not we had this such a weirdly and kind of such an america experience all of a sudden in the middle and i do not know what even that means except that except that my parents god divorced and then they talked about their feelings hen they both went the therapy and my dad read men are from mars women are from venue and we we talk to my dad about relationships and they started he started dating and i was just like i feel we had this family the crazy family on the block who dish put up christian likes the nod a medical crazy family wit the call in all of our lives and ten all of a sudden my parents turned all america and ad is america experience and now we are this little happy family and it e cant grows me o too cause a i as is not where we fit he know this is not our family be not i i think it is great i lot it feels really normal and good now ism still struggling with normal and good when you thought about your life as some slightly depressing

at an auction he never seen a bull tame his kids would climb all over chance chance would nuzzle up to alphas wife sander and lean his head it it really is having a pat dog or patcanta stand besides but the seems much less demonstrative wrong that that is wrong what a nowt frogman sand would agree with this but think everything they went bad all the trouble that eventually unfolded it all came is they were blinded by their feelings with ha worlds largest tattoo saddle broke take techs long horns and brogans fishers pot of animals a sure to bye crop pleas or your corporate gathering convention

point shot saviour rout had this really sweet situation they got to work side by side with all these animals which they gloved chance was tame the he was allowed out of the pasture never had favorite spot in the front yard under the trees sander would watch him from the kitchen window ice was really nice feeling be downing the dishes you look out and there is your tame pe bull ordinand laying on the grass then a any dance of member chance did not coming from the pasture was handcar went looking for him finally ran had out to the pasture andfound him dead he is nineteen which is really old for a bull here was a really a sad day to took the came out out an take some pictures an an us at well he deserves more than that i scanned him a skinned his whole body it took me all day t was raining it was a really sad time it'd skin a while cry while i would just a baby just crown a baby o to i my not feel skin en him am going well somebody has to do this and it'd have to toughen up and re group and this lasted all day long i guess i was a complete wreck or by the time was all over with you says he had no choice he had to skin hm in the first twenty for hours cause he wanted to get him tanager made turn him into a full sized bromic statue have around forever i people could step let the picture take him with him chance could stay in the family business i was emotional everything was really emotional and all the family had a good crap to all to kids in the people who knew him long they all just hated that ora re wine three months before all that happened romp heard about this way that he might be able to cheat death with chance and keep him around is moreen taxidermy it was a real long shot some one call me and said we have red and art when the paper that and am was going to clone an animal we man confess and clone make one from another i it out no cannot be an am is texts say am w famous veterinary school and animal hospital this happens to be an hour and a half drive from raft's house his chance is regular hospital and we called up and said you going to closed an animal right as a yest weld take tissueand we might and we w want you use chance and wand other folks would call the some friends who call and talk to him and and they kindly just i think we boy the i much they gave up as it do say well would do it the ne and scientist dis coded cone chance for simple reason he was old there is some things they thought they might find out by cloning an older animal e chance was there anyway getting a mole by obscure for disease he clients could use the dealate from the mole to do their warning in taxer too night a man he is wite adder bull a the reunited i guess he is been rein created can once and eighteen days if she chance died e longship paid off a clone was born the first clone bull his huge news there as rape if you get out what to call chances con second chance and he was just the prettiest little white lit wite bromic caff he ever saw in speedily an barely able to stain i thought it was the me animal i would say you in ell we going bag that that is the first head land i thinking the the clippings when they interviewed me we got him back a the the vetidain am at ask us a are kitted with us about whether the calf was going to recognizes on stall in the barn we we got him home but we sort of blue that off well the the first day we brought him home we do we turn him loose over here in the yard he goes over lays day water lay down in the same spot the steel to chokes me up he lay down the same spot that chance lain it that is not reasonable when at i was spooky that was spooky anything hie notisrader way with second chance is that he has chance is same mannerisms when he eats an usual manners instead of putting his head into a feet bucket holding it down there chewing into this no more food but chance he second chance raise your heads close er eyes too have never seen another animal do that ice never seen another and will do that there is something else about second chance something harder to quantified i just feel he always recognize trial fissure ah and rape would lay down on the ground and second chance would lick him and lick his boots and second chance would lop across the pasture and come to us a and we watched other people that would crawlinnearand he would not would not come across the pasture to them he just always seem to recognize rape and what did you think did you think somehow his memory got transferred well no i still do not think that i think that he just has the same instincts the same did he is get to make the same choices why would the eating thing be the same a clone is a kin to a genetic identical twin is not the same animals not chance actor my westuson is one of the scientist who runs to reprodictov science as lad be take i sand am but have the con second chance he says it because a con is just a twin on then more nothing less it may not even look the same as the original just twins constant necessarily act the originals either the doctor westuion understands how rather sander might not see it that way well people din attached to their animals and that and they want to sometimes see more than then's there and they do see more than is may me really there and that is not necessarily a bad thing i mean that like that is over it there yet that is lot that is not need scarily a bad thing and and it was interesting for me to listen to rape tall he lies under the same tree and he eats his food just the same as the all chance did and u that is fly o ralphhe o that i just all his blood look us to day interested in that in doctor was turn reminded me several times is is not the same animal do not expect a pit the same same attitude for a pit and i didn't believhim because ever thing looked the same you just when i seem especially at a distance he look much chance and every day as he is all gets older and older much e he even second chance is birthday rape in sander wit do a party for him fires and barbertul would you e thing about it would be disturbing for the guest of honor if only he knew he may what it is worth birth day ill the family and friends and neighbors came tote front yard poster pictures a second chance we had his birth day can which is a big feed tub with e no candles on top and we blew the candles to an and i said that is about dark i think o lee e back to the barn i put one finger in o and his noseryng which is a common thing it gives you close contacting if they making any aggression you can merely feel it and you no respond in i was walking him we just did a few steps out of the yard and i had toe leave rope in the other hand we just took a few steps and and bloom caught me with his horn and slam me down and wit that is when he dislocate in my shoulder he me in the back i was i mob on that made he pick me up in shslamm me down you say and any proceeded to you on top of me with his you his mostly his had his forehead in his horns oh we found three deep deep whole six or eight inches in the yard the next day where he had missed me and he was he was really trying he was really attacking it was was on purpose oh no have a o no this canopy if this cannot be happening because we had had much faith in him an you know just i did had at that time always hanging about was yew why a you doing this what why and i was i just disappointed the whole time i rememberwhent i was kicking him in the face oi just going how can you doing this to me quit it i think my feelings my o he actually hurt my pride since he tack top acknowledges scan chance is not the same animal as chance he believes that he definitely believes it when you love you see what you want to sin everybody knows that i part o him still held that hope hoe that even as second chance is not chance right now he turn into chance the still get the reunion wit a hope is involving his age es since i did not have chance when he was until he was seven you almost seven years o i do not really know how second chance is supposed to act a you enough chance was just this back in the day right right he might just have to go the stage and settle down i know horse is settled down my taxis long horns settled down to cerumen thinks have been really wondering about your situation is i wonder if having second chance around all the time is every painful for you cause it reminds you that you do not have chance it is here you have this ghost of your favorite animal walking the property who is not exactly chance and if it just come breaks your hartlittle bit no sir just the ops it your just exactly as wrong as you can be far right now feel we have gotten about ninety five per sent of him back i mean the same quality is the same fun that satisfies me that is better than zero when he was laying out in that pastrami there did he was a zero me we would never have any enjoyment out of him any more and there is a tremendous difference between zero and ninety five per cent ye people want to believe it is resurrection sometimes and and it is in fact not resurrection is just itstree production is bad news tutor westucion is had to delivered to a lot

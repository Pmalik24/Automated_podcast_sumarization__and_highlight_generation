happened when somebody takes your family throws it up in the air a deck of cards an thebe be easy chico its this america life om maker glass we averting the full hour to day to what happened to these two families take auburn is the reporter and before he starts just hop you keep everybody straight in this story a quick overview of the two families the millers are the bespectacled dark haired one from the letter miss miller's husband the reverend orbit miller was not even helical preacher the voted to the church and they were a bookish serious bunch tissue house with a lot of rules and there were a lot of kids too seven kids in all the my donates are the lighthaired one from the letter and is a much smaller family just two kids and the feeling in the house is very different from the feeling in the miller's house they were easy going quick to laugh and joke ground mister my dona ran a tenia re airship in town here shake lowborn it was the four women at the center of all this the two mobs in the two daughters who were affected more than any one it is take them one by one starting with sue missus miller's baby it was raised by the my donates before the letter arrived the facts of she's life had seems pretty orderly she was a married mother of three living in michigan her husband worked as a chemists she was close to her mother she called and visited her parents regularly she also had an older brother bob named after their death twas all pretty straight forward and yes sue was different from the rest of the family in certain ways dark and tall and skinny in a family that was none of those and a pretty light hearted a household she was nervous studious serious but at did not seem strange in junior high i remember my friend said to me you must be adopted because you do not look at all your parents and i said i do not know i asked my mother i said at my adopted and she said oh no no she says i was dragnet and you are my child i wanted a baby an and you are my baby you were not adopted that that con minced you oh ya that was not of i mean she that was right my mams at all well you just take after great grandpa the sir and one safer then i just forgot about the whole thing years later when she got the letter that told her the truth she was stunned and she knew she had to break the news to the my donates had raised her but she didn't call them right away mister my donate had a bad heart and she did not know what the street would do to him first she wanted to be absolutely sure it was true bloodiest were done with the millers and they proved missus miller was right about the switch weeks went by and sue began to fret she wrote letters o her parents but did not send them she worried her mother might reject her sue knew her mother had never been a big fan of the millers ever since they met and now suddenly e turned out sue was one of them it was confusing and then after i knew that they were that i had been switched and that i had different jane and my parents kept talking about these people that were odd the millers because they reverend miller he is not even helical preacher he wants people to know jess christy and that they would be saved and and ism really that too sometimes my mom thinks ism a little fanatical ism really a miller what does she think of me idea that is my biological family i i did think o she is she is going know that is not my daughter and she is going and she is going to get this popular party who is fun loving and and looks her and then she is going to say w i do not need that daughter any for she is part of that odd family a month after she got the letter so went to see her biological mother and father this sis videotape of that first meeting a axis not e o that i is his ye her my her right there she looks happy never miller was affectionate with her putting his arm around her was everybody smiling so know had four new sisters and two new brothers and the miller show her pictures of her other relatives he's rose to i i might a organ we way for gat born tool o there is a lot of nervous laughter and there are some awkward moments when sue talks to miss miller about the fact that she never got enough breastmilk as a baby my mono r i but over all the millers seemed giddy that their daughter is finally come home and sue seems eager to know them air lo i hero later that same day sue drove to the my donates to the parent she grown up with after dinner she sat down and told them about missus miller's letter told him point blank she was not their child at first they refused to believe her but then she told him about the blood tests finally sue handed over all the letters that she had not sent them in the past month letters telling them how much she loved them and how much she wanted to stay their daughter and my dad said you are my child i changed your diner and my mother she nothing was going to be different between us but it was just it took a while for us to how are you going to think missus miller has for forty three years been longing to see her the child shed given birth to u she is excited about it and my mother's what happened to my life it exploded one sings come down sue came to to conclusions one she was not going to become a strange from her mother and too it was her brother she might lose my name is pi my donate and i am sixty one yetis sold i would say the don is sue and i were probably not that class am for whatever reason the reason was pretty simple actually they have almost nothing in common bob as for and a half years older than sue a sweet jovial guy who never got along with his broody little sister and when bob found out about party found out that she was his biological sister he called her right away in californium when she got on the phone i was just totally blown away ah the way she pronounced her words were identical with the way my mother talked she could have been my aunt er my mother talking on the pan i knew that she had to be my sister and i was esuperanxious to to me her an the in person an then until that timely just talked all a time with every hon con that we mad in on we open tat or teach other n and we had the same personality and west to think much alike my brother and party are just thick as thieves in what seems and when ever party comes to my home town she stays with my brother and they stopped tall awol all ours to the night talking for sue her brothers enthusiasm for party brought out every insecurity she suffered as a school girl she did not fit in she did not have the social leave that came naturally to bob and party he was popular and i was not i was a serious person nobody would dance with me at the dances and i i want he had a band i mean i was shy or i was whatever and i wanted to be a cheer later i tried out for cheering i just could not do it i did not get picked as hears went by when there were family events with everyone sue would get anxious if party was there too occasionally she would break down in cry i remember at the wedding when my nephew got married my brother danced with everybody he dance with party and you can see thar was haven much for and laughing to other and and just dancing away and then he dance with my cousin he danced with my mother he danced wither he did not dance with me and here i am you knock or ma ten her gaining not what he dance with with me no what's it was bad but the bed good part about that was when i got home from the wedding and my brother called me and he said at i did not even dance with found i said who told you to a he did no i to but it just brought up feelings that youfeel commit again and because i wonder what is gin happen when my parents are gone is my brother get a care to even see me any more this brings us to party the other baby in this baby switch for she found out the truth about who her mother really was party's life was not all that different from sues party was also marry also had three kids she is also moved out of wisconsin in her case to southern californium she is also religious sue but that is pretty much where it ends party worked all of her dust life and still does as a nurse she grew up as the six child in a family of seven kids besides her there was many media faith ruth sunny like and ester her mother rant a disciplined household everyone had to work she remembers washing and drawing all the dishes by the time she was five or six there was not much money around the five girls shared one bedroom the church was the center of their lives and the family never went on vacation or even to the moves instead they were all taught to paint and courage play music though party stuck out in her family for one thing she was the only one who joked around she says even now the millers cannot tell when she is being ironic ad the there was the blondness in the perkiness in the socializing party say she felt everything she was interested in was lost on her parents i do not think that they ever came to watch me sher and again that was not something that they would have done cause athletics was really not a value to them at all i was just not ever meeting their expectation of intellectualism and my mother has told me since then you i really did not expect that much from me because i knew that you were not or child that was a hard thing here incredibly when party was twenty one years old some one actually told her that she might not be a miller one of her older sisters ruth came to visit with her husband rude rude had a couple of years and after dinner he got to talking and he started asking me what i knew about the my donates and i really did not know anything about the my dona's and then he told me that i looked them and he said what would you do if i told you that they were your parents and i i was kind of stoned it was the first i had ever heard anything about it and he did in fact ay some hurtful things does he told me i do not care what anybody says from as far as ism concerned you are not really truth's sister i thought it was just rude been rude he just has crazy ideas and he dreams these things up i was just horrified and and he did not tell me a had a time he just came out with it that is ruth she and faith an many lady a the older girls had sort always known about the possibility that party was not their biological sister couple of them including ruth had vague memories of their parents talking about it after they brought party home from the hospital about how this baby looked different for missus miller's other babies and that maybe this baby had been switched then when ruth was about sixteen her older sister faith came home from a trip on a mississippi river boat and told ruth head seen so my donate on the boat and that she looked an awful lot them the decided that ruth ought to have a look too the two girls cooked of a re connistan's mission on one sundae they got their boy friends o drive thesis seventeen miles away to the mcdonald's church and prairie to scene ruth sat down in a up nor the front next to faith wright before the service began she says there is sue walking down the center lie and know i i thought she even walks many i ways i was just you will well that could be that could be herd that could be my sister and yet i think it might be and at any pointing this time does a creation am well won't we just asked mammandat about this now that is not how their family work it just did not talk about these kinds of things and as ruth and faith saw it it was not their place to messing their parents affairs which was why when her husband rude blurted it out a few years later ruth was shocked and party refused to believe it at that point she denied she says oh now now that is not trip then i thought well o hate and it is not bad if she e she believe she is my sister and that is got the next week though when party was visiting their mam missus miller she asked her about what rude had said missus miller gave her a non committee answer saying that once upon a time they thought that maybe perhaps it might have but even if it did happen there was no way to prove it that was that over the years a thought that she might be someone ease's child festered in the back of party's mind and much later when she was in her midthirties she decided to get to the bottom of it she was working for a group of pediatricians which included a janettic counsellor she told the council her story and said she wanted to get blood test done the council asked her what the macdonalds knew about all this i said i do not think they know anything about it she said well if you were to find out that that these parents that you have are not your parents and the other family does not want to have anything to do with you how were you gin a feel and i said well i do not know i do not have any idea and she said you really need to consider how that is going to change your family for you and how it is going to change relationships for you she said unless there is a real i have reason that you need to know sat i do not recommend that you dig in to it that is sort of spooked party she left it alone that is what might have ended if it had not been for missus miller's letter at decade later it is hard enough to learn that your mother is not your mother but it is even harder when that news is delivered by some one missus miller tact is in her strong suit in fact she seemed to have it tinker for the whole thing for starters missus killer did not contact party ensue at the same time she first sent the letter to sue my donate the daughter she barely knew and then waited almost two weeks before mailing the letter to party the daughter she would raised she said she wanted to call party first but never managed to reach her as result party got word about one of the most basic facts of her life second hand all the while waiting to hear directly from her mother and in the meantime i had got phone calls from people i did not even know that were telling me hey ism your brother hey i was switch t that worth with you when she finally heard for missus miller the mother she would grown up with not only did she get the letter but missus miller had just been to the fiftieth anniversary party of the mac donates party's biological parents and she took a one of the programs from it and she mailed it to me and basically and this is gun son kind of a small thing but it was a big thing to me she circled the names of people that were participating in the programmed my one of my uncles on the birthside early genzallas she circled his name and she wrote this is your uncle and she circled my brothers in name and this is your brother bob and case she would circle their names and say these re your parents and you know am reading this thing going what do you mean these ere my this is my uncle this is my brother this is my mam and dad this is not my my family i not even know who they are and i took that as a o ka ism saying as of right now you are not our kid you are their kid you are in their family party says her mam missus miller she is the world in black and white she focus on the facts o the situation maybe hoping she could fix things by simply setting the record straight she was not malicious she was not trying to be hurtful after all those years she was just tired of secrets and now she wanted every one's roll to be clear but was hard marry says to be on the receiving end of this sudden adamant truth telly there were a few years there where every chance my mother got she made it perfectly clear that i was a mac donate for the longest time whenever she would write to me she would include my donate in my name my cot are he serious just absolutely bazaar things that she she that is just how she is she am there is no great area actually my mother wanted to i god at court and have my name legally changed back to soon mac donate and have she's name changed that was her idea it is kind of she tells me that this is you are you are my daughter and but at the same time she says when she refers to say she says well your mother am is doing such and such your mother said this and when i think of my mother i think of her during this time it was lady's at reverend miller who reassured her the started talking on the phone lot he explained things why all those years ago he refused to return to the hospital and switch back the babies and he let marry know that he still loved her he did not i not her to push me out of the family he was he in fact would call me and tell me i do not care what she says you still our kid and ism glad we had you did you feel that then after this happened a little bit closer your dad than your mam yes yet definitely at that point my dad had this verandas guilt because he felt it was all his fault that he should have believed my mother for all those years and he just i think he honestly never thought it was a possibility he thought she really dreamed this up in her head and just got obsessed with it and the other thing was that he really thought what difference does it may a child is a child she is with us she is ours now the other palm from marry just how to approach mac donates her biological parents the were nice enough when she spoke to them on the phone but they were not exactly welcoming her into the family i remember talking to mother about this is your blood daughter here is not mac donate who remember was having these great home calls with his new found sister this is the daughter that actually was in you and hat i mean i understand you did not raise here but she is her blood you biological dauber i and dam i do not know that i she was as excited about it as i was and i could not figure that out at the time she was guarded there were ice enough when she spoke to them on the phone but they were not exactly welcoming her into the family from lady's perspective h genetic counsellors prediction from yours before seemed to becoming true i felt she was losing both her mothers party wrote a letter to ka and bob mac donate her biological parents i want you to know that i will except whatever contact you choose to have with me even if it is none at all i promise you it'll never try to make you think of me as your daughter i know that she's your daughter and no one could ever expect you to feel otherwise party eventually decided that the only way she was going to resolve this was by getting on a plan and flying out to is cousin to meet the mac dona's face to face give them a real chance to get to know her to get together at robin came mac dona's house did not go exactly as she wanted from the mac dona's perspective party looked and acted remarkably a mac donate she got a long famously with their son bob she have had the exact same oil painting hanging on her wall in californium as they had in their living room a landscape with trees and water but sue was the girl they had brought up and they felt loyal to her protective i kind of felt the like woman ka ore kind of keeping me in an arm's distance because they ware not really sir how they felt or wanted to feel and i do not think sue had that since in fact that is true maybe because some of the miller girls had suspected that she was the sister for decades and because missus miller always knew the truth sue was being embraced completely by the miller clan and well sued feared everyone would choose party the outgoing curly to rover her it did not work out that way here is martin in fact it was the exact opposite she had both families wanting to make her that she was included in their family that millers wanted to incorporate her family into our family as quickly as they could and we i i did feel in the beginning she was taking my place in my family and that was odd very odd and sometimes i do not no exactly what her relationship is with my sisters i i honestly do not know o how much they community how much there in much hard of me really does not want to know because i think i would feel left out of something going out what is to be a mam and to learn at the age of sixty nine that your only daughter is not actually your daughter at all and that were not bad enough that lots of people in your town people around you knew years before you did buts in a minute from scagobobegredio went on program continues is america life mired glassed eveyou just outing in take modern is telling the story this hour of two girls switch to birth one mother marry miller knew and kept it a secret that nothing about it for forty three years the other mother came mac donate had no idea the two fathers in this story were not interviewed mister my dona's health did not allow it mister miller died to thousand and in this half of the story we hear from the mothers again here is jacopren at the hospital in nineteen fifty one came mac donate was told that she would given birth to a nine pound four hounds baby she don't question that every day she was at the hospital the nurses brought her the same baby girl nothing seemed o miss to her and as that baby sue grew up the one thing that puzzled my was that missus miller whom she knew only vaguely from church seems interested in sue she always referred to the girls as sisters after they were born she had written us i christian letter and do and said she would always to keep in touch with sudan because the girls were much sisters and i crass i thought that was foolish but him i went along was at because i do not to me waves i guess we might say and that is why i started sending them a copy of our christian letter that is how missus miller kept track of sue over the years missus miller would do were say things concerning the girls things that just seemed strange to cay when cases church was celebrating its one hundred and fiftieth anniversary for instance say was sure person for the event reverend miller had once been passed her there he and missus miller were invited and the millers came and i was in the halfway and missus miller said to me did you ever think that our girls were switched at birth and is i said heavens know i thought that was such a ridiculous thing to say and am and i cries i was very busy because i was cheerpersan and i had many other things to do i pass it off but that is all she said there was nothing any further i did not it did not bother me because i just thought i could not see any merit to it i did not have a doubt in my mind and ism not one to barrio trouble what came a dona did not know was that there was a whole slew of people in her church community who had heard about the rumored baby s witch from the beginning missus miller came a dona were actually in different churches say was a methodists in the millers reevengelicals missus miller told people whin the evangelical church about her suspicions friends of hers and people she hope would keep an out in sue but later the two churches emerged bunch of people from the evangelical church now knew who came a dona was and who sue was and realized that this was the girl missus miller believed to be her own and this whole crop of people knew but never said anything to came a donate one of them was darling wolfgraham she heard at first from her own mom who heard it at church she said everybody kind of at church after having seen party beside the rest of the family a just could not believe that that was their child it was pretty concealed an rig within our own church probably the lady ad maybe o the little true that got together in fact my mother said what is do not tell anybody a we all we never said anything about it i darling wolfram did tell her daughter that grand the daughter there with me ended up marrying she's brother bob the older but even she never devolved the secret to bob or any of the macdonalds here she is her names also sue o i know i did not because it was always just the rumor and i thought well he will think i not you know and he was very angry at first with me and i he said why would not you have told me that i said would you have believed me i mean id say she guess what bad it'll think your sisters yours well there was no de ani tasting that that or anything else i den the would have been no prof that is what most people in town seemed to feel it was not their place to bring up such a thing especially with no way to know of it was true for sure what that meant was that after came a dona finally found out the truth an nineteen ninety four people started coming up to her in church mostly casually mentioning that they would known about it all long i was surprised that nobody really ever a told us the booms the the nor the lands the hastens i i just could not believe it i just a i just thought it was odd that many people would know in a town of our size which was fifty five hundred people when that many people were aware of it that the news did not get to us slowly anger began to set in cay was angry that missus miller had not corrected things back in nineteen fifty one missus filtered high jacked her life in this way and she was angry that missus miller put sue in the difficult position of having to break news this to her parents and angry that now the millers were asking much of she's time and attention i got bad a had to go on medication for high blood pressure well course they were really clamoring to get to know her and a i felt excluded i felt they were trying to take her away from us and and sudan always had said to me ma'am why did not you have any more children after i was born she wanted to be a part of a big family then she found out she had all of these i brothers and sisters and a the phone calls were fewer and i and of course party did not really call a whole lot she is a very busy gal and i was not having that much communication with her and a i thought i was losing both of them a mac dottle began getting notes and phone calls from reverend miller he told her tat he thought it was god's will of this had happened even he asked her for forgiveness again and again a just outright he just saying can you forgive me just just that on the telephone it yes and quoting scriptures i all the time for me to read to console me because i had said that i had i had shed a lot of tears and and i i had probably all of the emotions that you have with the death in a family i think i would not into a kind of a depression about similar to what i did when my mother died and case was trying to get me to say that i had forgiven them and how did you feel when he said this was god's will and what was your action i could not believe that because i do not i do not ta have that feeling about i do not think god punishes us an anyway i think what wed do is pretty much our own doing but he had everybody convinced i think that it was god's will but i had talked to several of our former masters who knew about the situation and they ya assured me that this was not god's will they said that was a coconut and i do not think that was too well received when i mentioned that i told missus miller i felt that it was god's will when she realized that she i not have the right child i think it was his will that she do something about she wrote that letter to missus miller eight years after she learn the truth that long it took her to sort out her feelings maniac dole in the millers eventually reached kind of day ton cay's no longer angry the way she was but she said she will never understand why missus mill stayed silent for all those years if i h d does strong feeling as she did that i had the wrong baby i would have pursued it i i do not care whether my husband objected or not i i feel on i should have made it a wrong in to a right i i only had the one daughter and she had five daughters the fact we were even owned even sure we would have another child i crisis we were elated when i did get pregnant and and then to think that i did not get torose the one that i ad wanted to much an do i never will probably understand why i mean i forgiven hem but that does not mean that i forgotten i can still wonder why and probably never will know why it did not come up any sooner t many miller was ninety six now she lives by herself in the country her house is filled with the remnants of her and sorbet's life together in the church they were married for sixty years there is a large statue of an angel in her sitting room when we as planning to put on her own grave when i first talked to issue miller about what had happened when party was born she told me pretty much the same story she told in her letter how she knew as soon as she got home and waved the baby that the nurses had made a is stake yes i told in w i think we have the wrong baby and he said well i would not disgrace it door bi tell em e gave wit the wrong baby and he this this is a nice little baby will keeper when when your husband said to you not this baby's cute let us keep it did you agree with him immediately or was the a little bit of arguing octane forth for what to do not we did not not get bat the but i kept looking former and a was always taking any one whom i bathing i and fact i when i would go don have any touch wit ne ma don't we we got introduced to them i i kid to tattooer about it in she she told come b the was crazy at i green woman thought i a her girlie was a little serial to hear her talk about it in this way laughing that especially after hearing came an donate side of things but then missus miller told me more of her side of the story for one thing she explained just how six she was after they had gone home with party an nineteen fifty worn she was losing blood having spasms she thought she was going to die she told me that she even started calling round trying to find some one would be a mother to her six children the sickness she said lasted for six or seven months but the time she was well fixing the baby witch problem was that much harder even if she could somehow convinced every one it was true but what happened if he suddenly took o six month old away from the only mother she knew and the family's relationship with doctor deploy was no small thing either reverend miller had made many visits to doctor deadlock's wife when she was sick and now doctor restock refused to charge the millers for anything the millers did not have much money and they might not have been able to afford the health care otherwise but for we to can did don't fer doing it is doctor been find to in good do i and why ruin all that the be consideration because missus miller did not want o cross her husband all she could do was hope that many if she dropped enough hints calling the girl's sisters and such cay would eventually realized on a come what had happened it was an odd strategy if you can even call at that when sue got married for instance the millers gave her a trivet sorbet had made the card was signed from your other possible parents sun dismissed his part of the whole sister thing but she also thought was kind of weird missus miller's most ambitious scheme happened after the girl's graduated from high school when they were about to be eighteen missus miller arranged for the my donates to come to dinner she figured if she could simply get cay ta look at party cay would figure things out the evening justsended up being kind of baffling for every one involved since only missus miller knew what was going on but they had not notice any i do not know why they did notice that that maria look them and was this i do not know why they did not ti at the fact is missus miller longed for sue for her biological daughter ever since she realized the mistake back in nineteen fifty won but it seemed feudal trying to convince her husband sorbet i i i thinly it is not right to o do that you could keep somebody off e baby i didn't than lit right to do that and overtime at talk o to me at it u it is all right till be

make in visit i nth neither sure nor party blames missus miller for going along with her husband they say there not angry with her they knew reverend miller they understand what their relationship was they understand why she did not speak out sooner forty two years after the switch reverend miller finally laid eyes on sue at the my dona's wedding anniversary party and the moment he saw her he knew that she was his biological daughter she looked exactly him at last missus miller felt free to act a month and a half later she wrote the letter o i wanted him go we with me and he didn't he finely did but but was really for me began that was terrible the that hang a wat yell and an sat that happen it gook say an off along time a am sorry b one thing missus milter does not regret is raising party she remembers party always lightning the mood in their house as i gid she i she is really alible she always had jokes she had joked everyday it i deeper laughing you know was it was good for a i at i i really good frat ever out i me the my kid jar of was serious that t life yet now thenar more i am before when id asked you if she thought it was god's will you said yes and is the reason because party brought something important to your family you she did she brought happiness dear sue ism writing you this short note to officially give you my welcome to this miller family and relationship this is sue reading a letter she got some time ago from her new found miller sister faith though there are many many good things about our family and parents and being raised by that family there were also some definite deficits if your ever curious as to what they were i would be very willing to fail you in you fully appreciate the parents who raised you between ourselves ruth and me we or at least i always figured you locked to probably maltha with her happy lucky nature could take the climate of the miller home better and we hope you flourished in the mac donate household well well ism she is basal gets she is basely saying to you you may have actually got in a break here being in the family i loved o i locked out i mean are the times when you when you feel little but guilty about and of having locked out with the home that was neon maybe little be easier to go up in was sure i guess did ye a little belt gilt but it is not my it is not my fault there was nothing id did not have anything to do with it my sister faith called in she was talking about the way her mother would talk to her n ism think how would i have survived with that kind of upbringing you do not i did not grow up that at a i do not know how i what as survived but sue says here a lot of things she missed out on too by not growing up with the millers the family did all kinds of hobby painting and rock polishing in three de photography they had dogs raised an for rabbits all sorts of interesting people came to the house guests from out of town and missionaries it was a different way of living one that she admires as for party she does not to dwell on the notion that sue might have been the one who locked out does i thought ever crosse your mind an what if the switch had not been made what that donates ha just taking me home and i had grown up in the house with my biological parents my biological brother who would i be oh that is a funny question i i really om i really only thought about that one time i only let myself think about one time it was actually right after i met them and i ways going back to my my mother's house i left pray to seen and i was driving and it was then that i start to thinking o my is my life would have been different and as i the more i thought about it the more i realized i cannot think about this because it will drive me crazy if i do and tho i cant a made a promised to myself that i would does never go down that road again that i was not tan o does not get to go there ne i really haven because there is no point it is pretty rare that party and sue actually meet face to fays once every few years they get together for a large family gathering a wedding a graduation a funeral the summer bob my dona's younger son got married and parried sheen when party showed up at the house for brunch the day after the wedding she could not have seen more at home with the family that she did not meet to er fortis she teased the groom and handed bob's older son at present for his baby it is a little ate as for er to an ain e gardens goa a s up ye i the bit they present when sue arrived she slipped in quietly this was the side of the family she was raised with but she seemed tense watching as party made the rounds everybody laughing having the two of them near each other was a little awkward people were definitely aware whenever both women were in the same room at one point toward the end of the party as sue stood near by mart started talking about the room that she had grown up in and the miller household all the girls were in the same room party shared o bed with her sister fat and had to crawl through this bench to get to the bather midnight with his faith with locked e way to the hall instead of going in the hall and g o

a quick warning there are curst words that are beeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our weight this america life dot o work from v by chico says america life an my class why are not you more mad i think ism just too tired to be mad it is when i think of tat i get exhausted i get a little desperate i coal feel a little bit i feel a little bit under water this my to work there shown the cold is the produce her in the radio show and the thing that brought him to the state is a bed night wight good a bed he does not have no he ordered it wag in september mi get when move to no apartment the ss wish have been sleeping since i moved and on the floor on my old mattress awaiting my new bet to speak queer the mattress for the new bed arrived right away after you orderlies is roll up a beside near the window whether issue is the bed frame and the headboard the to wall undelivered absent four months after ordering and i taking to shot about this because today's programmed is about all kinds of different sorts of run around and he is in the middle of a sort of classic one one lots of is of experience for the record the bed that he ordered is a queen size bed from the camper on mine store as outcasts producer he told me he felt a living crochet ordering a product that is advertised on many pod cast but he says he rely the bed it is tat an angola cushion headboard to ween against when he reading at night chon is somebody as never really fixed up a place with nice furniture and he was finally getting round to it and he was excited and at first the delay was a completely excusable kind of thing the bed was backquarder which in happens wit the furniture must must be ready for delivery on nonmember lighten but the eighteenth of nonmember comes eighteenth of nonmember goes it does not show up at cromlech is out to camper ah they said you will here from our delivery partner of get a tax from the delivery partner as coming i never heard of called or ex arise texts me and says i we have scetceld your delivery for september twenty six and ism it has not been september twenty six for s to months conceals are and sketches the delivery saturates him for a day this in the future not the past but this is the first of what will be many tax and communications from our ex the make no sense at all the new delivery day of in three weeks the day finally arrives i get up strip the mattress pull it off of the floor set it up to make it easier for them to take away suchainthing against which trance against the lawn office against my books wait for them ranting gets text telling him his bed will not be delivered he means three scatter he cost find out why and they said a know we cannot bring it to you because you ask for the haul away service to take away your old mattress was could not this truck still drop off your thing even if they worsts in a hell an the old mattress i yet good question why does not being able to take something away prevent you from bringing the deliveries re scetceld for to day tree days later men did comes the tax saying is man be tuesday no expedition why an i won't have after that the text again saying that now it will not be delivered tuesday and i call then and ism what is the deal and they go others pen at truckbreak down now like o when can it come now and the go oh hang on a second and they look at their notes or whenever the g on nor away you are good for to morrow not i am good for to morrow there had because it is already been added to the round and am there a truckbreak what was that just something you said and a i still another answer of that a to say this is one of the most annoying things about this kind of run around at every stage you get answerers that leave you short of squinting and scratching your head trying to understand them every explanation is and explanation then tuesday i get up again i strip the bed i pick the matches up off the floor i lean it up against the wall and then i get at tux saying your delivery is confirmed for thursday this time many cause there is no explanation at all just an apology thursday come and on thursday i get up i not strip the bed nor do i call the mattress off the floor cause beginning to learn of course my does not come and i call them and unlike it is going on then they go oh there is a hard hold on this order and ism wises there a hard hold and they go oh an there was a duplicate on the order dock yet two bed frames and headboards here that are sketches for shipment for the same person without a might be a mistake and they didn't wan a ship till they knew shah wonders why didn't is contact him an ask if you ordered two feds errand also t is this been on his paper work from the star then that is always been the case rice why am i only finding out about this now that means it was never going to come or something and and now you wondering is this even true that this prom in the paper work well know because it seems specific why would you make up something that unless it is just i do not know i do not know i guess the answer is i do not know and it is madman then after thinking they had to deliver to beds to than they admitted they don't have any they did we call doc search finally showed up with a bed but who was the wrong size which would than back and square one roll on a than started to keep a record of all these interactions with our ex in camper and at this point it is eighteen pages long if this document were poem what would it be alit would be call john's a published poet by the why ah how do you sleep when what to our exon camper to be company to find out how they do sleep at night given the treatment of shoncrawl the answer was refreshingly honest camper o we pe of operations he melt admitting ye the last for years because gold was supplied change hade been crazy camper has experience to quote a myriad of disruptions you did say that only a tiny portion of the shipping has done with our ex and they are trying to work with our i to improve things ninety per cent of their customers he said rate their experience with our expo favorably meaning ten per cent do not than is one intent pretty bad odds of phase mi take is that they never actually had to bed for him than cause has come this far does one start over for a different company a run around it is different people different ways ism the perfect person to give the run around to because i am a freezer naturally in disposed to flipping out om demanding a result you say you would not do these thing i would not do these things ism ism the person who you want give the run around too because ism not gun alike reach to the fan try to strongly even one i e ism polite about it true ting got l worked up talking to me about all this but the harshest he ever got with camper or are like is a sternly wordy detail the sound i he was written by an english gentleman in the eareighteen twenty quote this is beyond unacceptable we sleeve know it camper intends to do to rectify the situation yours sincerely i run around we put in that weird information window were you cannot tell what the truth is w you do not get what you want in a contest of feels with some other person or entity and goes on and on and on just as a man it tests you it shows you who you are to data programmed some very different kinds of run around and some very different reactions to them the people were being push to the very limits s to of us at on forty eight hours sat the lot more hours this fir story is about somebody who shone is being given the run around but the run round is not something much more consequential to her wife than a bet from and the woman it is happening to overunover she has to decide whether to cut her losses and walk away or stay with it and fight er way through the porter bring smith if his rode about this for the new side the bother banner explains even before this whole thing began relay's life involved a lot of running around she is busy got three kids work stays and nights as a home healthcare when money's tight she also drives for door dosh in it is to cart she spends a lot of time in her car a lot of busy people but unlike a lot of busy people redye told me and mi produce her cries she usually chooses the slowest possible rout to her next destination because ism scared of beltways i mean i do not do beltways that take the long way everywhere what emeayou cere o bellmen just scared of all the traffic many different lanes with cars my i have to bed anxiety and my nerves or bed i think it is just many different lanes with just many cars flying past t you s i just prefer not a it'd rather go on a side words is they a rent peep lame above this yet in like to go any bast forty five senate's commitment to the local roads just outside of balltimar where she lives we will sometimes id twenty thirty even forty minutes to her trips that is her nay the store i want to tell you started last spring when something went wrong with rename stop benefits her foot steps her monthly money stopped appearing on her benefit is card fixing this took five or six trips to the social services office billing out times of paper work and three months of waiting this is ant unusual for her or any one on benefits finally a kind woman at the front desk et social services looked into her case and found some glitch in the system she fixed at for renew and the next morning everything was made right all three months of miss benefits showed up at once she now at almost three thousand dollars on her card the highest she would never had renal felt a wave of relief but a couple weeks later rename went on line to check the bounce on her card and everything was gone except sixty six dollars that is all i can really remember i thought it was a mistake i thought while we me get off the a and i clear day out and tried it again something she called the number on the back of the car to make sure and found out again sixty six dollars first she was just confused then she noticed large transactions at stools she is never visited red washington d c where she never goes gas beltways she realized some one had somehow stolen her stop money the thousands of dollars she just gotten back on her card was gone and one afternoon this is were her run around began have been reporting on social services snap in mainland and have seen snap boot happening a lot ban fits left sky rocketed from ninety thousand dollars and twenty twenty one to over a million and a half dollars and twenty twenty two stop brought his actually up across the you us the night had happened to rent she could not stop crying a and could not sleep this is money she used to buy food for her hates without it she would have to pick up enter jobs get behind on men the next morning she march into the same government building she would been in many times before to fix the problem in person maybe shed get the pixelate again i went down tho the social services and the same lady that fixed the food stamps was ye have remember i just fixed them for you and all the money that was going to come on your card she was almost since years she said i feel bad for you because it is much she said have never seen that much be take in at once am she said but i can tell you now they are taking they are not on every fund anything the woman told renew be cause the stolen snap money is actually federal money martian could not pay her back those a state white policy she said there was nothing we she that i really wish we could help you and then of course everybody in the whole causey know you are sitting there with all these people and the window everybody can hear you talk as you only walking a couple steps to the window and to get the whole room looking at you at one time i felt stupid i crying in that barely crying in for people i try to hold my emotions back and it was hard that day i just putt hold aback i first mat renew on the space but group for parents and mainland who used benefits snap there were lots of parents mostly moms writing inlaying they had had there benefits stolen and there was renege posting all the time about what had happened to her and really trying to help every one else every one please read this she wrote if we all come together and report this to the police in social services than something may be done there were lots of mobs who had tried to get social services to refund them no luck they would also fouled reports with their local place nothing i talked to dozens of them and renew was in a category of her own she did far more than any one else when i got her on the phone backhand shed been playing phone and meal tin for days bouncing between every authority figure she could find the office of the inspector general for mainland social services the you stay d we which fun snap even the mainland legislature were she called delegate after delegate but at all got her nowhere i d er you the went yet robin rammer e yet a and e won be that unfortunately no matter what are you he said they are not on every fun the money the police were not any help either the cop a sine to her case office her timothy malice would sometimes take days to answer her tax and did not seem to be doing anything he was a rooky who had not graduated the academy yet related something i have not seen any one else do she decided to investigate her own case she was going to find the people who took her snap money one thing about renew she loves true time shows forty eight hours she knew how important the first couple days are in any investigation she was were time was slipping away she went to the fact she had the snap benefits a had given her the details for every fraudulent transaction all seven of them they included a dollar amount the date and the name of each dor thread been big purchases some over five hundred dollars rent thought that may be those stores could rewind their security footage to the times of those transactions and may be identic my the thieves she text all this to off her alas the then i i e tat my town and one e i no thou of the or no er that yo people you mi n tan cart i tan et the ti from all that that that e to thank found that she suggested the place contact the stores but nothing happened i four the fort of my tow most of the stores would not help her they do not show surveillance footage to customers only place but one manager at an international market agreed to check and theft the bayou of the people that fit to if ye that one to the for i pictured in one for feted test know of that the thriving away and all of a sudden renew was looking at the faces the people who stole from her itscurityfootage am a sundae and early august it looked to be during the day was right out the foot was grainy but she can make out a middle aged man accepting the store then in a different foot a woman with a low bun and blue striped skirt with ha shopping cart and you fee direct the cart the people that for it wont pa i and pay e the baby for you u can in ta fiery you the people of all pa it o we be for ye what if on the picture twelve hundred dollars a baby formula which seems heard but it make sense if you think about it formula is a very efficient way to concert food stamps into cash it is in every grocery store it does not go back quick my me intent you can pack a lot of it into your car and in the summer of twenty twenty two there was a shortage of it renew had found the suspects and get away car the bout it showed them driving off and a toy what a many man but she still had no idea how to find out their names their identities and even after squinting every which way the photos of the license plate she still could not make out what it was if you look at it for a fore way you could feer little better but than wan you really tor a con fer to have the rather i the cane for hated said that o major this won renew tested all this to officer alas he did not say much just quote i up toted the report with the information you have given me he also said he referred her case to the departments investigative an side her crime units then he stopped responding for weeks the now you only in for any of my fact tat ting if he had found anything ell tow nothing he have not responded you are

system error or that the card was used fraudulently there would be no refund other moms on the face bat group had got in the same letter a lot of them had given up in that point but renew reads the find plan she noticed that the bottom of the letter offered her the chance to appeal this find done before judge evidence i the e a i them hat h fer hearing e tin an her fire e a a i got through that i ta the me the then clearly you people but i have not e that an he a li that in would corner wherever she was going to file in a peal it was a lot of money and some part of her just wanted to prove that this thing had actually happened to her but she had been robbed all she had was grand footage from one of the stores she wanted a stronger case if she could get better qualities security footage from another sore maybe she could identify the license plea with could lead you to the criminals she wanted to go in person but again these stores were near washington d c a beltway an inner state

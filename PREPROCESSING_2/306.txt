welcome to the hubermanlaponens a science sciencepace to is from i mandruhuberman and on a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing plain effects we will also be discussing what are called no so effects as well as belief effects all three of these placebo nosing and belief effects are all related to our brains incredible ability to place an expectation on what is about to happen and actually change what is about to happen independent of the physical and chemical properties of a drug or some sort of other treatment solution for things pain parkinson's disease irritable bowel centrum agma stress and on and on and on now one of the most incredible things about these effects is that despite the fact that it would appear that they are simply psychological or the power of the mind over matter it is not that at all placebo nosing and belief effects actually change the way your biology your physiology works in fact you have neural circuits within your brain that are dedicated to how your expectation of what will happen actually changes some of the most cardiological functions within your brain and body modifying for instance tartrate blood pressure the release of specific neuromogulator such as dopamine and a adrenaline and powerfully that these types of effects can actually work along with traditional drug treatments or behavior a treatments in order to vastly change the way that your brain and body work if you think of the word placebo as and inert substance or treatment that is merely a control it is merely something introduced to an experiment or a clinical trial to try and figure out what is happening normally in somebody is brain or body as a comparison to some drug or other to p of treatment well while that can be true and placebo controls are vital for certain clinical studies it is also the case that pluses no seems and belief effects have powerful impact on our physiology entirely separate from all of that much that several highly esteemed researchers in the medical community around the world believe that placebo no so and belief effects should actually be leveraged in the treatment of various diseases as their own unique treatment by the end of to day's episode you are going to have a clear understanding of what placebo no silo an belief effects are their biological underpinnings and the way that you can leverage them toward your mental health physical health and performance before we begin i emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and sienstulated tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now one of the key things for getting a great night sleep is the temperature of your sleeping environment for instance in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature needs to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep it makes it very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment you can dialing specific temperature ranges for the beginning middle and end of your night it even has a sleep tracker it will track your slowwave sleep remsleep total sleep and give you a sleep score and you can actually divide the mattress into two different temperatures if some one else in your bed likes things a different temperature and they of course can have their sleep tract independently of yours it is an absolutely wonderful tool its completely transformed my sleep much that when i travel to hotels or lesbian bees i find i do not ever sleep as well as when i have my eight sleep to even shipped m i eight sleep out to those places that gets a lot complicated but that is how much i love my eight sleep it gives me the best possible night sleep if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep doc calm slashhuberman to save up to a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u s a canada u k select countries in the e and australia again that is eight sleep doc cam slash superman to day's episode is also brought to us by aero press aero press is similar to a french press for making coffee but is in fact a much better way to make coffee i first learned about are press well over ten years ago and have been using one ever since aero press was developed by allay adder who was an engineer at stamford and i knew of allay because he had also built the called army frisky he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feels of engineering that turned into commercial products now i love coffee ism somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after i wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if ism going to exercise it'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but i love love love coffee and what have personally found is that by using the are press i can make the best possible taste in cup of coffee i do not know what exactly it is in the aero press that allows the same being to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee even the traditional french press the express is extremely easy to use and it is extremely compact in fact i take it with me whenever i travel and i use it on the road in hotels even on plans it'll discuss for some hot water in all brew my coffee tea rite there on the plain with over fifty five thousand five star reviews aero press is the best reviewed coffee press in the world if you would to try aero press you can go to aero press dock calm slash superman that is a e r o p r e s s dock calm slash superman to get twenty per cent off any aero press coffee maker aeropress ships in the u a canada and of r sixty other countries in the world again that is aeropress do come slash supermen to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a programmed that lets you see how different foods and different activities and your sleep patterns impact your health by giving you real time feed back on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor now blood glucose sometimes refer to as blood sugar has an immediate and long term impact on your energy levels and your overall health one of the best ways to maintain focus and energy throughout your day as well as to keep your called metabolic health in best order is to make sure that your blood glucose never spikes too much nor does it get too low with levels you can monitor how different foods an food comminations impact your blood locos levels on a moment to moment basis have been using levels for some time now and it is really help me understand which foods and food combinations exercise schedules and sleep schedules are optimal for my blood glucose levels and how that translates to energy levels and other metrics of health if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor you can go to levels dot link slash supermen levels has just launched a new medium censor that is smaller and has even better tracking than before right now there also offering two free months of membership again that is levels dot link ally an k slash supermen to try the new censor and too free months of membership o we let us talk about placebo effects i will also be talking about no so effects and let us just establish the difference between those placebo effects are when an inert substance or behavioral treatment that is a substance or behavioral treatment that is not going to have any kind of direct biological or psychological activity right it should not do anything on its own somehow does in the direction of improving symptoms or performance now let us contrast that with no sabot no sabot is when a drug or behavioral intervention which is inert it should have no impact on symptoms or performance o any kind but with no silo it turns out these substances or behavioral interventions actually worse an symptoms or performance now oftentimes people will just say a placebo effect its la bit more rare for people to distinguish between placebo and no silo effects but i do thing its important to know their difference going forward it'll mostly just refer to these as placebo affects but ill talk about no silo affects a little bit later ow also talk about belief effects solicitous establish what belief effects are belief effects are when you or somebody else learns specific knowledge that changes your expectation about what is going to happen in reference to say stress or consuming a given food or taking a given drug or doing a specific behavioral protocol and the specific information you learn or assimilate actually leads to that specific outcome in many ways belief effects and placebo effects are similar is just that the word placebo or placebo effects as commonly used to refer to drugs and behavioral interventions belief effects are more specific language used to describe when information of any kind changes the outcome of some physiological or psychological process now what is common to placebo no so and belief effects is that they all work by changing expectation and any time we talk about expectation we talking about the function of the nervous system and specifically the brain and specifically the prefrontal quartics within the brain the prefrontal quartets is neural real estate which has just fancy nerd speak for the neurons in their connections that reside just behind your forehead just in the front of your skull now the prefrontal quartets has a lot of different subdivisions or regions the overall function of the prefrontal quartets can be described as having the ability to either activate or suppress other neral circuits deeper in the brain some people in fact or previous guessed on the hubermnlapatast a neurosurgeon said the prefrontal quartets can generally be descry bed as the structure in the brain that controls other structures in the brain by saying s or suppressing their function for instance if you have the impulse to move or to shout the prefrontal quarter suppresses that movement or suppresses that desire to shout or that shouting if you have ever hade the experience of you know going to the edge of a clamor being on a high bridge and thinking omaginists you just have the spontaneous thought which please do not do this in action but e one will have this thought a ma goodness what if i just jumped off and people think minis i do i have some sort of a death wish well no the prefrontal quarter being largely a context evaluating and prediction machine is essentially looking at that landscape and predicting what would happen indeed how bad it would be if you were to jump off that bridge or jump off that cliff and then you feel that imagines what is wrong with me why would i think this but the fact that you think it even for a moment but you do not do it and the fact that you recognize that its sort of a ah a dangerous thought certainly a dangerous action again please do not engage in the action tells you that your prefrontal quarter is working properly again the prefrontal quartan is involved in suppressing certain types of behaviors and what sorts of behaviors well the larger theme of the prefrontal quarter that we need consider to day is that it is an expectation or prediction making machine it is a bunch of neurons that release chemicals and have electrical activity that are speaking with an receiving information from other areas of the brain and it is a valuating a number of things context like what is going on in this room what is going on in the scene what suppose to happen your what might i do what should i do what should i not do et camera et camera now the other thing about the prefrontal quarter given that it has all these different subdivisions is that some of those subdivisions have a uniquewhat we call labelled line communication a unique highway that leads to specific brain areas that control specific bodily functions including heart rate blood pressure et camera and a little bite at ear n the episode it'll talk about a specific paper when my favorite papers in which a specific prefrontal quartic region is identified as controlling very primitive aspects of our physiology such as body temperature and heart rate in reference to beliefs or what is happening in a social scene and this is very different from the way that say getting into cold water or experiencing some other sort of stressor causes increase in heart raised or vast constriction what we are talking about here when we talk about placebo nosing and belief effects or the way in which you learn information or you are told information hay this pill is going to do blank a may because the label says it may be because the scientist or the doctor tells you that this pill does blank or this injection will do blank or maybe you learn some information about what some specific drug or supplement or behavioral protocol will do and in that learning you come to expect a specific set of effects and certain nerd circuits and the prefrontal corrects become active and start to activate certain nerd circuits deeper in the brain in areas the hypothalamus these are ancient very well concerned across animals areas the brain that control very primitive functions y they exist in essentially all camels and even in reptiles the prefrontal quarter also communicates with areas of your brainstorm controlling things breathing et camera the prefrontal quarter is a sophisticated area of your brain that takes into account context both in the present as well as memories from the past it can take into consideration goals about the future and then combines all of that into neral signals to areas of the brain that control basic physiological functions relate to the immune system the stress system the reward system the pleasure system and on and on when we talk about placebo nosing and belief effects what we are really talking about is the ability for information and specific experiences to lied to expectations within us about what is going to happen and then our physiology of our brain and body mundane mentally changes such that those things happen let us talk about some specific examples of placebo effects from the research literature and to day work an a cover a lot of different examples from different systems but as we do that i will specifically be selecting examples that illustrate different types of placebo effects and illustrate what those different types of placebo effects are now i should mention that if your interested in placebo effects there is a wonderful book that describes many many different placebo effects and their biological underpinnings in cases where those biological underpinnings are understood and the book of referring to is one that i used prominently in researching this episode it is called none other than placebo effects understanding the other side of medical care and the book is by fabrisio benedeti i hope i pronounce that right fabrdisio o entouitalians out there if i did not do it correctly i apologize it is an absolutely wonderful book i confess i have never met fabrisio benedeti i confess i have no relation to the publisher or to the book itself except that i absolutely love the book highly recommend this book it'll be pulling from a number different examples described in this book to day to my mind one of the most interesting examples of placebo effect is where placebo is given and can profoundly change levels of dopamine release in the brain now the study ism about to describe was done in parkinson's patient people with parkinsins have degeneration of neurons in an area of the brain called the substantial night which is an area of the brain and the kind of bottom back part of the brain for you iffacionatos as the ventral segmental area but you do not can to know that name these neurons contain dopamine and are essential for the generation of smooth movement patterns including walking and reaching and moving on one's hand to writ et camera and of course dopamine as involved in a bunch of other things too including motivation and reward in people with parkinsins depending on how severe and advance the parkinsons is they suffer deposits in the ability to generate smooth m movements and often deposits in motivation and reward pathways as well now there many different treatments for parkinsins some more successful than others unfortunately still not completely curable at least not at this time but most of the drugs that are successful in treating parkinsins to some degree or in other are drugs that increased levels of dopamine within the brain for obvious reasons as i just mention parkinsins is a degeneration of the dopaminergic meaning dopamine containing and releasing neurons in the brain people with parkinsins will often be given a dopa which as a precursor dopamine or other types of drugs that increase dopamine within the brain now there been a number of studies that have compared certain drugs known to increased dopamine such as a dopa things apomorphine from pristine et camera to placebo control drugs and one of the interesting take always from those studies is that yes drugs a dopa bromacriptine et camera increase dopamine and at least can partially or transiently improve symptoms of parkinsins in many not all patients with parkinsins the placebo drugs given in many of those studies which were simply a sugar pill or some other inner pill does not contain any chemicals that are known to directly bind to or increased dopamine in the brain and yet none the less when the brains of certain patients were imaged it was clear that not only was there an improvement in symdemology but there were increases in dopamine release within those patient's brains which on the face of it should make no sense however when people with parkinsins or people who even donna parkinsins are told a given drug can increase dopamine and then they put these people into a brain imaging device it is called a pet device has nothing d t animals is the positronomission tomography device and these people had been injected with or consumed something called racial pride it sounds rely we are dindangerous but actually race pride looks a little bit dopa n itself chemically and has a little tag or label on it and it can bind to certain receptors in the brain where dopamine would normally bind what was observed is that the plusibo itself was causing reduced binding of this race pride to areas of the brain that have dopamine receptors which meant unequivocally that there was more dopamine released in the brain because if more dopamine is released in the brain and parks in those receptors will then the race pride which looks a lot dopamine cant also park or bine to those receptors simply put a plusibo drug again a drug that has no direct action on the dopamanergic system if it is given to somebody who has parkinsins or who does it and they are told this drug is going to increase levels of dopaminior brain and potentially improve your symptoms of parkinsins or have some other effect well it succeeded in increasing dopamine levels within the brain which basically should make us all sit back and say oke what are we to think of drugs a dopa and a apomorphine bromacriptine as compared to plusibo wised everyone just taking plusibo weren't we just telling people hay this sugar pill is going to increase dopamine while too important points to answer that first of all the increases in dopamine that are observed from plusibo plus information about what that plusibo ought to do for increasing dopamine are not as robust shows they generally not as robust as the increases in dopamine observed from an actual drug known to increase dopamine transmission or release within the brain the second point is that the structure of the information given to somebody and the belief that they form about what ought to happen that is the expectation effect which you will struck toe realize more and more across to day's episode that expectation effect really is the underpinning of the plusibo effect while the strength of that expectation is really hard to anchor across individuals and in fact if people realize their taking a plusibo the magnitude of the dopamine increase is s actually decreased this is why we use placebo controls in clinical trials we want to establish the real difference between the effect of a given drug on a biological system in this case increasing dopamine from the belief or the expectation of what that drug will do in that sense the placebo is really a measure of expectation of what a drug treatment will do at least in the contacts of a drug trial i mention this somewhat complicated example because first of all many people are interested in dopamine we all make dopamine its involved in motivation drive and focus and reward all sorts of things that we hear a lot about these days second of all it really illustrates that placebo that is expectation about what will happen is impacting of course placebo effects he realized that now but it then also has to be the case that placebo effects are playing in to any effect that we might observe from taking a given drug or supplement based on our expectation of what that drug or supplement will do and miraculously or at least what i find miraculous is that placebo effects these expectations based on knowledge and beliefs are highly specific which raises all sorts of questions about for instance if you were given a drug that increases dopamine levels but you were not told that it increases doom levels that perhaps you were told you are lied to and told that it increases the activity of a different damage later ceratonan would it well let us explore that because as wild as that seems it turns out that what we believe about a given drug treatment or behavioral treatment actually has a high degree of specificity to illustrate the incredible specificity of placebo effects i want to describe a study related to hormone function hormones come in many different forms we have testosterone estrogen growthhormon coatis all et camera there is a study that was carried out inhuman in which subjects were informed about growthhormon release and quarters all release growthhormn is a hormone released for om a gland in the brain called the pituitary the pituitary has different parts the enter pretubitary releases growth hormone each night when you go to sleep it is involved in proving synthesis tissue repair bodily growth appendage growth and many other things cortical is a hormone that is released from the adrenals it can also be synthesized and release a couple other places in the brain and body and it is involved in a mine system function in anthem inflammatory action a lot of people think cortical is bad but it is actually and important hormone for our daily health are alertness and waking up in the morning et camera in any event subjects in this study learned about growth hormone and cortical and there release where their release from what they do just as you did and then their growth hormone and cortical levels were measured and not surprisingly they did not change just learning about growth hormone and cortical did not change growth hormone or cortical levels in these human subjects now on days two and three of this experiment subjects received an injection of a drug the drug is called sumatripten and sumatripten is known to increase levels of growth hormone and reduce levels of cortical and indeed that is what they observed when people receive these injections and then their blood was drawn growth hormone levels went up coatis all levels went down now the interesting part of the study is a separate day ache after the drug treatments they come back and they are injected with sailing which has know specific biological effect it simply salt water one their injected with sailing and they experience increases in growth hormone and decreases in cortical which on the face of it might seem wow that is incredible but based on what you have learned thus far in to day's episode you can imagine that knowledge about growth hormone and cortical somehow combined with the injection to lead to an expectation of increases in growth hormone and decreases in cortical which would be amazing in its own right ache after all sailing is in course it does not do anything directly and specifically to the growth hormone or cortical system but get this it turns out that assailing injection which does nothing on its own on day four or five after people have received this drug treatment increases growth hormone and decreases cortical independent of what people are told they are being injected with even if they are told they are being injected with a drug that has completely different effects than sumatriptan why would this be how could this be in fact there was even a condition in which subjects were told on the day they receive the placebo you are about to get in injection of something that is going to decrease growth hormone but rather they experience a genuine increase in growth hormone and decrease in cortical in the exact same way they did when they received the active drug sum titan o case this wild type of scenario has to be explained and in order to explain it we need to fume out from the experiment and ask what is the similarity between day two and three of the experiment meaning the days in which the people received the actual active drug sum titan that increases growthormon reduces cortical and the day in which they received the placebo and the one thing that anchors both those days together meaning the one thing in common that can explain this effect is that those were the days in which people received and injection and in fact through various control experiments and a few other experiments that were done subsequent to this as this experiment has been more or less repeated in different forms in different laboratories it became clearer that the brain and body somehow came to expect that receiving an injection leads to increases in growth hormone and cortical now this is not an indefinite affect right people get injections of other things in the future presumably active drugs not just saline that will change hormone levels or change nor transmitterlevels but in this experiment what happen is is that there was a wearing within the nervous system there was a somehow a binding of the notion of getting an injection with a syringe which in the first case was of a drug that increases growthroman decreases qartersall and then when subjects came back and were injected with a different syringe presumably i would hopes with a different syringe filled with sailing even though the sailing should do nothing the body and brain had somehow formed appearing an association between syringe injection and increased growth hormone decreased quartersaw which is incredible given that these systems the after pituitary the adrenal glance man these are ancient systems that to our knowledge we cannot directly control with our mind i cannot simply the t close my eyes and grip my teeth and cause the release of growthormone i cannot simply decide to deploy cortesall from my adrenals although if i thought about something very very stressful for a long time there probably be some quarts a secretion but to our knowledge there is no way to use thoughts to use beliefs to use understanding of knowledge to cause changes in our indicting glance right our hormone length of pituitary the adrenals but here we have a case where a drug that increases certain hormones and decreases other hormones simply by virtue of the fact that it was injected into somebody leads to a case where subsequent injections at least in the short run lead to the exact same hormone changes simply because in the mind and or body of these individuals injection comes to equal increase in growth hormone decree in quarter all independent of what is being injected now a key point is that had on the final day of the experiment the subjects been injected with a different drug that for instance increase of ceremony in or reduces epinefran i doubt that they would have instead experience increases in growth hormone and reductions in quartesall that simply not the case the fact that there was only sailing in there meant that there was an opportunity for the syringe and the injection we don it know which to lead to some sort of paired association in the brain and body that led to increase growthhormon decreased coatis all which mimic the drug effect but the wholeconareo here as wild as it is really speaks to the fact that oftentimes we think a given treatment is causing and given effect only because of the action of the drug or the action of a given behavioral protocol but in fact the drug and the protocol exist in a big context of different things that the brain and body are integrating and try to make sense of and that often gets lumped together often say that your brain is yes a prediction machine but it is also trying to simplify things in those predictions is not taking into account all the information it is often lumping information together and coming up with ideas about what is going to happen and why and doing this subconsciously in a way that as you just learn can have profound effects on what happens within us even at the level of something as basic as horizon release now what i just described is a pretty extreme example and it is a very experimental condition type example and it is rare that people are undergoing i these kinds of organized receiveall of information and followed by specific drug treatments and placebo injections et camera but you have all experienced the placebo effect in action by way of what is called classical conditioning simply by virtue of the fact that the smells of certain foods and your past experience of certain foods can lead to the release of a hormone called insolent insolent as a hormone that is involved in regulating blood glucose blood sugar atypically when insolent levels go up in the bloodstream glucose levels are going to go down because of the way the insolent controls blood sugar levels now if you have ever had the experience of walking past a bakery or repeats a show where a delicious smell is wafting out into the environment you may notice that cotimakes you hungry and indeed it does make you hungry because presumably you have hade the experience of certain smells being associated with the consuming of certain foods may be bakery foods may be pizza may be stake whatever it is and the consumption of those foods actually leads to increases in insolent in your bloodstream well there is the called conditioning effect whereby the smell of the food itself starts to lead to increases in insolent but the conditioning effects of different stimuli different things in the context of eating and specific foods leading to increases an insolent is actually highly highly modifiable much that experiments have been done where for instance somebody eats a particular food or in some cases is just directly injected with insolent but more often consumes a particular food and just prior to consuming or during consuming that food there is a bell ringing or a buzzer in the background going off and they do that a few times and then ism sure up anticipating what is coming somebody can just here the buzzer or the bell can simply ring and that person will experience an increase in insolence what i am describing is a condition insolent response a stimulus such as a bell or a buzzer that on its own should have zero effect on insolent release has been pared with a food that genuinely increases insolent within the bloodstream and then even if the food is in present the stimulus the buzzer the bell et camera can evoke the insolent response ow this is an important example to understand because it is a common one that we probably all experience and that exists within the wiring of our brain right now but its different then the smell evoking the insolent response because delicious food which evokes an insolent response having a particular odor that makes sense in the context of food but here we are talking about something completely unrelated to the food not the odor not the taste not the appearance just something that happen to be in the environment in which you ate the food leading to an increase in insolent and it just screams placebo effect but it also screams that the placebo effect is strongly modifiable according to context again the prefrontal quartet being the seat of the anticipation or placebo effect and the prefunto quartets taking i to account lots of things in the environment thing to understand what is here what sounds what smells what colors and then lumping all of that together an eventually through the activation of specific neral circuits leading to a very basic hormone response in this case the release of insolent and of course what i just described is classical conditioning ala palm pavlavlon the hobo prize for his description of classical conditioning in which dogs could be induced to salivate in anticipation of food by way of a stimulus completely unrelated to food itself not the smell not to look not the taste rather just a bell wrung before the consumption of food in a dog eventually led to a situation where the mere ringing of a bell could evoke salivation from those dogs are we all just salivating dogs i guess we are i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a g one a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that also contains adaptations i started taking a g one way back in two thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it in the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it insures that i get enough periotic and robotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realized is not just important for the health of our god but also for our mine system and for the production of nauru transmitters and auromodulators things dopamine and ceratonent in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are number of things in a g one including specific micronutrient that are hard to get from whole foods or at least in sufficient quantities a g one allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that i need robotics robotics the adaptadens and critical micronutrient any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a g one because a g once u port many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a g one go to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen and you will get a year supply of vitemand three k two and five free travel packs of a g one again that to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen o case given the context is a powerful modifier of the placebo effect and in fact may be central to the placebo effect i just one a rattle off a few of the known placebo effects that have been demonstrated would show the extent to which your brain in my brain are coming up with ideas about what given drugs or given behavioral treatments ought to do and in that way shaping what happens when you take a placebo or and this is an idea that will go into in a bit more detail in a few minutes perhaps contact is also changing the way that active drugs not placebos but active drugs are impacting your brain and body the examples it'd to give or from laboratory studies about the placebo effect but that relate to very common at home and normal life scenario suceither ye are not unique to the laboratory and they are the following first of all placebo effects are strongly modifiable by the expectation of the quality of a given treatment for instance if you are given a placebo that has a brand name on it or a name of a drug it could even be a made up name you do not know what the drug does but it has trade mark t m there in the corner of the name grandame as a posted generic placebo the grandame placebo has a stronger effect moreover if a placebo is placed into a package not just put in front of you on a little tray or in a little dish but rather in a package or ye a to push it through that low foil rapping or you have to take it out of a bottle and espeshly if that rapping or bottle has a label on it or it looks as if it is a quoting duo real drug well then the placebo has an even greater placebo effect the color of a given drug can even have an effect based on hour association or expectation of what different colors relate to in terms of our physiology for instance if subjects are given pills that they are told will help them fall and stay asleep and some subjects are given blue pills other subjects are even red pills other subjects are even yellow pills the subjects that take the blue pills tend to sleep better even though all the pills regardless of color are placebo they contain no active substance and for some reason most people associate the color blue with sleep whereas where i should say by contrast if people are given a blue a red or a yellow pill and they are told its a stimulant the subjects taking the red pill here i mean the actual literal red pill a not talking about any kind of cultural red pill have not seen the metrics yet people torii nun to see it but non him about taking the red pill quote on quote on talking about taking a pill that is the color red in an experiment the people that take that pill experience a greater plesibo induced stimulant to felt as opposed to when subjects take a blue or a yellow pill for some reason the color red is associated with a quotenquote upper a fact or stimulant effect moreover if subjects are given a blue a red or a yellow pill and they are told that the pill will have an anti de press in office the subjects that took the yellow placebo yet the biggest anti depressant effects color of a given pill even impacts the direction or in this case the magnitude of the placebo office and i shall mention then every one of those studies yes there was information about t what the given pill should do it was not the case that if people took the red pill they felt a stimulant o fact if they took a blue pill they fell to sleepy a fact and if they took the yellow oil they fill and anti ta present effect these were three separate experiments one on sleep where subjects were given one of the three colors of pills blue have the strongest effect or a study of stimulant effects they were told its a study a pills that will increase alertness and attention they were given one of three different colors the red pills at the biggest effect and the third experiment subjects were told this is a pill that will alleviate to some degree your symptoms of depression the people what took the yellow pill experience the greatest relief of depressive symptoms now that is pretty wild but but perhaps as even wilder is the more invasive o placebo intervention is the greater the placebo effect capsule have a bigger effect than tablets i do not know if that is more invasive but i guess it looks more medicinal to have a cabs verse is a tablet who knows why but that is what is been observed and injection of a placebo has a greater effect than a consumption of a capsule or a tablet of course and if people are placed into a medical device or machine especially cases where one of their limbs or both of their limbs or even their whole body is placed into a device even though the device is doing absolutely nothing specifically to our biological system it is inert right a bunch of buttons and a bunch of noises and a much of humming as if something were happening but nothing is tapering that directly relates to any one specific biological system except and now what ism about to say except expectation of what the machine is doing while that has the greatest placebo effect of all for some reason as the level of evasiveness or the much a say the complexity of a given treatment is increased will then the magnitude of the placebo effect is also increased and what this tells us is that the human brain has come to associate level of evasiveness level of complexity of a given treatment or machine to equate to bigger outcomes and in some sense that is completely logical but again we have to remember in absolutely zero of these conditions whether notes a tab lit a capsid and injection or a medical device is there anything being done to these human subjects that impacts of specific biological function except one and that one again is the activation of specific neral circuits and the prefrontal quartets that then are able to communicate with other areas of the brain and body through modified biological mechanisms of hero transmitter release and electrical activity in nuances what the brain does an of course the prison the quarters being par the brain those are the mechanisms is employs to change the activity of hormone releasing glance to change the activity of other neurons in other words the belief effects the expectations are real they are having effects through true biological circuitry just that the pills and the treatments and the machines are not doing anything specific at all except activating expectation weave been talking about the placebo effect and have been giving examples of strong placebo effects and while all of what i told you is substantiated by data i do not one to give you the impression that the placebo effect is limitless because it is not limitless for instance placebos have been used to help in the treatment of cancer but there effects within the treatment of cancer are limited to a very specific set of symptoms and contexts for instance people who are told a given drug will help them with their cancer by reducing their symptoms of hemotherapy or radiation therapy often experience reductions in the negative symptoms of kimotherape or radiation therapy reduced pain reduced magic and by consequence improved feelings of well being compared to people who do not receive the placebo and who are not told hey this drug which in realities of placebo is going to help you with your treatment its going to make it less uncomfortable case in the contacts of cancer treatment placebo can reduce the discomfort of various cancer treatments however placebos cannot reduce s the size or eliminate tumors if people who unfortunately have tumors c cancer are given a placebo and told this drug which actually as a placebo unbenotes to them is going to reduce the size of your tumors or eliminate your tumors that placebo is not effective in reducing the size or eliminating those tumors this is very important understand because as you recall placebo effects are expectation effects expectation effects are driven in large part by the prefrontal quartets in its connectivity to other areas of the brain and thereby to the body but the outputs of the prefrontal quarters are limited there are a certain number of them and indeed there are many of them but those connections do not extend to tumors themselves or biological systems or circuitry's that allow one's beliefs to reduce the size of or eliminate tumors and this is very important because unfortunately there are many sufferers of cancer and there are many theories about accelerating the treatment of or improving the treatment of or even curing cancer using called mine body techniques her mine body tools and we need to be fair to the data which have conclusively shown that reductions and stars improvements and sleep social support a number of things can improve cancer treatment outcomes now those are not placebo effects those are all practices for which we know there are reductions in inflammation reductions in stress hormones that lead to improved outcomes in the contact of radiationtherapy in the contact of a munotherape in the contact of any modified treatments known to reduce tumor size what we need to do is separate out three things here behavioral practices such as meditation sleep social support known to reduce inflammation and stress and that can improve cancer outcomes those are not placebo effects those are real effects there are also drugs re dilation cimotherape amunotherape and devices known to reduce tumorsize and hopefully eliminate cancer's tumors that would be the hope those are real effects and then there are the plusibo effects the knowledge and belief and expectation about what a given treatment will do in some cases its knowledge about what a given drug will do that improves the outcome achieved with that drug in some cases its people being given a completely inert substance or solution serial solution but being told this is going to help with your audio symptoms this is going to help with your pain during your immunotherapy radiation et camera and those are real effects but they can only be explained by virtue of expectation and knowledge each a a placebo effects and i want to emphasize that those placebo effects are not acting directly on tumors to reduce their size or eliminate them another example of how plausible effects can be very powerful and yet still have limits to them is yet another study from doctor ted capture slab at hazard medical school and by the way many not all of the studies that have been describing to day have been done by the captain lab he is done beautiful work on plausible effects for a very long time now he is considered a real pioneer and a leader in the study of placebo and has also been a big proponent of exploring the placebo effect not simply as a contrast to drug effects or device effects but as their own specific effect that perhaps can be leverage in the contacts of treating disease hats off literally plural hats off because they have had owe many discoveries in the contacts of plusibo and their powerful effects an their possible uses from the caput club and their colleagues there at harvardmedical school just incredible work and one of my favorite studies from the captain lab is one published in the new inland journal medicine some years ago in which they took people who had asthma these are people diagnosed with as these are people who have challenges breathing and they experience a lot of discomfort in trying to breathe normally unless they are taking their asthma medication in this study they took people off of their asthma medication of course not indefinitely but for a short period of time and as expected those people experienced challenges in breathing and discomfort associate with the challenges in breathing one group received no treatment they ware just taken off their ashamed and evaluated and then of course put back on their asthmamets another group received a placebo treatment and another group received a drug known to improve the symptoms of asthma now what was interesting is that the people who receive the drug for the treatment of asthma not surprisingly had improvements in breathing and less discomfort exactly what you would expect however the people with placebo also experience less discomfort in breathing but their patterns of breathing did not change again this really speaks to the fact that placebo effects can be very powerful but that their very specific they are not simply wiping out a condition asthma or completely eliminating all symptomatology of a given condition cancer this study illustrates very clearly that placebo is effective in reducing the discomfort associated with the challenges of breathing but not eliminating challenges with breathing jersey whereas they venture before there are drugs modified prescription drug treatments that can both restore normal patterns of breathing an relieve the discomfort what this really speaks to is the fact that the prefrontal quarters and its involvement and expectation can have powerful effects on things pain powerful effects on things do amen powerful effects on any number of different brain and body systems but not all of them our beliefs and expectations are powerful as evidenced by the placebo effect itself but they are not what we call omnipotent they cannot do anything and everything id to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood engine to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health coals have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones et camera but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modification supplements et camera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor you can go to inside tracker dot calm slash superman to get twenty per cent off any of inside tractors plans again that is inside tracker dot cam slash supermen one of my all time favorite studies in the contact of placebo is a paper thetas published pretty recently and the title of this paper is nicotine related beliefs induce dose dependent responses in the human brain and if ever there was a paper that pointed to the fact that our belief systems can really shape the way that different drugs different supplements different behavioral protocols can impact the way that are physiology and our brain work it is this paper it is a pretty straight forward study it was of course carried out inhuman and what they did is they had people tape nicotine nicotine is a known connive and cancer nicotine named because it binds to nicotine capital culling receptors in the brain which is just fancy nerd speak for the receptors the parking spots for a vital coaling a nuromodulator that is involved in attention and by virtue of being involved in attention is critical for the performance of certain focussed tasks most people associate nicotine with smoking raping dipping or snuffing here were talking about nicotine nets of raped however i want to be very clear i am not encouraging people to tape nicotine yes raping is probably healthier for you than smoking but raping is not good for you it would be better to not tape than to tape at all i did not entire episode about nicotine i want to leave aside the issue of whether not you decide to use nicotine a that is all covered in the episode on nicotine on provided link to that the shownote captions is a lot of considerations there it does increase blood pressure n it creases vast constriction non anon but as i mention nicotine is a connive and cancer it can increase focus an attention end in doing it can allow your brain to do certain things better tasks witching focusing in the contacts of a lot of distraction et camera et camera in this study nicotine related beliefs in ducked tost tupennent responses in the human brain subjects used agape to in jest nicotine and they were told that they were either investing a low medium or high concentration of nicotine and i really nice thing about the study is that they actually measured how much nicotine people raped so they were able to measure how much nicotine made into the blood streams of these people and they were also able to evaluate brain activity in areas of the brain known to have these nicotine receptors and to also be involved in certain cognate tasks just to get to the grand conclusion of the study what they found is that people who are told that they invested a high concentration or a medium concentration of nicotine performed better on a convey tasks that we know is dependent on or can be modified by the amount of a seedocolling transmission in a certain area of the brain then did individuals who were told that they invested a small concentration of nicotine now the interesting part of the study is that everybody c consumed the same amount of nicotine here we have a situation where there is a called dose dependent placebo effect everyone gets the same amount of nicotine but people are either told meaning they were lied to in some cases that they got a small medium or high concentration of nicotine and for the group that was told that they received a media concentration o nicotine they performed better on a connive task then did the people who were told they received a smaller concentration of nicotine moreover people who were told that they received a high concentration of nicotine performed better than either the individuals who were told they received a medium or small concentration of nicotine but as i mention before everyone received the same concentration of nicotine this tells us that not only are placebo effects related to expectation but that the expectation somebody has of the degree of an effect tuition experience actually creates a different level of experience put differently if your told that your getting a small amount of drug a medium amount of drug or high amount of drug and that the size of an effect gets bigger as you go from small medium to his well than you will experience the small medium or high effect depending on which group you were in even if you all got the same dose of drug now i need to be very clear everybody got actual nicotine the placebo effect here is related to what people believed about the dose of nicotine they got but everyone got active nicotine now here is where it gets really cool as i mention early or in this study they imaged the brains of people that were neither the group that was told they got a small or medium or high concentration of nicotine and what they found is that in the specific area of the brain that is known to respond i nicotine and that is involved in cognize functioning related to the task that these subjects were given they saw increased levels of activity of the neurons in that be ain region that scaled up according to whether not people were told they got a small medium or high amount of nicotine again every one got the same amount of nicotine they were simply told small medium or high and the brain area itself changed its level of activity which in turn changed the outcome on the connive task which basically puts everything in a really nice box wraps it up with wrapping paper beautifully puts it in a bow and says o we placebo effects are real and placebo effects scale with the degree of expectation that one has any time we are told that a small dose of something is going to lead to a small effect a medium dose of something is going to lead to a bigger effect and a higdose will lead to an even higher effect well whether not that occurs is going to depend a lot on what sorts of cotencote effects we are expecting again you cannot use placebo to eliminate tumors there is a limit to what placebo effects can occur but assuming that the effect that one is interested in is modifiable by knowledge and expectation well the size of that effect will scale with how big you expect the effect to be and it is not purely psychological that is the point here it is not just about your beliefs and you doing something very different in the contact of a task or in a sports event your physiology in this case the activity of a specific brain region increases its level of output according to your expectation of the level of drug you consumed in my description of that recently published study you notice i said placebo effects but in many ways what i was describing wort belief effects it is a little bit difficult to disentangle what is a placebo effect in what is a belief effect in general belief effects have to do with acquiring a bit more information or specificity of information about what the expectation should be i suppose the study i just described could easily fall under the category of belief effects and not just placebo effects but none the less belief effects are powerful and their specially powerful because as one starts to lay er in different amounts in different types of information as to what had given drug treatment or behavioral treatment will do one can start to see really neuantsd outcomes as well as truly surprising outcomes and some of my favorite studies on belief effects were done by my colleague at stamford she is in the department a psychology her name is doctor a sacrum she is been a guest on the superman labpodcast before we will also provide a link to that episode and alley's lab studies mine sets mine sets of course in corporate a lot of things besides beliefs they involve prior knowledge they and to have even more information woven into them than either placebo effects or belief effects but alley's really one of the world leaders in understanding these belief effects and has done some just gorgeous work in illustrating the incredible range and extent of belief effects that exist one of my favorite studies in this contact is the paper from alley's lab entitled mind over milkshakes mine sets not jobs nutrients determine the gremlin response here it'll just briefly describe the study all paraphrase the abstract on two separate occasions people consumed a three hundred and eighty carry milkshake and they were either told that it was a six hundred and twenty carry quoting indulgent shake or a one hundred and forty carry quuinquo sensible she then the hormone gremlin was measured gremlin is a hormone associated with hunger it is released from and binds to various sights within the brain and body but it is generally associated with the hunger response the desire for food then their subjects had their blood drawn at three different time points at base line prior to consumption of the milkshake anticipatory meaning just prior to consuming the milkshake and post consumption ninety minutes after consuming the milkshake and then gremlin was measured within the blood samples that the people provided now as you recall e anyone is consuming the same three hundred eighty carry shake but that is unbeknownst to them one group thinks their drinking an indulgent shake that has lost he calories the other group thinks their investing a coin sensible shake with fewer calories and it is important to note that in the study the individuals were asked to read the labels of the shaken get information about okay this is an indulgent shake has a lot of calories lot of fat et camera in the other case this shake has very few calories it contains healthy ingredients et camera now you can probably guess where this is going the people that consumed the milkshake but were told it was a high carry indulgent shake and also by the way consumed information about it being high carry an indulge are their reading that on the label experienced steeper reductions in this hunger associated hormone called gremlin as compared to the group that also consumed the same three hundred eighty carry shake but thought that the shake was a sensible shake with fewer calories that was a healthier shake those people experience reductions in ireland as well but they were less steep they occurred less quickly over time and in addition their subjective level of satiety of fulness or of feeling as if they had enough food to quell off hunger was also related to whether r not they thought they d consumed the higher carry indulgent shake or the lower carry sensible she there are bunch of other interesting aspects to this study i am just giving you a cursory over view of the major effects but the take away is very straightforward what we believe about the foods we are consuming strongly impacts the downstream hormonal effects of consuming those foods gremlin after all is a peptic hormone that is secreted from the stomach yes the stomach has neurons but as far as we know the stomach does not have a little thinking brain in there the stomach is operating in a very kind of crude language of the nervous system as compared to the thinking in a analytic language of the brain the forebrain but what is happening here is that knowledge indeed specific knowledge about what more calories means as supposed a fewer galleries what the word indulgent means as opposed to sensible all of that is being combined and then communicating with neurons and other systems of the gut to literally create a different hormonal response to food and that is incredible because the hormonal response to food is a very strongly evolutionary concerned set of mechanisms and yet this study and other studies it including the condition insolent response that we talked about earlier you pavlovas dogs are in this case we are the pavlovas dogs where the ones that conger condition to a bell or the smell of a food or the sit of a sign on a bakery to get a insolent increase all of that stuff that is primitive hard wiring of the brain embody is also being strongly impacted by the more let us call it sophisticated or analytic aspects of the wiring of terrains such as the prefrontal quarter such that what we believe is going to happen is actually what happens now the other study on belief effects and mind sets and how they can impact outcomes in terms of our physiology relates to exercise and this is a study on that doctor drum herself describe him about because she was talking to one of her academic advisers this was before she opened her own laboratory and yo areas an athlete she was actually a division one athlete is incredibly impressive individual by the way this a tenor professor at stamford as she was a division one athlete has a degree or rather a certification in clinical psychology am she is extremely accomplished individual but exercise an athletics have always been a big part of her life and one day she was talking to her adviser and her adviser offered the possibility that and here i paraphrasing from a different conversation perhaps all the abusive effects of exercise are plesibo that is i silly what her adviser said and alley at no there is n n away right and we know that you exercise you sure getting increase in heartraht in blood pressure during exercise but that leads to lower levels of baseline blood pressure and hart rate afterwards after you adapt that exercise and her adviser said well cay that might be true but why do not you goes it she did test it what she did is she took hotel service worker these are people that clean hotel rooms for a living and these are very active people right their vacuuming their changing sheets ere going upstairs the folding laundry there doing a bunch of different things throughout the day and they divided them into two groups one group was told that doing a great job and being diligent is very good for you they were told all sorts of things about their job and how it was important and indeed their job is important right we need people who can perform these rolls of turning over hotel rooms and doing those sorts of things that hotel rooms can be clean and beautiful when we arrive the other group however was told that the normal daily activities that these people were partaking in the folding of the laundry going up and down the stairs pushing of carts et camera was exercise and more importantly that it was the type of movement that could for instance lead to reductions in blood pressure reductions in body weight improvements in lots of different health metrics now the incredible outcome of this study was that simply on the basis of whether or not people were told and therefore believed that their daily activities would lead to improvements in these different health metrics predictions and blood pressure reductions and basil heart rate reductions in body weight well that is exactly what happened people who received the information about how exercise was healthy and their work mimicked exercise experienced the health metric changes whereas people who were simply told your work is important you w it is important to do a good job et camera et camera they did not experience the same health metric improvements that provide support for what doctor drums adviser had suggested that at least some of the effects of exercise are likely due to mind sets or beliefs each a a belief effects throughout to day's episode have been talking about how our expectations and beliefs and mind sets can impact is really deep layers of our physiology things hormone relieve things level of discomfort or pain during a given treatment and on and on and have talked a lot about the prefrontal quarter as critical for understanding what is happening in a given context and forgetting those expectations because the prefrontal quarter as you recall is a prediction machine and contexts important for prediction and on and on what i have not yet told you is how it is that the prefrontal quarter actually does this i mean what are these magical output pathways of the prefrontal quarter and while i already established that they are not infinite rite the prefrontal quarter cannot control everything meaning if i give you some information just thinking about an believing that on your left quadruped is going to be much stronger than your right quadruped and if you just keep persevarating on meaning you keep thinking about that and looping on in your mind and i give you some examples of how you thinking about strength can make muscle stronger and on and on in the classic context of the posing effect all that expectation ought to lead to an improvement in strength and capsize of your left quadruped but that is not what happens why or more accurately why not well as far as we know there is not a direct nerd circuit or hormonal pathway whereby thoughts from the prefrontal quarter can impact the growth of muscles in your left quadruped however there are output pathways from the prefrontal quarter to regions of the brain that are known to control very basic bodily an brain functions such as the hype of thalamus and those pathways are known to be able to change certain parameters of our for instance stress response blood pressure tartrate azo constriction even body temperature i t just want to take a moment and describe what i consider one of the more beautiful studies illustrating a specific pathway from the prefrontal quarter to the hypothalamus that a lots control of the called stress response in the context of very specific psychological stresses now this paper is importnocious for our discussion of polio belief in mine set effects but also for any discussion about called psychosomatic effects or the idea that are modes of thinking whether r not they are related to calmness or distress can strongly impact are physical health and the title of the paper is a central master driver of psycho social stress responses in the rat goodness that is a tongue twister psychosocial stress responses in the rat now the fact that this study was performed in the rat should not cause us to lean away from it or to think that it is not relevant to humans because the very same circuitry's that are described within this study have analogous circuitry's within the human brain i know that to be true from my work in noranatomy teaching noranatomy and other groups separate from the group that did this study have explored similar circuitry's in the human brain now in this study what they were able to do was to identify these two particular regions which it'll just call them d p d t t for short instead of saying dorsal peduncular quarter and dorsal neatest just say d p d t t this is the area of the prefrontal quarter one do not let these acronyms and name scare you these are just names of a little subregion within the prefrontal quarter send connections little wires that we call axons to a area of the brain called the dorsomedial hypothalamus the dorsomedia hypothalamus is a highly conceive structure meaning whether not you look in mouse or in rat or in apes or in humans or in dogs the dorsomedia hypothalamus contains anurans that are involved in generating cardinal features of the stress response things increased blood pressure things increased vast constriction things increased body temperature things increased brown fat thermogenesis now we can even go a step further because that is what they did in the study they mapped the connections from these specific subregion of the prefrontal quarter the d p d t t down to the dorsomediohypothalemus and a very specific set of means within the dorsimedio hypothalamus but even there we are still in the brain we have not yet established how activation of the specific anurans in the dorsomediohypothalmus actually change blood pressure how they actually cause azo constriction in the primary cause that is what happens when you get very stressed whether not from social starts or from cold water there is a constriction we call vest constriction in the periphery my blood is shuttled toward the card the body to keep your cororgans alive your still going to get blood to the big limbs of your body you can move run if you need to but your digits house appendages are going to get far less blood flowed to them because of this pascal constriction and that is achieved by an output from the doorsomedio hypothalamus o case of the second hub along this chain to an area of the brainstorm called the nostril medullary safe coke again fancy name you do not have her remember the name if you do not want to maybe you iffacionatos want to but what we are doing here is we are moving from the prefrontal quarter to the hypothalamus then to the brainstorm and then from the brainstorm out to what we call the parifhry to the body to the spinal cord to the blood vessels themselves to the organs of the body the gut and the heart and the lungs all the things that we associate with the called stress response as we have been learning about placebo effects and belief effects and mind set effects and learning that ora just our knowledge about something our anticipation our thinking can influence levels of a hunger hormone is not that wild or can influence the amount of pain that we experience in response to a cancer treatment or can change the amount of opening in the brain in the conte of a placebo given to people with parkansin s well all of that seems very very surprising until you look at studies of the sort that have been describing in the last few minutes that are starting to establish the very precise neral circuitry's that lead from areas of the brain the prefrontal quarters that are associated with thought and contact and planing and prediction down to i do not want to call them the deeper or more primitive layers of the brain because these areas the hypothalamus and the mandola the brainstorm though not really primitive in the sense that they do very sophisticated things is just that they tend to be present in both mammals and reptiles their present in fish whereas the prefrontal quarter is a brain structure that has undergone fairly significant elaboration as you move from animals say cats dogs up to great apes and to humans and at least to our knowledge as a field of neuroscientist and biologists humans have the most sophisticated or rather elaborate prefrontal quarters the most number of different subareas of the prefrontal quarter and every time there is an investigation of those subareas what they do what their anatomies are meaning where they connect to and who connects back to them it is found that there is a tremendous degree of specificity all of which is to say that we should not be surprised at all that these placebo belief and mind sat effects occur because there is a clear biological substrate for them up until now we have been talking about the placebo office as these incredible set of effects that have a real biological substrate there are anatomical pathways hormonal pathways no transmitters involved and that is all true but what is also true is that the plosion effect can very in size tremendously between individuals end across different studies and in fact this was described in the first formal study of the plusibo effect in that study it was shown that approximately thirty per cent of the individuals in the study showed a rob just placebo effect but that the other seventy per cent showed a less robes plusibo effect and that result meaning that variation in susceptibility to the placebo effect has borne out again and again and again across different studies now modern science has now taught us that if you look at the genomes the genes that happen to be expressed in one individual verses the next verses the next verses the net there are are certain genes not a lot of them but there are certain genes that seem to correlate with certain types of placebo effect being greater or lesser in certain individuals and while there are lot of these different genes and a lot of different placebo effects one of the more interesting ones is the i o m t gene which in codes for something called catalog o methyl transferase catalog o methyl transprace as the name suggests it has a are in their in the contacts of a discussion about biology that almost always means your talking about in enzyme catalog o methyl transphraces in enzyme involved in the regulation of the call catacolamines catalog means being dopamine epinephrin and norepineferan can have already talked about dopamine in the contacts of parkinsins have talked about opening a lot frankly on the superman lalpotcast because it is involved in motivation it is involved in focus pursuit of reward it is involved in movement as we discussed earlier nor epinephrin anepinepran also do many different things in the brain nobody but not the least of which is to increase activation state for heighten focus for increasing the bias toward movement of the body and on and on in any event this gene so m t catalog o methyl transphrace seems to show strong variation in individuals that show strong variation in he placebo response to certain types of placebo conditions and i just mention it because a i think it is superinteresting after all a lot of the studies that have demonstrate placebo effects have shown those effects in the contacts of changes in dopamine epinephrin and nor epinephrin it is not without contexts that were talking by tension legend but also just as a general theme the fact that there are genes that in cod for specific biological substrates in this case regulation of opening epinephrin and nor epineferon and those genes show up at different levels in different individuals and the placebo effects show up a different levels in different individuals and now there are studies there are starting to show that the levels of those genes and the degree to which one experiences the placebo effect either elevated response or reduce response to the placebo effect seem to be fairly strongly correlated this again is more evidence that yes the placebo effect is based on knowledge belief expectation but that it has a real biological substrate just as there are anatomical pathways out of the prefrontal quartets of the hypothalamus down to the brainstorm and out to the body there are also genes expressed in specific cells within our brain and body that allow for our beliefs and expectations that are carried through that prefrontal quartets circuitry to have either a greater or lesser effect throughout to days episode have been talking about how knowledge your belief an understanding about what might happen ought to happen or very likely will happen influences whether not that thing actually happens the soculplasebo effector belief a felt or mind set affect and what i hope have made clear during the course of our discussion is that while placebo effects arrive through our cognitive understanding of what might ought to or is likely to happen the downstream effects the effects on agma irritable bawelcyndrum insolent growth hormone picture favorite biological system essentially every system within the brain and body has been shown to be susceptible to placebo effects what i hope is becoming clear is that in every case the placebo effect is a biological effect it is not just our thoughts tricking us into thinking something happened that did not happen it is our thoughts our mind creating real biological effects if you are learning

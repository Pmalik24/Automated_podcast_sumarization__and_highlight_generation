well folks the attempts to take down donate trump are very very real and the are having significant consequences for of the body politic their coming from nearly every major institution in the united states from our universities to the media from academia to the judiciary as well talk about it is happening everywhere and the real question is why is this really about donate trump as a person is it really about donate trump with all of his myriad foibles and mistakes and craziness as or is it about something broader i will contend that it is about something broader that the elite institutions in our society have basically decided that if any one remotely right wing were to ever enter the presidency again would be an existential threats to their vision of utopian future for the united states the reason i say this is because this pecan marked president say have an entire episode of facts up at youth the can you write now about the worst presidents of all time and what you will see in art lists is that it goes all the way back and all the way ford and it really tries to take look at what people did while they were president and the impacts of those things while they were president and sometimes as jimmy corner in this post presidency but historians every year is on his big story about the presidential rankings the overall presidential greatness rankings from the america political science association and what this list does is demonstrates who they thing was the best and who they think was the worst obviously teyavetrumpin last place of course of course and would assume that they would but that does not really answer the question as to whether they just hate trump or whether there is something broader going on to truly understand how much the let institutions hate trump and really hate the wright wing left understand that it is not just that they hate trump is that they despise any one who smack in any way of being on the right in the united states in trump is just the apotheosis of all of those things ears the apepacts of all the things that they hate because they are able to stack up all of those myriad craziness is and foibles of donate trump on top of all the other things that they hate about republicans f you look at their list their list is stacked top to bottom with democrats every republican is down grated significantly every democrat is up grated significantly here is the list from the america political science association of their top presidents they have graham lincoln an number one obviously consents is numb one pick now usual consent to pick is graham lion umber one and gorge washington number to sometimes you the other way gorge washington number one inabraham lincoln number to but those are always the top to but not for the america political science association they have lincoln at number one and then the have franklin dealing roosevelt to number to which is pretty astonishing considering tat franklin decliner rosevelt presided over the great depression he probably lengthened it by nearly a decade with his garbage economic policies frankly and declinate roosevelt initiated many of the vast government overspending programs that if crippled america and created of vast wellfair state that is led to a thirty for trillion dollar national at in other words there are some good things that a the are did for example his leadership during world for too even the even that was played by some bad leadership depositions particularly with regard to say the malta agreement which seemed all of eastern rope to the soviets after are had a bazar off spot for stalled in any case putting him number to above gorge washington is the tell but don't end there the put tetdyroosevelt at number four teddy rosevelt of course was a progressive any rosevelt was a believer in the power of big government even though he was a republican and the republican and democratic parties have shifted identities somewhat over the course of time the but homes jefferson at number five harry tureen at number six and boron mama an number seven there is no possible way to say the barokobama is the seventh best president of all time the seventh greatest president of all time clocking in above wit d eisenhower names malison john dams road regent and everyone else that is insane barockobama was a terrible president barockobama wildly exacerbated racial divisions in the united states of america by every available polling statistic he presided over the complete dissolution of america power around the world he down created the america military he rest us in the foreign sphere and domestically he pilloried america no president of my lifetime bar non not best on issues of race but also on issues of culture on issues of say sexual mores we moves from a country wherein two thousidnt a barokabama campaign as a proponent of traditional marriage to by the time he left office open discussions about whether men are women that is what borackobomaded besides presiding over the worst recovery from a serious economic recession in america history the slowest recovery in america history and he spent more money than literally all prior presidents combined t did barokobama they have him at number seven on this list and then e l b ja who initiated the great society programs there spent public thirteen trillion dollars on anti poverty programs to leave almost precisely the same percentage of america and poverty they have him ranked at number nine the guy who wast the we at not war and got us involved in at the first place the guy who completely rewrote the constitutional relationship between the government and the private america citizen target is at number nine bill quintan is at number twelve as though job bison is at number fourteen hon this list from the america political signed location how in the world is job in ranked number fourteen roads dragon is rank number sixteen coronal regent who led the most booming economic recovery in modern america history in the nineteen eighties and also created the ground work for defeating the movie union thatguy is ranked thatguy is ranked at number sixteen and jobidon is rankest number fourteen by these people burro willow the worst president of all time a vicious resist who let us into world were one who then created the system that let us in the world wore to who jailed his political opponents for session audio willow a truly horrify who created the autocratic state the worst president of all time they have thatguy ranked above road pagan tho the reason that ism reading this is because you've to understand the framework by which our elite institution's work and because of that framework my are letting to both a bazar delusion that they cannot possibly lose to somebody donate trump and also they are led to believe that they can do anything they want to stopped only trumpets after all if you have the fourteenth greatest president of all time according to the people running against literally we worst president of all time well i mean what cannot you do to stop that president of the united states what cannot you do to stop donate trump we at to more on this in just one second first do you know big tack can big government haven common they both would to silence to sending voices into submission if you told about something they don't on social media well good chance your post will be flag by a concent moderator you might end up on some sort of government matchless to fight back against having your voice centered by both big tack and

that simple stop letting your voice be sensor to fend your rights and protect yourself at express pans on am slash ben that is e ax p a e as us pans o come slash ben to get three months for free that is express vans to come slash ben in the realm of delusion name silver has ben taking it directly on the chin over the week belaud because the poll analyst put up a piece pointing out that cordon is extremely vulnerable in his reelect effort he says quote if you would asked me a year ago i would have told you that jobidon was a reasonably clear favorite in the event of a rematch against donate trump not overwhelming favorite mind you but perhaps o sixty five thirty five favorite the case forbid seemed obvious enough and come insulin reelection more often than non of course bid an bee trump in twenty twenty democrats will coming of a relatively strong mid true i do not but grudge people who took this time to realize that bison's reelection would be a heavy lift the first time mi in turn the will began to shift was in late summer when bison's approval members remain poor even as the economy was improving and it was becoming more apparent that his advanced t age was an enormous problem for voters and one democrats were not going to be able to spin away since then bidet's situation has to come considerably worse if you're ten year's younger you might still be a sixty five thirty five favorite says name silver but if his campaign is substantially en cumbered by his age he is probably now the under dog he says you got see to stop being delusional and he goes through the stats and he points out that jobidon has a real problem in his reelect effort which is why you are sing people ranging from name silver to as recline neither of whom its exactly republican calling for hoiden seaside and he is getting walled by the left to day because it is not possible for join to lose thou simply be impossible this is why they are till trotting out my clobachar the senator from minisota to claim that jobidnis all mentally well when we can clearly see that he is not here's ami clubachar over the weekend i was on a air first one with the presa going for mind one to i is con an for going from washin tan the tutor with cone for an interest structure project and i was with the president for over an hour and talked about many thing the mastic an tarnation he was jokes his re coils good it was the fame experience that my colic had who tout with him for hours memo cretin me publican about the mid only a few weeks ago he is totally vine scoring t my clubtrare and here don't continue to maintain this because again if you believe the jobidonis the fourteenth rats president of all time and the brogabom was number seven then how is it possible for jobidon to lose to donate trump but teem widen does realize that there is some badpolling numbers for him and he is now going to try to pull off a reset according to acids they see his state of the union address is a big public recent moments or god luck with that have seen a land a state of the unions over my time watching politics which is several decades at this point and leprosy there has never been a state of the union that acted as an actual reset for a president there been good ones and there been bad ones it rarely acts as a signal moment a not there on to try to relaunch jobidon good luck with that they are launching the blackberry again ins the middle of the phone market according to axis many tope democrats are convinced that if the election were held to day join would lose a rematch with former present and trump bison's state of the union address is probably going to future some interesting moves including for example an attempt to change the debate with regard to immigration jobidon is now considering an executive order on emigration that would effectively try to prevent more mass immigration into the united states he is going to do this just before the election an attempt to take the issue off the table now there is a pretty significant problem with that which is of course that is a tacit admission that he could have done that all along but again jobidon is realizing that he is vulnerable and sonant democrat even though thy really do not want to believe it and again because this is a battle of good for sis evil according to democrats that means it is time to break glass in case emergency the emergency is here another are now breaking the glass and that means that they're intention all the hounds of how on donate trump not just with regard to the criminal legal cases against him but of course last week we saw in insane fine levied by judge rather an grow against donate trumps at business the trump organization this an insane judgment if this judgment his three hundred and fifty four million dollars and damages just to keep what this case was the accusation by attorney general of the state of new york latish names was the donate trump fraudulently inflected his real estate holdings in an attempt to gain loans from private actors there is no allegation that donate trump did not pay back this ones there is no allegation by the people who actually gave the loans that donate trump ought to be prosecuted there you have a case against him because they did not suffer any damages this is basically the same thing as if you went to slender and you suggested that rehouse was with more than it actually is worth and they did not bother to do in a phrasal or they did not a prase and their prase came back and it was keno within margin of error or at least it was high enough a they decide end what booming market misthrow the don't you anyway and then later the state came back at you and decided to fine you for a high multiple of whatever the lone was according to enbisynews the judge who presided over the civil business fraudtrile against trump on fridge order the former president his sons at business associates and company to pay more than three hundred and fifty million dollars in damages and temporarily limited their ability to do business in new york and run of course had precept this thing was perfectly obvious from the get evasion is this trial laid out he said trump is guilty and i was just a question of how much money he is going to force trump to pay according to new york attend generalities names they said that with are judgment interest that judgment totals over four hundred and fifty million dollars and in order for trump to appeal yes to come up that money that is the why the process works in new york it is not as tough you get to hold that money in a dance pending an a peal in appeal you wouldimagine with and with the overturning of this particular insane verdict remember no damages were pledge is a bazar statute in which the state of new york can charge you with fraud not criminally civilly which requires a different standard of evidence criminals beyond a reasonable doubt civil is preponderance of the evidence which means they just have to show bi a majority of the evidence the donate trump was fraudulent about his real estate holdings and then they can find him four hundred and fifty million dollars based on very damages which is obviously an attempt to bankrupt him it is obviously an attempt to make him non liquid in advance of the election make him liquid ate his assets crating an about another bunch of headlines create lack of cash low for hims we cannot actually defend himself in criminal cases around the country it is an absurd absurd attempt what should being legal attempt we it is a more on this in just one second first have been talking bout my relics mattress for years have had that heliksly mattress or o would debated this one it is the gift that keeps on giving s i have a lot of issue tho keep made from sleeping namely four small children and every nigh when i get in abet and o falseleep headway which is why i really appreciate my relics mattress you will too go

ruling also bars trumpet his company from even applying for any bank ones for for three your he cannot even get a bond for this thing a normal firstwell who can give a bond in the the am out of four hundred fifty million dollars normally when you ye get charged with something or if to me with the money you get a bond the bond is re payable in a certain period of time andyou'r talking about you o ten grand and i talk about four hundred fifty million dollars when your entire business organization has been voided for doing business in its home state for three years which means he is going to have to come up with a bunch of money obviously an run also ordered the continued appointment of an independent honor and the installation of an independent a record of compliance for the company trump called it in illegal in america judgement against me my family and my tremendous business he said the decision is a complete antotalsham that of course is true his sons were also ordered to pay four million dollars a piece it also bars them for running the company hat's obviously what this is about and by the way this is stacked a top the judgement in favor of egg carol the least credible witness of all time probably in the amount of eighty three million dollars civil trials where donate trump now does money amount to well over half a billion dollars all of that initiated since he lost the presidency in nonmember of twenty twenty this is of course in insane judgment it is clearly political as the walsterturnal editorial board points out they say that this is using a hell fire missile to a annihilate a shop lifter there was no real financial victim lutitia names campaign for office promising to find true guilty of comping and well this is initiating a lot of onset and some blow back there are a m there r bunch people wore suggesting that they are going to initiate travel boy cost of new york there was a call by one person online for an attempt by truckers not to ship their goods into the city of new york that seems to hae falling a part here it is this person calls him of chico ray he put this up when viral over the week century was i do down i e a fridge o becks iron when i ti tat focus ta i war a i a you u u know my grant in stein yo no go or yin or my the you know you its i it's not no i oil figured here not no were a any movement i going not any i ta sir you know going any to one ere i at i why why i an ta i let you get noway you knot let us what e it i us a i stay wit tremor pe an oil true taro that eh will there be civil disobedience an he says no right but you could see something more likelier ghana we happenings every business person in new york who remotely affiliated with any republican positions can pull the money if you are living in new york right now and you're affiliated with the trump campaign an anyway to give money to the trump campaign you are in a rush down to florid as fast as humanly possible you breakout to see a money drain in the state of new york that is on to make the last few years pale in comparison because if you believe you can live in new york and not have your property expropriated by a judge for what is kind of normal real estate business wheeling and dealing that operates round the edges in new york must be real about how realist it operate to new york we exactly you stick around in new york for all of that meanwhile federal agencies the called deep state they are attempting to insulate their own regulations against the possibility that trump becomes president again now this is the problem it the autocratic state in a hated by wider willow you have basely an independent body of regulators who work for the democratic party and who are just going to ignore whatever trump tries to do now at trump is pledging to do is these pledging to bring them under the umbrella a federal law that lows him to fire people and he totally should he absolution if you comes president of the united states regulators for are tempting to inshrine in law permanently regulations that out live jo bison those people should be fired immediately don trump is right about that there doing their dames to try and thwart trump should he become president according to politico president jobiaens allies are getting any about his administrations pile up of unfinished environmental rules burns agencies are facing a deadline the spring to finish some of the most important regulations to insure a republican congress in whorehouse can not erase them next year complicating matters is the fact that the deadline will not be known until months after the rules are completed now how is that even legal how is it legal for them to right regulations that are unrepeatable by congress in the president of the united states is there's in is there an independent body in the constitution of the united states that is allowed to create revyou free regulations that lined all of us without the in put up note their boss the president or they are boss the congress that is insane but they are openly reporting that the regulatory state is attempting to inshrine and law all of these regulations to avoid donate trump's presidency that is of their attempting to do again because this is a fight against evil according to these people and they will use any means at their disposal meanwhile obviously on the foreign front things are falling in to absolute sheer chaos tan it is chaos on all sides and it is really quite hideous donate trump put out a statement over the week end on the death of nevalney alert in of alnhese all less are not nevolney of course was almost certainly murdered by the gremlin he was wafteror he was attempted that they tried to kill him back in twenty twenty one when they tried to kill him and failed then they then arrested him he came back to russia they arrested i immediately the a methirtier sentence they sent him to the geology and then they almost certainly murdered him in t the the turn contemporaneous reports coming you suggest then nevalneys had body had signs of bruising this going to metro u k several officers from the maybe that is luscious intelligence service which is the air t the c b visited the poler wolf prison camp earlier this week according to activist at the human rights group pelage date before the opposition for your drop dead age forty seven on fridge the organization claim c c t d cameras were shut off at the complex in the hours before his death as well as suggesting the speed at which the authorities made comments on the incident was deeply suspicious a well prepared statement liken by the organization to o pressrelies was issued by the prison two minutes after his death was supposed to have taken place two minutes and seven mates later the drumlin spokesman demethree pesos was addressing in the country's press if that is not what happens after a person dies of natural causes it does not take to government two minutes to announce is death it is more on this in just one second first no one to talk about life insurance but it is really really important you need to include it in your financial planning for this year start chopping right now if policy genius find the it policy to protect your family to day give yourself the peace of mind that comes with knowing tat if something were to happen you your family can

over to policy genius tot come lash paper or click the link in the description at your free life entrance quotes much could save that is policy genius do come slash chipiro in fact an in made at the complex told the russia opposition media other prisoners were in formed of vow new had died at ten a m which is before the officially recorded death time of two seventeen p m can they described how unknown vehicles ha arrived at the prison the that before none of this should be particularly surprising these again just a few years ago they attempted to poison him it a nerve agent called movichock not only was this well documented the documentary an ah we o the can watch nevalny actually documents alevin cavalry literally calling up the people who tried to poison him and asking them what they did he pretends the here working for the government yo ask them they just tell him straight up that they poison is underwear and the they hope that that would make it into his mouth bet doing a water bottle or something and that that is exactly what happen almost died local paramedics have told opposition out that nova gas hat the euros than if ally's body is currently being held at a different facility in the same area as the prison they still not turned it over there not turning it over presumably because there will be signs of actual murder on him dulia nevalnia who is his wife she said her late husband body is being hidden these their waiting for traces of yet another of putting novachock to disappear anon a chuck is a chemical nerve avion that kills you and then eventual lay the signs of it wear off in the body the russia government thought it had worn off in the body and then the german were able actually detected last time they use sofa chuck against navalney so donate true then put out a comments on nevalney after several days of not tang anything a he said the sudden death of electing ofvolney has made me more and more aware of what is happening in our country when is a slow steady progression with crooked radical left politicians prosecutors and judges leading us down a path to destruction open borders riggdilections grossly on fear sort from decisions are destroying america where a nation an decline o failing nation maggot twenty twenty four it is there a few things to be said about this one the last half were he talks about the decline of the country and the militarization of the justice department militarization of our judicial system all of that parts true it is totally wrong for donate trump to compare that to the judicial a raiment a rest without process that two process about real charges jailing and murder of ladimerapoutent's political opponents and is wrong for two reasons one it suggest that the state of play in the united states is similar to the state of play in russia which degrades the united states things are bad the united states that nearly as bad as they are in russia that is a difference in kind and we should recognize that because again many of these probing are fixable with say elections or say with moving or say with impeachments bad judges it the same is not true remotely in russia since it is probamatics compare america o russia for two reasons one it degrades the actual stay o play in the united states when you hear journalists traveling abroad and de crying the state of censorship in the united states in russia where they literally kill the accidents that is a bad look is not true a but it also happens to down grade the scale of what is happening in russia the state of evil that is happening in russia and claimer gotten is in fact a corruptdictator a now thy become unpopular to say finds some circle i do not know why you can even make the case against america involved n you crane without talking up gotten but then again i suppose you camp because here is the thing it is in america interest to watch america get political rivals down graded in terms of military capacity it is not in america interest to watch those get political rivals goal up large segments of the globe in terms of territory and population that have control over things grain and oil making a real politic case for why the united states should basically acquires in russia military land grabs that is a very difficult case to make the only case that you are left making is effectively that russia is not that bad here that you crane is worse or what ever it is the problems russia is kind of that bad if you onto make the case that america does not have the get political interest in crane make that case but many of the people who are making that case are not really making thatches they are making broader case which that russia is not that bad that somehow gotten is a guardian of christiania or gotten is a is a a defender of of western values against secular liberalism that is not what ladies pouted is ladder gotten is a proponent of russia greatness russia greatness is largely basistorically speaking on russia land control that's been true for literally hundreds of years that is it belay pouted we will say that himself in his interview with tuckercarlsin for example he literally spent the first thirty five minutes explaining the history of of cassia's control of land at no point did you talk about won vote be spread of russia values or the i importance of christiania in fact when tuck or try to prompt him on that gash doge the question let us talk about what is in america interests at this point with regard to russia soup when what rushes actually doing at russia attempting to do on a foreign policy level is sort of recreate the red green brown alliance back at the outset of world when two tire effectively was a red green brown alliance n that alliance is in the notes an the soviets and these lamas because people forget about this but these lamas wore working the entire second world war effectively with the notes ha the new attempt by russia is to recreate that internationally and with some help from domestic friends in in other countries what that means is that in this particular vision russia astray is not red the reds would be artists people on the far left to believe that the west is in a various force in the world that everything bad that is been happening the world is some sort of weir blow back to america and those people have advocated for america an mes for a very very long times o be burn sanders who suggest that everything that happens in america is what is been driving places elsewhere and we we ought to withdraw from the world because its better for the world for america not to be involved an other parts of otherworld america in a various awards in force in the world they are joined by some people on the on the right who have sort of horse you theory this thing or america is really really bad and again america foreign policy is responsible for all the blow back that has happened over the course of times o have sort this horse shoot theory they can mutant sort of the red category then you of the greens those who be the slams let be people the molas in iron or commas or calcining loach hod or bussharsod or the soothes those groups our allied with the marks as this is why you sees say queers for palestine marching in the lest for example and then you have the rounds the rounds would be people ladmerpouten who actually is a fashion lanerpouten is not a communists his country is wrong a fasiostoligarchy if a thirteen per cent flatsacts but in order to own property and have your property be secure you have to be an ally of dictator which is the way that it works over their china by the way is in sort of the same category china is sort of picture totally communists but they're more factious than they are communists considering the they've allowed large slats of marked activity inside the countries they are more corporatist at this point than they are actually communist this anti america alliance is what ladmerpouten is actually pursuing at this when you can see it cropping up all over the globe get's more on this in just a moment first our friends i ziprgroter conducted

to ziprkrur do come slash daily wire zipper is the smart way to hire russia is now forming open a lances with the far left in south america the ben doing this for a while this is presumably we hula do silva who is supposedly the great savior of democracy according to the america left in brazil over the week end he literally said novel these daftcuot ism notion to jump to conclusions let us see what the doctor say was the citizen sick it is the case of the passenger who died on the plan coming to ethiopia who are we going to blame hula is covering fur nofvaney at the same exact time by the way his also covering for camass we should point that out in fact over the week end hula said that israel is killer and came out in fullscale the fence of comes sere he was over the weekend and by thewy they've now withdrawn their ambassador brazil has from israel here he is said what as happening in the gozistri and with the palstinian people does not exist at any other historical moment in fact that existed when hitter divide it is kill the news fullskal antistatic language here right the idea is that the news are in the new hitters and the palstinians who initiated the murderous rage fast in which they killed twelve hundred is rally citizens the still holding a hundred is daily citizens under ground in gaze right now commas could surrender tomorrow they are not obviously hula is upholding the alliance with comas with alsineaslonichy hod with the radical diplomas with vegans because he is in fact a red and his making common cause wit people ladrpootn who really is not the red any more he's mora around flanker putting because he kind of a fastest and mi say kind of i mean he has complete governmental control of literally every aspect of his society and is not fully a communes re he let us the oligarchs keep their money long as they serve his interests and you have seen this a lance grow it is it is it is a very proplama ad kcal lance for the united states then russia now controls large segments on tat least the have ben a lance with iron for example therein a lance with comas and palstinian is loach hod over the week end in fact commas was in voted by russia to visit according to the jerusalem post palsinian authority prim minister mohommed stay said over the weekend runs invited palsinian factions to meet in mascot at some point in late february mascot has already hosted a comastelegation in october an october that comas delegation with was led by senior comas member must abumarzuk mat with the russia and cranial deputyforn ministers mail bogdanov and alibageri kanji that meeting re presented a convening of interest between russia ran and compass the relationship between russia and terra groups in the silliest is quite real obviously and then you have the left in rope which is backing those interests as well for example you have soup a barrel who is the head of e for policy who says that israel should stop attack in comas now because compass is really more of an idea as pound a terra group he said quote compass is an idea you do not kill an idea you have to provide an alternative that is better which of course is absurd men nation was also an idea and then america annals killed a bleep load of antis obviously meanwhile ran is on the move as well over the weekend iron actually destroyed the others which arnaranian sued sank a brutish ship in the red sea according toe what news vieucases maritime at trade operations agents reported on money the whooshes sunk a ship travelling in the red sea sat of the port sit of much an yeoman it is the first time at since israel war on compass that a crew had to abandon their ship because of the hobbies meanwhile by the way the united states had to strike five toothy targets in hemin including an under water drone that's apology is coming from the agrarians of course or working with the ruffians according to the new times the united states struck five toothy military targets including an underway drone and who the controlled areas of lebanon sturdy according to the s military that is the first time iron back to these had employed such weapon since they began in their campaign against ships in the red sea was an unmanned under water vessel but the hobbies are receiving much of the technology directly from ran of course the formation of this entire coalition which has happened under the species of jobidon is incredibly dangerous to america interests the solution to that is not to down play what russia is in the world the solution to that is to face up to what russia is in the world and to muscularly protect america interests around the club mean war everywhere it does mean that america does certainly have an interest ins free shipping across the world wherever the cost is of the ran war it is significantly less than what happens to freedom of the seas decreases to the point where every ship is avoiding the red sea and the seas

surrender an afkanastan to the eighth century thugs were the caravan and now's a turns out in surprising we remember that time that jobidon said that albino would never be an afghanis tan again that we had achieved our purposes a spoil or let they are afghanistan again according to the jerusalem post the agita terrorist organization is having a surgeon in afghanistan under the ruling talisman setting up eight new training camps alongside five ma dramas is comic educational institutions around the country that is a report from the can security council from canary the report said the training camps are located in serious provinces including coney watchman partan an outgun shall solicited sites posed balata to move its operatives in and out of neighboring iron and said that a new base to stock pa weapon my has been establish in the posture valley north of the capital of call again what we are watching in real time is a in a lines of convenience in russia in china and it is including iron and those countries idea seeking to make common cause with left wine countries in south america and in abri a as well to create effectively in anti america block that is what has happening in real time that is been led off by the era of jobidon surrender laden politics there is a lot of attempt er by the way to pass this off as the result of trump but let us be real about this a on was fairly contained while donate trump was president of the united states they are quite fearful russia was fairly contained while dona trump was president of the united states they were fearful if not of his metric then of his in predictability china was not exactly certain what dona trump was going to but they are perfectly certain of what jobidon is going to do and that is put up a soft show of force slow walk aid to america allies racily because the democratic party is vacillating this is why wen jobidon tries to suggest for example that the blood of elegy novalney is on the hands of re publicans that is an amazing statement he is the current president of the united states if the president get's the credit or blame for what happens while he is president i notice that this old date is the current present of the united states there he was over the weaken h ha whale o o sis that i would not use that turn there making a big mistake not responding says join i notice that you said that you were going to have harsh responds for navalney if he died that something a jobidon said when vote return to russia and then valley was immediately arrested in geology cordon said there would be significant repercussions for russia should that happen shouldn't one be murdered well now if alley bee murdered and jobidon are not down bleep but again this ate broad scale problem for the united states and it is a conflict of vision with regard to form police outside the form policy tomato reunited states breaks down into least for camps first there are the reckons have sort of an outsized roll in the america imagination because f the warned rock the no consequentially made the argument the willsonian argumenthat t as america job to preserve in foster democracy everywhere on earth regardless as to whether it was in america direct or indirect interests that effectively america values had to be spread no matter what and that the safest world was a world in which america valley's predominated even in places that were very unfriendly to america values that school of thought has basically gone by the wayside and anybody who says t e word no con right now with regard to the vast majority of politicians is is just talking nonsense vas majority of politicians even on the on the for of hawkish right were not in favor for example of the war in libya or direct america involvement in serial and many of them are not in favor of for example heavy involvement event in crane today hope again the the of no con idea was thoroughly defeated by donate trumpet twenty sixteen and was rather significantly described about the worse rock that that school of thought i would say has been largely marginalized then there is the sort of real politique school of that which is their certain conflicts in which america does have an interest and tat does a mean boots on the ground means sometimes money it mean sometimes boots on the ground depending on just how strong those interests are an america does in facts have foreign interests an america must apply its leverage in strategic ways in order to achieve those interest that means getting involved in some conflict with money a funding new crane to stop russia from taking over reeve but not necessarily throwing money down the manhole of attempting to have the tackle of a crime which is not going to happen for example id count myself in the real politique camp of america foreign policy those are two groups then you have the isolationists isolationists sort of suggest that amebic has no interest in what goes on around the world what is happening anywhere an america interests are simply domestic and that any dollar that is spent outside of america borders is therefore a bad dollar i thing this is short sighted and wrong but you understand the tendency it is short sighted in the sense that america actually does have a very strong interest in for example freedom of the sees america has an incredibly strong interest in how for example oil flows around the globe that does effect america citizens america does in fact have a very strong interest in america allies being prevented from falling or being destroyed or being significantly harm because those allies are the ones wo are going to come to our defends if god forbid the re an attack on the united states or their bunch of foreign interests that exists i think the isolationist position is untenable and when people suggest that it somehow immoral that foreign in general is immoral i just under what hey would a set about the marshall plan was the marshal plan moral the marshal plan literally rebuilt all of western rope if it dad not happened then the soviets out have taken all of western rope withthat we in fine also icing the answers yes i think that is incredibly short sighted but that isolationist wing is is a third wing and then there's the fourth horseshoe theory wing of foreign policy and the horseshoetheory wing is occupied men increasingly large segment of the left and shockingly in a small but increasingly large segment o the right and that horseshoe theory wing is not isolationist in the sense that is just not an america interest to be involved in foreign policy it is the idea that america itself is deeply flawed and bad and that every act that happens brought is a result of the evils of the united states of of passed america interventionism of america foreign interests and that america should retreat from the world not because it is in america interest to do but because in the world's interests for america to do an that theory involves the propping up of terrible dictators it involves the leaving in power of some o the world's worst people it involves leaving allies out to dry right that sort of stuff is the forth wing of america politics and the problem that we are seen right now is a conflation of various wings o america politics on all sides of the of the various miles let us be clear when it comes to jo bison's foreign policy jobidon's form policy vacillates between sort of what he thinks is the real policy and the horseshoe theory if vacillate strongly between those two poles because that is where the democratic party is split between the real polity there is some democrats who still understand thatamerica has foreign interest and those democrats for example support foreign aid to crane and israel by and large and then you have the democratic wing the a sort of the radical young people who believe that america is bad and terrible in the world and basely should revert to its own borders and then open those borders and that wing is very promise that is thou a she eft to lead wing who the democratic party the is a very real wing and you seen the bide administration because jobidon cantactuay bridge that gap vacillating between the two positions wildly and that has led the rest of the world to conclude that america is in fact quite weak and the rest of the world is not necessarily wrong on that score meanwhile as far as the republicans who jobidon is blaming for all of this it doneclear exactly at the republican party is doing at this point because the republican party has laid out various different views of its own on exactly what america for policy should look and you actually have members are probably all four wings of the foreign policy establishment that i just described in the republican party yo one members of two wings in the democratic party you members are probably all for wings in the publican party if a small niche for no conning a very large real policyquing ye a a a small but growing isolationist wing andyou have not even smaller but still growing wing of horseshoe theory folks and the publican party is split between all of those which leads to a vary confused and confusing take on what foreign policy ought to be doneclear exactly was going to happen the use representatives all i would say is is it in america interest for russia to take you cranehole not for russia to maintain that non base or crime and and the war i think everybody if they could make that deal happen hose of rational mine wants that deal to happen the question is whether ladies gotten once that deal to happen i see no indicators at this point that he does he believes the west is going to collapse why dos he believe that only because of afghanistan a because of he atom and because of rock an because every major foreign policy commitment at the west has made over the course of the last forty years certainly since the end of the cold war has largely ended with the west retreating to its own boarders and the various powers taking territory whether time about hong long rid tong madafcannistan ladder puts simply playing for time meanwhile again the re publicans fore a split on the for of s of their not sure exactly wat to do represented my turner who the had of the house intelligence committed of oho he says that that right now the husespeaker is trying to clear of house for u crane ad but having have time of it as president silently has been asking for the take in to tower for five month now has speaker on thinking you any issuant that he is going to bring you can aid to the floor with present johns has made a number of public statements committing ut to fine thing by halfway for the end free crane i believe him i think that we will and this does meed to get don this is absorb critical for you as support for you crane and to oppose russia aggression an we we will find out but one big problems of course that because all the parties are split along various lines not even clear what people want from you crane according to politico people in music there is music security conference and a bunch people showed up from various countries enter mark warned democrat a virgin n share of the sent intelligence committee said that the aid package being considerably quoting what a game change or for you crane but he did not make clear exactly what victory even look he declined to say that the support would insure you cranial triumph instead my just said the it was sort of the last hope it is unclear exactly what is going to happen in you crane an this part the problem tor bin his kinin articulated what an and looks in you cranes we you are seeing the rising isolationist horse show theory wing cops you do in fact have to tell your own citizens what the hello plans are when you spend significant amount to foreignade abroad even if you want o say as i would say that we are better off funding you crane to stave off a russia taking of reeve with the less than one per cent of money that we spent on our federal budget every year and fairly insignificant percentage even of our defense budget to basically restock our shelves grease the wheels in terms of getting our military production capacity up to up to snuff i even i don't make that argument make the argument nobody's making any these arguments truly annoying to be meanwhile china f course is seeing a bunch of weakness according to the wall street journal the chines military had a giant military exercise about three months ago in the south chase in the philippic we actually the philippic we which they swap of the pacific ocean east of titan was the sight elite of a decisive air craft carrier battle an world ware two between the united states angepanic carriers are now once again gathering there and for good reason control of the phlipine we would be prized in any conflict between the china and the united states over titan or the south chase us worship's troops and supplies to played from basion glamor we would likely need to transit through that aria and chino mud want interrupt those flows your seeing the chines attempting to take control of that particular location in october of twenty twenty three chines air craft carrier and four o the worships did at drill there in september they did another drill in this particular area in canary the united states held to drill there an fascination at home leads to foreign aggression ladies linen famously suggested that his form policy was probe with bayonets push where there is mush america enemies know that they being an awful lot of mush at this point i get meanwhile on the america domestic front america resell problems continue to be seen in the halls of woke academia is an amazing interview that was done with the free press by rolling friar roll fire is a hazard professor we became the youngest black per an ever to be a word tenor and ivy league school at the age of thirty he says that he faced his threats and had he at arm security after he published a study in twenty sixteen showing no racial bite in police involved shootings in fact his research found that officers were less likely to should black people than a white people in similar situations although the difference was not statistically significant as the epic times points out he said i let the day to talking i do not care what at cost but then apparently he told berrywiss the editor of the free press in the founder of it he told her that he expected his research to show different conclusions ut when the research showed no bacon police involved shootings meou had a newteame of assistance and repeated the exact same study theresults were the same his hazard college told him not published because they were worked that he would ruin his grew he did run it an in fact it did ruin his career former hazard president clouding gay allege that fir's conduct with regard to one of his aids exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet expectations and who suspended from hazard two years after being accused of engaging i duo unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature he denied all that obviously here is that poland fir discussing with verywise what at means to cross the establishment one of these universities one of the details in this story is that you ere suspended by woman who i had never heard of until recently her name is cladding gay and she said this in a letter to the economic department at the time professor friar exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet the expectations of conduct within our community and was harmful to the well being of its members the totality of these behaviors is a clear violation of institutional norms and a betrayal of trust of the hazard community i guess i when ask do you believe in karma a heres from and also does calling for the jeniside of news constitute bulling and harassment yester no a fault an for s again the fact that that is hard to say at hazard university but get rid of roman fire was very easy to say at garvey university is demonstrof where racial politics currently stands in alter the week an droyrid had herself a a sane and solid dey she suggested that she deserves reparations did dropped am which is weird since her parents are emigrants to the country and are not in fact america sense of of slaves here is droyrid talking about race in america to be a black person in twenty twenty four in america is to be in a state of complete perplexed confusion about what is wrong with a country that hates your history to this day cannot admit even the basics of what was done to your ancestors cannot accept any responsibility for the lack that has carried through the entirety of the existence of you in this country y and think sixty years of relative freedom is enough and to find out that literally bronco mama's two terms in are as president are your reparations and tuneteent which you already celebrated anyway is your reparations and yet you build this country you literally physically built this country and yet the attitude toward you from a lot of your peers and your fellow citizens is just shut u and be grateful as let us be clear about doited she did not physically build this country in fact nobody of this generation as physically built this country to be realistic you are talking about whether in fact slaves worth predominant drivers of the america economy in the antebellum euros and others from pretty hotly fought economic debate over this the typical answerer is no actually slavery is a drag on economic productivity pretty much everywhere that it is practice but put aside that entire argument drop read saying this taking nohow it is very difficult to be doited is pretty astonishing considering again her dates from congo on her mamas from guyana anta and she is a multimillionaire but this the state of our racial discourse in the united states ardyfolks coming up we

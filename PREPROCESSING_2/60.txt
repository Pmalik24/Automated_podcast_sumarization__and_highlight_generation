they showsponserba express vision is time to stand up against biota protect or data express vipianti cams lashes yesterday sand a majority leader chuck summer of new york took to the floor of the senate to de cry antisemitism stumer is not in amazing source on this particular topic given his consistent support of the middle to polishes on most antiseptic president in modern america history arakomama none the less he spoke about the threat of antisemitism and in a rare moment of quasionesty he actually mentioned the problem of antisemitism among liberals here is what he had to say i feel compelled to speak because ism the highest ranking jewfish elected official in america in fact the highest ranking jewfish elected official ever in america history and i have noticed the significant despairing between how jewfish people regard the rise of antisemitism and how many of my non jewfish friends regard antisemite are taking advantage the propalistinian movement to that's house hatred and bigotry towards jewfish people but rather than call out this dangerous behavior for what it is we see many of our friends and fellow citizens particularly young people who yearn for justice unknowingly aiding an abetting their cause note the language there they're people hi jacking the propalistinian movement the hi jacking it the young people they are they're good hearted they just do not know what they do summer actually explain that the phrase from the river to the sea a genecitl call to destroyalgews was actually just ignorance plenty of people summer actually said champ that phrasepot not because they hate jewfish people but because they support a better future for palistinians of course that is a i and to particularly egregious li when summer himself is that zero to say about antisemisfrshudtoleban o can oar inside his own packs for example there a some people last night chancing from the river to the sea in new you city while they attempted to stop the lighting of the christian tree at rokofeller enter last night to these look good hearted but slightly misinform people to you in he wan actin in these officers fit outside rockofeller enter sorry according chucshimer they are just to passion about the propalistinian cause that they are not antisemitic they are not radical in any way there t ignorant liberals they're never the bad goes according to chuchimer what we are watching is precisely the mentality created by the world of leftist ideology answer knows that but he have to my about it because to recognize the roots of letting antisemitism would be to destroy the progressive ideology wholesale that left this ideology is based on a matrix of oppressor verses oppressed that in any given situation the powerless are pressed and the powerful are the oppressors that oppressor oppressed matrix maps directly on to a ntysemetic conspiracy theories about jewfish power news are judo wite because news are financially well off and israel is disproportionately successful and really unsuccessful region of the world the oppressor oppressed metrics simply does not fit the news who are actually being victimized by widespread new hatred in the middle east and abroad but who also are very successful to the left keeps pushing the li that is also true of the anti dephamationlly which put out a pull yesterday with hill international which is a college group asking college student if diversity equity and inclusion should cover anti jewfish prejudice diversity aquatic inclusion d e i is the rubric under which the left pushes the idea that unequal group outcomes are the result of systemic discrimination by that mat news are thebeneficiaries of systemic discrimination be of course there disproportionately successful d i simply cannot include news because d e basic logic forbids it d i opposes meritocracy it opposes performance it opposes success none the less the eighty four per cent of jewfish students an seventy five per cents of non jewfish college students said news should be included in d e i training that news should be somehow included in the oppressor oppressed metrics on the side of the oppressed of course these students say that what ell susacklly would they say the premise of the question is deeply food only one answer is possible to say the jaws should not be included in d e i would be to discriminate against news which violates the supposed basis of d itself but to include news explodes the entire d e i superstructure because again d i is based on the idea of oppressor overseas oppress and news are included on the side f the oppressed how are they successful these students are saying what they are expected to say surd the news can be included in the victim class without recognizing the central truth of d e i it is a scam victim hood is not inherently connected to level of success sometimes the powerless are evil sometimes the powerful are good sometimes the power lis are actually victimizer sometimes the powerful are the victims he cannot fight antisemitism with d i e can only increase antisemitism with d i because the entire frame work is conspiracy theory the only way to truly fight antisemitism is to recognize with the bible says in heteronomy quote the shall not be partial to the poor or diner to the grate but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor but that is the one thing chucktumer and the ad el will never say base again t would violate their ideology instead people on the left will pretend the true anti feminism does not lying in oppressor oppressed matrices but in people can musk ad they'll target him specifically because he does not d i they will claim that d i is the way to fight antisemitism wo give e on musk fights d e that means he is bad they'll slander him is an antiseptic even as he goes to israel to express solidarity with the family of murder news they'll try to activate advertisers to pull their money from twitter supposals because e on us is the root of all antisemitic evil melon musk to his credit is fighting back against this here is a clip yesterday vegan muskcutan absolute classic his being asked about advertisers

explaining that he to see the paws that has been created by negotiations between israel and commas a costar then they won we that extended more hostages our release then the big question here is whether this a prelude to western pressure for israel to enitofensive against commas completely which is insane as well talk about momentarily here's blinking yesterday wed to see the pasextende because water is unable first an foremost is postage is being release it is also in able us to u to surging monitor sis in to people gazer who best telly need nay again the the idea here is is that just ta pass tat does the united states suddenly expect the israel going to stop what is doing israel cannot top what is don no and in fact they came very close to abying the sense fire last night because come ass literally waited until five minutes before the deadline to come up with new hostages and what what commons is doing right now is unbelievably evil it it is as evil is what they did it october seventh is just in emotions on october seven they murder twelve hundred people and they canned another two hundred forty and now they're separating families out they're saying that some people are dad who are still live there somewhere saying some peoplewar live are are actually dad and an you while they are pursuing terror attacks literally this morning in israel israel time there is a terror attack is in the the a major highly traffic street corner injerusalem at a stop and i you can see these are two brothers from each jerusalem who identify with commons come ostocredt or this attack they get out of their car and they start mowing down a bunch of people who are at a stop they ended up killing three people including a pregnant twenty fore your woman they were shot by people who are on the scene reserves who shut up with their guns o a a a civilian who is off duty and who ends an up shooting them three dad six injured supposedly this is n the middle of a see fire come ass took full credit for this come essays this is a good thing and yet israel is supposed to keep going with some sort of pause to get the hostages but i got say there is a moral question is whether israel should or can continue to do this sort of routine these again what is happened o the hostages is horrible and evil and continues to memorable and evil at the same time is the life of the hostage any more valuable than the life of that twenty four your pregnatwoman who just murdered on a street working jerusalem which presume ley would not have happened if israel were continuing it is military operations to defenestrate comas speaking of the treatment of the hostages it is amazing to watch as world and international organizations pretend that the hostages were treated well in some way a let levy whose the poke person for thy usually government he says a no the hostages were not in fact held in reasonable conditions as the thefitee of home captivity return ho over the lost went were beginning to discover new ceiling details about life as was hostages am of course not at liberty to satin formation from the official investigations but the evidence of the families have been sharing with the media is chilling the hostages were not held in reasonable conditions as some have vicinity can or children were serial abused just homos reported its own crimes against humanity on october seven it continues to do not hutment its own atrocities releasing footage of crowds terrorizing the hostages in the final moments of captivity those sense bringing to mind that scene from game of thrones and cans of the a series cult of course not ten an talking about of course the hostages were not held in reasonable condition what else you expect from i terrorist group that the simple fact of matter is that the hostages were treated precisely as you would expect come of to treat the hostages will get to that in just one second first have got a holiday if that ya it is sure to make

destroying humans they continue make a variety of arguments the gain israel considering going back in they are going to have to the only question is when and they re bunch of people predominantly on theft for attempting to make the claim the israel should stop they're complaining that after commons no one knows what comes next that is a heard accusation cause prettimich everybody knows what comes

when confronted with bare facts heres chis haze them as and be we picking up racial matters glass of putting them on anta and then playing thevillegitiat there is a question of what comes after people

a dedication ratification in ode to what is i down the is vice ad inefification yet be was ripe now the to advents from the age since that since they on from ego to see satin they a in the kind ofgagan we siting the scold there been educated to slated us wit is how do being had decant all do respect what all affect women to say thus wether that is true or not its is to you can potash to can her ten de get for we at tin the so there are is a acts tear finland thousand people have done there have been children who have does this is not in is w i for ta the scared but my why question is what i hear from you is not yo bin was we ate to restart the twustapesuotion but i hear from you when i hear from most of his really political leaders in the center right and the collision government is no mamas no pie i may be their actual collision and we will manage the occupation in perpetuity and we will sell the west bank and that is can you will have to de with them gan you will have to deal that crease then goes on to suggest we denying self determination to these people it is worth pointing out this point that cries hes ridiculous assumption that self determination is some how old to every single group regardless of the eagles of their believe system is extraordinarily dangerous did uses deserve self determination had is bola haw the white premises ha sees round every corners they deserve self determination but north back cases point e left continues to push the idea that the palisinian grabs in the assess drip in wetback are somehow magically a moderate group simply dominated by a few terror masters i know this a very flattering met the left that h west protected we love to tell ourselves the smith an this is the will be greeted as liberators in roc with s the same thing from the bush ministration here is the pendragons spokes person saying just that course the israel is are taking in to a count innocent civilians an that is why again in all of our calls ah that the secretary has with his counter apartment air goat we continue to urge of course for the protection of innocent civilians wherever they are in gaze and and again we have to remember mama does not represent the palistangan people and they shut it a the palistanan people deserve true leadership an and and again mamas really should be rooted out from than gaze o a the idea that they do not represent the palistinian people is a my there is precisely zero evidence the comas does not represent the palistonians that zero no evidence of that fact does not mean their all terrors it means they do support a terrors group period they elected comas and then by every vailableple since then the supports including in westbankuer homes is not governed for all the people hours tang you cannot trust the poll results in gas fine do not trust those pool results trust the pol results in west bank with a palmitin authority is the governing entity then there is the complain that the left is lodging that israel must stop its campaign against comas in order to minimize civilian casualties as we repeatedly discuss is you tries to do that but to folks on this question gives total leverage comas because comas does not care at all the here zero about that topic finally the left complains that international institutions are being hampered in their efforts to help well let us talk a little bit about these called international institutions they are a sick joke they are broken thy are broken because there is no such thing as an international community there can be no community with tyrannical hellholes and people who support terrorism and yet apparently long as you say the magic words international humanitarian institution everybody's suppose to bow and scrape before you as though you are in fact good hearted saint doing wondrous healing work more often than tot more often than not the term international humanitarian organization is a tremendous lie take for example the united nations the better dis grace that is the men is nothing new of course the u in came into being in the after at world ore too when the west was seeking to end all conflict the international diplomacy as literally all o historysence that has shown that plan was a giant failure it turns out the best guarantor of international safety and security is a strong had gnomonic western power namely the united states whenever the u en has been intrusted to guaranty safety an security it has failed in core in rwanda in goslavia in the sing desert in lebanon literally everywhere whenever you in peacekeepers

garbage and or tools of comose the unbelief and works agency for example the only agency in the men dedicated to one specific group people palistinian a refuge s and i put refutes in quotes there because we are now talking about the great grand children of people move three miles down the road into the gossip trip has funnel billions of dollars to palistinians including terogroups in fact since nineteen ninety four the united states has sent over ten billion dollars to the palistinians the united states supplies nearly thirty per cent a u and our waw bugged historically u and our a work for it consists of tens of thousands of palistinians living the gossip trip including many terrorist and terror suborns as we talked about on the show when the trump administration cut aid the u an our w way the state department sad quote the fundamental business model and fiscal practices that if marked u and our w way for years tie to u and our ways endlessly and exponentially expanding community of en title beneficiaries is simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years the bid administration quickly restored aid to the and our w way but now the u and our way is giving western powers heartburn again that is because of reports that one of the child hostages hell becomes was actually being held by a u and our waw teacher barely given any food and no medicine by the way that would be the kind of person teaching at the schools the chrishasenies are actually teaching at the schools when a la chicane in that clip tells crusades the people are being in indoctrinated by teachers from the and up w anise well even if these literally one of those teachers was holding a hostage a child hostage in his attic no wonder the blundistog for of fair committees frank mar rose strip in germany as she called on the german government to cut aid to the u an our w way it is not just the you and up way that is the problem here is saran tendril deputy executive director for you and women that is a western organization that has not bothered to condemn compass's mass rape of his ran women on october seven her sh was being question by the angola drag of signed if therein tho tea that you cannot specifically call out home and the mounting evidence now over seven we that is rarely investigators ho collect they that we shown our tour about the acre at they committed specifically on october seven the as i think that the crop of the issue here if's not just condemning factual violent against the women and in any war in general i pethificaly what a card on october seven perpetrated by mamas indeed you an women always support impartial independent investigations into any feria allegations of gender were sectional violence and within t u an family these investigations are led by the office of the high commissioner human right and just to provide a little bit of contract intuits of human women run you an women sticky cervix and hi an the knowledge on gender violent and prove support investigations as we do with all man investigation us me an know on condemning compass that is an awful lot of word tell to avoid condemning cams but what else would you expect mar humanitarian organizations take is another example the international red cross because the international committee of the red cross requires the help of groups compass even work in the gosistrib they and up as tools of comas the iciarcy has spent little or no time condemning comosprats other see of the atrocities instead they focused on israel action in gaze the iciarcy also failed to report the facts which they knew about as daily hostages being held at rosin hospitals even as the international media lied that those hospitals were civilian sights meanwhile the iciarcy has not fulfilled one of the key components of israel original hostage deal with comas verification of life and health of the hostages being held by mamas that failure has had particularly tragic consequences in the case of the betas family the ware kidnaped from a village called near gods father yardman mother sheer four yearly are and ten monthly feer ore taken to gaze there is the footage of them being abducted you can see there is mom carrying these two red headed kids as comas kidnaps them they're physically healthy there are obviously healthy when taken but nobody knows if they are alive earlier this week it was reported that the family was treated the popular front for the liberation of palestine another terrors group by homes and then yesterday homes plane the family had ben killed by his daily boys where is the ice jersey too testified to any of this deny it verify there absolutely missing instead the iciarcy the wonderful humanitarian organization has become a shuttle service for is daily hostages helping comose release the hostages as gowan crowd's cheer in blood thirsty fashion there is more of that last night do notary folks the palisonian a population they hate compass which is why they are literally jeering mocking cheering filming the release of israel hostages mostly women in children is a wonderful moderate who deserve self determination obviously the world will be a better place if they ad a state the international humanitarian institutions have beckoned themselves in the current israel comaswar but they ware suspect lone before that its just the radical muscles in the left town press have wondered lies into public view by adding the imprimatur of the magical international community to corrupt institutions riddled with political radicals and corrupt functionaries in just one second on a talk about international institutions in international politics because a lot of what you are seeing to day in the o bits about henry passenger is predicated on people's views about particularly this subject last night henry kissengerdied there is a hundred years old am ad metal very briefly once and i had interviewed him once its agenda being taped am he is a fascinating character obviously very checked character a lot of the decisions he made were extremely cold need extremely cold eyed lot a people ranging from anchovy jordan too christopher kitchens condemned him as war criminal for his decision making during the vixen administration with regard to for example the intention invasion of east tremor or the america intervention on behalf of pinochle in child and nineteen seventy three but or are the bombing of cambodia by the same token how you view kissonger is very much reflection of how you view international politics as a whole and the reason the this is broken t own sort of a left right to vide despite the fact that passenger's history was very checkered in terms of left right decision making for example the right does not the fact that kisser on open china what passenger who really led to the opening of china at the time as a real politic decision because he saw a gap emerging between china and russia and wheat attempting to exploit that gab by wooing china away from russia i that was the goal the goal was woo chinwag from russia remove them as a source of trade and resources four russia and you lend up weakening the russia regime which is wite the the trip to china was initiated with ninon speaking with mow in rest respect we can say and i would say that is a bad mistake at the time it is a choice between two bad decisions and this was the sort of guiding light of passenger's foreign policy to henry passenger for for those do not know much about passenger himself he was a massive celebrity in the nineteen seventies who was a secretary of state during the vixen and and jerk ford administrations according to the waste journal no a secretary of state ever achieved such celebrity while an office as henry passenger an nineteen seventy four newsreel covered depicted him as superman comic kero time called him the world's most indispensable man gallop ranged him america most admired man an nineteen seventy two life magazine spread pictured him with a bevy of actresses including oil saint john yet no former secretary of state has been more vehemently criticized of the many anti passenger books the most influential was christopher hitchenses the trial of henry kisenger which explicitly accused passenger of responsibility four war crimes and crimes against humanity in into china c lay argentina cyprus east termor and several other places whole of the boy mentioned only one other supposed crimeseen bangladesh and nineteen the soviet union only three times is nail ferguson who were biography of henry passenger talking about henry passenger he said those accusations stuck mud late in life kisser regularly faced protest at is public appearances yet the and gods with e historical record and ferguson points out that passenger was both the white house national secured adviser and the secretary of state his accomplishments included the negotiation of the first dramatic arms limitation treaty the a m treaty with the soviet union the opening to china the sees fire in yon we for war in nineteen seventy three the and of us involvement in the veanomor for which both he and north teat names counterpart the do tho were wanted the nineteen seventy three bell piece prize but here is the problem if you see foreign policy as a family of nations not a good hearted people out there they all just want the same thing but there having different ways of achieving that then hard for foreign policy looks nasty to you because the easiest thing his just washer hands everything of that if the united states just go to hands off what why were even involved in these places why'd not from the right what you hear and i think this critic is correct of henry kisenger is that henry passenger was focused on the sort of met nick and balance of power that he forgot that the united states is a global hetgimon and from the left what you hear of henry kisenger is he was engaged in the dirty game of politics in that men that the united states was constantly engaged in dirty little wars all around the world we shouldn't have ben engaged in and the reality is somewhere in between the reason of the left things that is betas the left believes that a communist regime were to arise and satin america with the beet with the help of the union that is not a bad thing if thing marks is regime in satin amebic or many marks test regimes an latimerica what is the big dead wise that a problem what is it matter if phenom turns communist why is it matter if cambodia an eastern communist why is at matter if ye seaman turns communists why is any of that matter first fall that demonstrates a complete miss reading of palforeign policy works foreign policy is a dirty terrible business in which if as i say passenger had one central foreign policy message is one riding message was avoid the worst outcome which means some times embracing the second worst outcome if you read at navy as books this kisenger's main thing was avoid the worst outcome this by the way was his recommendation n you crane when it came to you crane during this war tat is currently on going very early on he suggested at there should be an offal in you crane because everybody knew the you crane was not onto take the don bass a uremia in which you crane was given security guarantees did not formally and ternate but was given enough armaments to defend itself against a predatory russia invasion and russia was basically given dominion over the territories hit was very likely to hold anyway and this pleased it no one in the early days of the war and turns out who's rather pressing because what he was attempting to avoid was a straight up face to face confrontation between dato and russia that is what he was attempting to avoid and he knew there there were not the stones for it in the west and realize what is happening on the ground and just to it on people ripen passenger there two rips one is that he miss red particular situations he shouldhae done things differently all of that is legitimate the second rip which is just wrong is the rip that you do not have to make these sort of considerations when you make america foreign policy then america foreign policy is either most sinful foreign policy an planed earth every ill can be ascribed to it you see this in the cretin of passenger with regard to cambodia and lots for example real the the basic idea that is promoted by the left with cambodia is that passenger when he took over as secretary of state in the after mouth of it ill be chase complete botching the venom war when he came in he said we need to star bombing the communist supply lines in cambodia and you authorize mass huge bombing rads into cambodia without the approval of congress now can talk abut whether it needed congressional approval in all the rest that is fine but as a foreign policy matter did bombing cambodia cause for example the left nowclanes that that cause the rase of pull pot in cambodia that mere rouge who never e happened if we had not bored cambodia that assumes that there is no such thing as to agency in the world it is a lie it is not true the minute the united states got out of the atom cambodia fell the bullet again it is a bunch of considerations this is the the overriding message of passenger's life hat's the thing we should take away from it while still quibbling or arguing or strenuously hating many of his foreign policy decisions foreign policy is a dangerous and dirty business it is not possible to engage in foreign policy and keep your hands totally clean that is not something that you can do because there are in fact of various powers who hate you and who wish the worst for you and who will have an impact on your life whether your talking about them controlling choke points and international trade as we have talked about on the show from the straits of hormones to the straits of tigon or whether you re talk king about active military operations against the united states in far wrong places and yes indeed at home you have to recognize that the world is a complex place that requires complex choices and very often those choices are the choices of the least bad scenario and having to actually engage with the second worst scenario and that really is the story of henry messengers for policy again i agreed many the cretins from the right that sometimes who is engaging in the second worst aware when say a better scenario was available and again that is a good crinite what i do not agree with is the total isolationists or libertarian position which is that america should go hands off in the world and somehow the world will be a better place for it there is a very difficult position to maintain in the in face of the fact that again their country's all over the world that hate us that do not truth our values that seek to maximize their own power at the expense of the america people there is this weird notion that is taken root on the right and the left its this horseshoe theory thing which is that everybody who act badly in the world was somehow driven to it give the united states is why you seen the left embrace ticktocks of bosom benlawden circuit two thousand to because old he would never have done that if we had not been mean in shut yourabet ashore you see the right do the same thing with ride russia never would have invaded you grain if it had not been for our attempts to extend a helping hand to to you grain and make overtures tornado or maybe russia has a long history under vladerpoudent of territorial invasions of neighboring countries maybe it turns out that other people except for the west have agency and once you realize other people except for the west have agency t changes your decision making dramatically this true all over the world the fundamental for policy mistake is the assumption that only the west has agency the sort of echo eccentricity this political arrogance leads to ironically more death then a humility that acknowledges that other people have it interest adverse to our own andthat you have to respect those interests even if that means fighting those interests again just one second we will get to the twenty twenty four campaign which again this can be the weirdest campaign in america history first

boyscan me girls and girls can be boys to stupid idea requires jokes and that is where doing lady rollers from yours to morrow night exclusively at daily wire plus at eight p m eastern well meanwhile the twenty twenty four election continues a pase right now in the real clear politics average donate trump is up about two points there are two recent poles that have bison back up a couple of points but he is never above forty four forty three per cent in these poles and in fact in the poles where he is at forty nine or forty seven or forty six trump is up on him in those poles in other words jobidon is stuff his sealing is forty four forty five per cent and when people are forced to decision mat right now they are breaking in favor of trump in fact what the pulls are showing is not right now actually increase or decreased support for bison actually over the course of the last couple of months his support is slightly up biding in these poles the the problem for him is that all the independents are breaking in favor of trump why is that happening is because again all the focus is on jobidon and the question is going to be can donate trump keep the focus on jobidon as the selection moves forward in order for that to happen trump cannot run a revenge campaign he cannot his campaign can be a political a policy revenge campaign he is alien here are my policies jobidingot ride all of them and world is now on fire i close the boarder jordan opened the boarder i was a negotiating piece of the released jobidon has blown up all of that by legitimizing the soothes in yeomen by funding errand by restoring aid to the palstinians he can say all that he can say that the economy was going great guns before covin than even in the middle of covet the economy was recovering at a steeper pace than it did subsequently under jobidon mobile is broke all of the economic levers which is why right now the economy is running extremely hot but also we are in danger of continued baked in in elation man he can say all those things that that old be a great campaign making that campaign pagan about were you better off in twenty nineteen or are you better off in twenty twenty four that is a good winning campaign for donate trump it is not a great winning campaign for donate trump ism come in in seminar bray all the people who came after me that is not something i think the america people are for again because the best of donate trump always in rover was the version of dona trump wo said i am your tool you wield me in order to achieve certain objectives i am the shield for you but when he starts to make it about the voters being a shield for him people ten to object to that they do not want to bin in to his personal issues even if they think i do that many y of those issues are being created by the left in our false if he answer to to dona trump is being in justly persecuted is election i do not buy that i think the the answer to donate trump the trumpeting on justly persecuted is fun his legal defense fun but again he has an independent case to make that is way better than that which is wagon he is been soaring in the poles the less you see of him you have not seen him he is been gone all the folks has been on toobinonye needs to stay that way which is why i think it is particularly foolish for donate trump to go out there and start warning people about the weaponization of the dock trump put out a a giant statement on trust socially yesterday that ism twelve points up on crooked jobidon i it knowhow poll he is looking at where he is twelve points up on on i will i was my wish a wish he is not there are no pols aery's up twelve points on bison but is got the justice to apartment another suing me wherever and whenever possible weaponization it is called and maybe that can make a difference this his never been done on the scale before not in our country it opens him a very big and dangerous pandora box jobidon should stop his election interfering fugs before it is too late for him and the rest of the country as the leader of the opposition party i should not be force to campaign from inside a court house which is very durable but not very democratic or convenient this is where they want me to spend my time and money it is not to air sister is supposed to work if they file the we than he just goes on along these lines again i do not think he is wrong about any of this i just do not see why that would be the center piece of the campaign it can certainly be a part of the campaign him sanglason jobidon's a very bad president he is going to lose that is the reason he is targeting me but back to why tolidine is a bad president that is totally worth while but if his campaign is in fact about his sort sir personal venge taking a i think that can be a problem for him that is a i thought expressed by his by the way erstwhile ally have my earthy from er speaker of the house he said that yesterday said if trumps campaign is about revenge how loose i don't think that is wrong and our have my earthy this is not bad political analysis ism try not square in my brain how are you outgo feelings about him at that time and say i think he'd be a great president tent i don't say a great present i that he would be a better president what wherever i said the country would be at a better place if his campaign is about renew rebuild and restore he wen if it is about revenge he will loose that the only persona that is on to determine not is that is not his campaign at is him and and he is right about that my earthy is right about that which is why true needs to be careful now i will say trump did something absolutely kind of ridiculous that is worth noting yesterday because frankly if any other candidate tod this up trump i understand that trump has a hall pass from the entire re publican party for pretty much anything he does at this point because it is all baked into the cake of this point but donate trump did in fact in worse beaten yesterday which is in insane thing to do what happened is that done there is a prisonane markfisher who builds himself as a confounder of bedlam in rode island he said he was very honor to have his and dealer's support bedlam is apartment you organization you want dealers support i mean i understand again that everything trumps as has to be taken notches with a a grain of salt a giant easeburg of salt the a giant salt block from the dead sea i get it but can we to point out that beallim's a horrifying organization it is a giant grift not only at a giangriftits giant any metic grift and in the giant ani white grift an is really really bad sign that that this is in turns of t reckon by the way this is the part of his reckon i think that is the worst is the urinal justice reform kind of stuff the idea the he is on a jail break among people were criminals but in any case if don trump wants to win he is going to tax focus in on the failures of your bison of which there are many all get to that in just one second first the october fifteenth tartar line his already passed i know many of you might be dreading the stress of filing those taxes and once terrible

rule in presidential politics particularly campaign politics that when something goes wrong sort of everything goes wrong my friend chon pot sorites over the commentary magazine pod taxes theater of commentary making herd book in the early nineteen nineties about the bush tunes reel lac afford in nineteen ninety one nineteen ninety two and one of his basic fesses was that when a campaign is failing everything starts to go wrong all at once and that seems to be happening to hoiden right now whether it is him just wandering around on stage as a comedian share gills puts it ut a rumba when you serve confused at the end of his species an bumping into things or whether it is what happened last night the biding christian tree a just fell over there trying to put it up in a fell over again these sorts of images they do not mean anything on their own but they do when the is a general lis sort of feeling of instability and when the aristas the represents the actual presidents of the united states and it falls over again is he in to is he in charge o weather no the juesare in charge of weather is well now but when when it falls over everybody is immediately flashing to job an falling up the stairs i gent her it her's what look last night and you crib the screws local washer on is head and you make sure to equal n you stand that tree up and you should be able to walk out of that from an noble pull down sadly no one looking to me ester down got the prayer fer what you i do not know tan you red on the details about the national car draw which blur in a a well e big or what hers to think be did not put understand be plant of it that is i i on e i on e l there they are trying to poet back up again and it is are these major they are not major things obviously they are silly things but when all the silly things seem to fall in one direction that is a bad sin for the incumbent president of the united states jimmy carter being attacked wives on a not nineteen seventy nine by rabbit a rabbit la a rabbit rabbit it's t was natural thing that cabin apparently well here is the thing is not just that jobidin things are going wrong for him is that of course things are going wrong for him bees not good at the presidential according to axis evidence is stacking up strong america a saving lesson drawing down they are existing savings cushions of course they are because the more you save an inflationary economy less our money is worth i put a hundred bucks in the bank to day and then my dollar is worth fifty per cent of what it was worth six months from now have lost money by keeping my money park instead you are better off buying things this why you are seeing an accelerating rate of growths o cue three showed a five point two per cents increasing c d p that sounds amazing right that is great except the what is actually happenings everybody is preying all the materials four cut four in anticipation of the fact the prices are probably in continue to rise we had to holidays according to axis the sherefdolts who saving cover six months expense is using their savings is considerably lower than was last year according to pulling from working consul the sure that simply does not know how long their savings will carry them has grown from about fifteen point five per cent i judge twenty twenty two to twenty one per cent the spending right now is booing the economy but it is likely to crash on the other end and nobody can have savings cause their anexspent their savings because of the inflation that is really bad news and the economic news were is maxes this is why people are feeling on tentroks inflation eats everything and jor began has not ben able to tame inflation in such way the people feel secure in the economy now all the financial ex per are expecting that the federal reserve is gan actually decrease the interstates in the near future which of course there lot people wait is not inflation still running hot right now and the answers yes it is still running hot right now and if you decrease those inflation an the those interest rates then presumably you are going to get new spending you investment and all of the rest of it the on mark its jumped at this obviously because your on is worth more now than was yesterday if the interstates start o stare ta drop with that see is it any of this good news for robin's economy agent that they are stuck in a rock and a hard place on the actual policy meanwhile the re publicans are starting to go after hoiden again on the impeachment inquiry re publicans are apparently considering holding in official house vote next month to authorize the impeachment in crane to bison my earthy initiated it when he speaker of the house without in actual vote because he did not think he had the votes now grope leaders azure talking about the possibility of the vote during a closedoor meeting with republican at law makers re publican leaders have long set a vote on the impeachment investigation was unnecessary they are now re considering his white house lawyers are using the lack of the formal house authorization to argue that the in investigation lack s constitutional legitimacy the problem of course is that it isn't clear thy got the votes for that that is have get to see the evidence that it johns is significantly better whipping votes then then key my earthy was my earthy was pretty good a dad he's pretty good accounting the heads johns maybe good at it we just do not know as of yet no matter the the impeachment inquiry on top of jobidons failing presidency is not going to help him it is not and om and the wite house lot now greater battle to it here is correnchon pare yesterday trying to gout f republicans for pursuing the impeach inquiry house re public is sou really focus on a medical family is n that of the pries family that is what american's wan o see then that is once that that is hung cut it nobody bis the folks son america families not on jobidon's family first wall hoiden family is an america family and a rather key america family i will say again i think the the underbids new tactic is actually somewhat intelligent calling on the house choppy to open up the meetings i i think he is actually pretty smart because it is basically calling their bluff ye we saying listen whatever you have to come after me about let us juvenal in front of in front of everybody the house his denied that request times comber that at house overs committed he said our lawfully issue spend a hunter by and requires him to appear for s position on remember thirteen expect full cooperation with our siren of for a deposition we also were hunt terry should have the opportunity to testify in a public setting at a future day typically house kennels insist on a privates opposition before allowing the public appearance the general six select committed tod i several questions test publicly including one from rude juliany him shorten for his parts aid sure we love to have hunter in for an open herring first when yet to have in testify behind close worst we can ask him all the questions who ant ask him and those facts are confirmed by some of the evidence we have in covered already already this ten twenty three form we are the confidential human force told the et the in was recorded in this form that those are the key facts that now it is important we got allow there key facts when we interviewed one of hunter bidet's business partners mister archer it is important we talk to the others we see t talk to epic chairman we need to talk to rob walker we need to talk to tony bobolink and we are in conversations with their lawyers that we think there is a gone to happen and we need to talk the jimbiden who was also in business with hunter bide those things need to happen in then as the chairman just said as thermal comer just said we will a have hunter bison in a deposition and frankly i thinking in an open hearing i think that would be that would be great that is what needs to happen the america people get the facts get the truth an again republicans a gin we pushing here none of it is going to be particularly good for jobidon already in just a second we re in to get to the the dumbest excuse for the america national neththat have seen recently if you are not a ember become a member use coach

welcome to the supermen science science paletot m end supermen and on a professor of neurobiology and ophiology at stamford school of medicine to day were talking all about sleep and how to optimize your sleep this is a topic we have covered previously on this podcast in the episode called master your sleep however since the erring of that episode there is been some terrific new science to come out have also received thousands yes literally thousands of questions related to the specific protocols covered in that episode as well as in the episode on jet lag and shift work and while to day's episode is not specifically about jetlag an shift work we are going to cover tools that will allow you to shift your schedule if you need to for work or travel and we will also cover tools that will allow you to fall back asleep if you happen awake up in the middle of the night or if you get poor night sleep had actually recover from that poor night sleep more quickly and yes indeed even replace sleep that you have lost to day's episode is going to be filled with practical tools we will touch on some of the underlying science but it is really design to be a practical tool kit for optimizing your sleep depending on your specific sleep needs serious times throughout to day's episode i will refer to studies that form the backbone of the tools that it'll be describing but whereas most of the podcast episodes here tend to be deep scientific mechanism and then tools scientific mechanism than tools to day i mainly going to focus on the practical tools that any one indeed all people i believe should use in order to optimize their sleep why should everybody want to optimize their sleep and put considerable effort into optimizing their sleep well but simply sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance of all kinds cognac performance physical performance et camera it also controls things our mine system wound healing our skin health and our appearance whether or not we can think clearly or not whether not we will live as long as we possibly can or not whether not we suffer from dramatic age related connive decline or not in other words whether not we keep your memory as we age i could go on and on about all the terrible things that can happen to somebody if they do not sleep well thanks to the great work of professor mat walker at universe californium barely and the wonderful book that he wrote why we sleep i think the world is largely on board now that sleep is critical to our health or mental health or physical health and our performance but what is not often discuss is how great life is that is how much more focused and energetic and how positive our mood gets when we are sleeping for the appropriate amount of time at the appropriate depth and when we are doing that regularly easily everything in life gets better when we are sleeping well today ism going to teach you the tools that will allow you to optimize your sleep that is get to sleep and stay asleep fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night and a just your sleep given the various life demands you may be experiencing before we begin it'd to emphasize that this pod cast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and signs rely tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's pot cast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the sells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to elect ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any con of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element t dot calm slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el even t dot calm slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capabilities it turns out that your body temperature and your ability to fall and stay asleep are very close see related if your body does not drop by one to three degrees you are simply not going to get into deep sleep or stay in deep sleep and waking up it also turns out is related to body temperature every time you wake up in the morning your body is warming up in order to wake you up and this has an enormous number of hormonal and metabolic and other cascades that are vitally important not just to what happens while you sleep but your health and your energy and focus throughout the day eight sleep is an incredible device it is one that have been using for now six months or and it is completely transformed my sleep and i already thought i was sleeping pretty well the way it works is that you can cool or heat your mattress according to different times throughout the night for instance you can cool your mattress if you tend to run warm and that will help you fall and stay deeply asleep and then toward morning you can have the mattress programed or that i should say the mattress cover program that you warm up your sleeping environment and you wake up when you want to wake up if you have been sleeping pretty well but waking up in the mill the night you might also find that by cooling your mattress even further toward the middle of your sleep bout well you will stay in deep see much longer if you to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep do calm slash supermen to

save a hundred fifty dollars at checkout let us talk about sleep and tools to optimize your sleep i want you to conceptualize yourself as contained within a room that has only very few windows or very few entry points what i mean by this well your brain and your nervous system control whether not you move or do not move they control whether not your digesting food or your not digesting food a control wither to your stress or not stress happy er sad et camera all of that stuff that controls all that stuff is housed inside your skin and skull et camera them might seem pretty obvious but what that means is that for your brain and body to feel alert and focused ready to move and exercise ore do some work or if your brain and body are going to lie down and go to sleep well that brain and body needs cues it needs inputs to determine when to do those different things and those us an in puts arrive through a define set of what it'll call stimulate but you can also think of these as levers or tools the main levers and tools that are going to allow you to control when you are awake and when you are asleep and to get better sleep every single night are light literally photons light energy could be from sunlight could be from artificial light we will discuss those particulars in a moment as well as darkness that is the absence of light were got light and dark those are too very powerful tools to encourage your nervous system to be in one state or another meaning awake or sleep temperature is another tool or lever turns out that when your body is cooling down you have a greater tendency to fall and stay asleep in fact every night when you actually sleep your body is dropping by one to three degrees and that drop in temperature is required it is a gait that your body has to go through in order for you to get into sleep and in fact the converse is also troupe if your body heats up by one to three degrees or you will wake up you have got light dark temperature food and when we say food we mean what we eat when we eat and the amount that we eat o case o light dark temperature food exercise and of course exercise comes in different forms we can do cart vascular exercise that can be low intense long distance exercise it can be high intensity can high intense interval training it could be weight training to beyond can be swimming any number of different activities but exercise in general causes an increase in body temperature and tends to make us more alert not just during the exercise but in the immediate hours after that exercise exercised us some other things that relate to our sleep as well talk about those to day and how you can leverage them another potent lever for adjusting your sleepiness and wakefulness is caffeine course comes is no surprise to people but why and haw caffeine works might come as a surprise very briefed we have a molecule in our body called the decisive and the longer we have been awake the more adenosine builds up in our brain embody and a decisive is part of the reason why we get sleepy caffeine effectively operates as a a decisive antagonist works by basically occupying the receptor for a debasing it is obit of a combolue to mechanism but busily all you need to know is that affine prevents the actions of a decisive that is one of the reasons why caffeine makes us feel alert but how much cane we drink and when we drink affine turns out to be vitally important for adjusting hour wakefulness and for optimizing our sleep w will talk about that as well the other category of lever tools which are immensely powerful for optimizing sleep are supplements there now exist as many as eight different supplements that can powerfully modulate sleep in healthy ways and that have huge margins for safety we are going to talk about what those supplements are in previous episodes of this podcast and as a guest on other podcast have talked about three particular supplements magnesium three inmate apagenine and thiamine which together can really enhance the speed at which one falls asleep and people's ability to stay asleep and to really get into those deep stages of sleep their particularly restorative to day we are going to talk a little bit more about each of those three and how they can best be used in commination for are also going to touch on some other supplements that i have not talked about much before if at all things glycine and gala as well as and social many people are going to find an coital interesting and of particular use to them specially there falling a low carbohydrate diet or if they are fasting before sleep or just trying to avoid eating too close to bedtime and yet there having a hard time falling asleep in social also turns out to be especially useful for people who have a tendency to wake up in the middle of the night and have a hard time falling back asleep it also some interesting and potent effects on anxiety throughout the days who are going to talk about inositol as a tool as well and then last in our list of general categories of levers and tools for optimizing sleep are digital tools i say signal tools i do not nessarely mean devices what i mean are things non sleep deep rest scrips these are zero cost scrips that you listen too that take your body through some deep relaxation and that can help people both fall asleep stay asleep fall banally and get better at sleeping also going to talk about signal tools related to self hypnosis is is distinctly different from stagshypnosis i know some of you here hypnosis anything of in o people yo clacking chickens and doing things that are outside their control that is not at all what ism referring to hear ism talking about coin really and research supported tools that have been shown to enhance people's ability to fall and stay asleep and that can get you far better at sleeping gain to recap the list of levers and tools we have got light and dark that includes the intensity one light the timing of light et camera we have got temperature we have food we have exercise caprine supplements and digital tools not just limited to devices but zero cost tools that you can access on you too band elsewhere in various as that can really help you optimize your sleeps o to day work on talk about all of these i really want to provide you as many tools as possible give you the logic behind each of those tools and when and how best to apply them that you can develop the sleep tool kit that is ideal for your sleep needs as we head in our description of tools optimizing sleep let us consider what the perfect twenty four hour cycle would look let us start this twenty four hour cycle with when you wake up in the morning for some of you the will be five a m for others of you that will be ten a m most people i believe wake up some time between six thirty a m and eight thirty a m but regardless of when you wake up in the morning one of the first things that happens is that your body temperature is increasing and that is just going to happen naturally some of it is going to be the consequence of your moving around a bit but really the increase in body temperature is one of the main triggers for while you woke up in the first place that increase in body temperature intern causes in increase in the release of a hormone called carts all coatis all as often discussed as a stress hormone but it is not just associate with stress it also enhances your immune system provided coatis all is elevated the right times and the right time for quarts all to be elevated is when you first wake up in the morning that increase in coatis all is also going to increase metabolism it is also going to increase your ability to focus mentally and for you to move your body again coatis all as often can demonized and conferer this bad thing and indeed you do not want carts all to be chronically or consistently elevated throughout the day or night but you you want carts all to reach its peak early in the day right about the time you wake up one way that you can insure that that charts all peak occurs early in the day right about the time that you wake up is to view bright light ideally from sunlight within the first thirty to sixty minutes after waking that is right viol bright sunlight within the first thirty to sixty minutes after waking it'll get into all the carrots about what happens if you wake up before the sun is out what if you live in the use where there is no sun or peon will claim there is no sun hate to tell you this folks but there is sun in the use we will talk about all that but everybody whether not you live in a cloudy place or a sunny place whether not there is cloud cover or not that day should really strive to get bright light in your eyes i really from sunlight within the first thirty to sixty minutes after waking the reason for that is very simple you want to trigger that coatis all increase to occur very early in your day and you do not want that carts all pique to happen later which is what will happen if you wait to get outside and see sunlight the reason for this is that you have a set of neurons nerve cells in your eye they are called intrinsically photo sensitive melonopsencells but you do not need to know that name those neurons respond best to bright light and especially right after waking early in the day they are best able to signal to a set of neurons that reside over the roof of your mouth call the supercasmatic uncles which is a cluster of neurons that then sends a huge number of other signals electrical and chemical out to your entire body that trigger's that carts all increase provide to wake up signal for your brain and body and sets in motion a timer for you to fall asleep later that night again we are not trying to going to to much mechanism to day we are trying to really hammer on tools and it'll substantiate those tools just a bit with some mechanism but here is what you do or at least here is what i do i wake up in the morning and i want to reach for my phone but i know that even if i were to crank up the brightness on that phone screen it is not bright enough to trigger that carts all spike and for me to be it might a most alert and focus throughout the day and to optimize my sleep at night what i do is i get out of bed and i go outside and if it is a bright clear day and the sun is low in the sky or the sun is you no starting to get overhead what we call low solar angle than i know ism getting outside at the right time if there is cloud cover and i cannot see the sun i also know ism doing a good thing because it turns out especially on cloudy days you want to get outside and get as much light energy or photons in your yes but let us say it is a very clear day and i can see where the sun is i do not need to stare directly into the sun if it is very low in the sky i might do that because it is not going to be very painful to my eyes however if sun is a lo bit brighter and a li bit higher in the sky sometimes it can be painful to look at the way to get this sunlight viewing early in the day is to look toward the sun if it is too bright to look at directly will then do not do that you just look toward it but not directly at it it is absolutely fine to blink in fact i encourage you to blink whenever you feel the impulse to blink never look at any light sunlight or otherwise that is bright that it is painful to look at case you can damage your eyes but for this morning sunlight viewing it is best to not wear sunglasses that is right to not wear sunglasses at least for this morning sunlight viewing it is absolutely fine to wear eye glasses or contact lenses call corrective lenses in fact those will serve you well in this practise where this tool because they will focus the light on to your curl retard on to those melonopsin and intrinsically photosensitive ganglia cells if your eye glasses or contact lenses have you v protection that is o say there many different wavelengths of light coming from the sun and they are bright enough that they will trigger the mechanisms that you want triggered at this early time of day trying get outside i deal within the first five minutes of waking or maybe's fifteen minutes but certainly within the first hour after waking i want a share with you three critical things about this tool of morning sunlight viewing first of all this is not some woo biology thing this is grounded in the core of our physiology there are literally hundreds if not thousands of quality pure view papers showing that light viewing early in the day is the most powerful stimulus for wakefulness throughout the day and it has a powerful positive impact on your ability to fall and stay asleep at night this is really the foundational power tool for ensuring a great night sleep and for feeling more awake during the day second of all if you wake up before the sun is out you can and probably should flip on artificial lights in your internal home environments or apartment ore wherever you happen to live if your goal is to be awake are if you wake up it for in the morning you you need to be awake will then turn on artificial lights once the sun is out however once the sun has risen then you still want to get outside and view sunlight some of you will wake up before the sun comes out and if you're asking whether not turning on artificial lights can replace sunlight at those hours unfortunately the answer is no unless you have a very special light when talk about what kind of light the bright artificial lights in your home environment are not i repeat are not going to be sufficiently bright to turn on the coatis all mechanism and the other wake up mechanisms that you need early in the day the diabolical twist however is that those lights in your home or apartment or even on your phone are bright enough to disrupt your sleep if you look at them too late at night or in the middle of the night there is this a symmetry in our retinal are i biology and n are brains biology whereby early in the day right round waking you need a lot of light a lot of futons a lot of light energy and artificial lights generally just will not accomplish what you need them to accomplish but at night even a little bit of artificial light can really mess up you are called circadian your twenty four hour clocks and all these mechanisms that were talking about if you wake up before the sun is out and it still dark please turn on as many bright artificial lights as you possibly can or need but then get outside once the sun is out on cloudy days you especially need to get outside i repeat on cloudy days overcast's you especially need to get outside and get sunlight you just seen to get more of it now how much light and how much light viewing do you see this is going to very depending on person and place literally where you live on earth whether not there is a lot of tree cover whether not your somebody a sensitive eye yes or less sensitive eye it is really impossible for me to give an absolute prescriptive but we can give some general guidelines in general on a clear day meaning no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover you want to get this sunlight exposure to your eyes for about five minutes or could be three minutes one day could be seven minutes the next day about five minutes on a day where there is cloud cover the sun is just peeking through the clouds or it is more dense cloud cover you want to get about ten minutes of sunlight exposure to your eyes early in the day and on days that a really densely overcast or maybeven a rainy you are going to want to get as much as twenty or thirty minutes of sunlight exposure another key thing is do not forget about just do not try and get this sunlight exposure through a win shield of a car or a window wether notes tinted or otherwise it takes far too long it is simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms you would be standing there all day trying to get enough light into your eyes from the morning sunlight and by then the sun will have already moved from low solar angle to overhead and it simply will not work for all sorts of mechanisms related to your circadian rhythm functions just do not try and do it through a wind shield sunglasses or a window it is just not going to work get outside if the weather is really bad or for whatever reason safety reasons you cannot get outside will hen i suppose chine get near a window that would be the last last resort but you really want to get outside to get the sunlight exposure now if you live in a part of the world where it is extremely dark and overcast or the weather will not let you outside or you live in a cave or some other small box that does not allow any natural light into it for whatever reason we then you are going to need a replacement for that sunlight and there are sunlight simulators or daylight simulators that you can purchase those are quite expensive in general and therefore i suggest cheaper options that work just as well because they get just as bright things ring lights that are sold in order for people to take series in this kind of thing a drawing belly detailed will work pretty well actually have one of those than i put on my desk all morning even though i still get out side and look at sunlight first thing n the morning again also especially i should say on cloudy days we do not have any affiliation to any ring lights or belly delights or these panels we will provide a link to a couple of different options if you want to explore the serious options i soft know what people's different budgets are i do not nowhere people live i just know that many of our listeners live in locations throughout the world where for instance during the winter it gets very very dark they cannot get sufficient sunlight but get that morning light i really from sunlight and take into account all the specific points that have given you here and i should say enjoy this practice it is really nice to get outside firstling in the morning and get the sunlight in fact when you start doing this you will notice that your body will start to feel more energized and it will feel more energized more quickly you will actually start the to notice this mechanism kicking in each day especial if your paying attention to your physiology enjoy this practice of getting outside yes you can take your morning beverage outside yes you can take your dog with you in fact animals intuitively know to get this morning sunlight they actually seek it out at the right times of days we human beings need to be told by poetasters and other people about the science that supports these kinds of practices are pets apparently do not but get outside alone or with somebody if you kids with your dog however you go about this practice make sure you do this practice at least eighty per cent of the days of your life that is right if you miss a day for instance you your bedroom for a day try and get next to a window let us say you are traveling or for whatever reason you are not able to get outside first thing in the morning will then try to get twice as much sunlight in your eyes rushes a extend the duration of sunlight viewing in the morning for twice as long the following day this is a slow integrative mechanism that under lies this whole thing of wakefulness during the day and sleep at night do to sunlight viewing and if you miss a day you can make up for it the next day but you have to get twice as much light or twice as much duration of light if you really want to get technical and you really want a measure how much light is in your environment you can download a free a something light meter and that will allow your phone to act is a bit of a light meter it give you a pretty accurate measurement of how many lucks which is a measure o brightness are in your environment in the morning and in general that is just going to be a good tool for if valuating your environments here is what i e suggest you do wake up in the morning take light meter point it the brightest light in your home and take a measurement awhile you'll probably find is it is about a thousand lucks now go outside and if there is som sunlight out and there is cloud cover point it at the side and press that ben you have you hold it down and it'll give you indynamicly up dated a luck measurement and what you will find is lie five thousand ten thousand sometimes even ninety thousand lucks even though you do not experience it is much brighter and that is because and indoor artificial light is very concentrated over is a small spacial aria whereas the sunlight is very diffuse but it is that diffuse very bright sunlight that photon energy that you really want that is going to set all the rhythms of your rain an body in the proper way not just that carts all peke but its get end trigger proper an abolish it is going to set a time ref you to be able to fall sleep about sixteen hours later and on and on and on and i should mention within the on and on and on it is also going to suppress any now tone in a hormone that makes you sleepy that happens to be swimming around in your bloodstream at the time you wake up it does a number of other things to including interact with the denizens system and can o wash out some of the denizens that might still be residual if you did not sleep enough fundamentally speaking get that morning sunlight viewing i promise you will be grateful that you did it makes everybody feel better feel more alert and it will greatly assist with your ability to fall and stay asleep later that night it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a item in mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand an twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the robotics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those robotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptedins vitamins and minerals that make sure that all o my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste right if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a years supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic green stock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply o item and three k to case an now ere still focussing on this early part of the day when you have woken up with first hour or after waking and we can go tar list of other leavers and tools right we have light and dark we ought hallway take about light and sunlight in particular we have got temperature food exercise caffeine supplements and digital tools now once you have woken up and you want to be awake this is likely to be early in the day if your falling on of more stander schedule you will also want to leverage not just light but temperature as a tool if you are in lined it would be wise to try and increase your corody temperature a bit more quickly then it would otherwise if you were to just yo shuffle around outside get your sunlight may be read a little bit et camera and they are two main ways you can do that the first way is to get into cold water of some sort this count be a cold shower of anywhere from one to three minutes this could be an ice bath if that is your thing it could be a cold tub or if you own a cold tub ah that specifically sign for deliberate cold exposure get under some cold water that will certainly wake you up and if you ever jumped into cold water or had a cold shower it really wakes you up because you release a adrenaline epinephrin from both your brain and body the body from your arsenals and your brain from lo cluster of neurons called locus sedulous again the named not matter one to three minutes of cold water exposure will wake you up because of that a adrenalin release and and i want a highlight the and it will serve to increase your corody temperature that is right your body and brain interact as a bit of a thermostat system where if you put something cold on the surface of your body your brain o a little cluster of neurons in the called medial peptic aria act as a thermostat and say ah the external of my body is cold and therefore ism going to heat up my corody temperature sizzle paradoxical people think of if you get into cold water grand ice bath your body temperature's going to drop and indeed that is true if you stay in for a while but if you just get in for about one to three minutes or under the cold shower for one to three minutes your corody temperature will increase then when you get out of that cold water your body temperature is increasing it at a rate at a slope that steeper than it would otherwise in you are going to feel more alert it also have the advantage of increasing not just a drennolin but dopamine which is a molecule involved in motivation focus et camera this is great for waking up we got sunlight we got temperature trigger by cold water and we have exercise one of the best ways to increase your corody temperature early in the day is to do exercise now some of you might choose to do your full blown work out for the day first thing when you wake up in the morning i was say the best time to exercise at least what the research points to is immediately when you wake up in the morning or three hours after waking or eleven hours after waking but that's really getting down into optimization for sake of muscular strength and grip straight and it is very hard to give a strict prescriptive here is what i suggest if you want to be alert early in the day and you want to sleep great at night get that bright sunlight get into some cold water and if you do not want to get into some cold water try and get some movement it could be a walks you can get your sunlight exposure while you are taking a walk firstling in the morning it could be a light jog it could be skipping rope these days i skip rope for about ten minutes or twenty minutes while looking at the sun am tying to layer in these different things for waking up and then i take a cold shower afterwards this we been doing as of lately but i do not do that all your long necessarily or some of you are going to be working out midmorning i sometimes do that but try and get your cord body temperature increased first thing in the morning and great way to do that with the cold water and or with exercise and again it does not have to be your full blown work out for the day if you are doing a work outs consistently which i hope everybody is because everybody really should exercise at least i believe five or six or maybeven seven days a week for me at six days a week sometimes five rarely is at seven get that exercise and ore even just a modest amount of movement walking joking skipping rope some light calisthenics that will further increase your corody temperature help you feel more await then we have the category of caffeine and again we are just talking about this early part of the day and you might be saying was second i thought this was an episode about tools for sleep well everything that were talking about doing these first sixty to ninety minutes of the day really set in motion a wave of biological cascades that carry through the entire day and into the evening into the night and really do serve to optimize sleep just hang in there with me and for those you the interest in focus and attention you are billy you learn all of these tools and practices are going to greatly a enhance those as well the next category of tool for use early in the day is affine affine is a very important compound to think about i do realize it some people who are prone to anxiety i specially panic attack anxiety stars might a hate affine entirely that is absolutely find you do not haft drink affine what am about to describe are raise to leverage affine use top to my sleep and wakefulness if you are comfortable with affine if you affine i happen to love affine i it in the form of coffee or espresso or your hamate t and pretty hear non smoked varieties of your hamate is non smoke because the smoked varieties seem to carry some carbon agamic some cancer causing risk theirs increasing date on that non smoked varieties of your hamate affine is something the lot of people consume early in the day how much depends on your tolerance and there is a lot of individual variability here again kaffinis in decisive antagonist or effectively works at a benzine antagonism and limit sleepiness i highly recommend that everybody to lay their affine and take for ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking however painful it may be to eventually arrive at that ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking you want and i encourage you to clear out whatever residual a decisive is circulating in your system in that first ninety to a hundred twenty minutes of the day get that sunlight exposure get s me movement to wake up and then and only then start to invest affine because what you will do if you delay affine and take until ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking is you will avoid this called afternoon crash and you may still get a wile bit of dip an emerging the afternoon but its not going to be that massive crash have talked about the reasons for that crash on previous episodes but if you delay your affine and take ninety to a under twenty minutes after waking you are doing yourself a great service towards wakefulness and to avoid the crash and the afternoon crash has another liability to it which is typically people emerge from that afternoon crash either grumpy or dragon than they will lean into drinking more affine which can then disrupt their sleep wait nine to a under twenty minutes after waking in the morning to drink affine and if you drink affine at any point throughout the day really trying avoid any affine certainly avoid drinking more than a hundred milligrams have affine after for p m and probably even better to limit your last affine and take to three p mar even to p m and for many people shifting that affine and take from immediately after waking in the morning to ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes gives them a much longer ark of energy throughout the day and they do not feel the need to drink more affine later in the afternoon if you do drink faffing later in the afternoon really trying limit the total amount or drink d gaff certainly keep the total amount to less than a hundred milligrams if you are interested in getting into the best possible sleep and i say this knowing that many people including myself can drink a double best press with two hundred milligrams of fine or more at five p mar even six p m or after dinner and still quit unquote fall asleep fa in are still sleep fine however there are terrific data mat walker and i talked about this and there are forehand more papers all the time that point to the fact that affine in take late in the day after four p m that is can really disrupt the architecture of your sleeps you might think your sleeping well but you are not sleeping nearly as well as you could if you avoid a caffeine in those afternoon hours now some of you might be doing your main bound of exercise first thing in the morning and you want your affine before that bout of exercise in that case i say go for it drink your affine do your work out right after waking up i do not have a problem with that you will find however that you are going to get an early afternoon dip in energy in that dip in energy is going to be substantial because it is going to be a dip in energy that naturally follows that work out from the morning it is dependent on temperature and it is going to be related to the elimination of that a denizens blockade by affine your getting a of a one too punch on your energy levels by taking a lot of affine and exercising early in the day you can sort of expect that your going to get a drop an energy in the early afternoon that is o say if that is works for you but just know that delaying that affine ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking would be the ideal scenario most days and most scenarios all that said i absolutely respect the fact that people have different worksceduls kidsceduls et camera if you want to do some or none are all these tools that is really up to you have just providing them to you in the a simplest form that i can possibly provide them now the other lever or tool that you have available to you is food not just what you eat but when you eat and it turns out that if you eat early in the day you support a biological clock mechanism that will make you more alert early in the day that said many people choose to fast in the early morning hours of the day or in the first part of the day ism one such person i generally do not in just any food until about eleven a m or twelve noon sometimes it'll have approaching shape sometimes it'll have some moons sometimes it'll have breakfast if people are meeting for brunch or breakfast i will have breakfast for social reasons every once know out but most the time i do not eat until about lunch time however some people are really hungry when they wake up in the morning just know that if you eat early in the day you are further triggering and increase in metabolism and in temperature that will make you more alert you do not have to eat early in the day but you can start to see how these different tools layer together sunlight viewing exercise cold water eating many of them are converging on the same mechanisms in fact when you drink waffle there is also a small increase in body temperature due to the adrenalin increase at it stimulates all of these things can be layered on top of one another or you can use them individually or think about them individually now food is an interesting lever or tool because it is not just about when you eat but it is also about what you eat and have talked a lot about eating for energy and what that means and terms of colonic energy verses neural energy et camera in previous podcast episodes we are not in a focus on that now because frankly to get into a description of whether or not somebody should eat fruits or vegetables or animal proteins ore day at camera early in the day that is very new aunts what you eat for your breakfast or if you choose to not eat breakfast is really up to you all that said if you eat a very large meal it does not matter if you slept terrifically well ten hours the night before or if you are about to go to sleep or if it is the middle of the afternoon if you're got is full of food there just a large volume of food in your got it is going to divert a lot of blood and other critical resources away from other organs of your body in particular your brain and you're going to be sleepy after eating a big meal s the sort of a dove but i think oftentimes in the discussions about what they eat for energy people neglect to consider food volume as a strong perimeter or variable in that discussion if you eat a huge breakfast is likely that you are going to be tired immediately after eating that breakfast unless of course you exercise very hard prior to that and your metabolize all that food very quickly it is up to you whether not to eat first thing in the morning or not but if you do eat in the first few hours of the morning just understand that you are setting or you're helping to set a food in trained as it is called circadian clock light temperature timing of food and take movement and exercise all of these things literally funnel in in a neural sense they funnel in to this thing that we call the circadian clock and they let that clock that set of neurons predict when you are likely to be eating and active and viewing sunlight the next day in the next day an the next day i say all this because therefore some beautiful studies an ill highlight one again in the shownote captions that show that if people are having a hard time waking up in the morning one of the things they can do is maximize sunlight viewing exercise in the morning drink caffeine although again night support the idea that that would best be done about ninety to hundred twenty minutes after waking eating some food in those early morning hours et camera et camera you can lay in multiple levers or tools in order to be more alert and that is what these levers and tools are really there for in this sense of what we are talking bout to day which is optimizing sleep yes they will make you more alert yes they will provide some adrenaline in dopamine for since the cold water et camera et camera but the reason we are talking about these things in the context of sleep is that they start to give your body some predictable autonomic timing what is predictable automonaunonomic timigwhle your autonomic nervous system is the components of your brain and body that cause wakefulness and sleepiness and you can start to create some predictability in that autonomic timing you can start to do things that really make it such that you naturally wake up at six in the morning or five in the morning that is right if you are somebody who naturally is a night owl who likes to stay up until too in the morning and sleep til ten a m and you now have a job or you have to go to schooled you of a partner that likes to get up early go to sleep early will you can make that happen and you can make that happen pretty painlessly if you take a week or and go to sleep thirty minutes are an hour earlier each night set in alarm and wake up thirty minutes are an hour earlier each morning until of course you are waking up at the time you one wake up and then even in that groggy state get some exercise get some sunlight viewing if the sun's not out turn on those bright artificial lights have some breakfast even if you are not hungry in fact for those of you that engage in shift work becauseyou had do or travel and your jet lag one of the quickest ways to shift your circadian clock and get on to the local casual is to eat on the local casual what all these tools do is the really set up a cascade i think of it as kind of a wave front of wakefulness and focus throughout the day it'll take you through the middle of the day in the afternoon stages will talk about in a few minutes but really they take you to this period that is about five p m until your bedtime i realize some people are going to bed very early eight p m or nine p m which to me seems very early but very few people go to sleep at five p m right unless you're doing that for shift work or other reasons but from five p m until bedtime is really a critical period in which you need to leverage particular tools in order to get and stay a sleep optimally and to be able to sleep through the night really there are three critical periods throughout each twenty four hour cycle and during each of those critical periods you are going to want to do as many specific things as you can to optimize you are wakefulness and focus and mood throughout the day in your sleep at night the first critical period is the one that we have ben talking about up until now things morning sunlight viewing caffeine ninety to hundrejory minutes after waking exercise and on we can call that critical period one and it really encompasses the time from which you wake up until about three hours after waking although i should just mention cause they are always lot people hey wait i wake up at four a m and the sun is went out until eight am o k might be four hours but really s those early morning hours of your day once you are awake the second critical period is the time throughout the day and afternoon leading into evening you may ask what the things that you can do throughout the day the middle of your day and into the afternoon in evening hours that are really going to set you up for the best possible sleep later that night well there are few us and there are a few do not first of all be careful about in jesting too much caffeine throughout the middle of the day that is kind of an obvious one for the reasons that we talked about earlier second of all if you are a napper and i raise my hand now for those you listening and raising my right hand because i love naps have always love naps nowadays i do and antiar or a a reverie sleep hypnosis almost every day and i ten you that as i mention in the early afternoon hours if i am feeling kind of sleepy because even though i optimize my affinal take timing et camera i t end to get alible sleeping the afternoon most people get a little sleeping n the afternoon some of that is related to hitting that peak of body temperature and you might think wait i thought high body temperature is associate with alertness and it is but right as you crests that high body temperature and your by temperature starts to drop there is a tendency to be a obit sleepy some of you might of to take a nap in the afternoon should you nap should you not nap that is a question that i get asked a lot and that i asked doctor father walker when he was a guest on this podcast here was his answer and hears what the date o support it is fine to nap in the afternoon but do not nap late in the day or for long that it disrupts your ability to fall and stay asleep at night for your major sleep bout ships a naps are fine but do not sleep long during the day or too late in the day that it disrupts your ability to fall and stay asleep i should also say you do not have to nap have an interesting phenomena that happens on these podcast in on sociomedia we will talk about naps in the fact that naps are great and do not make them longer the ninety minutes but then all the non papers get really worry lit wait om my suppose to nap i do not naps i wake up grog you do not have to nap in fact if you can make it through your whole day without naming great more power to you but if you do nap and you find that naps serve you well keep those naps shorter than ninety minutes for reasons related to all treating cycles and forth and make sure that you do not nap too late in the day that you are then staying up too late at night and having hard time waking up the next morning i will say that for a lot of people who do not naps or that find they wake up really grumpy from naps or groggy from naps i encourage you to try the revery a try an antiar script try you gander try something of that sort for anywhere from ten to twenty to thirty minutes i tend to you this every day now it'll just lie down and i i love yoganedrai love nastier scripts i love using the revery a in particular the portion of the revery a that gets you better at sleeping really is beneficial for me because it serves as very replenishing while ism doing that hypnosis but it is also get me much better at falling and staying asleep and falling back asleep in the middle of the night this critical period throughout the day as one in which most people are doing a lot of stuff they are emailing and picking up kids in their exercising in there commuting and doing all sorts outings taking phone calls an fumes et camera but if you can get that period of deep relaxation through a nap or nastier that is going to serve you well try not to drink too much canine certainly no more than a hundred milligrams of caffeine after four p m if your goal is to fall asleep at a reasonably normal time and for those of you that exercise in the afternoon understand that if you exercise very intensely this might be wait training or running or some other very intense exercise typically that is going to further increase your body temperature make sense it based on everything we know about metabolism and body temperature and it is going to called delay your circadian clock it is going to make it such that you want to fall asleep a little bit later r maybe even a lot later if your exercising in the afternoon or evening and that's the only time you can exercise or that is the time that you prefer to exercise great but be careful about in jesting too much caffeine in order to get the energy to do that exercise as that coffin will destruct your sleep and just know that you are delaying your circadian clock you are making at such that you will naturally want to go to sleep later and wake up later contrast that with if you exercise early in the day say immediately after waking upon in the first zero to four hours after waking in most cases that is not going to shift your circadian clock much and toward the end of the episode will talk a little bit about forced exercise prior to wake up times that does not been doing exercise in your sleep that means deliberately setting alarm and getting out a bed much earlier than you naturally would that turns out to be very potent tool to called advance your circadian clock we can talk about that alibi later in the episode but this critical period too in the middle of the day is when you are going to one to leverage specific tools and we take about those limiting affinal take be mindful of the clock delaying effects of exercise the fact that also if you are going to nap you do not want to nap too long or to late into the day otherwise we'll destruct your night time sleep this critical period too or second critical period i should say during themidle of the day is ha time in which you should be doing certain things and avoiding doing certain things that raises the question of whether not you should also be getting a lot of light in prattler sunlight throughout the day now that something that has not ben explored too much in the literature until recently when doctor saint radar whose the director of the chronobiology u at the natural institutes a mental health is decide to do a number of experiments exploring the effects of light on mood and other aspects of bring function and body function when that light is deliver not just in the morning which is great for us but also throughout the day should you be looking at sunlight or bright artificial lights throughout the day now on the face of it you might just think yes thesunlights great provided were not getting a sunburn were not staring at the sun and damaging o our eyes we should get as much sunlight as we possibly can in fact we talk about this in the episode on hormones about ow getting light on to as much of our skin as we can throughout the day can really help in the production of testosterone and estrogen and both men and women and healthy ways that improves mood and libido and all sorts of things that are associate with well being however because light is such a powerful stimulus for controlling the timing of your gleefulness or sleepiness i should say and wakefulness we might want to be cautious about how much light we are viewing in the afternoon in particular in the early evening hours right well turns out it is not straightforward viewing sunlight to the eyes sunlight in the late afternoon and evening hours gan depends on time of year depends on location that you happen to be in but getting some sunlight in your eyes for again may be five or ten maybe thirty minutes depending on how much cloud cover there is doing that in the afternoon sir yes an additional beneficial purpose which is you protect or you in inoculate your nervous system again some of the negative effects of bright artificial light or even dim artificial light in the night time hours between ten p m and for am which is really critical period three and will talk about what to do and what to not do during critical period three of every twenty four hour cycle but to make it very clear what ism saying here get that morning sunlight in your eyes but also get some sunlight in your eyes in the late afternoon and evening hours when the sun is at called low solar angle when it start to descend in the sky and you do not out to stare directly at the sun although you can catch a nice beautiful sunset go for it but as the sun starts to descend it triggers those same narrows in your eye that communicate with your circadian clock but it communicates with a different component ore different compartment within the circadian clock that circadian clock is not just one thing its multiple things an you have what are called morning oscillators and evening oscillators and to make a long story short the tool that ism describing of looking at the sun in the late afternoon and evening again blinking as fine do not stare at the sun but getting that sunlight in your eyes in the late afternoon and evening signals to that clock that it is evening time and that sleep is coming it also serves as a second anchor or reference point for your body in your brain to know where it is in time remember back to the beginning of the episode when i said your brain in your body and all your organs are locked inside this skin and the skull and they do not know what is going on in the outside world well that morning sunlight viewing in the other things you do during critical period one those provide one strong set of signals that it is wake up time and time to be alert in time to be focus and then in the evening by getting sunlight in your eyes again and sin particular sunlight that comes from low solar angle sunlight well that provides a second stimulus or a second reference point that tells your brain and body hey it is evening the sun is descending and you might say wait hots the brain and these neurons know the difference between morning light and evening light it turns out has to do with the particular wave lengths of light that are present in morning verses evening it is an incredible mechanism and you are probably familiar with the fact that when the sun is directly overhead it is really bright white and yellow and the skies often blue and if there cloud cover just comes through as a bunch of bright light well next time you are out in the morning take a look at what a sunrise looks there is a lot of yellow blue contrast n those yellow blue signal important specific sets of sells in your yon brain that it is morning in the evening you are also going to see yellow and blue but the ratio of yellows and blues as now change and you also see some oranges and an really brilliant sunset you will see some reds if you have not notice this already you really want to look for this it is a kind of fun and cool to look at will those yellows and blues and oranges that you see in the evening sunsets this e signal to your brain embody that evening is there and that night time is coming and there really establishing a second reference point or wave front of biological signals that are going to optimize your night time hours and your transition into really terrific sleep sonawlits talk about what ism calling critical period three of each twenty four hour cycles this would be the period of time of wat evening it might be six p m for some depending on when you go to sleep or seven p m extending in to the hours in which you decide to get into bed and go to sleep and then throughout the night there are number of things that you are going to want to do and their a number of things that you are going to want to avoid doing in order to optimize your sleep first of all you are going to want to avoid bright artificial lights of any color yes of any color we have not talked a lot about blue blockers in a lenses that block blue wave lancer short wavelength of light i do not of anything against blue blockers in fact many people find that blue blockers provide them some relief from headache and some i strain if they wear blue blockers throughout the day and certainly at night but you do not need them and even if you do wear them you will find that if lights are very bright does not matter if its a blue light a yellow light or a red light those bright lights will wake up your brain and body they will activate the same mechanisms that were activated early in the day by sunlight however and here is thee really diabolical twist i mention thisearlier but the diabolical twist in the way that your brain and body respond to light is that early in the day in the morning hours you need a lot of bright light ideally from sunlight to be very alert and to wake up but in the evening hours and night time hours it takes very little light very few photons in order to wake up your brain and body and to disrupt your circateing clock and destruct your sleep what that means is that once the sun goes down which of course is going to happen at different times of year in different places on earth but once the sun goes down you would be wise to trying dim the lights in your in door environment most days right i realize some night you can to throw party and have people over might not want a dim the light sumnights are going to go out you might view a lot of bright lights but most nights of your life you are going to want to dim the lights in your internal environment and ideally the lights that you do use you would place low in that physical environment you would try and not use overhead lights but rather rely on desk lamps or lights even place low to the floor even on the floor if you are going to use light at night and most people do i would encourage you to use as little artificial light as is required to carry out the activities you need to require safely that count be studying in which case you might need a obit more light in order to read or study if your watching a television show or your watching something on your computer dim that screen waylay down as dim as possible while still of course being able to view what you need to view even better should say ideally you would use candle light and or moonlight now some n lights the moon is really bright and you actually cause moonlight to go about your usual activities moonlight might seem very very bright but actually moonlight is fairly low light intensity an candle light which can also seem very bright actually is very low light intensity if you are sitting across a table with some candle light there it is a really bright candle chances are its only about three to ten locks which is very very little light energy compared to say an artificial desk lamp or an overhead light which is going to be in the area anywhere from a hundred to a thousand locks candle light is fine of course be cautious with open flame but cable light is fine moonlight as fine dimming artificial lights its fine provided there dimmed way wait down and again trying avoid using overhead artificial lights the absolute worst lights are going to be overhead florescent lights of the sort that you would have in the super market or ah that you would see it a gestation or something of that sort and i confess their hard times in which i driving home and it is late at night and i want to be able to get to sleep and all we need to stop at the grocery store or gestation or something that have actually put on sun glasses at night in order to avoid getting that bright light exposure at night although that is a little but extreme i have done that from time to time because that bright light exposure will absolutely quash it will eliminate any melatonin that happens to be circulating in your brain in body no monotone and a lot of people think of as a supplement melotoneand is naturally released as the evening comes about and into the night time hours its forming the makes you feel sleepy and allows you to fall asleep viewing bright light in the late evening hours and night time hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep for most people a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors and in particular overhead bright artificial lights between the hours of ten p m and for am that is right between ten him and for am avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible use only as much light as is absolutely necessary in order to carry out the routines and activities you need to carry out safely i should mention that the reason t overhead lights are problematic is the same reason what sunlight is right early in the day which is that the cells that is the neurons that can wake up your brain and body through activation of the circadian clock reside mainly in the bottom half or two thirds of your curl retina and the way the optics of your eyes work is that the cells on the bottom half of your eye view the upperificial field this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism that allows these cells to respond to overhead light from sunlight in the early part of the day and throughout the day but in the evening if you have bright artificial lights on in those bright artificial lights are overhead lights it is going to more closely mimic what sunlight does in the evening time and that turns out to be a bad thing if your goal is to eventually go to sleep again do like the skananavians do use lights that are set low in the room at night and if you really want to optimize your sleep wake cycles i suppose you could also do the opposite throughout the day you could really emphasize the use of bright artificial lights and sunlight that comes from above and for sunlight always comes from above but if you are working in a given office environment and it is two p m or three p m and you want to be is awake as possible really crank up the overhead lights and then in the evening which is this critical pair three that were referring to really try and dim those lights or have them off or just rely on candy light or moonlight from the hours of about ten p m until four a m our good friend samerhatar who is been on this podcast before summer is director of the chronology unit the national institutes of mental health but he is absolutely obsessive about this light stuff and avoiding light at night in fact he lives in what i or joke is a cave at night from nine p m until five a m which is really his ism kind of sleep cycle he has his use dark that you be lucky to be able to find a spoon in the kitchen in fact you be lucky to find your way down the hallway if you are me but in any case dim the lights from the waylay down it will serve you well it will make it much easier for you to get sleepy and stay sleepy and fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night now not to depart from this critical period three but if you recall viewing that afternoon light right the low solving light as the sun is heading down in the skies wo could be sunset or what i call circus sunset around sunset well doing that is going to slightly but not completely offset and of the negative effects of viewing artificial light at night i do not only give people a pass here but lets a that you're going to it'll watch some net flicks at night or you arguing to be up late studying and yet you still want to be able to fall and stay asleep definitely make sure you see that evening light there is a great study will provide a link to the study which showed that if people view evening sunset light or evening sunsets or sunlight right around the time of sunset it really serves to inoculate ere offset sum again some not all of the negative effects of artificial light between the hours of ten p m and for a now that is light but as you recall we also have this tool related to temperature and you will probably not going to be surprise that the way to leverage temperature in the evening is the exact opposite of the way that you want to leverage temperature early in the day early in the day temperature increases from cold showers or exercise at camera wake you up what that means is that taking a cold shower late a night as probably a bad idea rather takin a nice hot bath or a sand you might think would heat up your body and indeed that is what happens you you stay in a very long time but if you do hotter or a hot bath or a san in the evening and you do not stay in for more than twenty or thirty minutes and you get out you take may be a cool is shoes or warm shower then what happens is there is a compensatory cooling off of your for body temperature for the reasons we discussed earlier and your body temperature will drop by one to three degrees and it will make it much easier to get into sleep if you are somebody enjoys hot baths hot showers or hot tubs evening and night time is going to be the best time to do that if your goal is to facilitate sleep similarly you should try and make your sleeping environment pretty cool if not cold now that does not me you need to be cold while you are asleep you can get under as many blankets as you need but it is a good idea to make your sleeping environment cool in fact drop the temperature in that sleeping environment by at least three degrees and you will be happy that you did now some people rely on things eight sleep that i use out one of these controllable temperature or mattress covers other people would simply do this by putting a fan in the room or opening a window again depends on time of year depends on technology depends on budgets et camera but you are going to want to sleep in a relatively cool or cold sleeping environment and then layer on the blankets as needed to stay asleep and i say as needed because one of the things that you are going to do in your sleep or if you happen to wake up is if you are too warm you are going to put a foot or a hand out from under those blankets and the reason for doing that is very logical onceyou understand the mechanism you have special portals you essentialeep have ways of passing meet souse me in and out of your body primarily through the palms of your hands the upper half of your face and the bottoms of your feet through can glamorous skin this was covered in the episode with doctor crag heller from the biology department at stamford if you lower the temperature in your sleeping environments to lower the temperature in that room for house a controllable mattress cover that can cool down eight sleep or something that sort it is naturally going to make your sleep environment cooler and if you are too warm under the blankets all you've to do as extend a hand or a foot out from under those blankets whereas if the sleeping environment that your in is too warm here is very little you can do to cool off besides push off those blanket fer instance if you are too warm in you are waking up in the mill the night which is what happens if you get too warm you will push off those blankets but if the room is too warm we what even to do you would probably have to put your hands into some cool water take a coolish shower or something for a couple of seconds that is not very practical better to just keep the sleeping environment cool ism not a big fan of people putting socks on while they sleep reshes that ism not a fan of putting socks on while i sleep because that eliminates this labor skin portal on the bottoms of one's feet for those of you they have heard ware socks while you sleep that work scrape for people that tend to run too cold while they sleep and wake up bus their feet get cold but ifyoure somebody who wakes up in the mill the night chances are your waking up because you are getting too warm and the best thing that you can do is to cool or lower the temperature in the room that your sleeping and not wear socks get under as many blankets as you need to fall asleep and then across the night you will naturally just move a hand or a foot or all hands and feet out from under those blankets to cool off because of the relationship between temperature and sleep that is dropping your corody temperature one to three degrees gets you into sleep and helps you stay asleep let say you do exercise late in the day and you are finding yourself very alert in the evening and you need to fall asleep or let say you've exercise in you needed four cuffs of espresso in order to do that exert is we there a few things the you can do to try and bring your nervous system down into more state of calmness and you can do that also by lowering your corody temperature one of those i hourly talked about before taking a nice hot shower or a hot bath and then getting out and cooling off will decrease your body temperature may be not enough to get you into sleep if you have a ton of coffin in your system but again you can use this mechanism of temperature shifts to wake up or temperature shifts to fall asleep in ways that really can help you overcome some of the irregularities in your sleep wake cycle and exercise cycle et camera because of course nobody's perfect some days we end up having a work out in the afternoon or will miss the work out entirely other days we end up having that cup of coffee in the afternoon with a friend and h we have a hard time falling asleep you can use these tools joust in their optimized form being absolutely obsessive and compulsive about exactly when you do each of those tools that would be wonderful but life happens as they say and some days you are going to feel too alert at night and you want to fall asleep or you got to get it especially early the next morning and you are not somebody who normally goes to bed at ten p m well that is when something a hot bath or a sonic and really benefit you because it can adjust your temperature rhythm accordingly i would be remiss if i did not touch on alcohol and c b d and t h c i always get questions about these and i should say of course many places but not a t h c is e legal though there are medical uses and some places its o d criminalized other places it is legal am alcohol of course is consumed almost as frequently as affine is consumed i personally do not drink aldol i do not having thing against it per say i just do not tend to enjoy it a one the reason i do not enjoy it as if i drink call i simply fall asleep that does not really accomplish any the things that i really one to accomplish because the sleep that one gets after drinking alcohol is greatly disrupted sleep hate to break it to you but that is the truth and when doctor jaywalker came on this podcast you said exactly the same thing well t h c and alcohol do help some people fall asleep and may be even stay asleep the architecture of that sleep is sub optimal compared to the sleep they would get without alcohol t h c in their system i am not here to tell you what to do where not to do ism certainly not i the substance police that is not my roll ism just reporting to you the biology if your sleep is not restoring you to the extent that you feel it should or if you are regularly relying on a drinker to in order to fall asleep or t h in order to fall asleep that is disrupting your total pattern of sleep however i do realize that nowadays a lot of people are relying on t h c end or c b d especially edible forms in order to fall and stay asleep and we can just acknowledge the data does seem that there's a anxiety lowering effect of some of those compounds that do help people who have a hard time falling and staying a sleep because of reasons related to anxiety although in a moment will talk about some supplement and supplement protocols that can also assist in the ability to fall and stay a sleep in the can adjust anxiety and that do not seem to disrupt sleep architecture an negative ways in fact can enhance the depth and quality of sleep architecture o faso you done everything correctly up until now you get your morning routine from critical period one that your afternoon routine you saw some sunlight in the afternoon you avoided affine in the eight hours or ten hours before bedtime you not drinking i call you cool down the room i your doing all these things right you dim the lights et center et camera what else can we do in order to optimize our sleep well i always say behavioral tools first then look to nutrition then if necessary look to supplementation and then if still necessary look to prescription drugs obviously prescribed by bordcertified physician well we talked a lot about the behavioral tools for critical period tree we have not talked a lot about the supplementation base tools there are supplements that for most people will greatly improve their ability to fall and stay asleep and the three main supplements in that category or that kit of sleep supplements and have talked about these before a magnesium three gnat t h are e o an t e apigenin a p i g e an ion alien n thiamine t h e a an pony theaniy now some important things to point out about machree in either as it is called apigenan in they first of all you do not necessarily need to take all three although many people get a synergistic a fact from taking all three in fact you may not even need to take even one what i recommend is that if you are already doing all the behavioral tools regularly and your still having trouble falling a sleep and staying asleep well then you might try one of the supplements within this sleep stack they do have fairly wide margins for safety although i should also say any time you arguing to add or remove something from your supplement protocol your nutritional program you fully want to talk to your physician i do not you say that to protect us i say that to protect you but for most people the margins of safety on these things are going to be pretty broad a couple of notes about dosages for some people the dosages of any one or several of the supplements i mentioned will be zero that is you will not need them in order to get and stay asleep most nights of your life that is terrific if you do not need them for many people however taking a hundred and forty five milligrams of magnesium three inmate can be very beneficial that is the dosage that most people will benefit from some people need to go a little higher some people need to go a bit lower one of the reasons that we have been pointing people towards single in greediest formulations these days as because it allows people to adjust the dosage of one component of a called sleep stack without having to destroy the dosage of another component and on it also allows people to try just one element within the sleep stack without having to purchase and try the other s which is a problem if you are buying a blend of a lot of different ingredients a hundred and forty five milligrams of magnesium three and eight fifty five dirt milligrams of apigenan and again you could just take the alien an on atone and one hundred to four hundred milligrams of thiamine takin again alone or in commination with the other supplements mention this stack many people find allows them to get really drowsier fall asleep sleep really deeply and they feel much more refresh the next day and they do not have a grogginess to the now a couple of notes about these different supplements about five per cents of people report that magnesium three in ate really distress their godwit gives them diary or gastric distress in which case do not take it if magnesium three in at distress your gut or your digestion point where it is uncomfortable or at all and you do not it do not take any of it the proper dosage for you an other words would be zero milligrams now in a slightly different way many people who can tolerate magnesium three in ate or really thrive on magnesium threeiand eight and apagenan might find that theatre even at the lowest dose of a hundred milligrams cause again the range s a hundred to four hundred milligrams that theine gives them such vivid dreams that they actually find it disruptive here they wake up and t e mill the night er they find that the sleep of their getting is could of anxiety ridden because of the intensity of those dreams some people might choose to leave thiamine out of the sleep stack and just take magnesium three in hate rapagenan against some people might leave magnesium three in ate out of the sleep stack again all of this is really about finding the supplementation protocol that is ideal for you i should mention that whether got you are taking one or two or three of the components of the sleep stack the ideal time to take those is thirty to sixty minutes before bedtime especially if you have not had anything to eat for the three hours or before bedtime i confess that oftentimes ill have a obit of a snack late in the evening some carries or something i try note too close to bedtime but some evenings just because of workscaduali'll get home late be nine p m andi'll eat a big meal and then it'll take the sleep stack and fall asleep every one in a while that just happens nobody's perfect certainly ism not but that sleep stack can be very beneficial and i do think that it is preferable to melatonin here is the reason first of all milestone is a hormone that you endogenously make you now know a lot about melatonin and its control by light meaning light inhibits it or eliminates it darkness promotes it and melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep but the dosages of melatonin that are contained in most commercial products is far far far greater than what we would make endogenously is really supra physiological that is of concern because melatonin is not just responsible for making a sleeping fall asleep it also does things interacts with other hormone systems testosterone an esters and even in the puberty system and kids is taking melton every once in a while a problem for adjusting to jet lag at camera probably not i even say no but taking it chronically over time especially kids taking it chronically overtime can potentially be problematic at least in my opinion these other supplements are going to be preferable to to melatonin now as i mention the beginning of to day's episode there are some other things that i certainly take every once in a while and that other people might consider taking in addition to the sleep stack i talked about before or in place of that sleep stack if to sleep stack does not work well for them every third or fourth night i will take too grahams of glycine and a hundred milligrams of gala in addition to the standard sleepstack that i talked about before ism taking man three in a apigenantheanine and then i also take two grams of glycine and gala which i find greatly enhances my ability to get into sleep but the reason i only add slicing an gala every third or fourth night is that if i take it too often i find that the entire sleep stack does not work quite as effectively i do notknow exactly why this is the case but in any event that is what i do and more recently have also started using in social in particular my andnocital every other night it'll take nine hundred milligrams of myoandnocital in addition to man tree in a apigenan and theine and not on the nights when i take glycine and gala ism adding nine hundred milligrams of asocial to the standard sleep stack of machree an a thiamine and apigenan and what i find it is not only does it greatly enhance my ability to fall asleep quickly but if i wake up in the mill of the night which i often do to use the bathroom i find it very very easy to fall back asleep whereas when i do not take animal every other night or i find that i wake in the mill f the night it is a bit more of a challenge to fall back asleep in social has a number of different uses that have been disgusting terms a mental health and in terms of adjusting anxiety for it is daytime use what ism talking about is taking nine hundred milligrams on myoandnocitl also thirty to sixty minutes before sleep along with the standard sleep stack and i found that to be immenseleep beneficial i also notice tat has a pretty long talk of anxiety suppression throughout the day and ism not somebody who suffers from anxiety but i have to say just has led me to feel a bit calmer throughout the day and i do not really know how to say this except in subjective terms to feel a bit more a buffered against razilients against stray events and if you look at the littercharn and social and its interactions with the ceretonan system and other systems it that all make sense as to why that would be the case we will provide lynxtar called sleep kit which is part of our hurry net work news letter she zero cost news letter we can access this information about supplements and other behavior old tools for sleep in list form but that sleep kid does not include some of the newer information that have provided this episode in particular the information about innocital and what ism finding be the very beneficial use of asocial for the ability to fall back sleep after waking up in the mile the night which is something that a lot of people struggle with now that supplementation for falling and staying asleep but we can return to o the behavioral tools also as powerful levers and tools for falling asleep and getting back to sleep and again we look to enemy are non sleep deep least or the revery a as a way to do that as my mention early or the revery a has been developed on the basis of really high quality previewed research both clinical and non clinical by my college avid speak whose are associate share of psychaatreate stamford it is a wonderful tool it does carry a cost after the initial seventh a trial i can tell you what what the cost on that is s you can get a sense am because i do realize that anything that carries a cost for some people it will not be accessible right now reverse and i should list mention they did not pay us for an adore don just telling you what they told me that i can accurately report what a what cost to use revert they have a monthly subscription to use the revery a at fourteen ninety nine you do get the seven day free trial they have a yearly subscription of ninety nine and ninety nine ninety nine with a seven day free trial and they have a lifetime purchase one time purchase of too forty nine with no trial it right now is only available for apple not for android but they are yes going to have it available for android soon there is a sign up less there i should mention that while the cost might seem high if you compare that cost to say supplements are you compare that cost to a poor night sleep over time the cost to at least to me seems somewhat modest ism certainly within range for a number of people but i acknowledge not within range for other people which is why i also want to point to zero cost tools and the zero cost tool for getting asleep staying asleep and falling back asleep is going to be enemy are will put a long to a non sleep deep breast police that is available on you to available to anybody zero cost provide you have a a internet connection again dim the screen if you can turn that on late at night and there are a number of other yoga does scrips and as and sources around the internet in particular on you to that are zero cost that you could use if the revery a is outside your price range or is not preferable to you etcetera when i wake up in the mill the night it is usually to use the restaurum it'll go use the restart will keep delights as dim as possible i get back into bed and if i find that is easy to fall asleep great ism asleep and if not then i will generally plug in the revery a they have a fall back asleep a hypnosis and ninety nine times out of a hundred ism back asleep within minutes and i do not wake up until morning now very briefly i just one a touch on some tools that are very commonly use by many people out there and believe or not there is pure reviewed science on things e masks do i masks improve your ability to stay asleep and indeed they do provided they are not too tight and provided that the room is cool enough why well i mass cover the upper half your face which is where glamorous skin is localized remember palms of the hands bottoms of eat labors skin on the face a lot of people who wear i mass we will wake up because they are too warm if the room is too warms if you are going to use an eye mass to keep light out definitely make sure the room and your sleep environment and your bed are cool enough in order for you to stay asleep indiction i get a lot of questions about your plugs here is the deal with your plugs some people find that your plugs are very beneficial because of course they prevent the entrances of sound into the ear that could wake us up but some people find that the sound of their own beating of their own heart can be disruptive and they get a sort of humming in their head when they have those a your plugs and ism one such person although i family members that using your plugs when they sleep thrill up to you yo have to see whether not those ear plugs help or disrupt your sleep for me there no good o for some people they really enjoy them i do not use an eye mask unless ism sleeping in a really bright environment or i mean to sleep on a plain and things of that sort other tools that all just mention that have were reviewed research to support them elevating your feet either with a pillow or aby elevating the end of your bed by about three to five degrees can be really beneficial for increasing the depth of sleep because of the called lymphatic washout this is the movement of an circulation of fluids in your brain at night that lead to bore wakefulness and actually can improve connive function and a number of other things related to brain health there is one coat to that for people that suffer from acid reflux having your ankles elevated above your chest or above your heart the mill the night can actually exacerbate that acid reflux you want to do the opposite you want to actually elevate your the head side of your bed by about three to five degrees now one of the common causes of sleep disruption that has tremendously detrimental effects is called sleep apnea this is basic keep bouts of suffocation or lack of oxygenation during sleep this is particularly the case for people that are very heavy set and that heavyset could be from obesity i can also be heavy set from having too much muscle a lot of people who have are carrying too much muscle will actually have sleep apnea without realizing at sleep n ape as actually very dangerous it is associate with a number of cartyofascular issues of associate with sexual dysfunction its associate with issues with cognition sleep ape as bad a lot of people will have to use the pap which is a a it is device it looks sort of us a nodical mask or dive mask admits a whole apparatus that people go to sleep with however many people can relieve themselves of sleep apnea provided s not too serious and can sleep much better in fact i think all people can sleep much better if they train themselves to be nosebreathers while they sleep there are lot of reasons to be an nosbreather unless you are breathing very hard you to exercise or talking or eating that was all covering names festers book breath the new signs of a lost art it is been covered in a number different podcast we talked about on this podcast as well s a god idea to be an nosbreather unless you need to mouth breathe and it is a great ideate superb idea to be a now breather in sleep and one way to really get good at that is to take a obit of medical type and o tap your mouth shut before going to sleep you heard me right puts a medical tape over your mouth and force yourself to nose breathe during sleep it also prevent snoring in most cases really offset sleep a plea sleep aptenin again being a very serious health concern i should also mention as a tool that if you have a hard time being a nose breather in sleep you can try doing your party of vascular exercise at least the lower intense party of vascular exercise through purely nasal breathing and one way to do that again is to tape your mouth shut or put a gulp a water in your mouth but do not actually swallow that mouthful of water or to use a mouth piece or just deliberately keep your mouth close an and sit on breathing through your nose most people find that when they start to in party of scuba exercise that way it is really challenging at first but over time they actually can feel quite calm and still can generate a lot of physical effort purely using nose breathing the reason that doing nose breathing trying cardiovascular exercise translates to be a nose breather drink sleep is that your bigness is actually can dilate their plastic and over toe plastic meaning their their their malleable that is and they can become wideryou not can to get giant nostrils do not worry about it your airways within your your skull if that is what the sinews is really are these passages within the skull and of course within the nasal passages are will dilate and will allow you to breathe more easily through your knows but for those of you that are waken up of the mill the night breathing on your back or your partner is telling you that or other people are telling you that or that person on the plane with your mouth hanging open and grueling in your mouth breathing terrible terrible terrible for health reasons and other reasons put's a medical take over your mouth learn to be a nose breather during sleep your sleep will improve and your daytime feelings of wakefulness and focus will improve your party a vascular health will improve and on and on and now we largely cover the tools that one could use to get and stay asleep and we talked about exercise we took abut temperature we talked about supplements an we talked about of course keeping the sleeping environment both cool and as dark as possible i you want to mention a couple of broad contour tools that will impaturability to sleep really well on a consistent basis and the one that impacts the most number of people is weakens turns out that most everybody feels the impulse to sleep in on the weekend especially been out late the night before however the data show that keeping relatively consistent sleep and wake times is really going to enhance the quality and depth of your sleep if you stay out late one night sure you might allow yourself to sleep in and extra hour or but you should really try to avoid sleeping in longer than an hour beyond your normal wake up time that is right if you normally at eight hours of sleep and you wake up at seven a m probably oka to wake up at at a m on the weekend or after a night out the night before but try not to sleep until eleven or noon thinking that your going to catch up on your sleep or that is better than waking out at a consistent time it would be better to wake up at a consistent time pluserminus an hour and get a nap an the afternoon provided that nap again is not too long and the other tool that relates to nights that you state out too late or that you feel you an n a sleep in a bit more in the morning is if you are going to wake up at your consistent time for example normally go to bed at ten and you wake up at six let say that is your schedule and you and up staying up late one night until midnight or one for whatever reason and the next morning you wake up at seven and your still groggy in that case you absolutely want to wait to invest caffeine ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking you really do because there good day does to support the fact that affine can disrupt sleep yes that is obvious affine especially disturb sleep if you take it too late in the day that is very obvious as to why that would be the case but coffin especially distress what is called compensatory sleep if you start changing your waking time and your to sleep time and you start using additional affine to offset the sleepiness that your experiencing because of those late nights out will that is when you really start to disrupt not just your night time sleep but your daytime compensatory sleeps of those naps you also are disrupting the total architecture of sleep in the early morning hours there is a lot of great science that is been put to this or that is emerge from this i should say try and keep those sleep wake times relatively constant plus terminus an hour and try as much as you can to delay that affine an take nine you to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking every day but especially on days where you wake up and you feel you having got enough sleep in that case i highly recommend you just use amnesty are or the revery a we some other form of deep relaxation to try and compensate for the lack of sleep knowing of course that there is no complete compensation for lack of sleep there just things that we can do to partially offset lack of sleep now a couple of final points and additional tools that i think are going to be useful to everybody in particular people who have young children or following a shift work schedule or who are experiencing jet law keep in mind jet lag can be due to travel which is obvious but jet lag can also be due to getting woken up in the mill of the night right your body does not know the difference between flying to a new timezone and getting woken up in the mill the night the tool that it'd to offer you is an understanding of something called temperature minimum and ism going to make this as simple as possible and ism confident that every one can understand this even if you do not have any science background here is the question no you to ask yourself what is your typical wake up time i get what is our typical wake up time if for you your typical wake up time is seven a m plus terminus half an hour and that could be seven a m because you set an alarm clock or to be seven a m because you naturally wake up at seven am does not matter if your typical wake up time most days is seven a m well then your temperature minimum is five a m that is right your temperature minimum is not a temperature it is a time within your twenty four hour cycle approximately two hours before your typical wake up time your body is at it is lowest temperature that it will ever be in the twenty four hours cycled that is what it is called your temperature minimum here what you need to know about your temperature minimum if you view bright light exercise or drink affine or all of the above in the to to four hours be for your temperature minimum that will delay your clock what that means when i say to lay your clock is it will make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later the next night i get let us run this exercise for you the person waking up at seven a m on a regular basis i can predict with almost certainty that your body is going to be at its lowest temperature at five a m what that means is that if you get up at three a m or at four a m and you flip on bright lights in your house or in your bathroom for you have a cup of coffee or you do any kind of exercise or you get up and head to the airport the mechanisms in your brain and body that control timing of sleep and timing of waking will shift they will delay it is as if you put your clock on hold for a little while and then let it start again an that is the simplest way i can describe it and you will tend to want to go to sleep later and wake up later the following night now the opposite is true if you view bright light drink affine or exercise or socialist i should say in the hours immediately after your temperature minimum for you in this example the person whose waking up at seven a m your temperature minimum is five a m if you you bright light exercise may be have a snack may be not or socialist move about at five thirty or six a m or seven a m that will tend to face advance your clock it will tend to basically make you want to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier the following night now uses example of a person who wakes up typically at seven a m whose temperature minimum is five a m but of course you need to adjust that for yourself if your somebody wakes up at nine a m or five a m et camera why do i offer this is a tool well this is an immensely powerful tool if for instance you are headed to a times where you need to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier once you arrive in that times what it means is in the day or two before you leave you can force yourself to exercise drink affine may be even to eat a meal early in the morning or may you still fast early in the morning that is really up to you but you force yourself to do the at the activities that are going to phase advance your clock whereas if your travelling to a times own where you are going to need to go to sleep much later and your going to need to wake up much late or even a little bit later you can do those things in the hours prior to your temperature minimum now for those of you that work shift work this can be especially useful but i want to say a couple of things about shift work there are a lot of details about shift work and jetlag in an episode that i did specifically about jetlag and shift work for the deep dive go there but suffice to say this for now if you are going to do shift work try to stay on the same s it for two weeks at a time it is very detrimental to brain and body it can even be horrifically challenging for your brain and body in a number of ways if you are switching on the called swing shift you know your work in three days the night shift three days the dayshif three days the night shit tree days try and stay on the same schedule as much as possible and i should say for everybody people a jet lag and engaged in shift work or not but just for everybody if you need to be awake in the middle of your sleep cycle and it is not just a quick departure to the bath room and back to bed be really need to be awake you now you are feeding a baby or your om you are taking care of a loved one or you need to do something that is critical are you need to work if possible use red light and now for shift workers who really are trying to stay awake all night and sleep all day this is not going to be ideal but for people that for instant need to stay up really late one night or wake up especially early three a m to prepare for an exam that you just not ready for or to head to the airport et camera using red light has been shown to allow people to be awakenough h and obviously see what they need to see in order to perform their activity safely but it does not seem to nostrum the quarters all rhythm that is the healthy normal quarters all rhythm i realize this this kind of an advance tool and many people will not have access to this there are a number of different sources for red lights now on the companies u om or cosy light these are different brands i do not have any affiliation to any of these brands i should say their number different a red light bulb om sources out there in commercial sources that you can explore if you want but understanding this temperature minimum is really powerful because it allows you to adjust your schedule depending on travel depending on changing work schedules are school schedule and you are not a morning person you can use the tools related to temperature minimum to really become a morning person over time and it actually is pretty easy and i talked about this in a previous episode lie just mentioned that there have been shown to be important positive effects on cognition on even grip strength and physical performance for people that are early morning risers and that is especially true for night owls that deliberately shift themselves to become early risers o case o that is a lot of information and a lot of tools and i suppose the one set of tools that i really din drill in to to deeply the ones relate to jetlag and shift work and again please check out the episode on jetlag an shift work if that is relevant to you but i think for most people who are going to sleep at night and are trying their best to sleep while at night and are trying to their best to wake up in the morning at whatever hour and stay alert and focus throughout the day may be with a brief nap the tools that i talked about to day related to light temperature of food exercise coffin supplements and digital tools ism hoping will prove to be very useful for you they certainly are all supported by excellent previewed research and i should just emphasis again that most of the tools we talked about are completely zero cost while the supplements and some of the visual tools do carry some cost to them i really one encourage everybody to get your behaviors right get all of the things related to your timing of exercise and type of exercise in the best possible order and time of day we talked by this critical period early in the day and then another critical period in the middle of the day and the late afternoon and then this third critical period my the night different tools for the different three critical periods i promise that if you start to implement sum where i really all of these tools the quality of your sleep will increase tremendously and of course in doing the quality of your daytime alertness and your ability of focus will improve tremendously again sleep is the absolute foundation of your mental health your physical health and your performance in all endeavors if there is one area of your life to really focus and try an optimize if your goal is to be happier and more productive and just have a better life over all i can confidently say that sleep is really the thing to optimal if your learning from end or

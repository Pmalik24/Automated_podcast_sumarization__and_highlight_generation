welcome to the superman ladpodcast n the just science a science base tool for life i manner superman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is doctor madam grant madam grant is a professor of organizational psychology at the carton school at university of pennsylvania he is authored five best selling books and most recently has authored a new book entitled hidden potential he received his bachelor's degree from hazard university and his doctorate from the university of michigan to day we discuss pure viewed studies and tools based on the data from those studies that can enable people to meet their goals and overcome significant challenges including how to overcome procrastination as well as how to see around or through blind spots as well as how to overcome sticking points in motivation and creativity we also discuss the research on and practical tools related to the underpinnings of performance in any endeavor including how to increase one's confidence and how to have a persistent growth mind set by the end of to day's episode it will be clear to you that doctor madam grant has an absolutely spectacular depth and breadth of knowledge and that knowledge is both practical it is based on previewed research and he conveys those tools with the utmost clarity and generosity indeed by the end of to day's episode you will have more than a dozen new tools never discussed before on the superman labpodcast that you can apply in your academic endeavors in athletic endeavors in creative endeavors in fact in any area of life before he begin i to emphasized at this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocoss to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i the thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have spoken many times before in this pod cast about the fact that getting a great night sleep really is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the key things to getting a great night sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct and that is because in order to fall in stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment in the beginning middle and end of your night an has a number of other features tracking the amount of rapid i movement and slow wave sleep that you get things are essential to really dining in the perfect night sleep for you have been sleeping on an eighteslee mattress cover for well over two years now and it has greatly improved my sleep by fall asleep far more quickly i wake up far less often in the middle of the night and i wake up feeling far more refreshed than i ever did prior to using in eye sleep mattress cover if you would to try eight sleep go to eight sleep dock calm slash supermen now through nonmember thirtieth as a special holiday discount eight sleep is offering five hundred dollars off their bundles with a pod cover eight sleep currently ships and the u s a canada the u k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dock calm slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to a s by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real time feed back on your diet using a continuous glucose's monitor one of the most important factors in your immediate and long term health is your blood sugar or blood glucose regulation with levels you can see how different foods and food combinations exercise and sleep patterns impact your blood glucose levels it is very easy to use you just put them money on the back your arm and then you take your phone and you scan it over that money now and again and it downloads the data about your blood sugar levels in the preceding hours using levels has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount about what works best for me in terms of nutrition exercise work schedules and sleep f your interested i learning more about levels and trying g a continuous glucose monitor you can go to levels dot link slash superman levels has launch a new cesium censor that is smaller and has even better tracking than the previous fission right now they are also offering an additional two free months of membership again that is levels dot link slash supermen to try the new censor and two free months of membership to day's episode is also brought to us by waking up waking up is a meditation a than includes hundreds of meditation programs mindfulness trainings loaned sessions and amnesty a non sleep deep breast protocols i start using the waking up a a few years ago because even though have been doing regular meditation since my teens and i star doing yoganedra about a decade ago my dad mention to me that he had found an a our not to be the waking up a which could teach you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain ad body into different states and that he liked it very much i gave the waking up apathy and i too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes i only have a few minutes to meditate other times have longer to meditate and indeed i love the fact that i can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states depending on which meditation i do i also love that the waking up a has lots of different types of yoganedra sessions those he do not know yoganedra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind it is very different than most meditations and there is excellent scientific data to show that yoganedra and something similar to it called non sleep deep breast or ones boyar can greatly restore levels of connive and physical energy even which a short ten minutes session if you would to try the waking up a you can go to waking up doc come slash superman and as less a free thirty day trial again that is waking up doc come slash superman to acts less a free thirty day trial and now for my discussion with doctor madam grant madam welcome excitedly h very si to have you here a your career both public facing and academic career covered an enormous range of topic we have a lot to cover licretakin a and any time a two professor sit down or even one professor am says we have a lot to cover i think everyone listening braces themselves oh no but these topics a i assure everyone are of the utmost interest and you cover them in such both fabulous detail and you make it very clear ism really looking for it to this i to start off by talking about something that i am obsessed by and i know a lot of people are obsess with and struggle with and i know you also have a recent publication on this topic which is procrastination i am a bit of a procrastinator but a different way of stating that is that i love deadlines i learned in college that i love love love deadlines because it seems to harness my focus in my attention i just enough i guess you call it anxiety or autonomic arousal for the on ow narrow science or physiology granted folks for me just brings about a total elimination of all the distractions and it seems to both slow and accelerate my reception of time and it seems to bring out my best to have deadlines but i would prefer to not have to procrastinate in order to self impose deadlines i prefer that other people impose those deadlines in fact what do we know about predestination why do some people complete things while in advance why do other people procrastinate is it that they seeking deadlines as i believe i am and interestingly an sort of alluding to this recent paper yours what is the relationship between procrastination and creativity i feel i precise to steal with all that later but enough good one i by the ay there is extracredit for science ions on here me early don one of the best articles on procrastination ever written was titled at last my article on procrastinate intact la ye just made me smile ism i think that the the basic question i think to start with is why do we procrastinate and i i thought i was in actually when i came into this toping i was the the person who annoyed my college rotates by finishing my thesis a couple months early i found out there was a term for me ism a procrastinator is the you now the focus in the pressure that you get from a deadline i get that the moment the project starts i and sometimes months or years in advance and i was really proud of finishing everything early and then i discovered there are things that i procrastinate on too which was a little bit disappointing are you will into share what some of those i am i i am i procrastinate on anything that is administrative ism right though with you it gat time of my calendar it could take me weeks to respond you asked me a question about social science i will be back to you in a minute ism i procrastinate on grating takes me for ever i i basically put off a whole month of task that the thought had nothing in common it turns out that i procrastinate went on board boredom is i i guess it is probably my most hated emotion and i will do anything to avoid a boring task and i think this goes to why people procrastinate which is a lot of people think it is laziness or you are not disciplined enough but actually that the research on these is really clear that you are not avoiding work when you procrastinate in fact a lot of our procrastination is is focus on doing things that involve a lot of energy you have seen people probably clean their entire houses when there putting off a task ism it is is not that your being lazy it is that you are avoiding negative emotions that a task starts up for me it sports for a lot of people it is fear anxiety i do not now if i can pull this off i have an extreme case of impostors instrument this roll ism the the challenge in front of me is too daunting ism for some people is confusion i have not figured it out yet and i cannot work on this use i i feel come stock ism what is i guess the be question for you that address what is what is the emotion to causes you to crassinate it is charge for me to identify the stick here i think of it mores the carrot that comes with dead line and again i do not concern myself a prastinator per say i just really love deadlines in procrastination is a terrific way to simulate the dead line ah for me o you waits for you delay starting or finishing a task an order to have a a sense of time pressure that is right it builds a certain amount of internal arousal me to know o we have got seventy two hours to complete something and it is now game time i the sometime before the game time before a podcast it'll put in anywhere from several days to weeks or even months in preparation it it is really elastic depending on the topic but when it came to exams in school or if it comes to writing dead lines a i consider the the shipping of the product of the presentation of the live event that i happen to be doing as the second game the ore event the first event is the pressure and the excitement of getting into the groove of doing focus work because for me that is such a drug i mean it feels all having all the systems of my brain and body oriented towards one specific thing is just sheer bliss from me it sounds then you are you are actually not a chronic procrastinator thank you and never that is never been of the way if viewed myself but now i it'll take the it is a strategy for you it is a strategy that is right and i event i was fairly wayward youth barely finished high school et camera by time i got serious about school which was my second year of university when dead lines were presented there is an exam there is a mid term exam on a given date that was exciting to me that was exciting of that is the big thing that is my opportunity to to prove myself to myself cause i was really coming from behind and then the opportunity to or i should say that the feeling of dropping into that grove this is the exciting part is the preparation likewise with podcasting for our solo podcast i love the research as much as i love presenting the material maybe mayrymore maybe more right likewise for university lectures or for travelling and giving seminars as a traditional academic ism sure you are familiar with that right its it is wo preparation is where you realize it is almost i i think of it is somebody a miner in a mine and just finding a gem and of course there ought then they are all the thoughts of what you can do with that later and you've in to show people it u has a certain value to the world et camera but but it is the the searching in finding those gems that is even as i talk about i feel my bsigcan float out of the chairi've the same experience tit is the it is the the sri the unleash curiosity and tan the rush of discovery and by the time you're teaching it our explaining it but i ready notice have not learning it nothing any more and yes ism excited to share it and i hope it is helpful to other people yet think is as you talk about what your process less i do not even think what you do qualifies is for fascination technically i see's getting better better if think about how prefascination is is defined it is it is delaying despite an expected cost and you do not think there is a cost you actually see a benefit that is right and have tried starnatno for fascination that is its play you eve tried startingthings earlier and and i should say that my process often begins much earlier than the physical process if i was being observed in an experiment the of address finally sitting down to write this book chapter orbs finally sitting down to re search some papers for an episode but ism thinking about it all the time i may much to the dismay of people in my life ism ism ism constantly think about these things have making t walking to take out the recycle it'll have ideas and then it'll write them down i constantly writing things down voice memos into my phone have a method of capture where i baby trying to grab everything and then filter out what is useful do you have a process that for for gleaning ideas a little that i do now ism when when gelation and i started this research on procrastination she had she had come to me has very great of doctoral side and she said i have my best ideas when ism procrastinating and it was it was one of those moments where i did not believe her but i thought it was an interesting enough idea that it was worth exploring and i said show me get let us get some date to let seeing of recentest this and she ended up by gathering data in a careen company where she surveyed people on how often they procrastinate and then got their supervisors to rate their creativity and sure enough found that people who procrastinate sometimes were rated is more creative than people who rarely do me the procrastinators and i remember asking her what about the chronic procrastinators and s i do not know they never filled out my survey yes i recall from that paper there is inverted you shape function with procrastination on the vertical ones and and om and creativity on the horizontal axis let it let for o ki explain to me then the relationship between procrastination creative yes basically the the pique of creativity is in the middle of precrascinatia oka got it and tethered that there is an upside down you curve there and then i though this was fascinating than we go into the lab to say can we replicate this can we control it an an experiment and the hardest part of that was how do you canon me assign people to procrastinate to my knowledge never been done before and we eventually figured out that we can give people a a bunch of catastido and hen tempt them with highly entertaining you to ideas that were placed on their screen and we put different numbers of you two videos there than there is only one you are not tempted to procrastinate much if there are four you are probably going to get sucked in to a little bit of you too spiral if they are eight you might be putting off the task that is much less exciting than then you to watching jimmy kills mean treats for example and this was done in a thusly naturalistic continent thepibler people are in a computer the they are asked to to solve some create problems that look pretty similar to what you might do in your job and then were gin a score your creativity later and i it turned out that the people who were attempted to procrastinate moderately ism ended up generating the most creative ideas why is that ism the re couple tings that happen and you have to look at both sides of the curve what is wrong with the procrastinators and also what happens to the the extreme procrastinators ism and in both cases would happens is i you went up with a little bit attunnelvision ism when i dive right into a task ism stuck with my first ideas and i do not wait long enough to incubate and get my best ideas ism ism less likely to frame the problem ism less likely to access remote knowledge cause ism just ism just diving writing and meanwhile the credit procrastinators ism end up in the same boat because they do not get started until the last minute and they have to rush ahead with the easiest ideate implement as supposed to really developing the most novel idea and meanwhile that the people in the middle who yo starting to feel that pressure of why i i spun my wheels for ten minutes watching a bunch of you to videos am running out of time for this task they still have enough time to work on the ideas that were active in the back of their minds and and that gives them a shot at more novel ideas have tried to adopt this answer question have tried to adopt this is my process now to say i will still dive into a project ahead of schedule but i will not commit to an idea until have let it incubate for a few weeks and ism working on other things whereas an earlier version of me when it'd sit down to wite a book ism this is i had the book idea i would start rig in a day one now i have the idea i file it away and i give myself at least a month before i began drafting i and i think it feels less productive but it is far more creative what are your thoughts about some of what you described being a unconscious way bleeding the mind and the unconscious with an idea for instance a lentic a a school academicsonario where a students get an assignment and the assignment is contained within a folder and it just as assignment of and it is a do in a particular date and it was do on that particular date and there given the folder but they have no sense of what the assignment is you can imagine one category procrastinator that will take that thing and put it down and avoid looking at it entirely verses another category precastiner that will flip flip it open and take a look at oke this is going to be an essay on am i do not know something about a economic theory in the late seventeen hundreds close it and then procrastinate there is an idea which i frankly i subscribed to a little bit a because we recently did this series on mental health not mentaloness but mental health with doctor calcanei where he talked extensively about the unconscious and how the unconscious mind is always working with ideas things that we are concerned about performance these sorts of things even if we are not aware of them am what what are your thoughts about the creativity that seeded by slight procrastination being related to actually knowing what your precastidaning on specifically i i think it turns out to be i do twat to say essential but critical one of things we found is in order for moderate predestination to full creativity you have to be intrinsically motivated by the thing ore precascinating on interesting and what would happens is if yet if you if you are born for example by the topic you are knocking a open the folder you are nocking a start thinking about it at all it is knocking to began yum not can do any subconscious processing you are nocking to have any unsex feted connections ism between this topic and something else you have learned learned a outer or been curious about if you are interested in the problem than when you put it off you are much more likely to still keep it active in the back your mind that is when when you begin to to see young i imagine you can explain the biology of this ism imagine for example there is ism there is probably ism there probably more nail networks am that are connecting ism you probably get you get access to ideas that previously would have been ism sort of separate notes and i think that you you want to know what the topic is you do not wanted to see the blank assignment but you also have to find a reason that this is exciting to you ism otherwise ere can avoid it as supposed to letting it prolate that brings us to the topic of intrinsic motivation i and it'd to link that up with the topic of performance when i was in university there were many topics that i was excited to learn about some more than others of course but occasionally it'd be in a class or a getting assignment frankly had minimal interested never zero but mental interest an as a way of dealing with that i embarked on a process of literally lying to myself and just telling myself bouquet ism superinterested in reading this and ism got o forced myself to be interested in reading it and lo and behold i would start falling in love with certain things may be it was it was even the i the arrival of a word that i did not recognize and then i would go look atop an i knew i was studying for the glory at that time i d file that away i still have my know books of all the vocabulary words that i learned in the course of my university courses that frankly made the verbal portion of the glory lookpretty easy the which if you ever trying study for that at the end it is pretty tough to commit all those new words to to memory and context i could find little hooks and and through those hooks i could conrachet my way into a larger into rest and then lo behold ism really interesting green mythology you know that actually that one at first but and enough to trick myself but no may we could sendal a bit of time tile about what is true intrinsic motivation is it always reflective a can we make ourselves intrinsically motivated about us given topic or scenario or group of people a and then let us talk about how intrinsic motivation links to performance because there is a rich literature on this as i recall and i remember you the stamford study of rewarding kits for things that reality that is very moral to do if we could touch on catalo bit n remind people we have not heard about it but ism fascinating by this topic because i feel much of life is about doing things that initially we do not feel that excited to do and yet succeeding in life until you can afford to off load your a administrative work to somebody else which hopefully y now you have a you've done i i this is fundamental to being a functional human being frankly i just successful in are quotes but functional we got to do stuff that we do not enjoy doing yes i think were can tike about a couple different ways to nertrensions commotivation we can think about how the taskitself is design we can think about reward systems and then we can think about also the things we say to ourselves and others which i hope r not lies rather a persuasive attempts i let us t e lust tart on that when actually i i do not know a lot of people who are that good at deliver itself deception well well i to think it was only around a particular set of a goal motivated pursuits a but at that time for me also survival as i mention i did not do well in high school i really want to perform well in university but i knew that working just for the grade was not going to carry me it was it felt catabolic and i o know maybe i at that age i was still in the window of heightened neroplasticity we know it never closes but am but i think i also fell in love with the process of learning how to do what i just described ye i think for most people the best method of self persuasion is actually to convince somebody else i something of allied garrison's classically search cognitive to cent where he would he would ask you to go and tell somebody else a task you hated is really interesting and if the paid you a lot to do it you still hated the task because you had a justification i got twenty bucks to out to kind of five a little bit about this task i you at the task is bad but i did it for the for the payment when he paid you one dollar to go and tell somebody that you loved a task that you did not you ended up liking it more why and maybe i shouldn't be surprise but maybe you should tell me why i should be because i hope people got what you just said very clearly if they did not if you do not doing something going in reporting to somebody else how great that thing is lying about it to somebody else is one way to increase the you real to which you liker enjoy that behavior or topic and if your paid twenty dollars to go lie to somebody in the positive direction against your true believe it is less effective in shifting your your underlying affect about that thing your emotions then if your paid less get i exactly now i think obviously in the experiment lying was o an easy way to to show the effect but in real life i think the way that you wont to apply this is to say i have got to find something about this task that is interesting to me and then in the process of explaining it to somebody else ism going to convince myself because ism hearing the argument from somebody irony like can trust also chosen i how the reasons that i find compelling is supposed to hearing somebody ease's reasons and i think this this goes to the point that you were making which is if if you are trying o to find a hook to make a topic entreating i you have got a figure out coquet what is it that would m are this fascinating to me and in a lot cases what yore looking for as a curiosity gap i think shall scientists to talk about curiosity is an itch did you have to scratch there's something you want to know and you do not know it yet i would say i i tell my students often take your least favorite class and find a mystery or a puzzle something that you you just do not know the answer to exactly eve talked with our kids about this i what what really happened to king tut do can forget to the bottom of that and all of a suddenly i wonder n you do goglet and then i need to see if wicapedia has credible information on this and the more you learn about that the more intriguing it becomes i think that is that is the beginning of the process of of finding intrinsic mot ovation i see inherent in your answers the idea that there is something wired into our nor circuits and therefore psychology that curiosity as a verb the act of being curious and seeking information where well and i should say i defined curiosity in a hopefully you will disagree with me or agree either way does not matters longs we can get but deep understand i define curiosity as it desire to fine something out where you are not attached to a particular outcome yes that right give been psychologiscypically to find as just wanting to know and that means they're given by the question not a particular answer which is exactly what you are driving at o kit great and i think it as worthy parked that said the cure for boredom is curiosity there is no cure for curiosity as there there should not be a care for curiosity and by the way folks we do not know what nor circuits subserved curiosity in the brains rout it is a got to be a distributed network there is no brain area for curiosity but it is got to be linked up with the reward systems of dopamine et camera in some way because when one discovers something new that satisfies some curiosity that is clearly there is a there is a internal reward there o cat lemme back up if your child or an adult is dreading working exploring a topic or going about in assignment of any kind you will give them a question that they then need to resolve what if the the assignment is rake the leaves off the front lawn do you a do you say am count the leaves or i mean t how how does one get a past the sort of procrastination and a generate some intrinsic motivation for things that one dreads where it is unlikely that there going to discover some knowledge that is exceedingly useful for for future you always start with with we what is e what is the first experiment i can run find the most interesting looking leaf for your favorite law and than that that lasts for about two minutes and of get now w till the lot leaves there i i think not task can be made intrinsically motivating to everyone and when when intrinsic motivation is difficult to find what you want a substitute with is ism is a sense of purpose ism may be a better way to say that is ism when the process is not interesting to you ism you need a find a meting full outcome there is at there is some research an ism am the boring but a important effect where kids who have a purpose for learning ism this goes through high school and think this is not just interesting to me but ism in a bible ta use this knowledge to ism to help other people one day ism they they remove persistent and their studying they end of getting better grades and i think youknow intresicmotivation is often driven by curiosity about the how ism a sense of purpose comes from really thinking hard about the why why does this matter and it'd say with a you navethere making leaves let us try to connect that task to something that ill that you care about ism are you going to ism been a pleasantly surprise your parents when they get home ism are you going to ism you know have a place to place sacker that you did not before ism and i think then that the process of of getting to that i guys we i say is if you are find a motive it yourself ism it is a little bit harder than if you are trying to motivate somebody else on this if i was going to moth ate somebody else i would take a a page out of the motive national interviewing playbook where i would say don't i ant entity this place at her a second you are iterate a pile leaves it is the two hour task her is hand how excited are you about that three three really ism surprised i i thoughtyou'r u say her or one why is not not lower i any sort of physical activity because it allows me to move in i just move my body there my got to a you just identified a potential source of purpose for that activity and i i do not have a i don't have vested interest in convincing you to do this task i am genuinely curious about what would motive ate you to want to do it and as you start to articulate it be self persuasion kicking well then my monster using me si these approaches it'll dried at your own risk as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and our cognate functioning our memory our ability to learn new things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough sidemen and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimal process sources as well as enough robotics and preboil and fire to support thasially all the cellar functions in our body including the up microfilm now i most everybody try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods i really mostly from minimal processed or non process foods however one of the challenges that i and many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and probiodics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables that is why way back in two thousand in twelve long before i ever had a podcast i started drinking a g one and ism delighted the a g one is sponsoring the supermen la podcast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still drink a g one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those vitamins minerals robotics and fiber to ensure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you would to try g one you can go to drink g one dokcalm slash supermen to claim a special offer there giving away five free travel pass plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two again that is drink g one docile slash supermen to claim that special offer i have a question about extrinsic motivation if we grow up being incentivize by extrinsic things you will get your allowance if you blank you can spend the money that you make and on your paper out doing the things you really want to do is there any value in those kinds of learning basedinsentives fort kids and for adults because and that is the real world as well i i know plenty of people have family members that only work for a pack and there pretty o k because they spending their paycheck yuhobly more than i you'd not intrinsically attached to money i man i certainly have needs in in life but but i do not enjoy spending money for the sake of spending it or for gaining more possessions but i know people that do and i certainly do not judge m are they somehow existing in it in the diminished landscape of happiness or or because they seem pretty happy to me but they seem to have also worked out this relationship they do certain things to get the extrinsic rewards and they really enjoy what they can do with those extrinsic rewards there is there is a huge body of evidence on what are the effects of at extrinsic rewards on motivation of performance and i think the latest conclusions if you look at the the latest mat analysis huge study of study is trying to cumulate what is the average effect of adding a financial intend give to a task that was not insetevice before or to a job where you ware paid salary now being to give you inset of compensation ism there is a boost in general i people are are more productive when they are incentivize for their output but i these incentives are better for i for motivating quantity than quality you see people get more done but they are not necessarily more careful or more thorough o less careful unless they no ism actually the they are still positive effects on average they are just weaker i and of course you can then start to say hell ow to i incentives being fast an careful ism but i think were where we do have to be really cautious is ism there is an undermining effect of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation and you are you are alluding to this earlier stating back to the early seventies where we know that if we take an interesting task and then we pay you for it you might conclude that you are only doing it for the outcome and you lose interests in the tasks of the the classic demonstration mark lateral colleagues kids playing the door games and they are they are playing them because they're fun and than you start to add in an incentive and then when the hansentive taken away they do not want a play more because the meaning of the task is changed and now ism doing it cause i on to get something out of it a suppose to i left the process i think that that ism that phenomenon ism does not have to exist we know for example at work ism if managers as long as they give people autonomy i they do not present the rewards in a controlling way ism instead of saying drew in order to earn this you need to do the following work if they say hey lucky it'd really love it if if you would deliver the following am in an order to make that worth your while ism offering this incentive people react very differently when they have a sense of choice an control ism i think that that is i guess the starting point in the presence of autonomy i do not i do not think there is a major downside of of extrinsic rewards i think you also have to be careful that ism yet i guess that you are not over justifying the task in other words you are not i you are not swamping people's intrinsic reason f r doing it but your adding a reason to try it actually ism if we if we go to a different domain for a second ism thou get kids wo do not onto eat their vegetables exterrensic cansentives are very effective to get kids to try vegetables for the first time but then the hope is that they discover a vegetables to yo that they do not mind and and they find reasons to keep doing it ism and i think that that is how i want a lot of rewards to work i do not think that rewards should be carrots that we dangle to try to control people's behavior i think they should be symbols of how much we appreciate in value a particular behavior ad if you frame them that way it is a lot easier for people to say ye it ism that that reward is something that i really want but ism ism not only doing the task for that reward yo that that you basely answer the question i was going to ask which is an you risk of sounding new agee but we are sitting in californium i i could imagine that when one is focussed on the extrinsic rewards physical task or connive task for an extrinsic reward if ism focussing on the extrinsic reward ism also our quotes again not present it ism ism thinking about the outcome ism not thinking out process and i think there is you perhaps you can flush out some of what this is exactly but i think there is fairly extensive ism data to support the idea that when we are physically mentally present to the task that we are going to perform better and presume we are er i intrinsic liking of that task or performing that task increases as well as that true ye i think i think if we will not to break tome the mechanisms for why in transit motivation is useful for for performance ism one you touch on earlier it is focus of attention i you are it is much easier to find flow when your in intrinsically motive ate you get into that state of deep absorption where i time melts away you mention you've sort of either speeding up or slowing down your your sense of time you forget where you are sometimes you even loose track of your again to and you are just your just murders into the task and that that that concentration is helpful there is also a greater per distance effect that when you enjoy what you are doing you are less likely to give up in the face of obstacles you are more likely to think about it when you are not doing the task and come up with great ideas and i an i think there is there is a working harder there is a working longer there is a working smarter and there is also thinking more clearly effect this is a a brief but related tangent one of the things that have found incredibly difficult in recent years is that am in a most of my life really since i was a small kit i was forging for things and then nodi used to give lectures on money and class if they let me until they eventually stop me about the stuff i was reading about all we can gone early start n the professorial am front but now if ism reading something and i discover i what i think it s a really valuable piece of information or a cooler of protocol while this is really cool these findings are oh cool there is a problem which is that now i have an opportunity to cast that out to the world through social media we all do this could be an outside your insociamedia a from time to time i don ut your all over my i you and and i both do our own social media by ways which i really appreciate i think o one can always detective if some one else is handling on social media yes ism on social media and and i love that i have the opportunity to both am send out ideas an information and also received fee back i really love the comment section am and always encouraged comment i learned from it a frankly love is that a word i learned from it and and you and i were weened in the academic culture where frankly that the kind of hazing that that one receives an academic culture is very different than the kind of hazing that one receives on social media but am lets you say that if you come up through macadamia you develop a pretty fix skin a i g i do have to say that that the there is a part of me that was really surprise when i started posing unsocial that i love i left constructive criticism i was unprepared for the number of people who will new jerk criticize a study without even looking at whether the methods or rigorous right y come on if i posted this surely it is at least worth concerning the possibility the the strong evidence behind right well that is where a a i am a brief o i will not call it a retort but a response of a i a clearly you should read the study further because i think you will be satisfied with the answer something i do not ow a but i agree it it can be a little bit harsh in there sometimes but the social media a channels are i think how they have it is a double edge plate ism the obviously have their issues but can be a wonderful opportunity to share information and share it quickly the problem is that it takes me out of what i was doing initially which was learning searching for those gems with with which to share later and i think there is a broader landscape to consider this where people for instance are was that the beach yesterday s just absolutely spectacular day at the beach especially for this time of year and everyone as taking pictures of that experience on their phone and probably sharing that experience either social meteor with friends a this is very different then taking a photograph and not seeing that photograph until later or not sending it out an there now her infinite number of circumstances where we are taking out of the rewarding experience i shall release that we are taking ourselves out of the rewarding experience and focusing on a different rewarding experience that i think by definition is an entrance if reward we are take ourselves out of our entrants early rewarding experiences and activating these extents if rewards and do you think in any way that is undermining our experience of things that we really enjoy am again not to demonize social media or these channels but am have personally found it difficult to refrain from sharing this knowledge o m excited to share but i deliberately delay and there is lot have a deep list of folders full of things that i want opposed but have just doing it be no systematically over time because i really fight the temptation to to do this mostly because i want tod continue to enjoy this learning process in this the seeking process much yet i i feel the same the same i i feel torn i think i think i was e b whit who said i i rise in the morning torn between the desire to enjoy the world and the desire to improve the world and this makes it difficult to plan the day and i i i feel that every day i think ivy night i even i felt it this morning i was o case time to it is time to leave to to come to the the humoral pod cask mi wait but i did not hit my minimum sunlight viewing whit what d m i do do i show on time for you or do i meet your criteria the the the explanation i was getting my morning sunlight and therefore ism ex number of one an the even hours late would have been completely fine i figure much yes i the e i the bit and acceptable excuse with you i think every night i think everybody experience's aversion of this and i it is evenly gotten worse with was social media and with smartphones i i think a one of the most startling datypoints for me was the glory mark first to put this on my made a before loved the average person was checking email seventy two times a day how do you ever concentrate for more than a couple minutes if yourself interrupting that often you cannot bright shelty has a great term for this sh she calls it time confess and she says we are taking these meaning full blocks of time and we are slicing them up into these tiny little tots of confess and not only can we not accomplish anything we are also writing our own sense of joy because it is really hard to enjoy the t the thirty second blip of time that you get on a task and i think we know a lot more about this distance these problems than then hot solve them but one thing we do know is blacking out on a interrupted time is meaningful there is a great lassie parlor experiment where she takes engineers and she has them she sets a quiet time policy no interruptions to say thursday fridge before noon sixty five per cent of one average productivity could you repeat the the protocol yes at quiet time the obliteration of it but i think the most effective one with to say thursday fridge no meetings no interruptions no slack no males before noon and during those periods of no interruptions one could tend to whatever their primary purpose is at work yetyesor for me might be potcasting obi say i would porno my phone here never do but it does not mean no interaction with any one else it just means focussing on the major t task exactly and you come in with a clear sense of priority and purpose and i soft hin there is anything magical about to say the a fridge before noon it just the idea of setting a boundary and collectively committing to it that that seems to be important and i think when i think about this it'd be it'd be really curious about your take on i oncrono types here because i think one thing give learned in the at couple years is that if you are a if you are morning person you do your best analytical and creative thinking in the morning and the quiet time block would work very well for for me is a morning person if you are night will you probably want that block in the late afternoon and i was encouraged there there was some evidence during bovid that people have their best meetings right after lunch that there something thirty per cent less likely to must i task in an after lunch meeting i guess you puca probably unpack the the fruitcoma you not getting reenergize by other people but it is led me to wonder if we should all be protecting the first few hours in the last few hours of the day for deep work and and doing our core meetings and interactions and kind of off task activities in the middle what do mouthing about that as a sequence will a lot of questions about this for you but i love that sequence it certainly fits with my natural rhythms i i think there is ample evidence to support the fact that provided one is sleeping well at night and is on a more or less a standard status one i say standard imine going to bed somewhere between let us say nine thirty and eleven thirty p m waking up some time between let us say am six a m an eight a m may be five thirty seven thirty am something that not highly unusual a night owl or super early bird for people that are following that sort of schedule the first let us you say from zero to eight hours after waking there tends to be a fairly robust increase in all the catacolomine dope me group an errand up and frond which generally get generally speaking a my to increases in alertness attention an focus that are great for analytic work a great for implementation of strategies that you already understand and you need to churn through a lot of stuff am and of course tires a big increase in the morning especially if you vet morning sunlight a healthy increase i should say in martial sort is all is not bad folks you you want corse all but you want that pick early in the day we know that o was for most people it seems at least my understanding is that am that period of times rota eight a eight hours after waking or a is best devoted to the quilintqua most critical tasks but one of the common problems is that people take that a ability to implement a known strategy and they start battering back all the meals or talking to all by the way talking to to workers is great and it is often required but it is wat the questions whether notes productive conversation or whether not just conversation and we tend have a lot of energy early in the day and ism ism obsessed with the idea of normal energy as oppose to just choleric energy am there were time ut neural energy and then post launch really i mas we get to this or of you no nine to seventeen hours after waking there is a dip autonomic arousal that during the middle the day the postprandial dip there is a post lunch sleepiness a that can be partially offset by dealing you morning caffeine a bit if you have the afternoon crash but it is interesting the that a more productive meetings and less a last witching and distraction occurred a in meeting set after lunch because that makes me think that perhaps being a little bit less alert is going to lend itself to more focus and indeed that is the the sort of optimal state relaxed but focus you car not sleepy a but you also do not have much intrinsic energy that your you not ting on to a lunch of things as i think a lot of people do feel that way in ism drinking yo doublestpresso right now a late mind morning a late morning a and you i can sit still but i think of certain fume meetings how do i say this i don won't offend any of my colleagues only that they are morning enough they are not content rich enough to to grab all my attention and nowadays of course their multiple screens fibula have got twophones in a computer and raft really spend some work to flip over those phones while iron azumand things that a nelovroting a say it may be the reduction in autonomic arousal that that supports what you just described but i do not know a my my thinking a my understanding rather was that creative work and kind of a brainstorming was best accomplished in the late afternoon a have noticed when lecturing it'd be curious what your experience is with a in university lectures when i held courses in the evening i to hold my courses five to seven p m r even seven to nine thirty p m when i was teaching undergraduates that people were much looser and more relaxed and i always a i thought the that might have something to do with an increasing gala transmission that is known to happen late in late evening the emerge was a more relaxed what and less social anxiety they have been around people for much of the day ait i i i send back more reflections and answers i i do not have any firm nerasignce explanations for what you described but but there are some emerging theories about how it might work and t has the zero to nine hours face one nine to seventeen hours face too an then of course from seventeen to twenty four hours i'llcall it face street you should be asleep ideally well that i think there is there is a there is a confound in your your teaching experience which as undergrads often sleep in until what noon order they might be up in till for i am or at least ten a ms seems to be a typical rise tine out of the underground in a morning class might be too early for them to be fully awake but there is there some plan new evidence that at least on create to be at work i i read it a series of this three studies recently showing that early birds actually did do more creative work in the morning and in part i think again that i do not day any narrow scientist has has touched the mechanisms on this yet but in turn to the psychological processes early on there is just there seems to be a benefit of of the energy level i and some that energy leads to more divergent thinking and later if you are morning person you might lose the ability to to diverge quite as much and you end up in a more conventional space of thought does that does that track at all with yourunderstanding of how hey might play out in the brain mine er change is to be bit in it would be individual but yet there is something to these liminal states between sleep and waking maybe we can am rap a con lenient bow around what i said in what what you just said which is a that we know that in the transition states into an out of sleep and it does not assail have to be within the first half hour in and out of sleep that a there seems to be more divergent think long are least activation of neral net works that a are not as constrained as one observes when there in a in a sheer task and stray implementation mode right i mean i think is then a similar to the shower effect the shower office o people of ideas in show what or while running or of while falling asleep up or my best ideas always come within the first hour after waking that is we i carry a notebook round in with this may of people my life oftentimes i i do not want to hear or we talked any one first thing in the morning axis this problematic and i had to make adjustments will talk about adjustments between a a productivity and as a control and and a family interactions this is something i know you you have worked on and written about am but those liminal states are are interesting and and it'd love your thoughts on this a have had several guests on this podcast talk about their creative process a namely rid rebel a s famous for his work in music of producing also as a great podcast ogrematon am as well as called divert the colleague of mine who really in the point zerozerozeero one per cent of am supertalented by engineers nor scientist who also happens to be a full time am clinical psychiatrist and has five children o k am and i asked them about their creative process cause both of them are very creative a car's process involves the following late at night for him but it could really be any time of day deliberately making his body as still as possible and forcing himself to think in complete sentences ricks creative process although it includes a lot of different things has a lot to do with also getting very still lying down o k other folks that i have spoken to academics and an artists have referred to getting their body into motion but quieting their mind these are two opposite processes one case the body is still but the mind is deliberately very active in the other scenario the body is very active but they are making their mind sort of in free association not still but they are not deliberately thinking about any one thing fascia and ism obsessed with this maybe we you and i could work on this i do first sabbatical may we could figure this out because i have anything any onside this beforright because teethe the nervous sit no the nervous system hi am not aware of anyone as done it formally either the nervous system of course is am is a brain body phenomenon and what happens when we sort f cut off the deliberate operations of brain or body and it does not seem to matter whether not its brain or body as long as one as deliberately shut off and anyway i love your thoughts on this am i do not concern myself like a alter creative or creative type ism to any great degree but me neither hot o but ism fun fascinating it yore right but i turn your right but that but ism fastening by these deliberate tactics that highly creative people have have a undertaken i in order to bring about ideas i certainly have some of my best ideas when ism running and it'll just be running on my goodness i wat s even thinking i i need to write this town or came than continue i tried the dicer mouth approach and that the rebel approach actually to spend a week with rick ism oversees and indeed he spends a lot of time just still thinking and it is a very hard practice to get am to get consistent with i wonder i wonder if their individual differences here on an which needs to be stable or steady i i think you it think about a huge part of creativity is an is overriding your default instincts and if your somebody whose default is to have your mind constantly going then quieting would probably shift your your train of thought to something more original or unconventional i the opposite might be true if you have a naturally quiet mind i would imagine you need it you need it sort of jolt yourself out of that with lots of access to net to free ranging thoughts and i be interesting actually to study whether we can predict what you should still based on your personality i want and maybe what we could do in that study think we have a collaboration brewing in others joking to two scientists walk into a room and what comes out as a collaboration i it'd onto put people in a scanner it is hard to get people tread milling in a scanner because a movement aren't to fact but and just look at net a resting network activation and compare that to resting net work activation when people are completely still and forcing themselves to think an deliberate o send and then look at the overlap in that than diagram that is what is of interest to me they may be completely different brain states they might actually have more similarity than differences i wonder than if you can tie that to differences in the quality and quantity of output i would imagine that one of the benefits of either kind of movement is that you a you ant up increasing the volume of ideas which we know is good for variety and ultimately increases the probability that you stumble on to something new but than i think this the being still part is probably better for the filtering process i i think one of the hardest parts of creativity is actually judging your own ideas most most creative people have many terrible ideas in fact the most creative people have the most worked liters because they just have a lot of ideas and i i think that maybe there is a there is a way in which quieting either your body or your mind allows you to gain some distance from the idea and see whether it is bone headed or promising i to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tractor inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood en dine to help you better understand your body and help you reach your healthcoals have long been a believer in getting regular blood worked on for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test i man your problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get

dot calm slash supermen along those lines when one is trying to gauge the quality of their ideas how do you cope with or how does one cope with not placing a judge on that that causes some uni false negatives where you were your wiping out great ideas because you no rick rebel talks a lot about do not give the audience what they want they do not know what they want thy have not seen it yet if it is a truly creative idea they have not seen it and but of course we all have to develop our own sense of taste well how does this process work for you i mean you in about and worked on a tremendous range of topics an always i must say with with such rigor and such clarity of communication about the objects yeti's absolutely true mean one hundred per cent we say around here no week sauce and er is no week sauce in your a game it is incredible when do you get your ideas and how do you filter those ideas i feel the wen could be any time i think the you have you have v clearly experience this to for me the best thing about hosting a podcast is i haven't excuse to learn about anything i want from almost any one i want and i get to call that part of my job and i feel that having that built and mechanism for learning means ideas could could come at any moment the the filtering process for me is i it is evolved over the last few years what i but i do now is if ism that say ism starting any book it'll read a draft to the first chapter and i send it to five to eight people whose judgment i trust and by design some of those people are in my feel the no deep seated in organizational psychology others are very far out it'd but curious about the topics ism interested in and i ask them for is er to tend score this is the may relearn to do as i as a springboard diver where i would i would take off ism and ism doing e a few flips or twists and i think my dive as good but i cannot see it as ism hurling and mid air and it is of everything's a blur and i have to rely on my coach to tell me if it was any good i feel that creative work as the same way you are too close to it to know how the audiences gan react to it and yes you do not want o create it just for the audience but the end of the day you wanted to be interesting or useful to them i ask for the year to tent and no one ever says ten and and i use that is a calibration mechanism if everybody is in the seven or eight range i know that ism on to something promising and now i need a refine it f i get much to twos threes three and a half yet i either need a rethink the idea or dramatically rewrite how ism positioning it and i think one the mistakes a lot of people make is they know they need feed back on their ideas they go to one or two people and they start to feel a little bits defensive or threatened and their ego gets involved and then they do not ask for any more what they do not realizes it is actually less painful if you get more back because when eight different people critique your work you start to realize that a few of the comments that sort of bruise a little bit we are just radioman critic and no one else cared about those issues but then five people had the same problem that is not taste that is a quality issue and have got a focus on that and it really helps to filter what are the what breathe provisions i need to make what a the problems and complaints i need to pay attention to verses what can ignore as maybe this product was not for that person ism recalling when i was a nostoc a had a manuscript fully prepared and i worked in a laboratory where i did not work on the same thing as my poster adviser he was very gracious in letting my be the outwore and he said well i do not know anything about this topic before you submit it to this featly prestigious very frankly very procedious journal it'll be honest a youshall i go down the hall and handed to and i do notary was cause ism still in the same department a and i gave it to him this individual and he looked down he said yet you non it looks interesting but i do not think there is can to be a whole lot of interest in these is just not ill think no way this i think this is really cool but i was pretty dismayed sos cacao i do went back to my adviser and thankfully he is a bit of an iconoclasm and he said that is the best feed back you could have gotten definitely submit end to that particular journal and i must say that paper got accepted faster than any other paper have never had an experience that i mean it required some provisions i remember thinking we what an unusual response to after having instructed me to go ask a more senior colleague rays of at the time assistant professor and then to get the new it sensually negative response and then to take that as yo should deafly send it out it really taught me a lesson that sometimes one needs to invert there their action according a to the negative fee back they get not always but am thorns an end of one o casts it not a should be extrapolate to too many circumstances but baby led me to not seek out a feed back prior to submission of things terribly often i mean a i check information obviously prior to podcassin check the validity of the information and podcastsin papers but it made me realize that people's opinions can be idly idiot pancreatic and and in some cases outright wrong and really the the opinion of the journal is whatwhat mattered most in in terms of getting it accepted or not u how do you you said give it to the greatest number of people but if it is anything comments on social media there is a salience to negative comments how shall we filter positiveorsis negative we back well there is a her's mean sis here this is cleaner and deny ism looking at a hundred years of feed back research and they found that what drives the utility of feed back is not whether it is positive or negative it is whether it focuses on the task or on thyself if i tell you that your work is terrible you are going to get defensive if i tell you that your work is great you are going to get complacent if i tell you here is the specific thing that i liked about your work you are going to try to learn to repeat bat and if i tell you here is the thing i did not you are going to try to see if you can fix it i actuallythink we should worry less about whether the feed back is encouraging or discouraging and more about how do i make sure that i get input that is can allow me to learn from my strength and also overcome my weaknesses ism and actually i one things give have learned recently is there is some would say growing body of evidence at this point that asking for fee back is not the best way to get people to help you i because when you ask for feed back you end up getting two groups of people you get cheer leaders and you get critics and cheer leaders are basically applauding your bestself critics are attacking your yourself what you want is a coach which is somebody who helps you become a better version of yourself and the way you get people to coach you is not to say give me feed back because they will then look at the past and tell you what you screwed up or what you did right what you want is to say can you give me advice for next time and then they look the future and they will give you either a north on something to repeat or something to correct and this is such a subtle shift bat i can make a big difference ism everyone thinks have i guess i found myself applying this to a lot is ism i after going speeches i used to get off stage and say told love some feed back and you get back a much of oh i really enjoy that thanks what if i do with that information ism trying to learn how to get better and when i shift the question to say what is the one thing i and do better next time oh do not open with the joke the audience can tell you a joking ism i frequently it is give me a little bit more of a through line you focussed a lot on a bunch of interesting points but i lost the connective tissue and yet there is those actionable suggestions are much more likely to come when you just ask for a tip i suppose to an evaluation it is good ominous pause for a second i i'venever taken a push have taken occasional pass bur at to be one but they are very rare om as the audience knows oh that that is just gazillion dollar advice because i think that i everyone has an ego we all want to perform well we would to perform better over time and negative he back hurts and it can hurt a little or a lot depending on how defensive we are but a tool you just describe to remove some of that defensive armor that we all have and and actually let the information in in a way that is constructive is really great what you described i think is a way to create constructive criticism but the constructive part is really coming from within i suppose to saying it'd some constructive criticism and then hoping that the criticism is actually constructive you are taking control over the process in a healthy ay in a benevolent ay that that is the goal and i think the the question at comes up for a lot of people at this point is e i get somebody to give me advice but it might still stink how do i get better at taking at constructively and i think probably my favorite technic on this i learned from shelakhin she calls it the the second sore an the ideas that when somebody gives you a piece of criticism that is your first score that say hat a i in my in my world they gave me a three and a half and i want to know how i can do better next time how do i get myself to focus on that what idea is say i want to get a ten for how well i took the three and a half and that is the second score i want to o valuate myself and how well i took the first score i i think about this almost every day there was a i shall i i tell you quit story when i was at right out of my doctor it i got asked to teach a a motivation class for eirforse generals and colonels i was twenty five i think twenty five twenty six a ounothe'r they are all twice my age i they have got thousands of flying hours they have got billion dollar budgets they have got well this community well their nicknames striker in sand dune and i was extremely intimidated i i walked in there and i i thought i had to impress them and i started talking about my credentials and all my research experience and the feed back at the end of the four hour session was brutal i remember i reading the feed back forms and one person had written more knowledge in the audience than on the podium true i cannot procure that and then another ut i gained nothing from this session but i trust the instructor gain useful insight and that that was devastating is can i i would really to transform into an actual bear and hibernate next four months and then maybe it'll come out of a whole ready to hear this and have that option i had committed to teach a second session a week later it is all i could do was figure out how m i get hear this feedback and really take it seriously and guess i plied a version o the second score and i said i therhether some generals that are going to come back and see me again ad have got a prove to them that i was open to feed back and one of things i heard laud in clear was that they valued humility and i had led with too much confidence which was just in security based and i thought somehow to i how quite changed the suasion and walked in looked at the room and i said i know it sourball thinking it now what could possibly learn from professor who is twelve years old dead silence oh no sis the is going to horribly wrong and than i w ne the eyes in the audience i johmpson is i ah that is ridiculous he hold of at lease thirteen everybody started laughing it broke the ice and i think what a what i was trying to do was to take myself off the pedestal and say luck i heard your feet back you told me that you did not think i had anything to teach you and have got to acknowledge that right up front and be open to the fact that that is true and i want to coming here learn from you and i want to see if i can curate a conversation where we all and up learning and the we back was night and day different afterward i a won on person wrote although junior in experience the professor dealt with the evidence in an interesting way it it'll take it and ism there is something really powerful about about saying luck n i cannot change the fact that they hated my session what i can do is convinced them that i was motivated to learn from their criticism i love this concept of the second score and thank you for sharing that story i think you very often u we hear about people you who if people then catch the math in there a you ere paged by aged twenty five and as far as i know the the youngest tender professor a pen at twenty eight these are outrageous a outrageously impressive u metrics of accomplishment but for you to share a story about a less than optimal proforments and how you adjusted to it and and am the incorporation of the the second score that you referring to i think is a is really appreciated because i think that as much as we hear oh jordan you took many more freethrows and everyone just thinks about all the ones he made people think about all the ones he made it's the way the game works that's the way the mind works i should say it is appreciate that you flush it out with a with a personal example i too would want to turn into a barren disappear why i but i think that it is really impressive what you did and and i and it makes me think that the second score of getting a ten it at bringing the three and a half up right a as it were is really about turning a score into a verb process you over and over again as i do this podcast and and as have daughter the classroom when i keep coming back to is i idea that we should be focussing more on verbs and less on nouns we love to name things and categorize them but but when we start living life through a lot of verb process instead of getting being fit ism wetting about that a running as a thing really thing about just running right get becomes less daunting and and we accomplish far more but the idea that a you know the as is their mathematical models of the sumpsure but where you are baby talking about an integral right as supposed to just some value but you time but the slope of the line bight you're three and a half how are gouging to get to a ten gosh that is a huge gap and your dealing with back on your heel psychologically from getting all this in o battering feed back from these a these a highly accomplished individuals all these a arson a literally wearing them presumably on their body i see for you to see and and it is really about creating it is about taking control the slope of that line from the three onward and it is really a forward looking perspective i do not thing we are being in unduly a psychological here politic i may think it is really about taking a moment state and a now and turning it into a very ye i think that is right i from him a a great philosopher homer siphon whoa that verging weird language is it is harder to talk about is i in her i swear it and steal it from the siphons but if it came from homer siphon li am all for i on that is small train at of a small brain but given the size of his brain people haveseen the image a a fairly fairly robust knowledge her i venture on to some think i verbs are active and were we are drawn to them i i think yet a lot of times people review their past work and they just they end up shaming an earlier version of themselves in the they wallow an rumination and wet what we want to try to do in that situation which is easier see then done is say i purposive you knower of getting three back or advice is not to shame my pass that is to educate my future self a which i think is very connected to a low the work on growthmine set that that you have been talking about and there is been a fire start of controversy around i can we teachgript growthmine seine schools lately and a i think but but that is underscore for me is but you cannot you cannot expect some one to listen to one podcast episode or go through one workshop and magically believe that they are capable of learning anything at any moment this as something we have to actively work on on a daily basis and part of doing that exactly as you have said is thinking about the slip and saying right a the person that i ism computing with is my myself and i want o get a little bit better to day than i was yesterday ye i think am along lines a growthmin sand i was see we both no carrel track and respect her tremendously and i am i realize there is some controversy now around how you readily one can teach growthmine setter in corporate growthmines at my understanding and a love no a your thoughts on this is that when the wack work is combined with some of the all drum work that is protamine sat is combine with a knowledge just a basic and true understanding that stress and the feelings of anxiety and mention that am can actually be performance en hanging when those two things are combined i think this the work of avid eager in colleagues at eutiaustin that a indeed growthmines tat becomes a more visible in o in our a mine sets an performance am and are there other aspects to growthmine said and and other am other mind sets that are now being woven into that frame work that that can be helpful because i know am gash if ever there was a great name for a proof psychology growthmines at tells you everything you want everything you need and everything you for of need to know and just the name am but i we all find it difficult to implement ism just telling myself ism not as good as something as i could be yet it sounds great but in moments a of receiving feed back ah that is harsh sometimes it shard to asks us yet t is i think the the latest es a magnamera ism at all met analysis and than yuan i think serve that campphrsis the the carol in avid camp ism you have very different views an how big the effects are but i think one thing that they seem to agree on is growth mind that is more important in circumstances where people are more likely to need it ism if you think about for example ism kids who are impoverished ism ore marginalize communities ism you know the message that you actually that you you are capable of ism of evolving your skills to the point that something you are bad at to day you could be good at next year ism is really important when you never heard that before i and when you do not have a single person believing in you i think we are ism we are we are often missing the boat is we think i ism just get a of an in still this idea in a person's head and my work as done ism and we know that the contacts around you really matters i'mactually carols done some research showing that i growth mind sat is more likely to have an impact i when you are classerin culture ism also and your teacher it has the belief that kids are capable of learning and growing ism that you are you are starting ability is not fixed in any subject and i think we probably for all of us as individuals what that means is we need to think about the the micro environment that we put ourselves in ism i think the as one one thinks i think you lot about late my is scaffolding and the idea that yuknowhenyou are when your thing to improve it something you do not need a a permanent teacher necessarily you do not need one mentor guiding you for nine years what you need is is somebody who can give you the temporary support that allows you ti to scale to a new height just a a scaffoldwood on a building ism and in learning theory baysictly the idea behind scaffolding is organ initially give you the support you need to solve a problem and then we are in a slowly remove the support that you learned o to do it on your own and i think that those those kinds of scaffolds are often missing we can still the growth mind wetly got that belief in my head but i do not know what i need to do ism to you have to put that belief into action and that is where am that i guess that that me is and we have to go beyond mind set we have to think about how do we put people into contacts that allows them to to put their beliefs into practice you were asking me wet else do we need to support growth mind set and make it effective freight he's an we know people earn what growth mines it is at the idea that you're not as good at something yet o can terrific but it is very hardy implement in real time there are if to presume additional tools that one can a bolster that growth mine set with make it make it more accessible and benefit from it yes i just injury and ami resneskin i i study this actually we did am we were looking at growth mine set at work and a listens ah well he is the s and for under nog you met him yet have none but big place am yes ti finger you'll we all know as soon if that ya brilliant creativity researcher and my just joined us set at carton and ta has fundamentally change the way that i think about i ideas i in the way that she studied how we can shape our contacts and just done path breaking work there and we we were interested in growth mind set and we we design an intervention where people could learn growth in set at work we taught them to think about how their skills were malleable how stretch their knowledge into new areas and we have found that teaching them at that was not enough to boost their happiness or their performance well we needed also do is give them a growth mind set not just about themselves but also about their jobs in other words to teach them that your job as a set of flex of building blocks that you have got a whole bunch of tasks that make up your jobs some of those er are things to do others or might be inner actions that you need to have and if you break down your your job in all these tasks you might have some tasks that you want to accentuate and make a bigger partner job i there that you want ta try to subtract mothers that you might swop with the colleague and a lot of people it turns out think their jobs or are fixed by their job descriptions but in fact you have a ton of opportunity to say wen am m other something'there is a strength i have but ism not using it right now is their way we can bring that into my work and ism in these couple experiments we did when we randomly assigned people to learn both that their jobs were valuable and that their skills were valuable they got a sustainable boosts to their happiness that would lasted at least six months there was no cost to their performance i meaning you could to re design your own job to be more enjoyable without a without a drop in the effectiveness of your contributions at to your workplace and i think what i i came away from that research realizing is it is not enough to just say what what i can get better i can improve because very often you feel your your environment is limited i greatly i can grow but ism stuck a dead and job and what we need to do theirs is open up the opportunity for people to to to innovate on their own job description and then growth in set can begin to to have an impact we it it sounds a bit adding a s to growth growth mind set is not growth mind set it is growth mind sets a because earlier you mention that in the classroom environment if the teacher adopts a growth mind set yes as well as the students well then you have a culture of growth mine set it is the interconnectedness of this and and the contact in which the individuals growth mines that exist to have that it well put yet we mended of calling it duel mind set but i think making it a blurred is get because its it is not i i have this image of you know u you put a person in a in a cage and then tell them they are capable of growing still stock in a cage and we need a we need to give them a chance to to bust through those walls superimportant i hate to take us back to an earlier topic but there is something that i mentascu that i did not an an absolve needing to ask you which is your recent work or recent is work as a few years back now and your prolific that i have to call it a few years fact am the relationship between intrinsic motivation and performance on other tasks a ya ya and the reason i ask is is severalfold am i did two episodes of the podcast on did and one of the things that i learned in talking to experts on at it people with ad h t as well as looking at some of the novel treatments everything from behavioral to prescription drug to even nutrition based was that kids and adults with clinically diagnose a h t our actually terrific paying attention to things that they really enjoy or that the superinterested in clearly they have the capacity is just that they have am deficits f you well in attending to things that are less exciting to them less entreating to them if i recall correctly you have publication that explored the relationship between intrinsic motivation and performance in other stuff and one of the major conclusions was that having a deep deep interest in one thing might not be the best a condition for performing well at other less interesting task could you am could you tell us about that study what what motivated you to carry out that study and what some of the major take always were yes definably a you you sunrise it really well i think a the the original petit that this is another project with y hasten and a g h came to me wanted money to study entrance of motivation and we were talking about what we know about intrinsicmotivation and what are the gaps in our knowledge and one thing that has always bothered me is when psychologists study something that sounds positive and they only study the benefits of it there is no such thing as an unmitigated good rite all all a sort of enjoyable experiences have costs all up aslant experiences can have benefits we needn't we need to fill out this to by to of good thing bad thing a good out come bad out come a and i my challenge to her was can you show me the dark side of interanstic motivation and she came back and she said what if there is a cost of loving a task leaving here to hate a task that you do not even more than you did before si go that is an interesting idea attracts with a basic psychology of contrast effects i where a if you eat something delicious than your least favorite food tastes a little but worse afterward and i let us the study that i should have getting data from i from people at work and the we also design an experiment is sure enough i the the more passionate you are an task one the more your performance suffers if task too is really boring and i guess what what this did for me is it made meting differently about last sequence i used to wake up in the morning and do my most interesting task first and than the grating was hell and when i do now is i start with a moderately interesting task it is a little bit of warm up for me and then i have an exciting one to look forward to and if i do have a task that is boring but important i think the performances get a suffer else interesting a and normally do not ask about morning routines and how one structures t day because it is highly individual a clearly are and and depends on whether not people of kids and there patron what other ah but it'll just share with you a brief anatto to have a friend who is a very accomplished musician and has been for for several decades now and he told me that he has a practice of after he gets off stage and he is stadium stadium sell out level a musician a has been for a long time and shows no signs of stopping just incredible but a very down dearth person am and he said one of the first things he does when he gets off stage is to go to some menial task i though there is no way that is true but have known his wife since college and she he verified that statement in what what sorts of his menial task you time by his i like cleaning up some of the cans and things that are there made even cleaning a toilet at a then you and i thought no chance but it turns out to be true and i said what is whats this about is about humility som well may be a little bit but he said it actually makes it a lot easier for him to return home and deal with the kind of little things that just are out of scale with the experiences that he just had his tapering i a use i think ye ye i i first saw i was struck by the fact that he a created this process for himself long ago and he is also somebody who is you knows maintain it is been the same marriage for extremely long time is he is extremely happy in that his family a it seem when the feel it seems to thrive and all domains of life and ism certain that he struggles in some domain of life because everybody does but am it sound to me a very unusual practice but it seems to kind of relate to this that he has this thing he love's doing playing music and performing in particular and he is just you point of one per cent at doing that am burthen just bring himself back down to earth because much of life in i pushy family life is dealing with the the shuts in the inconvenience of everyday life yes it is at it actually sends what his doing as he is resetting his frame of reference to say if yet i go right home then the contrasts between this high obtain experience on having ism an sort of muddling through every day life i is going to be extreme if i do something really small then ism family time is going to seem a lot bigger ye i realize ism taking a bit of a leap from your study on intrinsic motivation in and low performance in another domains but to me cleaning up clean a toilet is it is it is a it is boring for all the wrong reasons oh as he say not you out to ben each no and and listen i mean e had to do it for living i would your it and i would try and do as well as possible n a a but a right well i found that say to be particularly interesting because i think that these days we a we glorify high performance you even cop performance a something we can talk about and we forget that a yes oftentimes people who are ultra high performers can afford to pay other people to do all the other stuff u i have to say in knowing some ultra high performers and in knowing some people in the a billionaire bracket the others a high incidents of a mental health issues frankly and lack of satisfaction with life that maybe even comes from not a having to do anything besides the things that you find most intrinsically rewarding a we all think that of i if i could i spend all day doing the things that i find most intrinsically rewarding but maybe there is something about this pushpole we know the brain at works and pushpole with almost everything that having some experiences each day that are con ah this a thing again do you think that heightens our level of satisfaction for the things we really enjoy i would be surprised if it did not i think and contrast effects are very powerful and we know an whether is half a century of research on happiness suggesting that the comparisons we make are what matter i yen i think i think him er e been probably put it best when he said happiness is reality in essexpectations and if you only have enjoyable experiences your expectations are rising into perpetuity id si it does not matter how good your reality is you wanted it to be better and better i think one of things that mundane experiences a manage to do for us or maybe better way to say it is ache wanted o benefits of montane experiences they keep our expectations on the ground and allow us to be pleasantly surprised by young a task that was more interesting than we expected even though we did not love it what you thoughts on a what i call momentum which is when i have a an experience i pertly we record a pod cast and really excited to get out in the world or if i have some experience that ism left very excited by at the end that oftentimes the energy again a sassed with this concept of neural energy the the energy that i glean from that experience seems to have carry over into other things you can be much more excited is go across the street and get a cup of coffee feels a bigger thing than abnormally would a and i would think that one could con o ride the wake of a of a prior accomplishment even a small accomplishment each day and make the tiding up or doing things that one would one fly find more boring less boring is that true the way your describing contrast effects makes i see that is more of a cliff that thing was great and now this thing but i also had to ride high on ism something to happen two three days ago made even two three months ago if feeling good equates to feeling good were feeling good i excentsuates the the banjo this is the attention between contrast and spell over and you can see both under different conditions i think where this is and this is a bran new sort of i don't anybody's reconcile those two two perspectives yet but my hunch from having worked on the contrast part of it is we found that it was only extreme interest motivation that had the performance cost on other tasks if you are if you are enjoying something i if you it that will give you a life for other tasks i but it is it is where this is the best thing you have ever done and now other things saccomparkison i that is where we start to see runingto a problem i also wonder i if there is a domain switching a fact here i i think your you are alluding to this i i red some research that just came out this year showing that ism one of the benefits when the surprising benefits of morning workouts is you actually have more confidence in y up job i because you get that small wind i i accomplish something this morning and that gives you a sense of efficacy that you can carry over into your nohow yous to start your workday i not to suggest it ever once hold work half in the mornings the ism with you i think everybody should both work and work out at a time that works for them but i think i i think there is something to be said for i something went really well in one realm in my life and that lose my belief in my capability to tackle challenges in a different realm what about in the opposite direction a you were a competitive diver ism i have to presume that there were days when you had lousy dies i must have been that that one day every at and then you you leave you you you shower up dry off head ted into the rest of your day and how do we shipment away from the you n negative thought spirals something went really poorly and now you are often to the domain of life where you can you how to do the things it required to do but maybe there is some challenge in some learning involved how do we cut moats between negative experiences i think i mean the ted last strategies ideal become a gold fish ten second memory think you do not even you in recall the practice you had earlier to day i think that i do not anybody who can do that consistently and i think the more disappointing the experiences the more you tend to to dwell on it i think i when when you talk about segmenting negative experiences i think the probably the research that have liked best on this and as when only may shut capture this clearly ism i busily reception emotion regulation says there there two strategies that tend to be effective one is distraction the others referring i distraction is find something else that will consume your attention i that is unrelated to the thing that you just bored at and the hope is that that that fades into the background refrain is lot of what you were talking about few minutes ago which is out let me foxes not on the level of my performance but this slope i my diving coacher best has a really great set of questions that he he asks and you know i i i remember i mud you had finish practice this is a terrible day i just feel are ism worthless as a diver and now diving was a big part of my identity man to let my team down now an a bad teammate to my coach is wasting my his time and now i he could have been you ow training somebody much better why am i doing this an arc would ask did you make yourself better today and even if was a bad practice there is something that improved yes of and sometimes the answer feels no and then he would ask did you make someone else better to day ye i gave a little tip to a teammate i i i made a joke that that made everybody laugh and as i great then it was in e bad day and i i think this is this is an example of what good refrain looks ism to say coquet the goal was not to be great it was to be better the goal was not necessarily just to make myself betters also to make other people better i and i think those are the kinds of questions that seems to sag meant pretty well well that feed back beat i think we all get stuff in those thoughts spirals and ma can not to demonize smart phones because they are wonderful tools but i have to remember the time ism forty eight years old a as of to morrow and i have to remember a time in which i negative stuff was probably happening in the background but i did not hear about it because no one was testing it to me it'd find out at the end of the day when i still had time to do other things in the meantime i ah that said i would also get negative experiences early in the day and then carry them throughout the entire day when nowadays you can get a positive ten messages as oke was not bad ah or something that but i i do think as s probably becoming apparent about these channels of communication are or either boons or disruptions to our a positive psychology is clear that were just liking bombarded all the time um just as a as a practical question oh what is your relationship to your phone do you set boundaries around your phone use were the types of communications and activities at you engage on your phone i do o everyman i i think everyone i now has not to do this i also have it to do not list and on my to doubt list in clouds i do not scroll on social me dead and i do not pick up my pound i past nine am and there is those two habits are enormously helpful particularly the not scrolling i pick up my phone when i have something to post or when i want a see what the comments are and then see if there is something interesting to learn or or somebody that i want respond to and that that that becomes a really healthy boundary because i do not gets docking one of these habit holes where all of a sudden two hours of cops hand i feel i feel like can wasted m time where do you post or keep your to do in your todontlist do you keep them on your phone now it is a word document on my computer see your still at the computer screen quite beach ya i feel that is where most of y good thinking an writing happens i carry small note book around with me now and write things down i just curious i what it is ye well one of those ye yeah i not to take notes of my phone ever wrist it it can be problematic for me i especially with with voice recognition now because you it is hard to go back to that in a systematic way for me but of a big believer in these these things that but for those listening and out watch ism holding up a pen s i pencils work to you and probably trend some of the deserts also showing that you have a better memory for information when you take notes by hand than my keyboard i did not know that but ism very very gratified to h ear that si the and i suppose if you do not have a pen and you do not have a pencil handy then you now blood always work just kitting ism just do not do not do not do not make yourself for anyone else lied just to get an idea down but it is amazing how sometimes we will have ideas while running walking showering out and about and then later trying recall those ideas and all rise them down they are gone the great jo strummed from the clash talked about the critical importance of carrying round a small note book such as you did because he said that the ideas fall down rain and if you catch them there there but if you miss them they truly will not be there later and that is there something kind of ere about that why would not we be able to remember these potential gems of ideas right e the the quivering up of the mind we had a guest on the podcast for a series doctor palconti a psychiatrist and he talked extensively about the unconscious mind i mention the sol earlier but a one of things that really stuck with me as he said you know everyone thinks that the prefrontal quartets and the frontal quartet is the supercomputer of the human brain sets contact planning stray switching et camera et camera certainly i it is valuable real estate to our intellect and a all our abilities but he said the the real supercomputer is the unconscious mind however that unconscious mind that lives below the surface of our awareness is also what drives a lot of our unconscious defenses are called blind spots projection projective identification in these have these can be both good or bad they can serve us well or or poorly abandon and forth but implied in this notion of the unconscious and blind spots is that we cannot become aware of things unless we either do dedicated work to become aware of them or even better would be dedicated work where we are asking other people to say hey listen you have a blind spot and it is blank bland combined tell us em about the roll of blind spots maven some positive aspects of having blind spots but more importantly what we can do to fill in those blind spots and and i perhaps also explain how how they can limit us and oven examples that i from the research were people overcoming their blind spots as ben benefited them tat would be amazement ya we there is a lot there lame better me tarp it saying i think a lot of people think about blind spots and terms of hurisix and basis you think about confirmation bias you think aba the the classic comment tversky work i that entered up wan ain't tannin know about prize on i yo we that the way in which i we are intuitive judgments ism often get anchored in the way we have done things before ism or we focus on the information that stallion unavailable to us an overlook less obvious information have come to think that that the mother of all biases is i what i what i think of is that ism not bias bias it is it secondly called the gasoline spot and family drowning and colleagues research but the idea is that i think ism more objective than other people and you may have your you may have plans in you are thinking drew but me like i i see things clearly and rationally and i think that this is it is a really dangerous data bias because the moment you believe you are not bias you are incapable of seeing any of your basis ism in some of the research on the baseline spot you see that i that people who have i who score high in cognivabilitys as me his are actually more likely to fall victim to that ism not biases because they have been reinforced for a lifetime that they are really smart and they are good to thinking goodness this explain some i we do not talk about curry events on this packs much by this explain some turn events at people that we are told their entire cheers that they are perfect or near perfect and i i we circumstances eventually came to you slam them hard into the concrete on that one or or in some cases it has not happened yet but we we watch them hurtling toward earth ism i i worry a lot about that i think the beginning of of seeing any blindspot is recognizing tat we all at blind spots part of being human i i think that the brighter side of that is that we are not just blind to weaknesses were also blind to our strengths i jane button and aura organ robots and colleagues it'd some research on the reflected best self portraits one o my favorite exercises to do in the classroom but also to do in work places sometimes even people n u doing it with their kids at home the ideas that you do have strength that you are not that aware of they may be things that come naturally to you that you do not eve realize are hard for other people they may be things that are struggles for you and you you think it is hoard to do and there fore in that at it but other people wat you do it and realize your actually quite good at it the you need other people to hold up a mirror to see what eyes invisible strengths are the way the reflect to best self exercise works is your asked to contact tend to twenty people who know you well in different walks of life might family member couple friends colleagues and than you ask them to tell a story about a time when you were at your best and you collect these stories it is it is the most exciting week of male you will ever get twenty not let me tell you how great you are but whats see this goes back to our discussion of back earlier is there really specific about a moment when you're at your best and then your job is to collect all the stories and do the pattern recognition exercise and ask what of the common themes that have seen through these stories and it is a it is a really powerful and vivid way of of getting a sense of what are those strengths and i yet it is not surprising that in some of the research when people go through this process they end up with much more clarity not only about what they are what they are good at and were their potential like but also how do i what of those situations haven't common where i was able to use my strengths and how do i get myself in those situations more often how do i create those situations more often i it'll it'll give your personal example on this i i got a bunch of feed back that i was good at helping other people see their strengths and i thought o quiet i do not feeling have enough opportunities to use that strength in my daily life what am it going to do about there and handed up flipping the exercise of set out and picked a hundred people who ism really matter to me and i wrote a stories to each of them about a time when they were at their be and there isn't it there is no reason i cannot i cannot make this part of my day i it is probably it was twas probably one of the best weeks in my life i it was better than getting the stories was was giving them and i got these notes back from people saying i i did not realize i do not remember that thing that happened i but i think for me was an example of saying o k ism know have have always enjoyed ism trying to bring out the best in others i do not feel at the time i was a i was a first year doctoral student i do not feel i had anything to contribute to others try t ism trying to learn how to you in understand this field and do a worth while study and write a paper ism not teaching yet i have no value to add and getting this feet back oh you are somebody who helps other people see their potential right let me let me take some people that i oi already recognize ism really amazing things in and let me just tell them that and i took me about a week to write the the hundred smells and ism i cannot think of a a week have spent better interesting a you flipped the process on its head a bit were a lot and that and it up being the reward do you think you learned anything about given that it was early in your academic career do you think you ism learn anything about your i particular talent or desire to to do what you do now i mean it much of what you described as seems to mapped welt what you do now ism yet you could be i if you were to choose were chosen a just not just but a laboratory scientist doing experiments om y are clearly still doing that at t but with a tremendous productivity but you have also decide to tell the world about the information that you are gathering and the work of a lot of other people's while i get up feel i can ship here because we both do this ism much more much more interesting aside other people's work the talk about what you already know it is indeed ism and it is fun to be able to to were one's understanding of the process and to what li what are other people doing and know how hard it is to do really good experiments and ism the able to spot really good experiments but yet did you learn in that early ism stage of your career that i think i want to do this later because what you do now is it maps pretty well onto what you just described i i do not think it was i i was not crystallized at the time but i was restfully one of those seeds that was planted that they must have grown because i i remember write after i got tender i wonderful colligating asked if i would write a book with him i was flattered and i went into to talk to my undergrad research lab later that day and i you i mentioned off hand and yet got this invite him an wite this book and they freaked out no you can not write somebody ease's book you have to write about your ideas first if you are on o write a book write your own book and i i i was very resistant because i love other people's ideas no i w i i feel what i do best ism i think it was i s buyer who wrote about the scholarship of discovery verses the scholarship of integration and i never felt i was a eureka blindingly original insight person i felt what i was good at was synthesizing ideas ism and kind of taking a bunch of i be no pieces of cloth and and sewing them into a quilt and allowing people to see the big picture in a way they had not before an i felt i could do that with a colleague who was already a successful author am i soon spastically held me hostage said you have been doing this research for for over a debate now and you have a responsibility to share that outside your classes and it reminded me of of that experience of saying o cave there is something i see and other people i want to share it with them a and maybe i could do that on a broader scale yet i think there was there were definitely dots that connected there when i was a a master soon at berley there was a i who now moved a michigan state mark breed love who i hope to host on the podcast actually as really interest does really interesting work on the billy of sexual differentiation and am i think that is an invite if your lest e i ah and he a it is indeed and he said to me he said review articles provided they are written by people who a are credentialed an a given field are sited at a hundred acts any one particular paper now at the time i was not interested in a impact factors in fact have never paid any attention in pact factors they have their importance varies an in different countries and am in the quass the the put place som roll a more in rope but i i could care less about in pact factor frankly am because was those metrics are what it is going to carry you through the difficulty of designing and carrying out a hard experiment you have to be intrinsically and curious about the answer right this and i know this but a but he basely said a what a something as really supports your point a which is that ultimately the ability o synthesized information is can feel a really good and he start ting about that that the feeling that he got from doing that he is also a tremendous spend scientists as well in any event am ism glad that you flipped that exercise on its head because now the world gets to benefit from you doing that for us all the time because i i realize now that much of what you do is to help a people identify in race their blind spots by am and i love your social media channels am and i noted on instrgram and i do scroll but but i scroll through and to your our channel to know you will put up in short form content that that really high lights the see importance of people embarking on strategies that they would not reflectively take that i see that over and over again it is we think that the best leaders do blank but actually the research was they do exactly the opposite and and you have a a vast am it of those long those lines know what are some of the most common blind spots that you observe and that people could benefit from understanding and and doing contrary action around as it relates to let us a interpersonal relations in the work place or at home and and d maybe we could see this with a finding that you have also written about which is that a men people who have an exert a lot of proficiency and even control in their professional life will sometimes bring that to their relationship life and that does not work it the idea that being in charge in being confident as a great is a great set of attributes am but it can really fail us in other domains i can we weave that in with blind spots he we can i think that a one of thinks i i found of the passer years is that and this is inspired by a a peltatlock framework i a lot of a spend a lot of our time thinking preachers prosecutors or politicians preachers prosecutors politicians yes you think bethels is as three mental modes that even if you never worked in any of these careers you you will watch your thinking colored by at least one of them more often than you would in preacher mode your basically proselytizing your own views and you a enter your in some in sob suggestions i think of you as a highly effective professional debunker of preachers of a certain kinds of snake oil when it comes to health a and and biology am sometimes you take that too far and people might accuse you of being a prosecutor where your attacking other people's use man an the third mode politician moths is basically him bother to listen to people unless they treaty agree with your views what what i think i is interesting as these these modes of thinking are adaptive for in in certain rolls ism preachers make great sales people they are often visionary leaders i prosecutors are often highly effective scientists and we excel it criticizing other people's work and finding what is wrong with it i politicians are great at currying favor they do a lot lobbying they win approval the problem is that all of these modes stop you from questioning your own assumptions of beliefs ism my i it'll take my biggest vice as prosecutor mode have been called a logic bully my wife had to explain to me that was not a compliment only in the e i know i know you have experiences too if i i i feel confident that their strong evidence that somebody is wrong i believe it is my moral responsibility to correct them and that never goes well amazing i will not reflect on my own es a jo say yes an yes a write write that the logic word ninja mode is one that i think we are trained in as economics we aren't that and or if your lawyer or or many other professions as well and i think it holds value and it can be very active in certain domains but ism less effective another damn yes and i think part of the problem is when i up actually wether you are preaching prosecuting our political assume your politicking you look you are not open because you have already in all cases you think you are right an other people are wrong and that makes it really hard for other people to to reason with you to disagree thoughtfully with you my favorite alternative and and this is at the heart of what you do for a living i and for fun is thinking a scientist and when i saythinking a scientists i do not mean the union to buy a microscope or invest in a telescope what i mean is s as you model tactically a good scientists has the humility to know what they do not know and the curiosity to constantly see cat you knowledge there's been multiple experiments showing that when people are taught to think scientists their judgment improves and to their decisions and i think a lot of that stems from when when you go into scientists mode you realize that all of your opinions are just hypotheses waiting be tested all of your decisions are experiments and it's not trying to prove that ism right ism trying to find out if i might be wrong and then if i find out i am wrong is easier to pivot and instead of being really invested in being right i can try to get it right and i think in some ways that is the that is the met message that ism trying to communicate to people with my work is assumptions are meant to be pressure tested they are meant to be questioned and challenge and if you are not open to rethinking your views then you basically turned thinking into a religion and i no about you but i prefer to his fuss i ism good data mas suppose to blind faith and i think that is been a huge part of your contribution in the last three or years to public discourse is i you have you have help people think more scientifically and talk more scientifically about their daily habits and behaviors than mi guess my my be question is how to we help people do that more often even in nomads where they do not have access to scientific knowledge and thy do not read journals persuelt the thanks for the kind words of fee back i think you might my rolls always to you identify whose coming the pocks for health tools and protocols and healthfully teach them some science an scientific thinking and for those that are coming to the pockets for science and scientific thinking helpfully they get some health tools and protocols also but ism these i fell in love with science for the exact reason that you are describing which is that i i lived i grew up in a family that was very divided politically along religious lines along essential every line what foods to eat what was healthy what was and and the only way i could reconcile i these very frankly polarize views was to i bark on the scientific method pose a hypothesis and then try and disprove one's hypothesis and some things get through the filter and it is a constant learning i should just ask when you teach people how to be a scientist in order to a trying to overcome some of their blind spots be better thinkers better meaning it serves themselves and the people round them better a is that teaching them what a hypothesis's that hath a hypothesis is not a question it is a sort of a your you wager on an idea with the understanding that you very well could be wrong and then you try and disprove that idea is that that sort of the crop of of what a in these experiments is am you are describing as teaching people how to be scientists yet if they just do that then they will they are going to benefit i think that is that is of the very heart of the lands is a out end just double click on the idea of disapproving your hypothesis other people live in a land of confirmation by us whether they are basically just looking for support for their are existing beliefs that is right their click forging we all do this by the way ism not criticizing here we all will have an idea and then we will click for age on line to support the idea that we disagree with them they diddisagree with us ah here somebody agree with and that agrees with me i think and do you think this as roots in our in the nor circuit underpinnings of a am just wanting to have a filiation that a filiation feels good yen having people that are us knowing that we are protected in that yet i think that is a big part of it think one of the reasons that we we in case ourselves an echo chambers and a hid an filter bubbles is there is there is a strong evolutionary pressure to avoid social exclusion and you know is not it is not just that you name being drawn to a filiation it is also a i i really want ism afraid a being excommunicated from my group and if i challenge the orthodoxy of the community that i belong to i might be an outcast i do not think i do not think every day people think through that logic but i thinkers i there is a deep seated viserough tendency to avoid that and i think the when we think about teaching people to see their blind spots more clearly ism a lot of that is is recognizing it is hard to do that on your own i because by definition your blind spots are invisible to you and this is why other people's an put is important and i think i i know this makes a lot of people in comfortable but i think everybody on social media should follow people thatched disagree with but not just for the sake of it you want people who reach different conclusions from you but where you respect the integrity of their thought process those the people who really stretch er thinking and i think that what we are train to do i that is what i was train it is a social science social scientists is to listen to the ideas that made me think hard not just the ones that made me feel good and to surround myself with people who challenge my thought process not just the one who validated my conclusions i think you know lot people here that message no but i soft wan to let that that awful perspective in the my world i no you want to be more nonce in saying who are the people where before i knew what their answer was i would be impressed with the depth and the thoroughness of their reflection and their analysis i should be following those people and learning from them regardless of the the hypothesis that they generate and the results that they share ism glad that you mention the am importance of following people the disagree with i think one thing that we have to hi and am hoping will may be even emerge from this conversation is that follows are not indorsements and this is our sheer real problem in there are academics who have lost their jobs not surely for following certain accounts but for m commenting on certain common threads may be en alike as it is a slightly different category because it is as the name suggest it is alike as that it sounds and it is thought of as a vote of approval of what is there ye but when one's option is are just a heart a a follow or no heart no follow now i was a big van of the thumbs up thumbs down i don the thumbs up thumbs down because at least you have the that you have an option to to to dessert i without getting into in on a comment battles and things that sort but i listen i have had people ask me why do you follow and because follows are also sing as a sign of support because ire adding adding followers and presume my in the algorithm raising prominence to a channel yet ism right they are with you i follow lots of accounts of people who i fundamentally disagree with but ism trying to learn and ism also trying to understand what what they are capture point are what why people find them intriguing yes an way ism ism a learner ism a forger you ism in the same boat and every lot's a while i think it it is dunning to me i soft now if you have ever looked at your your insigram statistics i but some i somebody i i call you might actually showed me did i did not realize you could look at the effect of each post in follows and follows i did not realize a and that i think it my typical ratio might be two or three to one foremost you gaining two or three to fought what two or three follows t every one that i lose the idea that i could post anything that would cause some one to follow me if i said something interesting enough that you thought i was worth following how could how could one post change your mind about that i think you are two focused on what i think and maybe not paying attention to how i think i was my my first reaction to that and my second is my second thought was well maybe maybe what is happening here is people show up and they do not realize the foundation of evidence behind the total body of work and one post you have strikes them wrong and they think this person is not credible or they think that this person has i lost sight of of what w rigorous science is i wonder if you you hade that experience to of i i think i i make the mistake of taking for granted that anybody who followed me knows that if i poset something i think it is worth thinking about and it is it is ban carefully studied and i did not have a i didn't have a dog in the fight i read this research and said this cleared the bar not only of an actatove journal but i read the methods and i found them sound enough that we tough to be discussing this idea have you had that experience to i certainly have and i should say that i was weaned in an academic culture three separate mentors very different styles all of whom we are excellent mentors but all of whom taught me that there are phenomenal papers where the every bit of information in the paper and indeed how it is written from start to finish is just water tight and incredible and there are other papers that are less water tight but occasionally there will be papers where one data point in a figure is intriguing enough to consider following that can trail in your own work even if the rest of the paper is in eh i met one data point now that does not mean taking one day to point in casting it out to millings of people on sulciamedis an actionable item is is is valid that is certainly not when ism dong but what i do realize and and am realizing again now for what you just said is that indeed people do not know the context her which what filters are we working with before we bring things forward and i think that um my belief is that if it is grounded firmly in the scientific method that that is the best starting place re time ut that earlier and i also understand the scientists differ tremendously and how they look at even the same data in the same paper there is no governing body that says o a this paper means blank the authors have their interpretation the students have their interpretation in fact the course i use to o teach t undergraduates which grew into a very large course we would learn to ask four questions what is the question that the authors were asking sometimes the sub question what methods do they use what did they find ad then what did they conclude and does it relate back to the original question and that simple breaking out of four questions of says this suntuarly what i do for all studies am but have my way of doing it and hoping to differ from the way that other people do it a social media a i think what is interesting is that i thin there is always going t be a corps following of of a given person your your fallers that they are going to trust your not soy cross the board wither there is a general acceptance of ideas coming through i think that on social media it is hard to strike a balance between setting the whole context and the action will take ways i get criticized a lot for not being concise enough and i agree but a but i also get no one decide putting things at a taking things out of contact yes a that is a tight replies a tight wrote walk and it is always going to be a tight wrote walk and omonagest keep going and i know you will too am and and listen i there is the sum kids out there surely not can be and that the are going to take our jobs eventually and and we will find a way do it much better who knows through a i i e re at a i be real bots am if you this is an appropriate place to ask about something else in e we are talking about for perception of a of others and in gleaning information overcoming blind spots is something you have written about some years ago now i guys would be almost he ears go now am about authenticity the word authenticity is is such a in field it such a mind feel i was going to say such it has such a gravitate positive gravitational pull oh there really authentic i suppose to what is the opobsa authentic phatic right but i think we could all learn to draw some lines between authenticity and overhearing right how do we gauge authenticity and we can refer people to that article you wrote some years ago i think a you may have written it differently where tod be to written today you talking an had article about somebody who essentially decided to tell everyone that he worked with all the things that he was interested in am a doing with them relating to them and it did not serve him well yes that is author o them right and then there is this this notion of benevolent deception in order to preserve relationship and importantly it brought about a word that we do not hear about very often but that i i rather which is etiquette there is sopor social media by the way i apply classroom rules it'll tolerate any common in the comment section but not the sort of comment that i would not tolerate in a classroom you start insulting other began insult me but if you want to insult other people ism not can ta tolerate that that is where dragline classroom rules there is an etiquette and i think that etiquette is important how do we balance authenticity with etiquette and also with preserving ones a a one's public life or private or private life i authenticity at home seems important you to be your complete self at home except when you want a physically it your sister or brother because they your ice cream that is not the right kind of authenticity now now it is not i think well the i think it such a which and complicated topic i think for the first thing is i i do not want people to be disingenuous ever but i have a real problem with people saying as an excuse for disrespectful behavior well i was just being myself i think avid safer was yes but yourself is an vassal go i think i think what people forget is that we have we all of multiple selves you you yet m you you have known this your whole career i we all have multiple identities we also can think about yourself as your thoughts your emotions i your values your personality with fact of yourself or you trying to be true to i would argue that authenticity without boundaries is careless authenticity without empathy is selfish and part of being authentic is carrying about other people's values that should be one of your values what that means concretely is i do not think we should worry about being authentic to what we are thinking and feeling in any given moment i think what we want to ask is what am about to do or say consistent with my principles and sometimes that means you will be false to your personality in order to be true to your values sometimes that means you will you will feel you are not honoring your thought are your emotion in the moment but you are doing that with a broader view toward who is the person that i want to be there as a cultural critic lineal trilling who wrote about the idea of sincerity is opposed to authenticity and i really this distinction he said when when you when you try to think about being authentic your trying to bring the inside out and to point entry that is not always appropriate or effective he sin sincerity is a little bit more about bringing the outside in pay attention to the person you claim to be and then try to become that person and that was a little bit of an armament forme i realize yo other there all these people who say well you should you should you should walk your talk and i think that is good advice i might even go a step further and say maybe you should only talk it if you are already walking maybe maybe that would help us avoid hypocrisy but i think that the fundamental message heres that we we aught we we all could be authentic to one part of ourselves and in authentic to another part and i think the most important part is to ask what do i stand for and if ism what am about to communicate is not consistent with that and maybe maybe i could self censor such created vice an do suppose a one has to wonder about the the role of a emotional states i think there career ending mistakes that people make in a moment ism especially on line nowadays and by the way this is not just for people who are already established in their career have heard stories and there seem to be more more of these in the news of of prince a unividios of things that people said some years earlier getting them ejected from college am a guest on likes freedman's podcast who works in the security's world said that one of the lessons that he teaches is kids as do not film themselves doing bad things but in and of course also not to do bad things but in general to just not film themselves doing anything because of his understanding of the risk of of doing that and we soft want to create a paranoia but am gosh i mean whoop are when you're fourteen is a very different person than who you are when you're twenty seven when you're fifty of a hope so o and am is i think it you no balancing authenticity across the last pan and were expecting young minds to do this and clearly older minds cannot do it either i mean not i this is a pretty well now case of a chair but major pay the major psychiatry department am we will not name the university but am basely lost his job for a single treat he just was not being thoughtful in fact he was being a really am mum to to other people and loss his job inland i think he pi do not know him am ut and it was obvious why he lost nothing h was debatable but am gosh think about somebody who is a chair of psychiatry which means their psychiatrist which means their train to think about thinking and there you go it is a making how common misses and i think what things is fascinate to me his i guys is is goes back to is main her time about a moment ago but i i think that when when we communicate we have access to the sum total of of of our thoughts and everything we ever ever said that we can remember and we forget that other people on they have a snap shot it one f the questions i i to ask is if this was the only post that somebody saw of mine would e be proud of it out it communicate who i am and who i aspire to be good the answer is now maybe i should pause before i put that out there that that is excellent advice if you were the only post your one and only representing you fantail that now that could be paralyzing if you are pridectonist you will never post be i think for somebody who is posting regularly i it is a good filter to just ask ism am i i being thoughtful enough good i will not had anything to that just a it'll just say good let us talk about potential i was in junior high school and i remember having a social studies teacher who a shejust would go on and on about potential she at special programmed after school you could can vale potential potential potential i and we hear about this we have untapped potential you hear we are only operating at forty per cent of our abilities you don't people say that i the implication is that we have reservoirs of potential that we are just not accessing because we are not doing the right things thinking the right things i i know you've now research this topic extensively give a new book on this topic i tell us about potential a do we all have huge reservoirs of potential that we are not accessing and of course i and everyone else once know how can we access those but maybe could also tell some of the myths around potential and an tell us about is about potential such at such a a sticky topic for all the right reasons think i i it is one of the things where you have had this experience ism sure many times where you start thinking and talking about a topic and you realize it is it is been your whole life but you did not see it until then i feel that way about potential i think that have been passionate about helping people achieve their potential as long as i can remember i think every every goal have ever set has not been about stretching my potential in one way or another ism or at least realizing it and whet have become struck by as have study this topic is we all have hid in potential but we do not know how to unlock it why do we often under estimate our own potential we judge ourselves by us by our starting abilities and this is more common for people with fix mine sets but even people with growth one sets i you try a new skill it does not go well and you think this is not for me ism not cut out for this ism and then it gets worse when other people also you are not just under estimating yourself your also being under et under estimated by others other people watch you and say ye you do not have the you are not a proud ism you are not a natural you do not have the talent that it takes and i think the big with there is that a to taken is the most important driver of how high people climb it is not motivation an opportunity matter more than to ability for growth motivation and opportunity ye i you know obviously you everybody starts at a different point imbue how close you come to your potential is much more about the character skills you cultivate ism to to improve an improving over time and then whether you are in a situation where youknow you you have access to the knowledge that you need and the tools you need to keep growing and yet concert example this for me is i when i when i start diving i was way too late i picked it up is ha tea nature a lot of the my divers in the world start by five goodness and actually in china theirs their handpicked by for body type and sent to aversion of diving boarding school where they non even teach kits how to swim i they tie rope around them that they can just pull them back after after they they hit the water in the decent will partner bye ti roper i think it is their waste they diving with a rope that when they get the water there not wasting any energy exactly you are just being dragged through the water and o that is a it is my understanding of it ism well but brill oi i they have to walk they a to climb ye because the munch other things happened that the the swimming apparently is very second there anyway ism i starred really late and i lacked most of the things that you would want as a diver ism i i could not touch my toes without penny monies my teammates called me frankinstine because i was stiff when i walked is lacking the flexibility i have no rhythm my coach brought a metronome to practice one day and i could not even keep the beat ah you know you think about diving as a sport of grace no and then i also could not jump and i could not twist either and like you are missing the exclusive power you do not have the the athleticism ism and i think if i had if had just looked at those abilities and no business being a diver and in fact no business being athlete it'd already been cut from the middle school baseball team three times i did not make the highschool socrateme those with two sports it'd poured a debate into that this is going nowhere ism epic just the most incredible coach i can ever imagine he said to me on the first say of practice he said ism yes you are missing all these things but i believe if you if you pour yourself into the sport that you can be a state finalist by the time you finish high school and he saw more potential in me than i saw in myself and that just lit a fire under me and ism what that translated into is a lot of the behaviors that that you and i both studied i setting specific difficult tools for i want to learn these dives that seem out to reach ism for i want increase my score over the next three meats by ten points ism for i want o learn how to all my limitations not withstanding one thing that i can master t have to control over is how clean i going the water i can get a reentry that there is no splash and that is the most important part of a dive and one of the greatest compliments efercot as a diver was i came out of a meat in am as couple yours and i think is may be a junior in high school and i one o the judges turned to epic and said all he can do is rip and epic said yes it is also it is almost saying all he can do as win ye know this it was a great backhanded compliment but epic was listen he made the dive it has a degree of difficulty may be he did not jump as high as he wanted maybe his tiptoe his took was not as tight as he wanted i but at the end of the day that dive disappeared straight up and down into the water you cannot not give that a seven and tat don't observing me really well and think that the broader lesson here for me was epic said to me ism actually last year i i never thought about this he said i i never got close to even qualifying for a lipid trials i i did not have the talent to to be that guy but got way better than i ever expected and i epic said to me he said looking back i he said you got further with less talent than every any diver of evercoached and that was meaningful to me an when it reminded me was i my priest accomplishments were not in the areas where i started out with the most talent they were in the areas where i had overcome the most obstacles and i think that to me is ism really wet drives people around potential is to say i it is not performance that is mote of eating it is a sense of progress i love that story and i and i could not agree more man i think or knows my favorite topic in sciences the course i performed at least after my freshmen were which was abysmal am least well in the face when i was doing well i ma class with it is neral development i now teach neral deellai wat neral development i bad were you at it at fir i o get well i have to put in contact my high school and freshen your college were were abysmal i i basely no place being there i can only think my school girl friend for a being wonderful that i followed her off to college and ended up there am left after my fresh emir came back and then at that point it was a stop function i worked out of fear and excitement and love of the material am i was a strait a student thereafter but in my senior senioryor souse me i took a course in neral development which was extremely challenging a and i got a bee plus and that bee plus still gets me but it is a topic that i love the most it is what i did my a graduate hesitance what i reached a at standard among other topics and a anilest to thing now i have against humilitiaside considerable mastery over over the the material but it is because i did not do as well as i would have liked and i applied myself much and i think that it just did not come naturally to me and then you eventually overtime you you cannot get it we you get you get it a it is it but it is still my favorite topic because it was that friction point right it is the yachting through and there is something i do not know it is just intrinsically satisfying to me i used to watch my bull dog mastiff costello chewing on a bone or when he was on a brick cause he had a kind of a homer siphon brain about his object choice to chew on and wit and he just look he was in just total bliss it was this effort am combined with some intrinsic pleasure of the process and i think that when one is ratcheting through something that is hard it feels good that is almost better than the outcome it it it is better than the outcome i think it is and let's it is fascinated because this is why ism always bothered by people saying play to your strengths because if you do that you will gravitate toward the things that come naturally to you and your going to miss out on very often that the skill that was hard for you to learn to your point is one the you end up with greater natural over because you had to put in the extra effort and you end up deriving more more satisfaction i the fact that you might this was really tough and i figured it out ism implicit in your story i and may be partially explicit an in some parts i when i was when is l get the character scales that help people realize their potential ism and really fuel unexpected growth ism i indent a finding three that i i think i under disgust and ism an well supported by science ism i think that at basically if you want to reach your potential or ism it she more than you thnkyou are capable of we are looking at becoming a creature of discomfort ism and embracing things that are unpleasant or awkward for you they will be the first thing the second is ism is being a sponge and soaking up knew information and also filling her fils i filtering out what might not be useful and then the third is i is being an imperfections which is knowing when to aim for excellence and when to settle for good and i i hear all of those themes in your story i i you knot that was obvfully obviously uncomfortable youyou got to be plussedyou do not want to do any more nor development too it was it was frustrating and exciting to me at the same time and then i went everything i did in the five or seven years that followed was all about learning more about this topic because ai dit was not about performing well or proving myself i just i i loved the material much more because of how challenging it was and ism grateful to you ben reeves professor you see sand barber incredible her anatomist and teacher of neral development and an laboratory scientists because i i think had i gotten in an a i do not know that i would have fallen in loved with it in the same way is not that weird you would not have had to work at it to discover what was fun about it i imagine n absolutely and it still one of my favorite topics to teach i and learn about you mentioned discomfort being a sponge slash filter if i got that right and an imperfections i yet tell me more about the imperfections piece because i feel i have had students in my lab and have known people another domains life that there there absolute paranoid about shipping something out for you world to see it and of course no one wants to put stuff out into the world that is not right in got for by could be wrong but i or that is going to embarrass us you can understand why people are perfectionists but i never really understood the the the extreme perfectionist hate ever do anything and an never thy happy people cause i can toms no i was to homes our and i think as the world's latest leading psychologist studying perfectionism and if you look at his medanalysies a perfectionism is a recipe for burn out and depression and anxiety because you are constantly comparing yourself to an ideal that is on achievable i perfection is i are not they do get better grades in school slightly but they do not do any better at work then there appears because i think in school you have a predictable outcome you have a general sense of what is to be on a test and if you study hard enough you can come closer to the plus whereas at work performances much more nebulas and it happens to perfectionists a lot of times is they end up ism optimizing the things that are predictable and controllable and man sort of missing the forests in the trees and i think that that the antidotes i as far as i know really have to to do with calibration you knight i talked earlier about i how i to ask for zero to ten to find out ism i am the balparker not well will not by biggest liabilities as a diver was i was never satisfied with my score and one day air said to me you you hear lymph judges talk about our commentators talk about the perfect ten that is a misnomer if you look the diving rule book a tennis for excellence not for perfection there is no such thing as a flawlesstive i can look at dives the have gotten straight tens and point out nineteen things that were wrong with them but they were excellent and then we had to define the standards of excellence would i have as a recovering perfectionists somebody who just beep myself up constantly fact i got ism the did paper play a words on my swimwear and one year i was given the if only a word ad there is a look fortune o me and as as if only it'd pointed my left pinkie i would have got an eight and a half instead of at eight and this the story my my diving career and i did not want to you that person any more and one o things have learned to do is to when i start anything ism yet if i sit down to write a book ism aiming for a nine and the reason for that is ism in a poor couple years of had my work life into this topic ism hopefully a lot of people are going read it and i want to make sure it is surely the best work i can produce shall media post ism o cat with a seven if ism always shooting for a nine ism not in a post very often because you are non your sealing for nine is your threshold for nine is exceedingly i ye and i wanted to keep getting higher for times my idea of a nine to day is much more challenging than it was ten years ago and i think this is this is what people probably do not do enough ism especially if your in extreme perfection is is they do not realize o q ism but me let me forgot how important his task is and then for this task a six is sufficient that then i can pour my energy into a pulling the the seven and a half toward a nine where it really matters ism and inevitably if you do not do that what you will do is you will get a bunch of nines ism things that are completely trivial i went to a high school where we had a couple could get u perfect on the essay the they would have big the center full the list of all the early admissions to all the fancy ideal schools or defiling was not on that list i soft even know if i i only cops anywhere o near that list i probably not i and some of them have gone on to have terrific lives and seem pretty happy and i know a number of them an in contact with them and i i think for some of them that performed exceedingly well on standardize testily on i i hear a bit more dismay in their in their current life not all but it is there i have to imagine their data on sir early high performance being a seed for challie lunges later on obviously y do not want the the opposite the sort of what i guess they refer to now a common do not complete failure to launch you do not people not meeting that the milstorns toward being ism self sufficient adults but ism you wat wonder some of the dangers of success when thinking about realizing one's larger potential oh that is such an interesting question ism i think yet i think they did on this go both ways some early success is i it is a motive actor it builds the kind of momentum you were talking about earlier i you w think there is a gullsetting researchers lock and make them have talked about a the high per romance cycle where you hittagoal and than that builds your confidence and then you set a more ambitious ghoul and then you reach it n there is this upward spiral over a time but there is also a mountain of evidence that achieving your goals can make you complacent and there is a i sometimes is called the fat cats centrum where y recept up resting on your laurels and then there are also competency traps where you get good at something and then you keep doing it the way you have always done it and you do not realize the world is changed around you i ism allergic to the idea of best practices the moment you call a practice best you have created an illusion that you are not and the moment think about a removed lot a company has had really you have what they thought were a fact of models for collaboration and all of a sudden their best practices are not feasible because everybody's working remotely and they've got ta throw that out the window and look for better practices for an evolved world i think ism those the things i worry about most with early success i i think that one o things i would love to see more people to when it comes to reaching potential is i is to figure out what is my failure butt look i i thing my experience on this ism you started i wrote i wrote a first book ism gave its head talk and pretty soon out i was spending eighty per cent of my time saying things i ready knew and i was getting typecast ism not learning growing but ism also not i do not feel contributing new knowledge to the world what am i gent to do about that and twenty eighteen rolls i you now it this cumin a start a podcast and that will be my you know my learning mechanism and any now if his can work i did not know how the medium would work for me i did not know people we gin want a listen ton my voice i certainly do not ism maybe organ freeman likes the sound of his own voice obis i listen your podcast i i all so n joy listen yours but you would i think everybody hates the sound of their voice i just i just was not sure for a lot of reasons whether it was going to work ism and then i thought about it and i realize well all of the the pivotal moments in my career have come from taking a risk and i thought that i needed to build the confidence in order to do it and as reflecting on gullsetting researches as one does realize the confidence is going to come through doing it and let me try it and i guys what i took away was if i do not if i never fail it means ism not challenging myself ism not embracing discomfort ism ism not being enough of an imperfections ism i said i actually set o goal that i would start at least one project every year that did not succeed and let us be clear ism not aiming for failure what ism doing is is creating an acceptable zone of failure to know that that is gonna mod of ate in mistaking and some experimentation and hopefully some growth and i know it is hard for a lot o people to do this in their lives specially if you have a as superdemanding boss ism but anywhere we are all better off from a a growth in potential standpoint if we have got if you if you succeed on ninety per renting your projects that should be a hugely successful year if you succeed on a hundred per cent i think you are aiming too low what are some of the projects that you ere gulnelly swimming in the back your in n that would be fun but i if you are willing to share a ye that for you still strike a little bit of a but anxiety cord o no e you a i o o you musician not at o again again at a are you thinking about a becoming musician or exploring playing music i what how the reason i ask at that way is am how far into your discomfort son do you reach in order to a in order to challenge yourself s because i think that whatever one needs out thresholds a there are lot of things that i wish i could play o musical instrument frankly but ism ism not that mote of aid to do it most because i enjoy hearing other people play music much that ism perfectly happy ism stated there is also enough good music out there you'll have to crate the there is baffling along a great music ism i think there is tea there is a micron o mack reversion at this in the micro side ism then past year i it'd bet do this work pod casts for five years we i was you have taken the corps of my organic say seal psychology work and trying to take on a topic and and make it interesting and useful to people and then realizing i was feeling constrained just ta focus on work and as a psychologist there's lots of other things when to take on as we expanded into ism the second show rethinking and i have some experiments ism tempted to try but have been really hesitate do them ism do you watch wrestling growing up ever professional rusty a i did watch a little bit of it and then for whatever reason in the last year a my good friend rick rebel who he is not obsessed but he is a real devote he's a fan of professional wrestling he had me watch som m but an even a w he was explaining that is easily physical drama he is explaining why it is intriguing to him and informative to him and then a ism a big oh fan of a a certain john er amusing large frederics and from rancid is is a huge wrestling fancy or now got until people that have come into contact with her telling me all the tough about wrestling wrestling seems to be cropping up more and more i i do not know the e first thing about wrestling i think i caught it a few time you head eye it was is hall cousin in a few others pass across or man yet ye but the the think that i remember was loving the tactic matches where ye somebody would get overpowered and the they pull in somebody to help i be interesting if there was a podcast where you take issues that people fundamentally disagree on and you started to bake and then somebody can tag in if they want a challenge an argument and instead of constant concentrating on the particular guess you have you basically have a problem you are trying to you hae to get to the roots of and you've you have all these people jump in and and hopefully build towards ore encitful perspective on it i no idea of this going to work it'd really love to try it and is the first time have spoken out loud about it because mi do not know that i want it that i want to see that crash and burn and yet why not look what is the rest think it is cool we in right soave what in topics or or are you thinking about covering cause ieganything its a pretty pretty controversial topics but i will not to know what the ones you are thinking about we i mean it'd literally just i may not thinking out loud here but one one that i think on the controversial front that would be could be really rich is ism to think about policies for transathletes and sports that is a controversial try controversial but also have have talked to some experts on this a have talked to some transathletes ism in the people who are deep in this do not know what they think the policies should be and i i think actually hearing them talk and understanding the complexity of those issues and then may be hammering out what what is a policy would propose for schools what would you want for for olympic events i i just think the would be fascinating and it'd loved it it'd love to moderate that discussion goodness a i e would not i would not look to i it into that om glad you would i would not that seems soh one of the most barbed wire topics one could ever i embarking which is exactly why i kin a putting my vote you absolutely should do this podcast i think it is an am aging idea actually folks put in the common section on you two whether not madam should do the podcast and and that topic in particular i think i the amazing because am one thing that keep coming back to in my own mind is that a lot of the controversies out there stem from the fact that we very often have individuals pitted against individual yes and there is much lost in that a and i think about science and going back to the scientific method where we have subfield pitted against subfield when when you talk about a field there was huge controversy over the structure of deny and it was not one individual against another what you had small groups different camps and there as some partial overlap there is also if you read the double helix there was also a lot of a a i bee behavior else people entering romantic relationships just to glean information from the other side human beings not at not at their finest a but in any event small panels arguing competing teams competing i think is a far more interesting and informative than individuals busting heads i think too and i think a you now another another one that i think would be really interested unpeople who say great mines think alike no great mind challenge each other to think differently and when just do not do enough of that i been he lot politically what if we brought together a bunch of people i who are not ideologues but are really interested and pragmatic policy solutions to rewrite the constitution if we are gin to build one to day you would to tackle big stuff i i know i love it i love it at compliment it is a comping no what i the odds as said earlier no week sauce no weeks just you just as your you would go right for it i mean these listen these are the issues that people are really activated by because these are really for issues they they get down to the autonomic nervous system they are in the hypothalamus as we said but i don't teethes should be i look at these topics and think i just want to get it right i do not have a vest to interest in what the model should be i just know that even the wisest people of two hundred fifty years ago were not prepared to anticipate the world we live in to day and we ought to be constantly i soft know i do not think you should live in the world where you affirm your beliefs i think the only way you learn is by continually evolving your beliefs and i guess ism trying to finger out more ways to catalyze that around issues people care about but i do not care about the issues i care about the stretching of thinking and the improving the way that the worldworks it'll tell you if you decide to do this podcast with the tag team foreman i love that you gleaned it from watching wrestling at a times a around these a very controversial issues i promise you that will be one of the most popular and important podcast in on the planet earth mi bepotcast on other planets i hear that the you galaxies far far away with a they may have pot cast you may have hade them for much longer than we have but that is a that is a winner well maybe it maybe it'll try it as a little experiment on the rethinking feet and see if it is an unmitigated disaster well where my vote lies i recite that case o to go aback your question for second on the mascara side have always thought to be fun to try to write a si i novel and the question ism wrestling with write now as is that a good use of my time the great sift writers out there there are not that many social scientists communicating about the topics that it do and it feels it might be i soft know iliac this is it might be too much of a diversion then again according to your words am you had no talent and diving but you exceeded t all all a performance mattress am by by considerable amount a throw motivation and a and opportunity ntelright am i vote yes ism not i have not read much cipher maybe any to read read morsiphi are you fans f i left sight that is it is one of my favorite ways to imagine a better world and also ye prevent a worse one from emerging but i do not know there is at there is a part of me that thinks there is a as auburn sin in colleagues did this you know this reecertandam about prize winning sciences and what diferencates them from their pierce a no but i being the son of his assist in having been surrounded by just by circumstance a number of noble prize winters a when i was a kid young kid a very curious what it what that this desert says an me that there they're many themes you can clean from it but that the thing that really jumped out at me is a the nobody prize enters are more likely have artistic hobbies firemen certainly did yet a then there is a long list o them but if you break it down in the data it was a they are twice as likely as there peers to play a musical instrument there seven times as likely to draw or pain they are twelve times as likely to do a poetry or fiction creator writing and get there is twenty two times as likely as there peers twenty two to dance act or yes perform is magicians well form er magician as very sat avatisit why was not going to ask about magic but let us talk about it i was on a the cate you win every year take my sister in new york for her birthday my birthday causes our birthdays are close together and we went and saw a magician mentalist by the name of as wind i am ai i think a secret pronunciation am who just just the last time i saw absolutely blue my mind i there is no way it is not magic of course i know it is not magic but it is but miner standing is that there is some things that he another great mentalist an magicians do where they are not absolutely certain of the outcome they are there playing it is probabilistic and there is a risk and a thrill for them too amend that they are also creating memories in a racing memories and of something that we i may host ass on the pod gas because i refluent he is very far t of it creating memories in a racing memories that is a lot of what he does and he has tactics to do that in any event i was not going to ask about magic but i know that you were a professional magician a i will not point your life and that you you did this present because you enjoyed doing it but getting beyond the the sort of a pull rabbit o the hat or picket or identify the card that the person picked out of a the shuffled stack what is it in what was it about magic that intrigues you does it inform him anything about the work that you do now it does yet i you i think it when i started o was twelve and i was just it was just fun and i was looking for a way to entertain other people and entertain myself in the process and then you now became a challenge can i learn this new sale and can i y master this trick i think ism curious thing i did it college was i started a magic club the avid quant who is a a teller magician and a cruciverbalist as he calls it crusiverbless he does i magic crossword puzzles essentially that i i cannot do it justice you have to see it it is unreal ism and i watch him for our first performance together and realize one of us is going to make it as a magician and it is not me i uses it standing anyway ism the way of figures in my work now is i think much of good science communication as is direction and it is the same skills i used as magician if i told you that the the card you picked was about i disappear from the deck and appear round the window you would not be nearly as intrigued as if it happened by surprise and i think the same is true when the we communicate knowledge i think it is it is actually why many of my post you flagged this early or many of my poststart with ism this thing is not what you think it is actually this other thing ism i think that you now challenging conventional wisdom questioning assumptions is is what surprises people i and then leads them to think either i have something to learn or do not know i got a put a shield because my beliefs are being ism called s your attack and i think that the art form of magic was always about creating a surprise that would delight people ism as supposed to leading people to feel they were tricked or duped or manipulated and i think that the challenge for me is to say ski i want to figure out what what we know from behavioral science ism yet mostly focussing on psychology as that's my cuorexpertise ism what d we know that is actually different from most intuition and then how do i explain that in a way that surprises people but leaves them to say oh that is interesting as supposed to that is wrong and than want to fight about it s almost as if you give them the experience of what you are trying to teach them that the oh that is wrong cannot i be the available response because in magic it to it is it is everyone knows it is magic just with professional wrestling folks by the way there is there is prior understanding of what can happen maybe they go off script but i think that is you she i think part of the interest in professional wrestling for those that are extreme fans of professional wrestling is that they almost want to wonder about whether some of it is not in the plan but the is a suspension of see of reality that i seem to enjoy because if somethings vague or well we should we should be i should be more careful about my language in with magic why when see osiamn i i do not think it is actual magic but he is able to give the illusion of magic the real illusion is that it is magic right it is not the illusion of making the card hop to somewhere else in the room and he is phenomenal i highly recommend people gill see ho show if if they get the opportunity but the i this they are doing a documentary about him now actually it'll be income natflic stuff is hay u but it is the illusion that magic exists that is exciting a with science communication yet i always a aim for four things i do not always e eave them but and i think you do as well if i made that ism a topic be interesting clear ideally actionable but not always and the the quad fact as when it is also surprising interesting clue your factional and surprising sort o is the the ultimate if they're sure oh i did not realize that but it is it is hard to find data points that satisfying all former better and the surprising is the least important by far ism i i assume table stakes is it is rigorous oh well ops sitting underneath all four of those points are i that it is scent that it is actual science right one did not you say it right is not conjecture or theory that means that there is data to support it and that the data were collected with with the appropriate mount of rigor right there is at there is a reservoir stuff that that is underneath as a found yes and we given the base line of rigor how do i find what is interesting clear actionable and hopefully surprising although i would at kat i would make a case is a classic article that hurray dais wrote when my all time favorites is a a sociologist who wrote a paper called that is interesting and he opened the paper by saying ism ideas live not because they are true but because they are interesting which decimated one of my sort beliefs i i thought it was accuracy the drove people's beliefs and he said no ideas live because they are interesting and then he goes to build an index of the interesting to explain when people are intrigued and his case is that most of interest is surprise and he breaks down all the ways that you can turn conventional with him upside down you can say that ism something you thought was bad was actually good or vice verse you can argue that ism something you thought was homogenous is actually heterogenous you can argue that something you thought was individual was actually a collective phenomenon or vice of for sanies he is got this wonderful break down of of all the was of being interesting and he is the one y are the distinction between ideas that a challenge weekly held assumptions intriguing you and strongly held assumptions ism you no sort of offending you but think from dais's view and i think e is right a huge amount of interest is surprise and but i do not think it istle only driver of interest i might i might take your criteria and say o can we start with rigger we onto go to interest clarity and action ability how do you to interest let us build a sub model of the factors the drive interests and surprise might be at might have the biggest bade await in the regression equation i but what else what else drive interests i have a couple of hypotheses i in t hear yours you havebeen doing this actively and highly effectively beyond surprise what else interests people in your content anything that draws on self reflection for them i think we all have an it in a desire to better understand ourselves why why we work the way we do why we do not work as well as we would to entertain domains some an encase understanding on on our experiences of others too oh now it make sense tat wit a going back to the the cant episodes but we did several them for m i think it is appropriate you to learn from him that narcissism is envy it represents it a extreme deficiency in the pleasure a that pe nurses can have an extreme pleasure dry but they they always feel they have far less than they would to haven that others have far more of it because they do not have that same yearning for it right and that arsis at its cops is deep envy that to me was wow i and to to realize that now understand that all this discussion that hear out there about arsis even calling other people nurses that a there are genuine narcosis out there and what they really suffer from is an extreme deficit in pleasure and their constantly envious of others it framed everything i thought about narcosis about them being overbearing which they can be and often are a et camera et camera et i think it is also anything that leads to a oh i can i can i can navigate narcosis better with that well that give that takes all your boxes i is very surprising cause its not the way normally understand archaism but i think o you had no for me what is the maybe even it is at least as important as surprised maybe more is self elephants and it does not have to be actionable right it has to in a lotticases just help you understand or make sense of something that is been puzzlanger that is that is ism you know sort of i hakim ism almost always surprised when i say something from be no here heres here is a synthesis of research here is a reanalysis and i think its kind of obvious and people get excited about it because it gave them language to describe something they'd felt but they did not know how to a articulate or talk about and i think that i the then think is is why most the most popular tattoos i are about human behavior i because people are interested in people and if you learn something about you or about others you do not have to immediately do anything with that it to find it intriguing and even useful i because it enrich your world view a recent guess on this podcast we haven't erred it yet but maybe it will be out by times the says was with a least forfilldmen bear it she's em psychologist turn next tennis right studies e motions in of curse and she described how in certain cultures there's a language for subcategories of emotion i still granular i you knot as she described a word in japan's i do not recall wit the word was that describes the the feeling of sadness that one has after getting a particularly bad hair cut something that i do not done you or i a are familiar with but ism familiar with from my experience of a romantic partners being really unhappy other hair canna you your sad but the but by having a specific word for specific experience people feel less alone and the feeling passes more quickly in time and and then she give some other examples a from german and from a skananevian languages and forth and i find that interesting it is the moment people here that they are not alone in an experience there is nothing actionable about it but it it creates a to no mean shift thereafter which they suffer loss i may feel more connected to others i man think it is really a beautiful example of exactly what your referring to when we learn about something and we we identify with it it is powerful it is very powerful and i think ism psychologies often say name it to tenement ism affect labelling is one of the most effective a motion regulation tragedies when we tell it when we talked about distraction and refrain earlier i should have said there is a third strategy which is literally just to describe what your feeling ism it it seems to allow people than to reason with an process whatever their feeling is supposed to allowing the feeling to control them and i i probably got the clearest sense of this an ism in twenty twenty one ism i read a and your time's article in ism in languishing ism the feeling of mad or blow and i have never had anything i any article i wrote resinate this and just the i all that the to the post magnet were just it me it me it us ex's so one in two word reactions and i do not think it was the content the matter to people it was the just having the term ism all the sudden people realizes her originally hurry keys research i was referencing ism it had been a eightball for me to say there is a if you think about the spectrum of well being this is related to your mental illness fires mental health distinction ism those are two extremes of the continue and at one end we have depression in burn out on another end we have you not well being an flourishing languishing lifts right in the middle as quarry describes it it is the absence of well being you are not depressed you still have hope your not burn out you still have energy but you are not at pique functioning your missing a sense of purpose ism you feel your stagnating and your empty and yet there is something about just saying the word languishing that led people to to realize yet that is a thing and course we are languishing were standing still in the middle of a global experiment that no one poppet it into which violates all rules of consent i by science let si mi check i but i think that that that is something that that probably is under represented when we are train to communicate a scientists to say on of the most valuable things we do as we give people language to talk about things i think that is a massive part of of your impact is this is one the big things have learned from you turn i i i used to be a little bit dismissive of i of cognitive narrow scene in particular i thought understanding the brain has not taught me that much about the mind being able t trace i let the take a simple example when i read joladu's research being able to trace i certain i a ligula response is i you know as the rude of how people deal with fighter flight and and threat i do not know that that help me that much if i can just describe fighter flight to i need the amygdala and you have commenced me i was wrong about that because when people have when they understand that i the neurological substrates of their thoughts feelings and actions they believe them more they are oh there is a mechanism for this it is being produced inside my head even though i cannot see it it is there and it can be studied with the tools of science i think that is a really big deal and i i really regret the fact that i did not spend more time on talking of now sciences i think it'd be a better sight a better psychologists day well the thanks for the kind words i think that u a fortunate evolution in our fields we are even felt if i may over the last ten years is that whereas nor science itself love needs to be sub dibidento nernatomy and the nor physiology it is gumption to all sorry science but it now includes psychology computational nor science cognac orbits it's all i think consider us no we have different perspectives in different training obviously but doing a lot of the same things just a using different on different direction tools it dot front different language base tools and listen what you have done a i wont to say masterfully i mean just with extreme virtuosity is to wrap your hands round such an enormous literature related to psychology him in the human mind and behavior and thought process emotions and potential and you many topics and to i and to extract the the most valuable gems from that literature and communicate them in a way than any one can understand and i et its is it is an extreme gift ought to be able to do that and it is i and it is clear it is working because you mention this article in language in which we will provide a reference to our link to in our captionecause i want to go read that now i mean ism always struck by this feeling of it might ism not tired but why have got toms to do will i why do i just want us sit here for an only may be i need to sit here but then you get in at all the a oke but you now need it there is a lot to do there is lot to get up and go i do not wat a waste my life and ye a rest is good to but i think languishing is something that the i de lincoln resinate with that when i had a bull dog it felt a lot easier to do cause he was always languishing but a do you ever just languish or or you busy enough that you you just feel your always a forward centeramass i think everybody languishes thin its part of the human condition and i think it might even be evolutionarily adaptive because i remember am another sort of my altering idea i remember reading randy pussy's argument that mild depression could be evolutionarily functional that it doit obviously clinical depression ism is debilitating in a lot of ways but low grade sadness ism lincoln's melancholy i we know whine one of thinks at can do is broaden your feel division ism and you know for for many people sadness is a signal that something is not working and it can mote of a problemsolin i it can in some cases ism open act cess to new perspectives ism unfortunately those potential benefits are of sadness are often overridden by the mode of national cost and also that the fact that you would now spend all this time regulating your sadness and wondering why you are sad right and its it is hard a harness but ism i i had a similar thought about languishing from this perspective to say that maybe moments of languishing open a substitute ism when we get stuck i sometimes we realize you have to move backward in order to make progress ism sometimes you have to unlearn things that you thought you knew i in order to to keep growing and ism i i do not i a friend mind said at he read my languishing piecelely you are not the languishing type mi book i maybe everybody's base line is different i i think one of the things ism ism really lucky to have is hi reserves of energy ism but for me languishing is i felt i did nothing to day ism and you now in a typical day if ism writing a book i should be able to write a thousand words ism proud of an ana a single word that i produced or i sat at my blinking curse staring at the computer screen and for the umpteenth time wonder did they call it a curse because of all the writers who cursed him and then i had up gouging what is the what or the satin roots of the word curse where did this come from and that is not a good use of time that is that is not forward mass the s lag ism spinning ye i i think everybody languish i and i aspire to do it less often but not never well the what dos curse what is the ruder curse people look it up put if boys put in put it in the comments on you to h i did i did look it up oh get o o little tells now no i fee there is a there is a footnote and hid in potential ism trying to remember it comes from i course i think and i the curse ism originally came no i twat to do it i a om it at never this is a you are hit after t a your hyppigampossis smart enough to e discarded that information a o you have more importanthings to do forgive me for asking the question folks put in the comments on you to good i have one more question about potential you have children correct three am and a lot of our listeners either our children or have children am and even for those that do not have children ism curious with they vast array of knowledge that you now have about potential and the fact that kids are these incredible sponges wright they i mean they they certainly experienced discomfort we know that they are sponges we absolutely know that sometimes their filters we try and teach them to be filters and holy they are imperfections maybe their kids there just perfectionist by default but to imagine that they are because standards come about when we become aware of other people's performance right what sorts of messages do you recommend parents give their kids and what sorts of messages are you actually implementing that perhaps are different than you a were prior to researching and writing your book on potential oh interesting his the first into say is a beck kenned doctor beck is my favorite source of insight an parenting and shes changed the way i think of tat the way i thing about a lot of what i do with our kids am but my wife allusion is she her instincts about effect of parenting are sophisticated i feel every day i learn something from watching her communicate with our kids and i i came in thinking i it i write this book about potential am i can t do parenting chapter because i want everything to be relevant a parents and i sure enough there is the chapter that had nothing to parenting where oh actually i am reading this research and there was a come ant where i did something well and i did not even mean to do it ism and this is something that i think every one ism probably under utilizes i know i actually that an over statement i think a lot of people i do not appreciate the importance of of this approach to parenting i and i am trying to do it more often ism quick quick story in that will back up into the principle i was i was getting ready to get my first head talk a number years ago extremely nervous ism ism a shy introvert i was for a long time afraid of public speaking i remembering college literally shaking ism to raise my hand being that nervous and now i felt to get in the red circle ism not my idea of comforts on and happen to mention to our oldest daughter that i was nervous and i asked her for advice on what i should do and she said i think i think at the time la see she must have been she was seven maybe think seven i maybe six and nit ism she said i look for a smiling face in the audience it it was it was one of those moments ruling oh that is such a good idea ism why did not i think of that yes i can do that i know people who are in be in the audience i asked a couple of friends to sit in the front rows and i i locked eyes with a couple of them and my nerves went down a little bit couple weeks later ism johnny's getting ready to be in a school play and she is also shy and interested and she is nervous and she asked us for advice and instead of telling her what to do i said well what did you suggest to me a few weeks ago and she she remembered and she said look for a smiling face and it was it was one of the it was one of the most moving moments ism of my life like allusion and i got to the play and she looked at us and she beamed and i just am i i think what id learned from that experience was kids need to feel that they matter and most of us think about mattering as a showing kids that they are unconditionally loved and giving them the support they need but we forget that part of feeling the you matters feeling that you make a difference as a kid feeling you have something to contribute as a parent asking my daughter for advice that boosted her confidence and i think that this is a have come to call this the coach effect it's when my favorite recent findings and psychology that when when your struggling with something a your instinct is to go to somebody else for advice and say i need guidance the problem is that keeps you in a passive frame of mind it makes you feel your dependent on others what you are better off doing is finding somebody else with a similar challenge and giving them advice and what that does is it it shows you that you have something to give a it's your efficacy a the research on this by learn escorts winkle and colleagues is fascinating people who give advice instead of receiving it randomly assigned and a more motivated and more confident and i think this is coming every parent could do i whatever challenge you think your kid is in a face find aversion of it that your grappling with and seek their guidance on it and when they run into that same challenge they will have confidence that they can begin to figure it out on their own and you can be a coach in that process is opposed to just telling them what to do which they may feel is not relevant or they may resist because they do not want to be told what to do by apparent that is my favorite parenting lesson from it potential i love that and i love your statement that kids adult want of matter that being weaker you do not make them feel important but often that is tied to performance mattress and the performance metrics are the very things that are making them nervous or that or creating anxiety i of it are you taking additional kits for adoption i in raisin reason raising my hand i the good be a lot my development a psychologists in the world if fat if we chaise our careers later superinteresting top again by the way ism very much looking forward to reading your book a hidden potential i clearly i have a lot to resolve around that issue because a i still hear miss rolling the in a middle school just telling me how much potential we have and that and then i was not accessing mine oh n its ay a voice in the back of my head all the time and even tough i feel very happy with a many aspects of my life that therefore a lot of things that i want to do that i have not done and i think it is through a i limit limited a what re they call limiting self beliefs or things of that or it any else in ans belief ere ouzo i cannot even say say the phrase u i do i do think all your hands i yet that antler humor man really has not he has not really tape is potential it wondering it ah well keep mind i have lived in a fairly narrow trench of of pursuit at nineteen i got into this and have been doing this you researching and teaching and doing recent for pretty much all have done frolic almostyour heading to thirty years and you too you have been in this in this game for a long time and that is it is where we to play but i but it would have learned from you to day in addition to many other things is that realizing our potential i has much to do with you reaching outside it we hear about our comfort zone but it is also reaching into a deeper wishes and thoughts and a i by keep going back to this idea of the tasting podcast and and the origins of that in your mind is la i never would have expected that but it also reveals something that sounds colic intrinsic to you you maybe you to see things play out a the way you think they should be played out as opposed to the what is clearly i intractable battle of lager heads lease yes that is it that s a core value i i think the i i cannot imagine an unsuitable problem i love and i want your i want your brain a listen madam i want to thank you first of all for taking the time to day to come talk to us certainly not just about your book but we covered an enormous range of topics a talk to us about predestination which as sort of third rail of life for many people a creativity intrinsic extrinsic motivation and a blind spots authenticity and and much more but also i want to thank you for being sech an a active teacher on social media in the class room you still run a research programmed you doing ted talks your writing multiple books your absolute female en terms the the amount of information that your putting out into the world than i must say i always always always learn from your posts your padcastier books there is certain people in the world there exceedingly rare but you are one of them that when they open their mouth people learn and they learn valuable knowledge and it is a it is a incredible thing m to be on the receiving and and i just want to say in behalf of myself when everyone else thank you ever much for what you do and a please keep going well thank you that that means a lot to me considering the source was i give the sentiments are mutual i think eve every time i whether it is reading one your posts or seeing one of your reals i i may overwhelming thought is that is a master teacher and if i had been lucky enough to take one of your classes i might have gone more of the were science section well i men fail nonet would it would've been interesting to learn more about it minimum and i just have tremendous admiration for your commitment to making science ism interesting clear and useful to people thank you i consider us an the on the same team and in that regard and a and i i probably will a tap you about a potential collaboration i be much fun o a at is to work together r ah meanwhile again thank you for everything you are doing and am angelica said just keep going and please come back again i feel there are a thousand other topics we could talk about and that we should dotted we will try that to make regret you thank you for joining me for to day's discussion with doctor madam grant if you are learning from and are enjoying this podcast please

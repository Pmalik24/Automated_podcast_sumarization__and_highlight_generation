something it is a a grid of tiles picture four thousand little tiles and there tiny the each is sixteen by sixteen pistols and the ideas anybody him by the tiles own them and decorate them how they want people hate different cartoonsnem and words they have posted when can created this back in twenty sixteen bear we anybody noticed for a end maybe twenty of thirty people bought tiles with any years predator done with pixel map that is the project tat this my ataman bride when it talked to him about so the same day that can gets atoms he mom that afternoon he gets on his wit him e that basically what you do even than and try t find really olden a ye pro tat and that you do that a hobble a doing it a the that and mind would be one the early even that point at an not that one ago and en a y ta that o must all that you can go and that ism probably then on a hat money and i do not really it sitting on a tend of money because in the creator world one kind of and of tea the people get excited about and pay money for is what they call historic and of teas the first end of teas that ever existed we can tells madam no that is all grade what is an and f tea make lo moneyadam ism a quick primer and had it ever occurred to you that what you had made was in an f tea no when i made t the for on a h lie i did even like the time i i heard of i a y en than i d heard in e new that hurry at one and i really had not look you wat a ye a which i it a rely yo it i i truly can poorly forgot about mi i and i hat thin how much ye think a get for tit and you that like the a that a hat one it develop for got e a hundred that an the looking at you y aye could ho like gat i hundred and to fit and at the in i a i i o like a i e an y can on part that the happening dimer rid tells him i can help he set this up and get ever range and people w pay you gobs an money for the rest of those four thousand tiles he said he knows a good guys who love the early historic and of teas this won though i talk it up a twitter a courage people to buy he says he is done this free but other old and f teas tat madam tells him whose one little snag can needs to lower the price of each tile as i was back in twenty sixteen cans at the price of each tile at two ether now ether i don't know anything about this can a to explain this to me is the name of one of the big script currencies bit coin two ether back in twenty sixteen was round twenty box the problem madam explain was the value of ether had down up and to through these days is now more than six thousand dollars wait too high from us people ye tat i would be a lot better o o or that for it if i that all of them you your point three i that zero point three five a another was each him me to a cost point three five ether a third of anytherly t the time i ran a thousand dollars and like for me that mad complete that he do not he did not really believe any of this was gone work anyway ut he figured which he got to wo i i oi go with it castrated knocking down the price of his four thousand tiles i i a at took some time because the way he wrote the original to the original program for pixel map repricing each to took a few minutes and and to do them by hand one at a time for hundreds and hundreds of tiles now he could have written cod to automate tat process but he said he was not thinking straight that particular week because that week his dad had a hardy tap and went to the hospital for buy past surgery and can was spending lot a time at the hospital with his dag madam was sending messages the buyers wo quote pounding at the door hurry out do them faster and some people were impatient hey just paid the higher price over six thousand dollars two ether which weeks tonovious question why lower the price if people were paying to a theory for them i betas in e more on and i i fat et the holy the yo tin i they cant i i have and idea my who no mi like a en withe for levin years she bell e she she t the bind them at that shudntly r the pi polite fie or one or just the that yo like you they wont at i know i not i not smart it was i a were the what a the an tit the pure or change their mine i give idea why they not at what to to all i know that we fell them right now we will litter that i don mat it we are looking at lie million or more i it we all all them and give never had that hand of money literally a thing about am about the come millionaire and then the heard part of the story herd hat i b a the heard artistry has anyone happened yet re who transpired nans he got a phone call that made him rethink everything that had happened to this point and would very differently at the my adamant bride who seems nice and helpful at firs he and i am had a series of conversations of the course of weeks where all of this unfolded basically can started off most of us i think he had not been following this hope and if teaching did not know wat they were and then suddenly lake i do not know somebody in a fairy tale whose transported to a strange new world where he learns he is a prince or a night or something can gets pulled into this capital world we he finds he has all this cred all the street cred as one the first pioneers an whence hes there he set a tick look around at the end of tea world stood a yo a days oke you just made me a millionaire who are you people and he does not what he sees and then some other things happened after that which shall her from baby chico is this america life om or glass seriously stay with us i find planet of the apes it we can re price is tiles and things when even better than atomic bride said they might he sold three thousand tiles turning him a total of three point five million dollars and the amount of time that took from dams first meal to three point five million dollars two days and six hours six days after that base we the first money that wrote around after he had all that money he did what many people dream of doing if they had lottery or something he quit his job not that he dis liked his job just the opposite e says he really enjoyed his job but he wanted to devote his time to developing picks map in various ways demand to push the price o picks am a high fifteen thousand to eighteen thousand dollars our tile he decided to keep nine hundred of them for himself but that i ha the heard part of the story at a a i let us get to the a part of this story o the were part i mean it thought we tat the part that changed that wit the i a re sou to ma and an bey e ha i i v tin for thin turning on the train that still not i wonder o the a thing auto about it an founded you picked off e i sher i call him and have been taking to him literally everyday then the got has come from australia he toldhim he looking at all the picks sales which is not sending his hard to do cause every transaction with an out teas on with script is all public that is how crypt works and the got going the transactions and the whole thing looked fishy to i why he asked were you lowering the price of all the tiles when demand for them was high is it he did not know exactly what kind of ripoff can was running the me no sens let you thought it i hat to be gan or else i we the complete more on it that a li you ton and a my i the a give ye more on that and then he to me that script pot o get creator punks script punks a this big i conic an of the and the these little cartoons they are punks eta's punks with moons or died hare all of them slightly to fervent there ten thousand of them cut easy t understand and they caught on celebrity's bought them jails some to willies highly clam stop dog and a big part of their value supposedly was that they were among the earliest and of ten any one ever made they were market of that way is the original one tea the first an of tea the average price of a creator punk when comes talking to the guy an australia three hundred to four hundred thousand dollars each each guy n australia was pick map is he year older than creator punks and i that la very why your what e wort a or that you tithing on not e evil million let my several hundred million unless you kea sharing out tit the bi ta that wit i all tray in words it er lest for we were the words he used i de i i the to do yo pi do i it the i from australia said it did not make sense to lower pics maps price at all again crypt punks were selling for four hundred thousand dollars and an was reducing ice map to a thousand dollars and the guy and australia had a prime suspect for who might be benefiting most from this odd behavior for who might be behind all of it there was a it a not the purchased a thousand pics reptiles the lowest price and then watch the price double and doubt again and again and again the not the not was the biggest owner of pick map ever was behind the not e made a too money i remember ham thing e yo think on the not cans fir thought adamant bride after o it was adamant bride who talked ho into doing this logical thing of lowering the price but then he thought do atomic bride had the con o money it a thousand tiles cost more than a million dollars see ad another suspect or rich guy some you could be the money behind adamant bride and i just tin to say i know this is the very random name to be putting out of the air and putting into the story but the rich guy can suspected was the president of the philadelphia seventy sisters taro more marry more who very publicly has talked about living an of teas and who can suspected because madam showed him the my had bought a few was of pics map very early even befoul madam re lunch the sight affix shall for madam told the world by it how do to do that maybe he also created the not quietly snag an extra thousand tiles at am opus turn that is ye the madam or deal or commination the got thin i am trying to prove it tat yet at lit like i do i do not know for sure it it literally thee the like you that would have no that er o yet the thou r it la right at the her beginning yen real be had a right to get it the madam told me like you fifivearly telling me the only way would work if i i then it for on i not even thing that tut the lower the pride and ay get a to that e possible e i the i do not want to be i do not want to be rude but it sounds madam probably asked you to go her the price he could buy more of them cause he knew the pray happy i a lot ye and any the thousand of them have you asked madam no it to why not o i be my the playing the stupid hart because ism trying to get true of it you there i my point hero one present can that you did not you i d even o how of you possible that my ham i want to know if it ham or it him in were or who it cannot i ask who why be mad at madam you did not know what you had he he made you a millionaire and he is also on the intricate making the mark at for you he is actually finding buyers for you he is talking it of he is making the whole thing happen why should not he make money who who carries if he gets who cares if he owns a thousand of them you own nine hundred of them and you'll make lot of money you you tent my my life an tho no a the the e you re them the in li i when i give him a half million dollars i i think you because i when all more on i cannot how to you he that the ten ti i that but i have just having that to the try o a i o i the other part of that thou wit when ye was tell talking me the first say he told me i not you e you have to be homing in it for you why would you do t i you only till doing at a hem joys making people ha the and if i wont rewarding a thing of it i can if not you you the part of it him just lying outright an graving the berlin i it is more boring an to blind to me i just not life his rolling and to mind bending the guy who would seem such a pow supported could been playing him for a soccer along ribbing him off at the exact moment he was making can richer than he ever imagined he would be you do not know much bat script to know that it is rife was scamps of all kinds can wanted to figure out who was behind the not was he wanted to understand what did just happen to him was he the rule who was i eve that he in you've realize that his pocket was being picked what was real and what was not in this new world he suddenly found himself in we read to stand ton four days later can tax me saying there is news and we get on the hound it is september even his birthday the had a little bat how it is been convey weed birth day to have more of his life but that is not the news yes as loved but it is a mild case that is also not the news it what is knew well he isn't pending lot of time trying to understand what is really happening with an tough teas especially with adamant bride in the guise who buy these historic and of teas and hes convinced it is pretty ugly yet it that that me the li i have proof out the at i for language i you to the are doing ta actively wit project hat the that it is really thought e who l at the do like i do not think it a legal ut i got nothing any that the legal in i think it usually wrong an o that ethical butter no log about it mostly i an't coming for the person made the ftectant in at the a i have it right i do not thing it you ticking i that he means and of teas i think it the horrible am that is thing over people by the whole thine can said that he sees everything that adamant bright in his gas you do in was the have con of adopted him and eluded i in their chat groups on discord discorded om if you do not know is a chastise madam a first to the guys in his discord group is the apes a i nit you let a what other the a locket an it just people the er w tit you y an you epic about snout e i win it find out about one bet ut goal rate ruin that is galled aping in it is a worthy direction here a lot in the and of t world one day got an of t is the board apes yacht cob to show me u what is horrible about what out arm's doing can calls me back from his computer s we can share is screen just ting there we go wersirry ti me well and my mecriphon was not liken this the moment i see him for the first time he is quin cot short hair nearly trimmed bed and the general via of the friendliest most sincere ten support guy in the world for job he dis vidiall calls in front of green screen with a really nice microphone and that is what he has in this call he goes ut to open up madam's discord group and of t archeologist her is and this just happened that two forty four am just few months ago madam said abri everyone please do not the or send thyself to anyone i wont to keep this opportunity to this community only this is had ye always does at this is what he did with pixel nous i wisent know the croup yet but din mac bride's doing right here is he is rolling out another one of these historic and a t is this stingo one is called ether t h ye r o was created it when he eighteen to yours after pixel map picked map ta most people never noticed it back when i was created but now madam's going help relaunch it the way that madam yo launch picked map it'll get people finally pay money for what a basically hin this case virtual imaginary buildings in he virtual digital city can't i i read the conversation that is happening in the chap my bride is telling the apes that is all buy in to this and get out therein twitter tell everybody we know buy it is well he is basically saying go crazy on other ether an the he say it and to make this especially appealing to the apes my bride says that he is negotiated with the guy who created other to offer other to his apes it a special o price duo well below what i think that ben sell for and to get the special o price he tells them he is on a hold alive even on discord a nine a m eastern time on sundae the apes ere fond madam that is a fantastic opportunity for us all thanks for this much appreciated you the go ant i sundaes next day ha nine am the apes gather get ready it is coming up at any second here s every there is the voice of adamant bride in the discord you hear him but you do not see him you see is screen sher as he chicks on various stuff and to give you a sense of the very happy let us make a deal tical look to what is behind the curtained vibe but the whole thing here is the moment when he gave fifty of his apes the chance to sign up to buy ether on the cheese for on three hundred forty bogs he told the apes a sign of sheet was about to go live i am going to in the next minute or make that public an the first fifty of you guy who pace your name in there wouldn't give you private tail link get ready do you stuff ready i hope you are already it now be ti it's some going the next seconds ah you guys tell me if you see tit is all my follow boom apish the sign of she dis appears names start filling in is er fast i see my man ceria collect or got in the lets we who else got in the top for sure a shivers got in here ugly punk yo got in there for sure not om bally nice space lo a soul t see brother you got in there for sure that that is just a in to have some sort of up age i to possible i think apes is always appreciated on an i hope yo gat i do i o canal this stuff that ataman bride did it is effective it pushed up the price of other some point in this cannot took me to a site called open sea which is a the big trading nonfarm with people buy in sell an of teas we watch as he apes to send from the trees and grab other yes is towers says see two minutes three minutes for mutes tat see the price is going out it wast point one for whatever there is one that just worst for three point nine a guarantee it is son be going crazy by this evening that is good be crazy actually right now you should go by ether was lie git is about to go up be yet i just thing to do that but yet its belt that is chatting happened shortly a to say this kind of amazing sitting there watching the numbers go up knowing that this was as close to a sore thing as i would ever gat one i free money it there but ism i did benin by money the average price of other had risen from two thousand dollars to five thousand dollars that is in one day when double bosom mend to the fifty apes who find up on madam's list tithe special old price of three hundred forty dollars each of them now on something worth five thousand dollars a little her yet little bit better this is could just get out and though eve just made out bandits a ready yes yes but out em's doing is working yes you just watery kind of told your eyes the matter the reason that i roll my eyes is because it is it is as yer some things some one's making money the matter what and when they do there means some one's losing money and basically the earlier you are the better it is if ten before other people badly tor one of these people you are going to make out really well n let's of other people can believes lose money t we saying in his view is a classic human do something that if you did t in the stock market would be wholly legal the apes get in early talk up a there twitter en courage other people by which pushes up the price in a couple of days wen the prices the highest they sou taking o quick sizable profit about the hope the and of teas price falls in anybody left holding it takes a beating lose money fact to day in the months since that day when madam weganched other the prices promoted it is now down as well as nine hundred dollars some days very different from those early booming days on is five thousand dollars and i do not think that many pops made people as you think you are going to make the money every awning here it is probably going to do oke but it is i can be good for the people else i up on the train last and that is what ken things is and of evil about the world of an of ten why thinks there is scam and should not exist seeing ow this may me wonder if any of this is actually illegal and have now talk to a bunch of lawyers about it lawyers who deal within of teas and script and security fraud and putting two who advise companies that reason of teas and i described what i saw adamant bride do in relaunching other and all of them told me that and if teas are new the laws still pretty vague there's been many lot suits or much government enforcement in an of teas but they point to two things that could be problematic look at first if madam in the apes were pumping and dumping specifically if they were lying about either wore about their own trading that would be an issue if they were going unto twitter and telling people that either is a great investment worth seeking money and two for the long run but then if they themselves only held on to it for a few days until the rice rose and then they sold it that would be a legal that would be market manipulation the second thing the lawyers pointy to transparency is key if madam i was going out giving a special price to fifty people to generate bus an excitement that is a normal kind of promotion and lots of industries when buyer says he said that could be fine bathe key to that being of cay is it madam would need to disclose it all publicly that any possible investor can find out that some people got a special cheaper price madam did not do that he would be danger of some invested they be somebody lost money they her suing him over holding back that information look at was madam crossing the line into illegality with either of those things get told in that proof in that either way as or the it that mysterious not purchase a thousand pick som reptiles a forth of all the tiles in started away there was someone much more sinister then madam behind the pot one day tests me panic about what his learning about the pot scared about it that he does not know if he wants to go on the radio any more i es this wort parts just an country tell an is just is is it soma figure an i think the o account that on you dell is just much much bigger he sent me a screen shot that show that the count had done nearly two billion dollars and trades specific its one point eight for billion since was created fourteen months before this not some normal person this is e let it i ma la smart police true a that people like its ay very well or can is hin you do not thin it is possible that it is just a bunch of investors a like the grub not madam as assembled around down where it slam no a hundred people and together they have lout of money i do not i do not think he is si this the ked certain yes may be working for the strip or something that he is not have i do nobly smart enough to be like this you wouldn't be doing what is doing if theotes' money this is i wholly differently give someone ye would be the reason mower something as undridiculous the this only one account tie people that have en is money tire going that have a behavior ire not in to people la blown the whistle on them join the whistle he means talking about the publicly on the radio know here no good movie were the person that places me makes its to the end and has a happy life she is ally the persons me get's kill wait there whistleblarm if is for the whistleblar makes it to the end and wins know i literally do not have i don't have a sense they do not have l o the that i some thing i alky no et index an ism my the only persons doesn't have again and the a take i i seriously legentimal feel my name being one story cud resell an me not existing ore my family my alien of that om ta not you artery ti that is like up i tell him on the call and later any man that i respect any thrice he mags and of course it is fine if he drops out of the story but is he right about that one pointy billion in trades count the bonus be making a ton of trades with a much smaller amount of money maybe the bots even buying from itself to drive up the price of an of was that something hat happens in the and tea world can he mess bat sis maybe him right her may we not there he's getting a new tool that could tell us how much money is really behind all those trades get to sot if very really thinks it the criminal syndicate pined all this get a better sense of how much sister's for him her's getting is offer developed by a company called chainalisis and is usually used by governments and long foremen and financial institutions to that who is doing what an of teas and script it could tell can what the bout was buying and selling and to who what re their accounts an attracted with a tocsin to the chain halisist people to a can rote me a few days pass what can use to the can alibis told k at who boon sold picks om reptiles with what the not was doing than then he tests me have lots o buds was wrong about preach everything what he found and my conversation with the not running is behind the not that is an minute rchicago boa radio went our program continues this mark om li from our glass to days program the reluctant explorer we have the story of somebody yo finds himself in this new world that he never ask to be part of and you decides to take to look around to figure out the truth of what is going on i came along for the ride we are right now in themiddle of our story about can win and picks map and before we go further in that story a thing that this might be a god moment to explain of what an f teas are an o one more detail for everyone who is gotten this foreigner story and still actually does not know what they are oke inf teas their images or art work or video cliffs are busily anything that you can post on line the key thing that makes them an an f tea is it some one can say they own it and ownership is possible is a record of who owns the an of tea get stored on some they called a block chain and lots of people know what block can is but lots of people do not some just going to say the block chain is a set of computers there all over the world and they all store exactly the same data and anybody can look at that dato the a public ledger that anybody can read blockchains store the records of whoops which and of teas who on script currencies and wright now all kinds of people are inventing all kinds of things to throw up on the block chain it is a mess and arctic chaos really one end of things you have the in b a selling videos of great dunks as an of was easily reinventing sports trading cards for the script world very old school for a commercial tat the other end you have stop a be burned a banks of print and then the digital copy of the print a picture of the print for we more than the original ever cause that one o was lot of a criptorsuffin that his kind of making fun of the whole idea that anybody would think with the in often is worth anything the original banks print actually had the sentence as part of the image wo i cannot believing moans actually by the what some pick up our story where we left off at to and the time of chimpanzees was a monkey what have you figure to since we was but everything literally everything ye you're your assure you ai i doll kens clean chairs ma i can see how the chain alibis of where map somebody is script transactions and i have to say it is a very satisfying chart to look at i dots o different colors and bines and arrows connecting them it took him daze to look into all these transactions when he did he learned for once i for all mel daily three's not the body ere count the rich guys he suspected dowry mora president in seventy six years enrol the also not the body i li can you was the not i rep can started will get everything the bowls doing he found that who ever made the not had not covered their tracks completely can set of this one address that the not sent money two it was different from all the others i got really lucky on this one lucky because he ass to found the same address on a message for it asking for fat ether yes father work i as use father test new pieces of cod the writing tat you you never do the o some one ease's at dress you always do with your i actually did this with my own this address led can to an account won get ho i get a is were pretty much everyone on the planet for her force cod there is other competitors a but it is make so times it now it is wonderful they get help a mountain is a pretty unusual in an is and then weer can found a twitter account t the same name that twit user that i bee the not es he as at a some little of a tarts a pickatsue was a little a had ban belt then yet he looks a little angry carriage is outer the amain on twitter so that ism the crater of pickled to i would love to talk to if you have any time an when i times this i was drinking out i was said then i said i am relatively certain that you bought over a thousand and just one to talk with you if you would be open to that ten smile says bis miles is not firkin out then the guy writes back a said m interesting ism curious how did you come to this conclusion which is a really good frisking question i said ah i found your address connected to the bout account a both receiving instantly funds then idea another smiling tit to keeps it i anyone to think that ism train to threatening or uni ma ye canvass the guyot how he found pick about start to bogs quickly is lit e guy says he saw dams tweed this one i goal and he ask again when i how id you find me on twitter an yer a little puzzles smiling scan explains how he found him then i point confirmation li coming holiday that i was right i said ooh it you did you get over a thousand no connection to barrel or out i other than is tweet an at this point ism thinking that there is no connection by justle checking si he got yes i don't a lo miles but do not know who degree is i saw this is a historical projects in petit after that is very amicable e is the cad about celebrating made me some day the guy tells canny has a partner that he does all this with tells him out to get touch with the partner he into partner also agreed to talk to me on precondition that i would not give the real names or record their voices we did a session one resume the yo got find the it a living in the middies both in their twenties though when they turned on the camera at one of them said i no way do not look him in my twenties trip to make you age faster a welkin script is a year it is twenty for seven a lot things happen they best got ins script in twenty sixteen twenty seventeen one of them as making money selling digital weapons to gamers begins counter strike gob fence more doing lot of those transactions in bit coin and then the point grew up they got o and at teas we wo guiders for decentralize fine insists which is being kind of up script rep man they just launch a and if the trading side of the down can peep with open sea but the calling gown there be sorted the rings fans i asked them about the one pointy for billion dollars in transactions and the said they have about a hundred million dollars to they invest wit and that to spend that over and over they boldly heart it out when we talked about pill mat they have decorated bunch o their tiles e e go to the picks om a dot i website you came we whole the combined to bunch of their tiles to write goon and mothers to write donjon i to big conavouncs this is all a can i say very different from what can imagine that the not was controlled by a murderous criminal syndicate by somebody in week with madam a bride trying to wind on the ta i shot he but it as a it probe press was the biggest impressed cause we cannot fondue first guys get hop account he looked at the cod he would written a looking through is self is this was don't god cot just as a revolver is a god a ti super impress an for me an is one of my people which of course is kind of reassuring in a small world the monsters we imagine are not real sot away but the same time i would one say there was som dis a pointed a we sons eellike i dead li did not on you it ti other too m yet budlike i really thought that is going talk blow the cover on this huge my you tie a i tho there e o be superable the there is something i there is something exciting about the thought if i ism going on cover a mass of criminal sentiment but a last the present of y sisters yet that that is a cute story in a be bat case is the was not madam and doesn't have anything to do with madam what was madam's anglewhy dey insist on lowing the price picks i map much was he pumping an dumping pill mat another on of teas do that carny suspected him of being this tin face master mine up to know good never i had no idea literally no idea though suspecting me this cries is madam bride in me took i went into detail about all the things the keen ad inspected him of i red him quotes were keen said that there was point o one percent chance that am was not deliberately ripping him off madam seemed truly amused by this this just crazy is crazy but you do not i get it i understand his thought prices it make sense but at the i mean when i hear it it is shocking i wouldn't even thought about doing that a price smog money talk to madam that madam got hooked on an of teas only six months before he pud ken into that world people baby would happened his a march of last year a bunch of these quote quote his store old an of teas would be discovered itstror to making tons of money i mean it just it is tit flipped the switch in my brain holy a it was literally all mi got there is gold get your shovel go did cause there is gold there all you got a do is still find it for the next four months he says he spent ten hours a day searching for other early an of teas by going phrases digital collectables blotching or t blotching collectables if on fifteen or twenty old an of teas at seeming than in work but must an then he says there was some problem in e which on programmanger whatever they made them unsuitable sewer day he did find a few that were suitable and then he and a friend found pistol map and from the beginning they thought it would be a big hid if they could just convince its creator to lower the price and the reason that they lord much by that point madam at a little experience and the only the one end of to relaunch i failed that we set that price too high and it it failed which whom mi says that is called at easerization peep it in by enough for them they did not buy enough of it he made his best guest for mixed auspice ye and work that better than any an of teas done before or sent pep just when not yet it was a rocketship i mean a complete rocket ship how many to did you buy three imaddit i might you don it is funny because i was not looking i was more looking for you the famine recognition thin the money i do not even know what to say ye it was just it was more about look at mac bride he rediscovered this is is also it get to be clear he did make a half million dollars off this the money that can handed him is a thank you but he did not know that was going to happen usually he says the an o t creators give him nothing an nobody's given him close to this much he does when i make money an an f teas but what adamant bride also once just as much it seems is it he once to make his stoic an f teas thing get them respect great a much larger community that find to them that is his angle if he succeeds he had hoe make money on all the historical and f teas that he owns personally but it is also now become kind of a personal mission for him he once historic and of teas to be remembered and valued and for that reason he is not pumping and dumping with his own an f teas is no dumping he still holding on to his tiles of picks em at and the other historic an f teas hes longe can actually looked at madam's transactions with the in alibis to and confirmed tat in all the transactions that he could find madam by a few an of ten of each of his projects anthem basically just holds on to them as to the other big feature of a poppadum scheme deception i couldn't find any examples of madam lying about the n f was he promotes or making false promises about how much money people would make when it comes to the other concerns of the lawyers that i talk to about madam and the way that he released that n f tea other to fifty of his apes hat special low price just remind you they said basically if people were getting a lower price madam needed to disclose that to the world t anybody who might be considering buying other well i i actually do do that with other it was not twitter before we did any sort of give away or opportunity anybody could have joined that discord anybody could have got it in we wanted more people in that is som not true at all after we talked i went back and looked at madam's treats for back than an he never tweeted about the fact that you could get a really low price on other by coming to this even whether he a held the even at all i fact when discorded a he is saying to his followers things do not tweed or send this out when to keep this opportunity to this community on way keep it on the down low he did mention the give away in a post that he did on medium after it happened we got back on the line i don ism doing good i don pretty good memory is he funny thing in it to less we weave with our very men it is funny he told me that when he went back and looked at what happened with other he realized beck than he saw a chance ten the discounted and of ten to reward the people in his discord my is which he calls the alpha discord o even though it is a public community anybody can join it at that point an time it was people why are we in the let discord for not getting any also alpha in the n f ta world mains special information in tell stop everybody else don't have yet i why are we here if you are not on to give us some awesome info i and this of trying to reward people up who were in there for a while he told me that this was all in the spirit of creating a larger community of people who valued these historic and f teas a in general i have to say the fact that madam did not think to disclose this special give away that did o the apes just shows how much tea and much of the n of ta words just making it up as they go along everyone is still tinging out what laws er an a pit of that there was his moment when i struck to madam where i told him exactly how much disclosure the lawyers thought would be smart for him to do to avoid losses is errand it was news to madam that is good o it is good advice than i i i hear it i think have acted appropriately i think intention matters i feel pretty good about what have done that is what all the criminal said a well we will see come visit me a jail i will you please to visit me a jail the soup in a had years since my initial phone calls with cam half a year the is been trapping around the en of tea world and found himself transported to he is act ben more and more r loll not exactly an eight bet but theverolly more team cowering and if teas do not seem evil to him any more fact the exact thing that he thought was terrible and of teas that get hight every piles on is the price rises and the people all and take a quick profit leaving lots of losers in the way he is now speculated that himself they money on a few things lost money on others he says with those then of teas with most en of teas he thinks actually everybody knows the prices going to up for a little while and then crash and everyone knows that n e won just trying to tenement time when will sell if you time it right then yid you pretty well it is it define feels a ad game sort of em the more i am in the space the more it feels for all kind of eticasy now and there is no because there are not my rules it is fair everyone is doing the she f of thing and i do not think there is anything morally wrong with it i god wit idea not l you i different then you were bi yo e you been corrupted whit changed him exactly the who an of tea world started boy different to him the moment he realized he was in being scam suddenly it did not seem he landed in a dark woods full of thieves trying to take advantage of him yes the reason why i was angry until that point was i thought that it was it in house they'd been lied to by madam this entire time and then to find out the he actually did a really a job of relaunching it and he actually was helping me rites he realms i always sic and ow not the stranger actually did something good for me yes and he literally did not charge me yes i tipped this bat am i know if he never existed and i somehow knew that i should relaunch pickshem up and loss sit i would not have done his i of a job it'd no idea are not anything that is not my skill set yes now he he was be jet can not men a bout to developers ham who warrant stammers if he is buying in f teas for fun as i he found his people and whole an of tea world seemed less ominous not that he thanks very much of most went of teas ninety nine per cent of my things are pretty much john he intended his john to make wit bock ut just is conceived ideas in the first place taxis not an unusual opinion i was interesting to me tat the biggest and of tea enthusiasts that i talk to for the story people really love an of teas they pretty much agreed with that at mac bride says ninety nine per cent of all an of teasruis to day will probably and of being worth nothing he says the most people probably should not get into en of teas right now the not goes but the number at ninety per cent worthless i read that one of the big and o tea bowls very saner chop but he ted the ninety eight per cent o men of teas would who's money cans life these days he in the same house he was before all this a vice train wit trarkquoi shutters and comes and

i last night was the superbly and i have notes we will start with the non political notes and the we will get to the political notes on the superbly no number one that is kind of political is the people my age are now the old a dairryacting to this the same way that people of my parents generation used to react too i dung know prince showing up a in now it is us we have become the old people because people who are ten years younger than ism a man i grew up with us er all man i drop with ludicrous and ism too old for even that him i grope with brooms in baton an now who these people are whenever i watch the half time shryfeel more than a little bit out of much but the big note here is that my generation is now the generation being pandered to which means we are the old which means by the way that our country is aging pretty quickly the fact that we are constantly pandering to whoever is the group of people who are the biggest demographically and the group of people have taste that runs toward two thousand four which is when usher's biggest album came out apparently i give only been told is by my staff inn but apparently as when usher was super huge was mid two thousands and i is now to thousand twenty four demonstrates once again this country is now the young country that has some fairly significant ramifications for the future of the country but again willet to the political later give other notes we will start with the actual game an they'll get to the half time shop to the actual game trick moms unable it i mean that guy i did not think it'd ever see anybody was as good as brain just on a pure talent level homes is better than ray he can run better than brandy he can read from the pocket as well is brandy can his cubs are in the first six seasons is higher than tom brandies was in his first six seasons homes is truly a tremendous quarterbacking ye can feel it i ben to a couple of superbolls the first one that i went to involve tombrady and then the second one that i went to also involve tom brandy and it was late brandy but you always felt comfortable with brandy having the ball in his hands and in that last drive when homes is coming down the field you feel as a fan comfortable watching theatrics homes of the football an away that you do not with somebody actor brockperty a get the fact is that homes with the football he knows what he is doing and you felt comfortable with a three point pirate him coming down the field and having a shot at winning the gan because he is truly in amazing amazing quarterback also ah i would just to point out this point that tho traves cease's crazy person this would be tailor swift boy friend and he is really good at his job he's an excellent tide also he is a nut case now to be fair pretty much every one in the anafell is raided up beyond all reason but very early on in the game there is a fumble and traves else comes out and just destroys and reed s it was amazing he who is mad that you comes up toe and read me bumps in he is all shewing out shewing out this this elderly walrus is real weird here is traves else doing that is me hat a mans he comes up to him i bums and re's it what trad that traves kelly comes there as to be pulled the way by other members of the team he was informing him that caffein kenned should not be allowed run the starworts universe any more it has to stop it is just bad good luck to traves else and honestly ism ism happy for train else because he was this closes to being the subject of tailor swifts next break up song but then the was say by trick homes now maybe the tailor swift baby boom is going to happen that's ben my production is that traves else is going o propose to tailor swift they're going to got married there n have kids and suddenly a bunch of hemin is see thirty two year old who never got married because girl power are going to realized marriages good then have babies en was gin to save the country maybe that is the way that our country at saved is by traves else and tailor swift having genetically perfect babies make maybe that is the way this actually works of get which brings us to that sandbox this the first me eve ever watched to game or tailor swift is in the is in the skibob where it my item was not directed a tailor swift somehow ice spice a person who name is ice spice made me tailor swift more why well because tailor swift was always the need fight in the bright tailor swift was always the person where you why she here to she understand her football works how seriously to she follow football why we pretending she is big football fan when she is been two games ever maybe and now she is there explaining to ice spice how exactly football works literally explaining to her at the superbly that this one team goes that away and that other team goes the other way an ice spice is is watching all of this as though she is trying to process higher mathematics the known rider at the osiers a few years back here is a yer tailor swift trying to explain to ice by talfootball works sh get an the they go that way and you see that wan an ice oman oh i get it now little bet but at she annually get titan seen her eyes that has no clue at tailor swift is talking about is i tailor swift is teaching her calculus or something it u to that may me tailor swift a little more because tailor swift at least knows halfootball works and ice spice as many people pointed out stole her hair from many id i do not understand what is going on in any case my favorite part of that was that this culminated in the chief's winning the superbly an ice spice celebrating with tailor swift as though she knew what the hell was going on bike bunch of thirteen yer old girls frena pretend that their best friends for ever even tho two of them hate each other ice spice just being super excite what is going not she has an know but she is celebrating crazy with brittle ma homes who by the way has like a little more in vestment in all this a writing ta homes tat she marry o the quarter back beating ma home's been dating the quartics in nice school tailors the the nubby and then ice spice is there for no reason in any case hero whose ice spice in the middle of the scrum why no one knows by ice spice is there that was that's the thing noes happening swell will get's more on this in just one second first pure

to to tom slasher pure yet eligibility for that free bran new say song of five we i get now to the half time shows quicknotes on a half time show first of all envy p is attune as always ottotune saves every single artist who has produced a piece of music since attune became a thing because legitimately none of these people can sing live it is insatiable it is true of everybody who's in the stands by lives more taken the the stands than the us on the field for the half time show you had tailor swift in the hands at just in beburnhants but none of these people without attitude can do a thing usher we've been informed is an artist of some sort by my tame they the're'll big usher fans if ushers sending to this say says to la i i i do not know why but in any case usher comes out and he plays his heads again i do not understand why he is famous because i do not think his hits her good but i usher comes out and he tries to sing points for points for moving around a at washer's a better answer than his a singer and i it can of look this o a hurry as get at one point he took off his shirt for some reason and then non sir dancing around and by dancing i mean spastically moving his body and the means as when you are over the her door asks you to show them where it and that is what it looks another one that i saw was you when you wake up andtere's a spider on you and ta that that is also that is also accurate to points for affect for usher who also rollers gated sows thaw's interesting they will pulled a munch of artists out of er retirement who i again this is not my bag as as america top rap artist i i did not know any of these people but that is because again ism out of touch with the younger generation which is to say the main stream older generation the eight year old in the room full of sixty year old in this country now that they they brought forth will john whose famous hit is turn down for what which involves him screaming at the top of his longs turned down for wat they brought forth a person who is not seal green i who is whose name escapes me i reenoplay turn down for what hair had this is that this was very funny i t they're playing yea they are playing that they cut in real close on will john screaming at the top as longs turn down for what and there is an unfortunate man who got flying up in the background known knows what happened when he came down it was it was awkward emery's jumping around then here he goes he on o that man is dead somebody should check on that i loll john was there to scream into microphone ludicrous showed up and was indeed ludicrous and alsodress ben stiller from dogeballs that was thing that happen and a polish keeps shut up and she cannot sing sat as thousand yet there is doghaball ludicrous he showed up wearing i ding me nowt he is wearing si rollablating uniform that that strong i agio isn't understand a whatever we we maybe our society is too wealthy maybe that is maybe that is what is happened here okra now to the actual politics of the superable first first thing to notice about the superable this year they really tried to keep it ay political they played the call black national anthem before the game they have done this last few years since serge flood died but they played it before the broad cast release and nobody i think saw it i remember ow that the superposes the same kind of thing a they they they played it but they played it far before the game that that it was kind of non controversial and then that allowed the usual suspects to boss about how people did not stand for this s black national anthem with again there shouldn't be a black national anthem here just one national anthem you on a sing a song that that is fine ism not our white need a separate black national anthem at the one event that every one i the country watches together but in any case the run o message of the superbly from all the advertisers was non controversy they are all desperately trying to avoid controversy because what people kind of just want is normality i know the superable were place to get up at that is what people wanted they just wanted a football game that was about football without the politics without the crazy of the past few years and that is what every commercial was about pretty much every commercial wash stone normal ninety ninety six level commercial with zit wit with nothing really provocative about that which is why when there was something provocative in the commercials what really stood out really only two sort of provocative commercials along these lined one was in ad for an organization called he gets us the being jess and it is controversial because this take on jesusus hippy jess now obviously m not a christian ism northrox new but i have read the new testament and virtually all my friends or very religious creations and ism i will points out t this point that even some one me understands that the message of jess is not one of unending tolerance for behavior it is love of human beings but not tolerance for bad behavior but apparently the he gets us campaign is that how jess really really is fine with everybody's behavior which is not the message that i got from the new testament where that is clearly not the actual thing the jess is saying jest as petty hard core in any case so were some of the he gets us add campaign which completely does not get jess but again all tat christian speak to that but ism pretty sure about this one the the ad begins with i people washing each others feet because apparently jess was big into the feet washing be t not because the then wanted to promulgate his belief system just cause he apparently really loved washing washing feet s we've got a cop washing the feet of some some dud you have a cheerleader washing the feet of red haired lady you have a while gey washing ton of not if a medical and then my favorite you have a lady wo sort of a suburban mam washing the feet of a lady outside a family planning clink i unless she is also trying con since that lady not having abortion ism pretty sure jess not hot on the abortion as it turns out i you have poor lady having her feet washed you have native a medical lady in viromentalis having her feet washed you we e immigrant having her feet washed again again muscle having her feet washed i mean not to be feared about this but christiania is in fact a proselytizing religion my understanding is there a certain values christian wishes to promulgate have i of people washing the fee together we have a m a christian priest washing the feet of somebody who appears to be drank which again jess not hot on the boys are girls protein is my understanding in sis jesusus did not teach hate he washed feet i would just to point out that jess did more than wash feet men it again i do not mean to be to christian prologizes her here because it'll leave that to others were actual christian but i that is not all he did and hate of what in fact jess did teach hate of sin an jess when or fan of silly my understanding of the merry magdalen story is that he did not say to her let me wash er feet now go back to being a and ism fine with it pretty sure that is the opposite of the story ye to tat got political old people on the righto the add i am one of the people who did not the add again i i i i believe that christiania and people going back to church is maybe the only thing that can save the country in reality and be water down version of christiania that basicallejust paganism is is something i ism not a bantam it is more that is just one second first have been talking about by he looks mattress for years have had it fer in almost to decadent this point i love it it is the gift that keeps on giving every night when i climb into bed before my little daughter wakes me up at six o'clock in the morning i realize that this mattress is the only thing keeping me alive if you have not already checked out that he

offering twenty five percent off all mattress w hers and a free bedroom bundle for listeners in honor of president's day the bundle includes to freepillows the see sheets and a monstrous protector hat don over to heck sleep dot come flash ben use code helices partner twenty five its the best offer yet sunken last long that relic sleep dot come slash ben use code relics partner twenty five that was political ad number one political number to are h little warmer on and that was the r f had there was it in a super pack for r f k who put out an a f had turingthe superable let me first state this is supersmart this is really really really smart the reason this is really smart is because jo bison for went the honorary superable interview that every in current president gats an the reason he did that is cause he is too old for the johnny can no longer function as we saw last week as will get into in just a moment and dona trump did not take out an ad i do not know why trump did not take out and this republic a perfect time for trump to take out and ad i assume may be the people broad casting the superolds did wan trump to take out and but the fact is that r f we did and this ad is very smart the reason the add is very smart is because again it is seeking normally what the r f case superpack understands that when america basically want is everybody to calm adown that is kind o what most america want at this point all they want is to know that they go to work there sing to take home the vast majority of their money there able t raise their families without being victimized by street crime that there not going to have their boys turned into girls or whatever that my they just want a baseline level of normally that is what most america are looking for at this point and what that is a throat and this ad takes a nineteen sixty ad si obvious i begin ta presidential history i recognize the sad right away this from the nineteen sixty campaign and was an add for john f kenned and to throw back ad and basically it is substitutes r f case face into the anna ism not a fan of the kenned family i think have cat was ha wildly operated president who be blew it wildly on the teabags for example i think that the rest of the kenned family teddy kenned was a likely murderer and also disaster are of the human being r f k r f k junior father was a fairly corrupt guy with ta with the very seems personal life ism not a fan of the kennedthe josh kenned the son of the they the guy who founded the dynasty was a was a noisy sympathize torso again forbear from me to be saying that the kenned families anything special i i do not the kennel's as a ken family but they do have brand recognition as you might say in america politics and r f take glowing on strap at not glomming on to his own father really as much as he is glomming on to the nineteen sixty let us get back to something resembling optimism in normality really smart really a smarted here is what the add sounded and i will narrate through it because there is not a lot of talk its thin as kenned for president and then it has pictures of r f k where the gaff pic pictures used to be and it is a ma shop of all these pictures from sort the kenned pass with r f k pictures and they're using the exact same song and the they had all the songs back in told basement it's his vote independent kenned and what what is the field hat you get from this ad of this advertise and then says knew for president and he looks a button from nineteen sixty this had is really smart because essentially a of k this ad is easily say make america grate again that is really wit the atisbatis to throw back at and thine vote independent right you do not either of the parties vote independent uts not even about anything that are if we is doing it is not again i think that is quite a brilliant add i think that you are actually are going to see better name recognition of r f k because if you leak the poles most america do not really very much either of the two candidate or running for president and just saying vote independent and then slapping at kenned able on there is about as well as you can do with one of these ads and using all of the throw back in imagery here is superstar to our fact junior very very smart ad and running it during the superable the singlemost watched event in america quite politically astute quite politically is do which brings us to jobiten the man who for went the superable again usually the superable it is a piece of propaganda on behalf of the current presidents of the united states because you get these sort of honorary are superable interview and ta and join just for went it use did not do it instead jobiton showed in what he did react to the superable that he is wildly out of touch and also to old for the job after the superable there's ben all these weird stupid conspiracy theories about how the see a and the f b i were on to rig the superabowl that traves keys would proposed to tailor swift and then tailor swifts would get up and in worse jobiton ait is superable none that was ever in to happen is incredibly due and again it it comes from a desire on the part of some people to a some what level of control in politics that is absolutely four clothes by the stupidity of most people in politics jobiton ton line team they then tweeted out o me after the chiefs one in overtime it is a picture of jobiton with the kind of dark brains in mean with the glowing eyes says just we drew it up are obviously is mocking the people led the conspiracy theory this is superonline really online es and this this conspiracy theories something that is been for push by the media and exaggerated by the media as a major thing in america life the fact that his team is tweeting that as suppose out just sort of a warm welcome to the people who won the superable and this is the big take away very online very indoor job notes they nothing to do with it he has no claims going on get's more on this in just one second first he still have that old car out there do not you you are tired of looking at it really tired of your spouse complaining about it i get it you are busy do not have time but i have the simple solution for you you should consider donating that old rusting vehicle two cars for kids you don't cars for kids here's one of that jingle that is now going to be stuck in your head the rest of your life one eight seven seven cars for kids k r as cars for kids i told you here is how works visit the reside at cars for kiddo orkslashmen give them some basic in formation let them take it from there the whole process only takes two minutes cars for kids will setula pick up at a time that is convenient for you what exactly are you waiting for called out or

and you arehelping people out a getting a tax break go check them out right now got nothing to lose go cars for kids dot orgy slashed get that ball rolling and that was betrayed by the fact that just be for the superbly jobidon try to cut a videos he does not do the interview but he does do a video from the white house about shrink elation shrink elation is this phenomenon in which you are spending the same for bacpotatorships there fewer potatoships in the bad the her a hidden form of inflation whit just happen thanks you jobidon now he is trying to claim an this because of corpora greed when in reality it is because he crated an in stationary economy the worst in stationary economy an forty years but what is worse about this particular video is that you say that jobidon looks death in this video is in insult to death he does not look a warmed over corpse the corpse does not look warmed over it is it is quite honestly i as an america whose president is this guy it is really frightening that a person who is clearly no longer alive is the president of the united states this is weekend o burners time here is jobidon video that caught right before the superbly e surreal sundae any ma you lit es on by slacker t a watch in the big game no when fine snake for the game you might have notice on thin port ten pop a small a ships my the way they will cumin cot to charging i yeas much ye can men sales ran to camerover what makes me the most tank is is clearly running off ax e shoo set ut the teleprompter in front of the cameras where you reading have had enough of what that can shrinks rip some companies try where is he look what shrinking the produce little by little an he is like all the way out here can me it is non a teleprompters work jo america public for stuck calling a come t a stop thitsmak her business how many been it he have to do to get this much vidionero goat that is a truly awful video he looks terrible his big pitch going into the game is trike shrink we first of all who is the political wonder kin who told in talk about in elation before the superbly his gas whose fault that is job in the corporations by the way this the one time in america life or everybody count a likes the corporations they the adds most of the time america like corporation suck and they watch the youbolike that was a funny ad from from drunken bonus i enjoyed that tone daff not alive too old and that is the slogan for the twenty twenty four jobidin campaign the poles are getting worse and worse for jobidon on the age issue i mean truly awful for obtains hat we have in the twenty twenty four sections s why the arofcy junior ad is smart well he have is a president who is far too old and terrible at his job ism ore concerned about hin being terrible at i job frankly thing a lot f people are concern about the fact that he is no longer gentians that he is a house plant hiding the water stane that is the democratic pay policy ism more concern about the water stand to be ounce with you but by pulling data most people are very very concerned about the house plant himself see have that on the one hand and the on the other hand you eve donate trump who just keeps saying things stop saying things if you want to what it is it is just eight the world's longest game of hold my beer it is just i in animates well start with obtain bran new be c news ipsospole mighty six per cent of america think jobidons told to serve another from his president eighty six per cent came slave eighty six per cent of america don't agee bout anything you cannot get eighty six per cent of america to agree that elves is dead you can not get eighty six per cent of america to believe the moonlanding is real eighty six per cents of america agree the robin's told and the other fourteen per cents are direct members of jobidon's extended family everyone knows he is tooled for the job every one knows he is no longer gentian every one knows he is falling apart fifty nine per cents of america think both he and donate trump artoold twenty seven per cent think only bisons told the fifty nine per cent who think that both he and trumpet told are basically just saying we soft either of these candidates because if you contrast trump with bison trump is clearly a much more alive human then jobidon i donate trump is fully alive jobidon is in the words the prince less bride mostly dead he means slightly alive but mostly dead and he is cannot need miracle mats to come in in revive him for anything remotely resembling a campaign here sixty two per cent of america think trump is would to serve as president seventy three per cent of democrats and think bidon'stoold to serve only thirty five per cent f re publicans think trump into old to serve ninety one percent of independensthink bid's told ninety one per cent i do not see how you can win reelection under the circumstances frankly the only way would be if say the other candidate would not shut the hell up and just kept saying things that are likely to her his campaign but the democrats are trying to walk past this one because they have no mean is m for gang rid of him according to news reports jo bison is very very upset she is very upset because the special council report from sober her came out and it said bite is certainly guilty of miss handling classfight information but a prosecution f him would be unsuccessful because he is vegetable because he is the centrally a ruling vegetable and we cannot allow any trial of him because he will just per cent himself thus and everon'll gall i regent but that old giant jail brolly knots o do not bother wit the prosecution that is the case the sober had the special council made in short and apparently source is at end s news relive while jo bison says the report is in humane mean i guess you could choose the prosecution and we a that goes for you here as meet the press reporting the person is close to the first slave told me that she was directly involved to the crafting out this under sin e mot men know well it is not always rare the a has that she said among other things that she wanted to speak out in real america mom lupin this was not just an accurate that was in humane and then she also want to make another argument that the first lady did there she said that america benefit from each of the present actin one years is experience is experience is what is allowed him to get things done or cay were benefiting from each of his eighty one ears h woman we could get now his record and we will in just a moment can but democrats our trying to come up with whatever angle they can hers what they are saying is that the special council is bad now oh how every argument flips the moment it is your side when he was sober mole and donate trump was saying the special council investigation is a job can its to which husband it is terrible an its politically motivated and there's a get state that is out to get me then the anti prestige that is in patriotic that is the president of the united states threatening demo crop threatening the buraracy you cannot do that that is terrible o there are hearts to flutter oh there are hands a waving oh there i sweat of breaking out on brows across the media landscape but jo bids an tired teem is out their senators members of h press the robot her he is e vow his out to get

i as we will seen a second you don't you could do you could release the transcript and we con see if that is true or not h does one release the transcript of any of the interview robot her ah jobidon in any case here is criscoons what that to could have been about is who understands that our alliances keep us safer jo bison who is led fifty countries to come to the defend of you crane were donate trump who alarmingly last night bragged about a story were he claims he threatened a dato allied to throw them to the russia wolves if they did not pay up dato is not a protection racket but is a security alines the substance the difference jo bison and donate trump and most elected officials make small gaffs just the ones you justsioed that is not what matters we are in a fight for the soul of our nation and the idea that somehow jo bison forgot the date of his sons death is offensive and appalling and what you should be focused on in by view what that whole shit of focus thought what are nation she o way boule trump is undermining rule of law democracy and our safety is a nation i get whatever the it is insulting how dare the special counts horde then madam chef he biggest political hack of our generation madam chef who literally went into the green room an amisendy seeansenan for three years claiming that just around the corner was a bombshell that would link donate trump to ladies paten slush fun that garbage human adamsheff he is out there now saying that her is a political hack oh pot calling settle black here but her clinger told if you do not remember pesectictlyar facts o things that happen years ago it to in goon you in do not try to rein that we try place and there is to thing have the unusual about a ducsishon which people a recalled my cops to years ago but to to strapklage from tho and make a political tact that that is shut hackery by mister her wow hackery says the world's largest hackles she hers the question if it is hackery by her then what they could do the firstvalt ism with her but nanycate if it is hackery by robot hurry not that could do thy cold releasolve the transcript they could do that here is that joint's layer trying that i can rely s hae the scripts i wonder why i wonder why you will not release the tape to interviews the robber her maybe it is because jobidon sounds senile in them that would be the ratio ow but what your talking about and letters you real make a down there are in the transcript that you have of the congregation over the eighth and the not yes i going get my recollections but yet soar transcripts on as you heard of einsanps in the pressbeatin room say couther discussions under way because it is a classify document not what could or whether will be or when released i cannot at anything to that to day you favor releasing them welt really a decision that have to take elision in the governments a classify locum he council on the presents personal council right would you recommend that ten the made public if they in see back up your personal mecca gan there is a possess under way ism not a specialist in that process an i really have to the church to those who have to work through those issues to that they do not want those transcripts mad public be cause what its going to show us that jobidon is no longer sentient the blowback by the way here is somewhat by partisan a huge for sundenge of democrats also think that jobidon does not have the mental acuity to be president any more killer canton can always be counts not to shive every other democrat in the back killer canton is a walking shive that is what she is ha human being here she was saying that jobidon's age is a legitimate issue perhaps the reason that killer canton is saying that is because killer canton she is currently hold this hilleclent now holder canton it is currently seventy six she is a spring chicken by our modern standards of the presidency and maybe she is thinking while if chow steps down maybe it is me maybe hope never dies in misery land here she was go in after job nips age the thing the extractor and all of that the thing that we keep seeing in pal after pal after pal is concern about yens at well stop what should he do on the see is it is a matter of sort of leg under scoring his boundless energy or who should he embrace his ain't decades on earth in the and the great wisdom he is games thru i mean to ago o above by me not he know i talk to people the wight house all the time and he know they know it is an issue but as i to say look it is a legitimate issue it is a legitimate issue for tromp with only three years younger right its an issue once you say that then you have to also talk about what is a take in the election and ism for job bison for reelection on the merits because i think he is tons really a job is president gate she is not ism bob costs right before the game sports caster he was yo have made it is time for job go away perhaps perhaps the time has come o the publicans and fox knew and all the tributaries that come off o that will overstate it turn blind on o the fact that tromp who has always been an unprincipled and reprehensible person is now a ranting lunatic who has men e a i is not true and when it comes to bison this is the truth that no one until very recently wants to say out loud but my friends will tell you give been saying it for four years this is emperor's new close stump job don should have run on a firm promise that he would be one term president the only reason he is president is that he is not donate trump then the em ta up om sorted through those people if bygones hubris is such that he does understand the best interest of his party and more important his country that he has to be shown the door her gat costs is not wrong on what a democrats who feel the same way about this bit years the problem there is no wat gan believe join is a stubborn old codger no one who trains the residence he wants to leave it ever under any circumstances in that that is just the reality of the ego involved here which is why bisons captain coacher much wanders he is ever n wet ever under any circumstances r is wish landed how do you respond to democrats yo say they want o tee a change at the top of the ticket ism in the process of doing it right now and and demonstrating that the present its a tomplishment have really been second to not and job bines going to get up every day the wanting job baton his never that a do is count on this he has never ever got a quit because that is not what he is not his in tire life not withstanding the fact that by the way he lost another shouter o main this life an he got up and he went to work and that mister let difficulty with this other sin and he got u and he went to work and he is get to him doing that in other words he are not going nowhere which pounds democrats in a he love trouble if the republicans cannot step on their own leaps well good luck with that will get t that moment all right folks inter attention from major announcement mark your calenders it is the epic return of back stage after almost a year way filming the pen dragon cycle jerry boring his back joined by mount walls michael mole's andirons andreclavan any donas to morrow seven am eastern six opium central is we go behind the scenes in beyond the headlines is lot's over an i cone one i is a minute watch the so live exclusively on daily wire plus tuesday night at seven am eastern at six him central ire not going to want to misfit o cam meanwhile dona trump's reelects would be a foregone conclusion here if he could get out this own way and that is the real question of the selection cycle jobidon cannot the feet his his own inabilities he cannot in he is physically limited he is mentally limited his capacity is limited he he really has a luncheon boundaries that been set by reality for him and is own policies will gets o momentarily disaster area that are significantly increasing the likelihood of world worth there across the world mainly through his cowardice and in action dona trump has one factor under his control that jobidon dis not and that is the capacity to shut his face it is important to shut your face when you'en't presidential election what you do not say is just as important is what you do say you being on to v more does not mean the iron win more votes dona trump dis ninety his profile this point dona trump needs every one to be focused in on the fact that jobidin is a terrible president who is no longer competent t told his office and that his back up is coma derris who is the world's worst lives president also not competent to hold her office but for different reasons that is what dona trump needs the selection be a refer rat fronton to what what he does not need to do is make big booboos that alow the media to try to switch the narrative away that there is can of the usual trumping nonsense ill a any of that is going to effect i the trumpyan nonsense would be stuff dona trump riffing about tailor swift before the before the big game he he body tweet saying i signed and was responsible for the music modernization act for tailor swift and many other artists joining din do anything for tailor and never will there is no way she could indorse cooked jobidon the worst and most cup president in the history of our country and be disloyal to the man who made her much money besides that i her boy free traves eventhough he may be a liberal and probably cannot stand me it'll gale is due stofinar who cares an it is on the due get by the way she is totallygan indorse bison we we all know this right and is traves i well get that again in a past world now would care because who cares what a tighten for the caducity chiefs and a pop singer have to say about politics and in reality outlines can move that many votes is it a due thing does at yet silly it is silly is that cganhaviny back on the election no that was on conniving impact but what dona trump says about policy that does alow for lines of attack to open against him that he does not need open dona trump was giving speech and he's talking about dato dona trump's position on nates that dato is important apparently thief's the the intelligent version of dona from position on patois that dato is quite important in order to check foreign actors we have interest adversarial to those of the united stay ts and the european union which is largely what comprises dato and yes dato of course is in fact a tool to counter balance russia a russia in the balking in you crane and other places and for all of the foolish talk about how russet is not an expansionist power i urge every one to pick up a look any book about the history of russia the history of russia is literally a history of expansionism the kingdom o musky was a very small kingdom and the i was a very large kingdom and they got even larger undo the soviet union and they got a little smaller after he fall of movie union and tot's got n a little larger in of ladder potent the idea that russia is not in expansionist power he is not correct that is just not true but in any case deal trump could say listen dato important we it which is why we want every one to pay up we do not wish to pay the large share of the burden tornado we should play r proportional share for ado and you guise who are in euros you should see how vital this is we rebuilt your economy with the martial plan eighty years ago we have rebuilt your economies to the point where you got can have the giant social welfare states where half your population is dependent on the government you can certainly afford a little but more for ado and you should i think that is the argument that dona trump is making here o badly articulated deal trump is making the argument here that if dato does not pay up the united states will not that is called leverage o case using leverage is not the end of the world saying out loud things we will not defend our dato partners if they do not pay up is not exactly in inducement for vladmrputent to stop his aggression precisely here is that here's dona true over the pecan on of the president of ta big country stood up said well serif we do not pay and were neck by russia will you protect us is id you did not pay you delinquent you said yes let us say that happen no i would not protect you in fact i would encourage them to do whatever the held they wind o ka he is obviously queasy joking here that is not aliform policy decisions get made but does it matter when presidential candidates as i would encourage them to attack you if you do not actually pay n it against this tonal true speaking in hyperblicaus that is the language he speaks that is the reality hat you can telloeny's joking when he is not this a store by with it for sure never happen no major country got up and said dona trump if we do not par fair share regnal let the ruffians in made us that is ta conversation than never happen in the same way that dona trump routinely retells conversations the other political candidate who come to him crying for his support which is not a reality none of that happens tonal true exaggerates for affect this in exaggeration for a fact but when your presidential candidate opening the door up to critique is not exactly your smart strategy the white house of course it jumps it directly on that with both feet suggesting that this was incredibly dangerous how could he possibly say the sorts off now the normal counters this is who did not invade you crane will dona trump was president would be ladder pouted is all the talk about dona trump being bad tornado they are topless violations of jatos presumed reach or threat a tuna's presumed reach on personal trump than the wounder drobitin cause your bins weakling but dato put out a statement dato secretary general yon stoldemberg shad dada remains ready and able to defend all allies ache suggestion that allies will out defend each other under mines all of our security including that of the you us and puts america in european soldiers an increased risks i expect the regardless of wins the presidential election the you airman a strong and committed dato ally and then leaders in german in poland also swiftly criticized dona trump's comments the you understand where they're coming from meant the the reality is that if you are an eastern european country ore country in the tactics and the president of the united states you do not pay up and they might invade you and your tongbolic logia or lithuania or a estonia an these places have gey pes tat are my due to compared to the get p of the united states mean the gey p of pole is six hundred and eighty billion dollars did yo the the annual budget of the united states not the gey be the annual budget is ten times that amount let us say that you are pole and you are curtly spending three going nine percent of your gey p into military rolls including twice nations current supermen target for fermata you you have to stay those consent a certain percentage of your money on your military budget in order to fulfil your jury underneath what is a your pole and what you here from the presidents of the united states is that a collect an attack on the collective that is dato will be accepted by the united states long as it is loft in their paying say one point eight per cent or something if your pole is that make you saying winners that make you upset say an i understand tackle dona trumpet saying here and what he is actually saying is he is trying to leverage everybody in spending what they should be spending on their own defend spending but putting out that signal publicly is not the same thing is doing it privately because of course lander patent and company are listening and they sends any sort of weakness as he chance for aggression that opens dona jump up to critic that he does not need they does not see that it is it is useless it is not useful to his campaign to do that sort of thing other things the are not useful to dona trumps campaign lashing out an nickel whale's husband why why is this a thing nickel valley is not important in this race nickel valley is not going to win any more primaries nick hale was over after new samphire mean to be frank who is over before new samphire this force was over after i i said after i it was over it re mains over why dona trump is spending his mental energy going after nickel hale and then going after nickel whale's his ben by proxy is this the restuff that scan attract the suburban women that you need in order to win a general election i do not thing and course it is not just about what he says it is about the fact that he opens the door this is trump is a personality one of the benefit of donaltrump is he does not give asleep right that is his big thing i do not give a bleep the problem is when you have the world's biggest target on your back which donaltrump does not giving a leap makes it harder for you to get done what you need to get done ism not saying he should care what people things ism saying that he should care about strategic thinking said he is more likely to win for example if that the on qua deep state has it is i on you you should not do is refuse to turn over boxes of document to morrow it'll go after they request them just turn them over what is the point of anything if that all you have to do is just point at the elderly tottering senile old man on the other side and win election whyyur being an nice whale's husband and allowing a spate headlines ben nickhaly his why just what world's the logic here if you want from to win ism asking this question because this is totally under trumps control the big prom for cordon many of his probing are not under his own control for dona trump i know he wants to be the limelight i know he likes the rallies i know he is a comedian i get the jokes also what is the strichegically what why would this be helpful forget about whether is can win or not is this helpful here he whats going after nickel whale's husband the greatest president in my lifetimes she said i well never hun against him then she comes over to seat mar lava sir will never run against you she brewer husband where is a husband o hes away he is a we what happen to a husband what happened tor husband where is he he is on a a what he is actually implying right there what he is actually implying is than e halescheeting on her husband that is be clear about what he is implying tar because that is what he is doing there beenthese rumors long standing with aka davits and all the sort of stuff where is nickehaley's husband he is an active duty member of the america military he is over sees right now how is that helpful again just forget about the morality of what he saying which i do not how is that helpful especially because again jobidon is a terrible president why not focus on jobidon forget bannikehaly focus in on jobidon the reality is the jobiden's weakness is leading to a larger chance of a larger scale war breaking out for example in the middle east right now there several things happening one of the things that is happening is that apparently according to several just offense officials this be open source intelligence wonder reporting preparations are now underway for a total or partial withdrawal a you using polished forces from eastern syria and a rock do to pressure from mean back groups including catch hasbela an now you can make the case we should not have out outlet us over there but if you ware going to withdraw people you do not do it in the face of ranee an terror if you wan to are the case that independently we do not need people over there and it is waste of time in waste of resources make that case but do not let crane an terror groups corn all drive you out of the region what ore they do after that they d clear victory what re they do after that they grafter the next easiest target whether that souses or its rales or america for an other basis around the region showing your back is the worst thing you can do in at least and the by demonstrations doing it over and over and over again there doing with regard to israel right now jobidon he believes that he can only win election if he panders to terror supporters in michigan that what he believes and that's why he is deploying top bison aids two michigan to do meetings in dearborn to rip on the is rallies who are in america ally you knows non america all famous not an america ally i wills last chat according to the times of israel yous deputy national security is or john finer made comments thirsty during a visit to the city of dearborn in which the top white house official said he did not have quote any confidence in the corns israel government now out just to point out this point the turn is real government is not just run by benjamin into nah who is ben made the bugaboo and the enemy of the pass benny wants is the prime opposition the person who in every poll if an electionrehalted y would be primenincter of israel backsaw is in the coalition right now worthy purposes of the war and yet the goal here is to try to convince i guess michigan prokomasnec that the bide ad ministration is trying to drain a line between comas and the israel government and then he apparently called some unnamed is rely officials quit abhorrent and said the administration should hae taken a stronger stand against those who compared quote residents of casino animals now that is a we the person he istagmat there is loaf goons who the defenceminister of israel who compared members of a mamas to animals and guess what they are animals if you are a member of mamas and you rape women and you kill babies you are an animal but volant was pisilytogmakhmas not every palistinian whose living or the meanwhile hoiden again an attempt to buy michigan support the apparently told prime minister benjamin into now one sundae that israel should not go ahead with the military operation in the gasabortown of raft without incredible plan to protect civilians now what exactly that means he first full israel has been attempting to protect civilians this entire time because f israel which has complete air superiority for t one thousandth time wish to kill two million palistinians in the gasastrip they certainly have the aerial kept ability to do that but they are not doing that in fact there is really soldiers who know ware going literally house to house and more to dor in e most densely populated areas of some the most densely populated places on planted earth is to not kill civilians in fact i mowthan israel soldier on fridge night who literally had his buy gun down right in front of him as he was going into an apartment complex in gaze last week we why are they been on the ground there the reason is to preserve civilian life not only that the reason the on the ground is to save the hostages was hoiden was apparently telling israel mas to go into raft which again is the only major strong hold comas as left theyapparently have four battalions in raft in were for israel to finish off that this basically jordan saying to the america military during told or to got once to get around berlin to stop there jo stop right around berlin no that is not the idea every comasofficial is now in raft everyone knows this this is clearly true not only that all the hostages iron raft miraculously we found out last night during the suberbol israel actually rescued two hostages alive in gas last night which is an amazing miraculous story yo have right now not a hundred hostages who are being kept we are nominerdad nobody knows him aneroid but israel actually rescued two hostages alive in raft well the be administration was telling him not to go in according tote pastry journal the rally military said money the rescue of forzando simony madman and leis her was a complicated operation performed under fire in the hart of raft a city an southern gaze were were palistinians are seeking refuge from the conflict between israel and comas i roughly today local time milt my forces an a police swatted broke into a house in lava and engaged in a gun fight with commas militant while shielding the hostages with their own bodies before evacuating them to secure location is really air striking gosh kill the hundred sixty for people overnight including dozens in raft of course those targeted strikes were at military members of a comas who hide behind civilians and having talked again s peoplewho are serving in gaze right now the embedding is insane the line between civilian and military in gaze between civilian and terrace and goa is incredibly thin huge percentages of civil civilian households in gaze contain weapon my huge percentages our hiding terror tunnels not just them by the way according to the pastry journal hidden deep below the headquarters of vet an eight agency for palistinians in goa city is a comas complex with roes of computer servers that israel arm forces say served as an important communication center and it telligenctob for comas the compound is directly below the united nations relieving works agency buildings in gaze city and they are running on electricity drawn from the u n soever people talk about the vaunted u n remember the u n our w a is cams they're indistinguishable in the gaze trip and meanwhile bison trying to tell these rallies not to on an rescue their own people which is amazing benjamin at the ago for his part he says listen we are not going to stop here commands eliminated when you destroy their fighting formations here he was on sundae you've defined victory said the war will not went tell harass is completely eliminated how are you getting know whin that is how do you known homes is completely eliminated when you eliminate the organize fighting formation and is the sad we takin eighteen out of their twenty four tersbetalians out of commission your mopping up the remain individual terse and when you read release the hostages of course and insure the comas that the gazes no longer thread to is you do not have to kill every last terry you did not have to kill every last sis terse but you made sure that that uses was finish is a military force you have to dismandal harass a military a military force at controls territory we are well in within reach and we should not stop nay meanwhile the bi administration trying to stop israel of fatally finishing the job with comas which of course leads to more violence in the region if israel would stop because comas would walk out hold up a mas flag say that they won even though they have completely devastated gaze and every ounce blood is on comas which started this war and which has maintained this war and then it has been on the north would polestar proving further and thing to kill more is rallies knowing that jobidon is a weakling and its not just in the madeleast it is also with regard u crane let us be clear at this point jobidon's failure to do fine mission in e crane has led tweak passing the senate and in the house no one knows what the off ramp is because hoiden has not actually spelled out what he thinks the offramp is right here was become very clear is that ladder pouted is basically banking on the west just retreating in you crane flanker pouted in that interviewtockok arson you people are saying that he offered nonfarm no he really did not his offal was no america support for u crane ever again which you crane is not going to agree to quelscan provide the support he has not made clear his territorial demands either and in that interview where he spells out all of russia history from his vantage point he says you crane literally does not exist and that the regime needs to be quoting duo de notified which means that ladder putter's goals have really not change his goals are not don was and crime his goals are reeve still and he is banking on the west basically saying okay find u no retired whatever ora what that would require for job to make the argument is not just alarmism it would be in actual explanation of what is going on in u crane that u crane yes there is corruption yes certainly a percentage of money that goes you crane will probably end up in the wrong hands because that happens with pretty much every country that we give foreign aid to this on o the problems of foreign aid there is some countries the very transparent about there some hundreds that really are not you crane happens o be a place of the lot of eruption sure their probes of vlodimers lens is leader lodgers lens has crack down on the opposition there is no question the h has done that hes id that actually even prior to the twenty twenty two invasion by russia with all of that sad et is not in america direct interest to have russia control reeve you crane and put that you cranial border to erectly on the borders of dato threatening places hungary in poland that is not in america interest and providing some additional aid which amounts to a drop in the bucket for america compared to the generalized budget of the america budgerana that i that is a well worth while but he has to make that cases normal that case he is simply declaring that everyone who opposes him is badly motivate n everybody who opposes him wants russia whin the war and wants them to take leave en all the rest which is not helpful in any way shaper form plus he has never suggestive what he thinks the end of this war looks if he came out to marks to lis en we almost the end this warlocks but the endow this war looks his russia essentially retaining the non bass and retaining crime and the united states and the europeans providing security guarantees without them joining ado do you crane and that is for the end of the sing looks and until ladder cutin is going to accept that this war continues you make pretty clear exactly what claimer queen's aims are it is the vagary of western policy that is a loud space for claimer pouted to create out about whether the west even wants to end the war at all when in realities seems less may be the only party that wants to end the war at this point may belongs lens but the west more broadly t e u and the united states as well providing first of all slow walk the aid so crane in the very first place and then after slow walking the aid he failed to actually a low for an offal in fact he fostering non offal and now he is feeling to make clear what exactly the mission is and the very clear reality is that there could be a point where you crane does in fact collapse again because russia will just keep doing this and then one of the things people do not understand about the assign mines at with regard to war is that additional casualties are not a disincentive for the russia emotional casualties are proof of the heroism of the runs in people its goes all the way back too the napoleanic era this is not just the world wore to era for the ruffians all of this radically increases all of the possibilities of serious war not just in you crane not just in the gosh strip not just in the north of israel but also china and titan china looks to titan right now they said themselves who is gan a stop us here's l who is on ta stop us the america people do not have the will power to even spend the money on you crane jobidon seems to want a stop israel from crushing a terror group we are much more powerful than either rush or homos if we grab titan who is on a do leap here's my who is on a stop us if we grab if we blockaded if we blockaded and we get access to their technology and we spirit our military radically who exactly is going to taboo jobiton has not demonstrated the courage of his supposed commitments it is a real problem and meanwhile they're people w are making arguments that i think are a really poorly poorly articulated about exactly how america military policy should actually be pursuit one of those people in fortunately sender mark ruby why general center of my homestate over the we ken he say that we cannot give any foreign age until we salve america proving o first of all let us just be clear about us america is currently spending seven trillion dollars a year seven shrilled it is certainly in america interest to spend forenamed money rather than s any america soldiers to places to insure the freedom of the seas for example having other people doing our fighting is a lot better the notes having to actually expend blood an treasure in order to do things beyond thank what is happening at the southern bordrght now is not a question of money he says that we have to spend the money on the border before we spend money on for in aid first of all congress has never seems to have a proper spending anything including senator ruby who is voted for a lot of budgets that he been very very very large but when sender ruby says that behave to spend the money on the word not anywhere else can we be clear on something the promise at the border not about expenditure the promise the border are about join n one to keep the border open have talked to the head of the border of patrol union he says this not about staffing about pay this about misterrection of currently located resources an i do not think that the argument that radio here is making is is sustainable as a matter of america form policy i want to get the border in a second but this to clarify something are you intupport of biggin you crane i think if we secure our own border here in the uni takes have said that we should d we should help o crane look have the money that is going to you can is not going to crane it is the by back our own weapons that we gave them to restock our own shelf at opus its hi want is included there as well my problem is this before we do these things we have to make america and america o priority again e ism extraordinarily in favor of making america count what the prior again i just do not think that foreign policies just connected from america priorities i only it is good when china takes over titan i only it is good when russia shots off the supply of of shipping in the black see or when it takes over one o the chief grain producers in the world or when threatens directly dato borders i only it is good when commons along with deraign sponsors is attacking an america ally and other cranial proxies are attacking shipping in the resounding any of that is good or useful to to can hove make this hard divide between america domestic policy that helps america an america foreign policy which is just what us galevancing around and spending money interest that does not make sense that is not what america policy is for america policy is to forward america interest we can argue about what the certain policies ford america interests but the idea that any sort of foreign policy expenditure or any sort of foreign policy that is hawkish is somehow a betrayal of america interest is bizardome it is pacifistic and counts a to most of america modern history in a globalized world the world is a pretty small place these days already coming out will jump into the border problems if

back on one o the early episodes of our radio show i had my from vertomak groaner come on vertu was this amazing cook shut coo cook in nineteen seventy vibration cooking that is still in print to day and vertu had the story that she would tell sometimes that back when her book was published she was interviewed on the to day show by barber waters or on the show back those and i the way vested told the story she is on ti v making fry chicken for barber waters and it some point barber waters less her haw he tell the chickens done and vertu says you can all by the sound and in vermis telling miss waters gives her the skeptical gold i give me a break and cuts to commercial vertu said that was always people's reaction they say you are crazy vertu that is not yet tit is kept you do not tell me some real was it fifteen minutes twenty minutes or whatever an i seyofve got a listen to the sound of the greece listen to the music on we years veto make claim that yo can tell if a chickens done purely by the sound and to prove the point you agreed to come on to our radio show to conduct this little readier experiment where my corkers and i fry ta chicken and we recorded it at four different stages a frying and then shuffle the order of the recordings a revert the demonstrate once far all was it true can somebody tell of a chickens cooked but that any visual clues without smell and here is me playing the four recordings for vertu and her trying to pick out which one is the chicken when it is finished let us roll and i listeners at home can play along with us here let us roll the first little sample sound i say ye i say that sometime the middle o k but the definitely is not towards the end you sad yet i it is it is in the middle gone toward thianisin the three fourth i let us let us here a let us here sound number two please number to is toward dial too o can number three i we beginning for the beginning that is more towards the beginning and number four danger organ o ken when all of little balls are forming on the bottom the little nice crusty now avert if you would have to hazard to guess us to which one would be the very last one as still sis one or two that is toward dial the answer is number too her to make him reasonably cause but she was not wholly certain tell me if a chicken is done only by sound turn out to be harder than she thought er to be yes it was hard you have to see it d what i mean ye oh it is it is it is minutes serious she of h labor and tense if thing you got a stay on it you just cannot be talking on the phone and watch an ten you got to stay on that chicken bias asking your daughters to day and they were saying how they can also a tell of rice is done by the sound oh yet that is true ye i taught them that those are the kind of family values are taught my children listen to the sound of the chicken me listen to the sound of the rice etymon died for years ago si have to say got to me a little listening to this next pit on the interview when she talks about her daughters and ow happier made her to hear when they said about her you talk to both of them i talk to both of them they were both really funny one of them said everything that she cooks is golden brown and perfect perfect perfect who said that that was i believe it was shandy really but she said but just because where her daughters that does not men that she tells us the real recipes we ask her for the recipes and she tells us recipes o them when we cook them they are not the same and not tat e holding back on a grade hat's it's the a quite true but i just tell them but then they have that the find out to rest for themselves thegn it is i i ta as as is many things parent i say i put a little ginger i i noon know than they have to tiger out how much a little ginger is the that is what to have to do fidiguss really is ever family is culture and his tradition it is a provision is art to day and our show for thanksgiving we can we but together a show made of stories we have done over the years about for and every one of these stories somebody heads out on a quest either figure something out old it do something very differently with food that most of us to dry easy chico its this america life am our glass they with us that one dead ring er it is aver years back one of our producers bent balloon set out on a mission much more eccentric and labor intensive the figuring out if a chicken is done by listening to the sound here he is i first heard about this whole thing in an email it came from a listener a woman name family cancer reworks in the food industry and the letter family wrote was about a story she would heard from a farmer the farmer who told her this is apparently a person of some standing in the pork industry admittedly i do not know the first thing about the pork industry but he is in charge of a pork producing operation that span several states the story he told family went something this a while ago he was visiting a pork processing plant noclehoma he is walking through it with a friend a guy who managed the planactually and at some point he saw boxes stacked on the floor labeled artificial calamari he stood there wondering for a second and then he asked his friend what is artificial calamari bung his friend replied it is hog reclaim reclaim that would be sliced into rings deep fried and boom there he have it hoke if i can let me just narrate for you what this would mean it would mean that in restaurants everywhere write this second people our squeezing lemon wedges over crispy golden rings and dipping the rings into marinara saw and they are eating of reclaim now they are sewing satisfied and deeply clueless it is pay back it is pay back for u blissful ignorance about where our food comes from and how it gets to us it is amazing and it is but it also seems a could not possibly be true i called up the farmer the talk to him personally i wanted to hear at first hand and the farmer confirm the story be entire thing the boxes the bung but when i asked him to go on the record to tape an interview and give his name here on the radio he very politely declined which seems suspicious right when i asked him why he said he would spoken with his girl friend about it and she suggested that he should think about the words that he wanted to come up when somebody goggled his am this was all fine though because he referred me to the real expert the guy who gave him the tour of the hog processing plan and that guy he agreed to talk oh y is this ran ye ye this is in me meet processing plant manager presently residing in mountain view misery where he runs an organic beef processing plant there called beyond organic if the story really were true ran would have been the guy who explained to the farmer what was in those boxes the not o er can abbot and and there ala bat gat o eat you lot may be ye a bin a wait per e t be an ta you to it what not ye bat not a at e the an an in a an er tan ta a to about a big made withal a a a b but but the specifically the labels that said a imitation calamari but where where did you personally see the limit ho homer they la a a ever ti tat able bay that ta ball to the the people ta to me e the people a wort rat e peer oh the people that that you work for told you that it was used for imitation alumni it and is there any possibility that you think that the when they were explaining this to you that that they were on o having you on a little bit haven me o ye a o machete ye a well i what a that but o be paper ben tat y to deerfly bared woke just to give a little better picture a port bung and bung is the actual industry term for it is long and floppy and ugly at one end it widens out into this more bullish shape a pink wrinkly pair that is the rectum at the other end at narrows into a soft pinkish white too i know it sounds grows but also consider we are a nation that yours more than a billion pounds of sausage every year billion with a bee maybe you liver worst tor capitol or summer sausage with a natural casing then you me have eaten bung stuff dried bung a lot of boots and italic sausages are stuffed in in testing if you eat those regularly you pretty much live up the street from bung why does the idea of a fried ring of bung just feel grocer partly it is the visual right when you see that little ring of calamari you do not want a picture it in the context of a picks behind then there are all the people who do not eat pork period down said there is also another reason tat beg t a be for bung probably and people bout ye a a u be mama at he bung that y a yo away e but the big question the question you have been thinking about since we got on this topic have you or i eaten imitation calamari bung dressed up is a food well born did not know he said his plan exported a lot of their big to aria but he just did not know much about whatever happened after left the door he could only speculate anything he said would be a wild guess the whole i turn to people who would know is pork bung being falsely petaled as calamari i called to youastie the you ester is food inspection service issued the following statement to me products we inspect including those derived from pork must be accurately labeled and cannot purport to be a product of another species it is ta against the rules but people break the rules a recent study of sea food by a group called ocean used d an testing and found that all across the country fish is regularly being labeled as other species restaurants and engross restores scalar sold is white tuna post rockfish being fraudulently sold was snapper in my ami more than thirty per cent of fish was being sold as something it was not and new york the number was thirty nine per cent boson forty eight per cent was angels a youready fifty five per cent fifty i that means if you order fishing away you are most likely eating a species you did not order in other words seafood substitution is ramen in this country and depending on where you live what i can tell you can get cleaned hog bung for about half the price of clean squid there would be money at it if you could pull off the suit as best as i can tell were you to do this you would not be caught a lawyer whose familiar with this area law an regulation told me once bung leaves the plant there is a variety of agencies and entities that would be in play u tie f tie stand and local government but ultimately he said the regulation we have is not designed to catch in o fence this it is aim mostly at sanitation and food safety bottom line the lawyer said if somebody wanted to do it chances are they would get away with it is some one out there doing this well for weeks i look for an answer the bestial says they have never heard of any one trying to pass pork bung as squid or any other species i contacted the national restaurant association the national pork producers council the national pork board a squid fisherman's association cisco and whether big food in restaurant supply companies it hog what a bung but hog rectal only gat that is the executive director of the californium selfish producers association but the answer was pretty much always the same nobody had heard of it but almost to a person they added that that does not mean it is not happening somewhere on weeks set a lot of the bung from his plant got exported my next called was to the us meat export federation which confirm that quote the main destinations for pork bungs are china hong long japan titan care and the philippines they are mainly used for processing but we are aware of some uses in soups and certain extras we are not aware of them being used as a substitute for calamari but it is not impossible on quote over the past few weeks have called aspen food suppliers people who live in work in and eat in those countries i talked to a woman named caring rang whose written in overarching compendium of aunt quazines have take to academics at any you and have offered and u c and hazard have reached to chefs who know sent food the answer again always similar never heard of it but it is possible partly because bung does not have such a complicated reputation in aria here it has to be some kind of secret ingredient a does here on the other hand though people pointed out that in care in japan you cannot get more than a few hours from the ocean quit is cheap and it is readily available you would only eat a substitute if you wanted the substitute generally people said if the switch was happening somewhere they would guess china eventually i found my way to this guy who i was really excited about some one who i thought might have my answer he was get this an anthropologist who lived and worked in china for forty years were he studied food and specifically meat when i talked to him though he made two points point one my question about this happening in aria was racist even just asking the question was basis because it plays on ignorant stereo types about other cultures eating things that we perceive his weird point too was that on meek my got from the pig plant run was pulling my leg and he was getting away with it because i was a humans he told me more than once that i should quote find something worth while to do with myself when we ended our conversation he told me that he was refusing to even dignify what i was doing by appearing on the radio or by letting me use his name look to respond to his points one by one first and my resist against agent well ism half chines my mom's chines any one have had the occasional issue with my mother but this has not been one of them we grew up eating chicken feet and fish eyes and i think it is possible to raise the question of who eats what without being racist his second point though that on meek was pulling my leg i mean the guy was still an expert on meet in china i called ran back a this me come quite on did i told him the whole thing about the anthropologist about what he said i guess i mean the only thing i would ask you is is a a you messing with me now i mean that wit wat ma to to me o what what the hail we fay hat be hob in for ye then that o e blame passion wet get that but in your in your hard hearts you believe it y man i mean i may i get a that men very thing it it is not bay with you an when that i yo go on off bat leg you having o a i mean you thank about at how for it want toter half is a specially big one that n a make ever any a a the one i work that you bring the pig than you ta an you tick am and the blood go of and to the top and a on town in it back you the dow there with that a take you and the thank r fun you and i that brit the blood from the blood blame and i that that i man t that the won they ta the pantry if they that the plan the bay the hard no only than away by the tam e to that tan in the got and yo b i man you can be an at the to if you you a it you do work in a to sting built you do not mot i contact of the plant round worked at where this happen and for what it is worth they backed i up they said the sales team had heard of people eating pork bung his imitation calamari though they had not witness at firs hand or heard it directly from a customer it was all here say at the end of all this i still had no proof that any one was passing off bung is squid and i realized i had not asked the more basic question here could bung do it could i pass his calamari and that question led me to a name eddy in and he land has eaten a lot of bung at least a hundred times he said probably more and he has a extreme food blue called deep bend dining and an online tevisho called comics kitchen i could doubly feet you resemblance texture word oh really yet ye duly om build bit a tort of this what of a rubbery texture sort of a columbary but you would really have you get rid of that n you yo we the this tow eleven over from the t be the bun somehow i had not figure that the bung once it was scrubbed and rite and claim with seem that it would still taste o you a you up but we have to you a mad your major branching a ha winy ha ma ma at bin ye ha a is is i trying to reach that those flavors after there ya me tat to waver a ben ya martian tat had for o quite a while o a lifetime yo aha ha he thought it would not be easy but he thought it could be done and there was only one way to tell if he was right took cook up some bung and eat it and if the taste was overwhelming and the texture was all wrong will then it'd have my answer and at this point it'll be frank i started to route for the bung i realize that this is not a story about fraud it is not a bait an switch story it is a story about possibility it is classic rags to riches it is about whether a cut of meat perhaps the lowliest most meliorable cut of meat in america might somehow and at least one place on the planet be dipped in the redemptive oils of the great culinary equalizer that is the deep friar and it might emerge transformed no longer an outcast but instead hair come clean shaven and a suite tie it might walk reborn on to a table through sheer force of resemblance it might be love it is history years of drudgery and hardship doing the bodies least glamorous job all washed awash no this is not the story of a conman burned made off it is pretty woman this is whether goodwill hunting finds his way out of south it is whether charge on that very last chocolate bar really can get a golden ticket to do all this to try it i called my little sister lore she is a shaft trained abroad at the cordonbleeau worked at miscall start restaurants she is at kannishafft soon we were standing in front of a belly case and i soft know why i feel hesitant about saying this because i do not think its races it was in chiton a to credit loin it looks it looks like like er w what you man it looked flicker it is what of it cut out it looks dial and laden had theories about pulling it off gaining soaking may be brazing but once we got to the store once she would seen the meat up close her doubts got worse i or looking at it i don't in at i do not is in your let an work it is oo tick its to much is to much us like muscles it is to as like ring cutter the take i the right i l it he as is a and there e o o my sister said eddy land was definitely right the give away would be the stubborn flavor coo that flavor she said it is tough to get rid of the earth revolves around the sun and bung will always tastes but there was no backing out now we would eat we would eat our way to the truth and what if it did not look good wat of bung was destined to taste bung who i did not look good for and he still put to fight rocky balboa that to this was it the bung verses calamari squidverse is talk the rumble in the buckle we set up the tasting at a restaurant in a love between luncheon dinner in the dining room there was just a few tables eating and all round the restaurant the morning ship was wrapping up as we walked in with a red cooler filled with squid and hogging originally it'd recruited some half a dozen people from our office at this america life as tasters the final group the day of the tasting included from the office sathlind and bran reed windless on that you gets had calamari i had calamari probably a month ago i wat bat wot li ran m i have not had it since we got this tip about a about the possible oh my got i beet of waiting yank totally and i ad to be once i i calmer pry begin to a regataringer of calamari like got it not all the time but it something ewer the my order t tit is on baptize a inion you know ye an i broken an italic do family were my parents were also born here i think calamari just big upon that sapper people cat aloft garden isoline that such s repeating it i had not realized this for weeks bran had been avoiding calamari he would been living in fear at if you find out that there in discernible from each other l u every calamari a no i do not think that is why i want to do this just to no going forward back in the kitchen things were looking bad i given up on the idea that drug would taste the same as calamari now it hung my hos on the idea that it least visually it would look the same but is my sister dropped the flowered rings of hogging into the fire they had turned into this kino big ugly tangled bod nothing the jiggly quit rings oh the were the very scraggly looking but then as if by a miracle they changed my sister gave a shake to the fry basket and as they sizzled the bunches seemed to gracefully snap into rings oh look at that tho it is magic her turning into circle a o o soon we were face to face with the plate on it they were two piles of rings similar in size similar in shape the bung had more of a frizzly edge to it kind of a fancy onion ring the calamari was smoother gates i as than bran did just give a first impression have it guess but i could tits most ting you pretty sure but you could would be wrong g i thought it would be more sure i do not ism away now my got reaction my reaction is that this was this was calamari this was not booked before you read it you see i totally thine this was calamari the other one salmon a do a at the same time forget just to be clear what is going on here sat has chosen one pile of ring which he thinks is calmer bran has done the same thing only bran is choosing the other stack of fried rings look at we are about to stere about to bit end to the simultaneously which we both think this was calamari but there the e officer officer ones again in actuality sat is right sat is eating calamari the chewing you here from bran's me that is the found of a calamari lover eating tried pick victim i should also add the were actually two varieties of big on the plate that day one bung that my sister had blanched over and over to mellow any organ face flavor and then untreated straight ut bungs on filtered unchained uncut one hundred per cent pure bung that one the latter one bung at its purest at the height of its bulginess this is what bran was again as they ate sat still look confident i think i think that that was i thing i was right i i was right really i i to think i was right game sat match bung and it was not just bran i thought daman who manages the restaurant he also thought it was passable a few of us picked up a faint flavor of peregrine but if you were not really looking for it you would not notice it was there one of the restaurant staff a giving eaten van burial had the simplest clearest explanation e i think that when youslighe something up within the debriedits in at is something its ben depart if if a plateful the bung came out how many people do you think would would even do you think you notice if you were in that satin i a topsinario is somebody says this calamari tastes funny and keeps set and as for bran o bran bran was reading a bit trying to figure out just what this was we a mean for him i i ism sure it been full of the past ism just sure f it wet to you are thinking that you being places in the passing a mat bun i just imagine seeing a plate that looks it it this food that looks this on it sitting with my family growing up but we detfually have eaten something a tasted this and just thought it was calamari for sure not only was not he sure if heat every calamari again he did not want to eat the calamari on the plate in front of him calamari i guaranteed him was real just to repeat one last time i have no proof that anyone anywhere has ever tried to pass off pork bung as calamari in a restaurant all i know is if you wanted to do it it would be easy and ism choosing to believe that it is happening somewhere because that some point in working on this story i stopped identifying with bran and any one who might feel redo grow stout by getting imitation instead of the real thing now i identify with the bung and it'd to think that somewhere out there right now under a heat lamp a plater is sitting it is warm and it is full of promise an transformation and redemption that is the world that it'll choose to live in for me for you for the bung for the bung in all of us barchan is one of the produces of y program that is n event before you o swear off calmer for ever please please notice the band is always hangar is possible that this is happening that he did not find actually documented proof that pig bung is being substituted for calamari a broad or especially here in the united states coming out cooking chicken for dinner right in front of the chicken who is your pat do you live with who watches you do it that is an a minute ribcage bublogredio when our program continues it is share from li from our glass to day's program turkey and a face mask for the holiday season this unusual covet thanksgiving wit many things about the holiday a i friend we put together a show with stories about food that we have done over the years we have arrived at at two of our programmed a too still life with chicken for jonthan gold was a kind of legendary food writer invented this way of writing about restaurants the treated hole in the well places and street food with the same seriousness that other restaurant critics had always written about fancy places this led to a whole gonna of food writing and levy shows anchovy jordan and before he died in twenty eighteen jonathan was on our show a couple f times and this interview that went to play you now it is this conversations that just it handed in a very different place then it began as you hear it ended with him talking about lido expect we you to call but the nature of eating but it began with jonathan explaining to me how he ended up living with a chicken he explained that that happened by accident when he was in his twenties he was not living the kind of life one usually associates with chickens this was during the period when i considered myself to be a performance artist of sort in naked performance artist to be specific he was putting together a performance he had a pig system which could put out the requisite amount of annoying feedback sound at high deciles he had the two full bottles of glade america beauty air of freshener which he would spry in their entirety in the perform space and he had a live chicken which he bought the day before the performance one of this chines poultry markets in mosangelis and comes to day of the shell and audiences gathering in a darkened warehouse in west deal i do notion if you've been to a lot of performance art but this was sort of really typical of the stuff that was going on of the period and i showed up and i was naked and i was carrying facetting d i was blind and i stood in the middle of this pile of supermarket chickens you know the the broilers you by another chicken that i bought was tethered to a three foot rope around me and i hack up and down blindly with the machete toward the chicken or just in general we is blindfold side enough was towards the chicken or non and i had fully intended that fact i would kill the chicken miss o for but chicken's art that stupid and this chicken wanted no part of the machete stated the end of is rope the entire time apparently and after ten minutes when as completely exhausted i fell to a heat and everybody left and the performance was over i do not now if you have stuck around after an our performance but the few minutes after an our performance are the some of the most oppressing in the world hows ah you have you have done your wad you have done yer sort of bit for art which has see the worker caused but you are sitting there you are covered with chicken to clubman my case it stinks to high hell everybody's gone and you have got a clean up and your taken its really not a pretty tell jonathan cleaned up and when he was done he had a chicken and he did not feeling he could kill the chicken destiny had brought them together he felt he could not turn his back he says it was the same as if a kicked chows up on your back door scratching lonely needy we took the chicken home and in doing that he stumbled across that benin line that separates food items on the one hand from pats on the other that devised the animals we eat from the animals we love i get home and i i have the chicken and i do not know what to do with it i spread out some newspaper on the top of my refrigerator and i put the chicken up there get a can of a green giant bread giblets from under the counter and i i opened it d i put in a little bowl for the chicken and i give the chicken a little water and the chickens on top of my refrigerator cause youcause you think chickens eat coin you had read that or something and those that was the available coin how's the available corner i i wish i had thought better of the giblet us idea why becks in fact if you are buying three or four hands of nibble to day which is what the chicken aid and your existing on almost nothing which i was then your nibble bill turns out to be some two figure per cent e of er total coming choke i rear you could imagine living on fifty dollars a week if but ten dollars of a ghost for niblyou s just hard to justify an expense that though at the remove of fifteen years i think i can probably safely admitting now it one of the reasons that i stock with nibbles is i saying the word nibble much and then this gave me the the excuse to use to words giblet in general conversation several times a day usually just does not come of and the chicken stayed there on top of my refrigerator for long time months six months i i is it it is a wondrous apartment e two rpabraet i had a kicked and a bedroom i did not have to look at the chicken when i was sleepy though i did not have to look at it hen i was cooking did you eve a cook chicken course i cook chicken did not you feel intensely a disloyal no i felt no particular loyal to this chicken i don't know if you have ever had chickens but it is not you mom you do not pet chickens chickens not really you to pet them and you do not hold them there is really no love that you feel for a chicken in your life i do not thing but yet you kept the chicken i kept the chicken because i could not bear to do whatything else and it is not i could have carried it out on to peck all of pardon said be free little chicken be free did you give the chicken a name i never name the chicken i when i referred to the chicken public i was called it the hand how did you not name it it was t it was us creature in your can us the chicken always seem tempera it never i cursed to me that i might have the chickens long a chicks month tithe chicken always seems something that i would have for just a come of days and then what did you think was got o had guess i thought e i thought about the chicken expiring be i have to admit that there was a possibility that some day i would actually cook the chicken i went through a lot of chicken recipes hundred hundred the chicken recipe but thinking maybe this will be the best before my giblet fed chicken exactly possibly i have to say the most delicious chicken that you could ever e because of this giblet you cannot bind giblet fed chicken for love for money i something ism not sure the a rest be existed that would have lived up to the fact of the chicken this animal who you have come to no on fairly intimate terms and who you've raise and you have put a certain amount of emotion in them i chicken if i might say who has seen you naked the chicken did see me naked damn it the fact is we need food to be just food and it soon as to becomes a living thing especially if we are city people what i used to the conversion of living things in to our food it is it is hard it is tried to handle without thinking it has to be bigger than food without wanting to make it ritualized or something bigger than food exactly i tell you a short a small store yet of course on a few weeks ago i was in this clean restaurant in creation n loss tasteless it was this place called the living fish center that it'd always wanted to go because the name of it was splendid in a living fish center i imagine some sort of vast vivaria word flipper was jumping through hoops and stuff and i go in there and of course it is just a prime are in restaurant i mean it is it is not that clean and i do not know thar tanks and stuff i do not o what to order i order a fish soup cause it looks they have a small fish soup specialty on the man and it comes in its just really strong smelling not that gran and i try squid fried with being sauce and onions which was it was not that happening and ism about to give up and pay the check can go home with the avast table filled with i need not stuff and i suddenly cursed me with the special to the restaurant is and e my way the waitress over and i tell her that it'd a prawn and she's puzzles she did not expect me to ask for a plan but i repeat my questions and she shrugs and goes and tells the sushi she and he goes to one side of the restaurant he climbs on this chair this ordinary folding chair and he reaches into this long tank this running just below the ceiling and he wiggles his fingers in the water when he wiggles t fingers the praise just become enraged and they start now nipping it his fingers and they start attacking him and he picks out a couple of the liveliest one and brings them back to his counter and without washing his hands on you just makes a few motions over it and a couplesackond slide o the waitress comes over with the pine on this huge down of ice what he done is you taken off the eggs less german heat essentially the head was intact and that little part of the tail the is always on prawn is l there but the middle part is naked a grub and i picked up the iron with my chopsticks and it was not dead this prawn it was extremely alive and it was wiggling it is legs and was wiggling its intends and its eyes were swiveling madly on its diestocks d i was looking back at me seeing me as actually the predator f the the creature that was on to eat it and that was a really freakish moment because is much as as much stuff as i eat and is low low as i eat on the food chain and as many pranks i have dis passed to my life i have never before killed the living being with my teeth and he the prawn knew what i was going to do and he did not it and i was not quite sure what to do but if i put it down the prom died any payment not to live without a hell nice on yelsewould have eat in a blablablass i bit into it i bid his body off with my teeth and the prone just relaxed in this way that was really eerie and the taste of the drawn the taste of the meat of it was extraordinary youameas set was it was life coursing throat it was the most live thing have ever eaten you obviously literally but again it was freakout was getting too close to the actual nature of consumption which is killing a living creature with your teeth when you when you bit into the iron did you actually bite off its head its living head and and have its head in its eyes in your mouth no i bit off its body and i held the and i held the head in my hands we said you see you held the head and can one hand in the tail in the the n you bit the center run and i thought that i i thought that i killed it but in fact when i put it down it was still had much life in it that it grabbed a pieces of salon's ashes and would not that go of it and i do not think i ever want to do that again did you feck there was something of about the experience that made it more this word is a little cornier than i intend but swear that can think of that made it more sacred that took it out of the mundaneness of the way that we eat we true most of us is eating without actually tasting and experience ting and thinking about what were eating and what on the earth it is that were killing to survive do you think in some way that it is that it is more it acceptable to eat an animal if you are more a way to the fact that it is an animal and what is happened to it but do you think e really does not matter i i think it matters a great deal i mean one of the no greatest metaphors and question civilization t is that of christy to gave his life that others my live and i do not want to be sacrilegious and i do not want to you don't be little thatmenth in anyway but a tie his giving its life that we might chickens giving is life tit we might and i think the least that we could do is to think about that chicken to think about that can that were eating not necessarily to be sat for it but to celebrate to beware of the being that it was that it was not just to bit of buy engineer protein somehow managed to find its wan to our places contain gold the curious bat his writing the selection of is columns called counter intelligence i much time with the king of catchup i understudy it ay with the stray of a man who has a very simple mission in life to give a little special treatment to goo people if contribution to society is often overlooked the men and women of the food service illustrate who when they meet this guy than to give him a to special treatment in return the stroy i as you bet to teller you hear it was first bread cast long before the pandemic john of the goldstone whose name i know its very similar to the guan i too but that means nothing tells the tale how a checklist and i have been friends since were kids and i can say with great authority that almost every day for the past ten years how are checklist as either dined out or ordered ain at least w one of his meals sometimes when toward is and sure what he is in the mood for he will lift an empty hand up to his mouth and pretend that he is eating he stare straight ahead trying to figure out if he likes the taste of the imaginary food he is shoving into his mouth sometimes his hand is holding a hammerer sometimes a fork rapped in spegetty and other times he is double fishing either end of an invisible pork rib towards always loved restaurants he was raised in a jewfish eastern european household were the very idea of a restaurant was a ridiculous piece of decades something for cossacks in cocaine attics who enjoyed flushing their money down the toilet restaurants had a transgressive allure and as soon as toward was old enough he started sneaking away to them after school or sometimes on weekends while the whole family was still asleep in fact toward was the very first person have ever dined out with alone without any family we were twelve years old and we ate at a comic sheets a real a place just down the street from us it was owned by a crotchety old green man named costa who served ridiculously large portions of food we would get a play o fries the size of a dead sheila pony but right alongside of it costa would place one measly packet of catchup when we asked for more he looked at us we had just asked from more blood from his mothers still beating heart were as i learned to fashion eating four tor five hundred french fries with a bottle capsized dollar toward learned had a talk to costa how to win him over how to make him see that giving us more catchup was just the right thing to do along the way toward learned haw to say in green thank you kind sir bless you for the catchup as well as the excellent crony a for avatar ketchup was his many years to your catchup ever since way back then toward has had a very special re for with the men and women of the food service industry and he has worked very hard over the years to cultivate this relationship dis not li eyes ye have been every sing restaurant they rely settle times the i i can call it it every restart a couple of weeks ago toward took me on a walking tour of the best places to eat in his neighborhood have walked into bakeries with toward were the young girls an old man alike who worked there have dropped their doughnut tongs to cry out with joy toward have watched him get moved to the front of the line outside restaurant in china town when he is relating to a waiter or a delivery man all that toward sees is one person giving another person food he talks to them as though they are friends brothers even his servers are able to sense his purity of vision and they bestow on him in every exchange some little bit of special treatment the e leas show your ghost here on the quarter there is a place called muser they'd the called a the de we which is the challenge i that's fly great place they clot tat they move red across the street they had goblin that he lets be getting meal it'd go to every day the gout a lot of free but i got it got to the plate when with cut mi as a shield to serve myself that is as of cops o go we going they gree me be levant get up i mud go d to myself coffee n is each you ache serve other people coffee it's he wat coffee did at firs it the jolty be we a a us to be as you it get if fay thing its you what tot yo me b we l epic let me mad toasting that vest mix of my founts a yester in fact toward is such a beloved figure in the neighborhood that whenever our friend tacker goes in to get take out from saris a local middlleastern restaurant he will tell whoever is serving him that in fact the food was not for him but that he was picking it up for toward this served i portions that were almost twice as large as what he would normally gad toward he is the best man his we over would say as he piled food on to his place you are lucky to have a friend toward indeed he was but the funny thing is is that toward is doted upon when he eats and restaurants that sometimes it makes it difficult forest to just sit back and enjoy his meal he feels he has to bounds things out and he dots right bat because of that it could be hard to carry on a conversation with him his eyes will nervously scan the restaurant for any way he could be had help to the waiting stay coward's ears can detect the mauled clink of cutlery falling to the carpet from clear across the room and when he does he will do a kind of concern him coat trot over to the mishandled piece of silverware and pluck it up off the floor as much as toward loves restaurants when he really wants to relax he will get home delivery and since hi was nearing lunch time rather than step into one of the many restaurants we were passing toward ushered us back in the direction of his house to did out for our grub had his place he pulled open his top kitchen drawer and i saw the many choices the lay before us there is about four hundred menus in that you i was there is four hundred about the count it ti say missis handfuls but ten ten twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seven as much as restaurant owners and waiters love toward it is delivery man who really really love him i mean who among us even knows our delivery man's name toward knows their names in the names of their wives and children when they come to his door he invites them in and offers them water and in return the actually call toward later not to see if his meal was to his liking that it was warm enough that there was enough catch up to ninety two hundred vaberasi to ten to twenty to thirty but touched fifty menus here there are some bobbles for shire or or even li you lake twill copies but only restroom all the time we decide to order from coward's favorite restaurant is lucky place called the green village i me thinking omber ten that a the gotta meet up and i think that is it that is homelethi i while we wait for the food heard waves me over and opens his kitchen cupboard to reveal physical proof of his good standing with the service industry e revs to all bags of catch up thoughts o he saws this is all from take out yet i you to big bags full of nothing but catch up father's some soy sauce tho gone to the days where you had to wheedle out a single packet out of a costs a hands tree your french rise it is true that i have much now have solely packets here but i i no better ham how many packet's i best it will never catch up to what i misstesste child catch up then with vaudeville timing toward delivery arrives e me toward greets the delivery man an old friend he has not seen at quite some time the is somebody that your friend's a beautiful men is toot's a nice men out telling it i your trouble to i it is gostolodin lands yell i have a hit is i to he give me apple he give me a youth he give me everything when i order in most people i figure these guys one out of my house as badly as a bird that is accidentally flown in down the chimney and i assist them in their passage usually having the exact change with a tip already for them at the door but at coward's house delivery men stay a long time they seem to want to so gat offer you something tell thank you thank you thank you hes miles not working anymore lo because he i i woke it there thinks at the the bat hat i call it to askothys am very well we no we get again hen ha i o but it don't after about ten minutes of this i just want to eat i find myself eyeing the bag of who lackey lying on the floor a camp ground beer i realize then that ism just not made of the same stop as toward and i never will not be beer the when we finally sit down to eat i cannot even get toward to admit that he is doing anything special with guides shim meet we go back and forth on this yet because i mean most people will not go to the extent et you do it is why you have visa word to telephone coming by year has to meet you that probably does not happen at we we believe i do not leave meeting i i nip mean just empirically you have to see at this point that you are getting responding differently then most people there must be something different though you somethngol comes my door for them a you times the only face we we how are you i much aching the person a the human being in most people i think are probably rue to them we most people that i know give livid in a buck i think that they would do a hardthey have a hated job than a waiter a waitress because he is a guys e takes your food guess into a care this life goes in to traffic come get a second risk his life i know he is driving to carry e towards work all kinds of food service jobs himself as a waiter a buss boy a short order cook and he says that as a result he absolutely loathes the feeling of being serve there something that just feels embarrassing and unnatural about it but it even goes further than that in his interactions with the service in the stay he is looking for a particular feeling a kind of cosy moment where he can palpably sense that the waiter has forgotten that he is a waiter and that they are both simply relating as human beings and then once he knows this once he knows there both getting along and everyone is happy he can move on he is not looking for anything else from them his motives are pure that way but these kinds of special moments do not come without strings attached and sometimes toward gets into trouble earlier in the day during our walking to her there was one place we did not stop in to a little convenient store around the corner toward became on characteristically somber and quiet as we walked by the store front window the owners a green woman in her sixty's named hula and her older sister used to be pretty friendly with him sometimes hula would not charge in the tax on his tronclabar and on occasion she would have him sit behind the counter with her on a plastic milk crate it was not much but it was still more than what the other customers got and hit made toward feel special but then at a certain point thinks started to get more intense there would been several hold ups there by life point gun point and i see the file bat for them it we them to be shook up a the cat tough ladies but the other alone and is told myself he know if if you have an anything is any trouble or something strung to corny con me a call and i really means it him in inches of emergency or hear just that there some thy can call i some to community some hive effort a community but she started she recall every day she would call him for all kinds of reasons to have him come by and fix things or to run errands for her and he would try his best to be accommodating she would even call him just a chat even though all of this was more than toward could shoulder he was reluctant to put an end to it it was only after the calls got later into the night at one in two in the morning that coward's friends started insisting he tell her that enough was enough and against his better judgment he did toward wonders if it was right to give her his number in the first place i meed that offer assuming that that it would be understood that there is a cut off point but to another person that offers it is a real genuine offer if i need help i in t o call you and she did and and maybe she is h one it is rate it is ironic that e know just like being nice to some one i she had the adverse effects the opposite effect an and it in is being like disaster and not you people are not even friendly with each other there have been other disasters for toward disasters were he was the one who went a little too far there is the time he became consumed with helping this neighborhood chines restaurant that without being asked he took it upon himself to draw pamphlets for the place the owner accepted coward's fliers but never circulated them later the owner picked a screaming fight with toward over an order and toward never went back and then there was the time he brought in beautiful framed photos of lebanon to his favorite lebonyese restaurant they could be reminded of home but the photos were never hung up nor were they ever refer to again but for toward those things do not matter and i know that he probably even do them all again there are many other moments that make his good intentions feel repaid in full some of his favorites are when delivery men he knows pass him by in their cars as he is walking down the street it shocks him out of his revery when they hunk their horns in a quick affection at burst for brief moment it feels a reassuring slap on the back toward thinks to himself that they are the best and it fills him with much gratitude that if he had a pair or peach in his coat pocket he would wave them over and give it to them down then godstayin is the host of the pod guest heavy weight we just finished its fifth season i hardily recommended great stories you can hear it on notify never else you

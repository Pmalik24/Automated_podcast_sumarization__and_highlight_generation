one of the beauties of life is the simple fact in a matter how stupid things get reality always wins and in fact whether a time what your personal life or whether we are talking about politics it broadly the simple fact of the matter is eventually you are going to run up against reality and reality is going to win it comes to bad political ideas that does not mean they cannot emerge victorious in the short or even the mid term it does mean that the realities of human nature the realities of the world surrounding you those do not just go away and eventually those policies will fail dramatically the dumber the policies the faster they tend to fail at o mean people acknowledge the failure tut it does mean that they fail pretty quickly one of those dumb ideas that has obviously taken center stage of late has been the dumb idea of woke woke is a foolish idea now what exactly is likeness were defend it before on the show likeness is the basic idea that if there is any sort of disparity between group outcome in america life that somehow that group disparity is due to discrimination and the only corrective is therefore reverse discrimination some form of discrimination that is going to equalize the outcomes of the various groups and we have seen wide variety of policies that been implemented in orbit clothes all of these gaps the quest for cosmic justice as homes soul the great thinker of our time has put it is a foolish quest it is not something that can be solved because the reality is the vast majority of group gaps are either in born or they are the result of culture and environments eras those are all the factors that there are that does not mean that every result is the result of inborn differences for example difference is in outcome intellectually very often are about educational differences or cultural differences as supposed you say i cut but for temple height differentials between particular groups those are about genetics this sort of stuff happens throughout life and looking at the ration awls for wide things are different an from of outcomes between groups is a good way of craft in good policy but we have basically thrown all of that out in favor of stupidity and now we are going to educate our children in this stupidity but the problem is again that stupidity does not reflect reality and we are seeing the results of that according to the san francisco chronicle a hard elementary school struggling to boost low scores and dismal student attendants is spending two hundred fifty thousand dollars in federal money for an organization called woke kindergarten to train teachers to confront whites to premise disrupt racism and impression and remove those barriers to learning he woke kintregarden sessions train teachers on concepts and corbicula that are available to using classrooms with any of glasswork elementarily four hundred seventy for students thou sessions are funded through a federal program meant to help the countries lowest performing schools boost student achievement and again the basic they behind this program is that if you just teach kid self esteem they will magically becomes smarter abetter performing if you teach them about the radical injustices of the life they lead in the freest country in the history of the world than magically they will per form better only one problem it fails cause reality always winds according again to the san francisco chronicle two years in to the three a contract with woke kindergarten a four prophet company a stud n achievement at glassbrook has now fallen prompting some teachers to question whether the money was well spent given the needs of students ware predominantly low income two thirds of the students are english learners more than eighty per cent are hispanic latent english and mathscors hit ne loads last bring less than four per cent of students were professions an math just under twelve per cent were provisioned at grad level in english that is to clime but about four per centare points in each category efforts to reach the organization woke kindergarten were not successful now again that is not a particular shock because again woke kindergarten is a stupid idea teaching kids terrible ideas is likely to make them perform worse not better districts officials defended the program saying woke kindergarten did what it was hired to do that is true they made the scores lower it made things worse they did exactly they are hired to do which is to masturbate the inequities therefore to claim that the system itself is broken one of the most amazing things about the non profit world this is true virtually across the board is that non profits are constantly exacerbating the problems they are supposed to fights they can raise money to fight those problems this happens all of the time in non profit land and when you talk about companies woke kindergarten if all of the sudden achievement rose based on actual metrics of performance they need for woke kindergarten would disappear one of their actual jobs one of the jobs of for example politically motivated people on the left is to exacerbates inequalities as to claim in equity that is the goal because if at any point those inequalities actually narrowed as a result of freedom and good in sense of structures than what would they do for living the district pointed to improvements an intendant and suspension rates they said the schools no longer on the state watches only to learn from the chronicle the school was not only still en lest but also have dropped be the district officials were doing even better and the wrongs noornot we have a lists radar the deposition to bring in woke kindergarten rather tan a more traditional literacy or math in movement program lines with thou belief by some parents and educators that the current education system is not working for many disadvantage to children the solution take these advocates is for educators to confront legacies of crisis and by is in schools and to talk about historic what supremacy the students feel safe and supported now there is only one problem which again is that this is a giant fail what exactly is in the woke kindergarten curriculum that is failing dramatically where the curriculum includes wondering which pose questions for students questions if the united states defended these rally military how could this money be used to rebuild palestine that is what you need to ask your first grater men implicit with all of its ridiculous stupid immoral assumptions in a diction the woke word of the day includes strike cease fire and protest offering students quit language of the resistant tins produce children to liberator vocabulary and a way they can easily digest understand and most importantly use in their critics of the system that left understand that woke dinner garden is just the stupidest boiling down of what is in fact in extraordinary amount of educational theory there is a there is a jurist of education who is very often quoted in these terms an polofere politer who talk about by names lens who we've had on the sundae special before he was a brazilin educator who talked about what he called the pedagogy of the apprise and the basic idea was they your supposed to inculcate in students not knowledge or wisdom or even was of of solving problems your supposed to impose in students a revolutionary ideology that was the entire goal and some of his students jane tompion said quit there is no such thing as a neutral education process education either functions as an instrument which is used to facilitate the integration of generations into the logic of the present system and bring about conformity to it or it becomes a practice of freedom the means by which men and women till critically with reality and discover hours participate in the transformation of their world and this is the way that much of our educational system has been taken over is that it really is not when we state there achieving their gold their gold is not increase the outscores that goes not to increase the english scores the goal of these educators is to exacerbate again inequities it is to present america as a terrible place that must be overthrown that is the generalized goal of these system there actually doing exactly what they were designed to do but the reality is they lead to more failure will get's more on this in one second first to sure me there is not a day that goes by you do not call or take somebody you care about my friends at pure talk are making

kids in the belief that america is a terrible terrible place with your tax par dollars in fact your is the wok cinterigown carton founder a personated akin grow a warded again a two en or fifty dollar of fifty thousand dollar grant by the federal government apparently and a here is this human yes everyone status i am antiasreo i am propalithi and i am when hanger pet can to don antisera i believe i your has no right to is firth be talk of a building and got o i fat has no mix believe every fender are you clastic committed camofhi i can made people if the a condaginth people have no right t they abelevenifry patina from the river count i believe what a star it'll be tree is this ma ran that just means colly the gets by the way this person would immediately be thrown off a building in the got strip also by the way if she does not believe in america as a country and believes that any one who is not originally on this confident needs to be thrown off the continent what the hellish doing here that is a weird thing but again the pedagogy of the appressed is the way that kids are being taught in public schools now it runs up against reality which that this is a deeply unsuccessful way of thinking it is a way that facilitates unsuccess facilitates the suffering of children and their families makes their lives materially worse it is destined it to fail and a mentally parents might realize this and the might thing hay you now t be great is my conceptual knew how to do math t be assume is it my kids actually knew how to read that might be a more useful thing than being inculcated to be part of the woke revolution by morons this reality always wins and reality is going to in here as well maybe these folks win in the short our titan the long term they lead down a dark road of despair and depression and and failure and the people who are inculcated in the system will be failures because they're trained to be failures and meanwhile reality setting in at an enormous number of america institutions another one of the institutions where reality is now setting in is dartmouth dartmouth actually got rid of the sea t during bovid and now they have decided to put a back in why are they using the sea t again because originally again these equity fools have been suggesting the because there dispirit outcomes with regard to the sea t that for example black students on average do less well on the a ts an then say white students and white students you less wile they teas by thewy tarnation students but they no mention part whenever they say that there are group disparities and essay t outcomes they claim the test itself is races which is sort of saying that just because news are on average a lot shorter then say natives of certain parts of africa that must mean that rulers are bias rulers are a problem clearly we need different yard sticks or something the sea ts are just a test that is all they are and as it turns out they are highly predictive of student performance dartmouth got rid of it for a while and it turned out that thetas a giant failed they ware letting in a bunch people who are not qualified to a show go through dartmouths now the bringing back the sea t and the a c t the new samphire school according to the waster journal said it was making the move based on new research showing that at ivy league other highly selected schools standardized testschores help predict first year college performance even better than high school grades do which of course makes perfect sense because they're lot of high schools we are grating on a curve if you went to a crappy high school it may turn out that in a student at a crapy high school is equivalent to a s students at a really really good high school but the a t istle same test that every one is taking lee coffin the vice president and dean of admissions and financial lights hade quit i become less convinced that test optional is we king fressodarmouth reanimating the policy trays on evidence he said there are many occasions since the school adopted it is test optional policy in twenty twenty again they adopted it n twenty twenty not as result of covet but as he result of the quote quote social justice protests surrounding the death of gorge flood because a life long criminal and drug attic died and this re jigger all of america life up to an including whether you need to take an s a t in or to get into dartmouth he said that there are many occasions since the shool adopted its test optional policy when he wished you had one more datapoint on a student to quote confirm what we think as a high achieving profile an other words it turns out that good predictor is remain good predictors he said escort will be especially useful as as badmouth receives more applications from high schools that are unknown to the admissions office and schools ore great inflation is a concern in fact the simple fact of e matter is in excellent way for people who are in bad neighborhoods to get ahead is testing testing is not is a half way out if your really smart kid and you were stuck in a crappy public school in a bad system and you did not per form in that crappy public school an bad system becauseyouare surround by bat influences but you score high on the essay tee that is a great way of overcoming that particular burden astrally we tomorrow the in just one

be again the lies of equity our lies and there being shown to be lies reality always wins reality is also winning with regard two ore america streets the simple fact of the matter is that eventually we are going to have to make a choice in this country between whether we actually want police officers to be able to do their job or whether we do not want police officers period there is no third option or police officers our magical dispensers of justice who never make mistakes in everythinglish pretty on camera that its not the job of cops and yet and in the aftermath of the gorge flood protests we decided the basically cops were the problem the whenever we saw as civilians something we did not on tape we were the best a judicatory body for the behavior of police officers now the reality is the dato day life of the police officer is incredibly defile you would not want on to that to which is why you are not doing that job all people on left who watch police offer tackles on ma tell my cohtosoro o my goshthat looks a terrible are you the one policing for drugs what what is the you do and treason i ask that is not because cops do not do things wrong there certainties or cops absolutely do things wrong and when they violate the rules then obviously there should be punishments for that but instead what you have typically is people who do not the fact that the police have to do rough things to rough people in order to maintain the peace and the yell at the cops overtime they see tape of something that does not look what they would do because a normal civilians escalation technic is to walk away from a conflict that is normally what do escalation looks for those of us or not members of the police for example well what that is resulting in is people simply walking away from the job of policing the harder we have made of for our police officers the four police officers there are the four police officers there are the more of cities washington de we the have ben completely taken over by crime and the generalized attitude toward cobs which moved from fun the police which is way to out their way too loud even democrats ran away from that slogan screaming by late twenty twenty because of the increasing criminates to demoralize the police demoralize the place remains the way that we now do policing in the united states is appoint being made by heather my donate over it city journal she says on canary thirtieth the newborn city council pass the how many stops act over the veto of mare arigadums the law requires new york police officers to fill out of form yearly every time they interact with the civilian if for example and officer asks a potential bystander t a shooting if you had witness thatshuting the officer will have to come plate a form listing the bystanders race see and age are there other potential witnesses in the area will urgently need to be con acted before they disperse too bad identity base paper work comes first but that act is innocuous compared with californium's dated collection requirements for police officers new reporting obligations under the racial and identity profiling act now require californium officers to fill out in eight page form with nearly two hundred fields when they make what is known as a custodial stop meaning the civilian is not free to walk away the form general by the californium those comes straight from the race and gendersthudy's class rum the offer first documents whether see the officer is a suspender man sixgendera woman transgenderman transgender woman or non binary person to avoid placing a retrogress of gender straightjacket an on the states public servants the form also allows an offer officer to check both non barn binary person and suspender woman for example the officer must list a sexual identity there is also an extensive office a race or ethnicity section then the officer have to document the civilians perceived sexual orientation el g b plus or straight heterosexual and the civilians perceived gender sis gender trains gender or non binary the discerning officer is l ad to surmise that the person they've stopped is more than one californium created the forms hethermat one points out to gin up antipole narratives once in officers identity profile is merge with that of the person stop the possibilities of finding some form of identity oppression are virtually endless while the predictable result of all this is why the hell would you join up at a cop have talk to cops all over this country very few of them have hi moral right now every police officer that i know an all pe down of bunch of them is looking to get out its fast is humanly possible and they are scared you death of being on this streets not because they are smarter of the badges but because thy re afraid that if they deal with the bad guides and there is a bize stander with the camera and the bunch a more on watching and be we that the officer willspend the rest of his life in jail an they have stopped policing they do not want to be on streets the thing they signed up for is the thing they have been prohibited from doing by the woke which is why as of august of last year the number of officers employed by the ale pity dropped below nine thousand the was a staffing level in seen since the nineteen nineties the total number of officers is wag to low peopleare retiring as fasts humanly possible people are taking half pensions in order to get the hell out the same thing is happening with the n i ad in gulag twenty twenty three the neural post reported the number of people interested in taking the en i pity exam is cratering likely hiding a new low as the city struggles to fill positions left vacant by senior officers leaving improves the an i p d astral expected three thousand testtakers for the winter examine and thirteen hundred people signed up people are not even signing it because why would you sign up for the again this is reality when you tell people they cannot do their jobs thrill be punished for doing their jobs and that basically they are now going to be genera and diversity workers who do not have the ability to stop crime who would potentially sign up for any of that and it is in every major city week's more on this in just once second verse the an fell big game is finally here and means now is the perfect time to join

a a in all skills an a experience by this a good opportunity for us to respect the ranks and a in all the regeneration of police can come fort o ai mean your a can illicit anyway it should be clear about this especially when your political officers people abandon trohnson mare when he with questions bout take the border or crime his excuse is don't has to do my job i am a black man with reeked he literally yes yesterday about border problems and in that last wave of migration from i legal migrate into the city and his answer was stop bothering me on a black i with resets ism not getting this what he said i have children who would ten schools we have score games o you all asking me as if ism not a parent in this city i get it a mare i get it but your asking me to give you a date and i have to court do you understand that you have not had a mare me i get that i have a wife i have children they have schedule and bless he's to have public safety get we have to address he's to have the

historic than lory lightfoot and ism pretty sure that there's been mayors of chico have kids before but again this is the excuse making for bad governments this is the predictable result of all this is lawless cities he predictable result of all of this bad governments bad equity standards leads to lawless cities in washington d c how much trouble are they having at getting recruits they have now lowered the physical standards for police officers in fact back in went twenty three reporters for one of the local outlets tried to take the physical last to be come a d c police officer these just people who no training nothing there just people who work for the local news nowhere an they pass with fine colors cause it turns out that basically you just have to be able to stand upright here is what it sounded lenten citric looters with i id says although the meed is large and we want quality officers a not just a quasi he says those who apply to the officers need a base line level of fit this empty invited seven news to take the fest you start by running going down these the are then going through cones running up and down stats dragging a hundred and sixty low hands of did wat then crawling on your can an mes an then wat up the hardest parts the cents an is i least the lack too early there is a may not tick the landing you also i get a that some h you lushly i logan is fetor

sandman somethings other stops but it is totally doable offers sens most people has and they give two chances on prospect ay an you can come back again most pupal pass and you get two chance than prospect day this is where you went up it's incredibly difficult to are police officers when you are addicted to woke idiocy it's incredibly difficult to police crime when you have told the police that they cannot actuallcallyce crime it is incredibly difficult to do education when your chief can of education is inculcating revolution rather than teaching people how to reader right reality always find what are go done up with stupider students more money spent worst police forces fewer recruits and more crime that is what you get end with another printable result of that is political failure and that is what you are seeing in terms of democrats on a national level now in these cities many of these cities have basically been cleansed of anything remotely resembling republican government there is just not to parties in places lot angels chico d c new york here are all one party cities at this point and this cities are gotten with even more reality because if they cannot get out of the mine set that has stuck them in this cycle o failure they will continue to fail there is no other choice round a national level other choices can be made and you can see that people increasingly in this country are deeply unhappy with the choices thathave ben made by their political class that is true certainly fort jobidon it is true for comely arris there is a reason why jobidin is pulling lower than any incumbent in modern history right now in part of that is because he is no longer contents and again the just sense that no one has control of this ship that the that the navigational tools are spinning wildly over here and that that is not a wrong impression get's more on this in just one second first ell lot going on lately i got to tell you nutrition it is hard

just a few years ago he out withe person who died twenty years ago get's the country wrong gets the personwrong an gets the year wrong here we go jobbing your president of the united states right right right after i wat i went through wit the to we see mean all eater feels eosin sin i i sat down i say merits bat an enteron from german om i from trance fort o me and say say no what why o how long habit i look dow and and chancier german what would youth say s to i o pick up the paper t or onion him one time say to the people great through the house of common great down o does two bobby or cure o stop for section o timers what would you a i never thought about ta what would we say that happened an ow the the monsoon round the world got he is out of it o case he is mentioning a frons matron first y calls him leader of germany he was french second of all frons veteran died an nineteen ninety seven s that is not ask he talk to for re years ago unless he is talking with ghosts again reality always wins the realities this in eighty one year old we now man that is the reality jobidon is no longer with us he as not been with us for quite some time and meanwhile his back up another harsh reality for democrats is even less popular than jobidon is there is that latest ante keyhole and it showed that jobidon's favorability ratings eighteen points under water thirty six per cent favorable fifty four percent unfavorable there is only one politician in america who is less popular than jobidon and it is his vice president the person who'll take over for him if he dies during as second term comely arris who is at twenty eight per cent safer and fifty three per cent and fifty three percent unfavorable this our truly garbage numbers here so us yesterday trying to rip on doll trump this is not going to hunt folks fears the farmer present a for the firs o hat and fiery and ratite and even utopia forms on power and political gan heacuseamran openoties makes it true what risen me the blood of our country and after ne o not mark an carpet feel hes a the for very fine people on the fine the former president inch sat hi hunts e tow his admiration a me dictator under on understand as oppose to a jobidon who literally said literally yesterday when stopped at after job literally said yesterday that the supreme part may have blocked him from it alleviating student load but did not stop him but do not work the dictator is on the other side again reality is these people are in popular there in popular because their governments is bad and reality is tarting said in on pretty much all size when it comes to e legal emigration for example just a few years ago it was considered totally insane to suggest invasion was happening at our southern border now of course the position of the democratic party has shifted because the america people totally understand that there is in invasion of the southernborder when i say invasion i do not mean the the people who are crossing the southern border as illegal emigrants are all seeking to do american's warm betas that is not true many of them are coming here in order to either work or be on welfare whatever it is that is not the same thing as say in invading army but the medical drug care tells are in control of america southern border they are facilitating a vast migration we've that constitutional again i sat on the border i have watched medical drug cartel drones in america territram not sure what you would call that other than in invasion even a sharpen is now calling it in invasion that is how badly things are going for the democrat there is a sharped on amisand we see last night using language direct from dona trump wo so an folks the migrants all over the country the finery are people outraged and could not there we e some kind of noble pressor cutin in mexcuplof days in some of these senor his fates saying why on you allowing this to continue because at the end of the day senor is hapten will but the voters an at the same time it in the bill you give a a money to gaze too to series in gaze and israel but the border i me win looking every day at the invasion o migrants at be playing but time gave would politics on this but to making here is sharpen admits that there is effectively an invasion of the southern border and can almost see the senator christy murphy wincing when he says that but he is liming republicans for that and that is not con hunt either because the reality is jobidon could stop this to day you could literally stop this today we will get to the latest on the border bill in just one second first folks this day nobraner a you are protector kids from the sort of leftist in indoctrination that we are say public schools in main streamed here is ha you do it stray fourteen day free trial to benkeids our new kids entertainment a directly from the daily wire bunker s the only streaming a that offers high quality family friendly shows reflecting your values

you will get fourteen days when limited access to monkey's world of adventure go to benkeedot come house cot unlock at sign up to start your trial to day meanwhile democrats are struggling with regard to this emigrationistue they have try to split republicans over a border bill the border bill has a bunch of laws with we went through it in detail yesterday anna earthy also goes through it in detail over at national review and as he points out there are some things about the bill that are better than current law standards for asylum for example have changed they have been a bit strengthened in some areas including the fact that you now are supposed to show that you do not have the ability to stay at home in your own country and move arias or live in a country the you pass through in order to come to the united states but again all of the law depends upon implementation and that in the end is the real problem jobidon has demonstrated zero capacity to actually implement the law as written he has plenty of law on the books that would allow him to enforce the law right now an am earthy says congress or pressure by the use is existing authority to secure the border and the crisis the most notable thing about the current senatorial proposal is that i would undermine the existing presumptions in the law that legal aliens should be apprehended detain in rapidly removed and that the united states is not required to provide asylum another words the baseline a sumption of the bill is that a certain number of people will get asylum that certain number people will be imported into the center of the country and all the rest the house hope also issued a statement ripping into the borebils thing s basically deva even with maconall in the senate we originally back the bill is now saying he is not king to bring it up for a vote if he has anything to say about it cause he does not have the votes on the republican side of the senate purer to effectuate its passage but the house majority in the in the house they say quote house republicans oppose the senate immigration bill hes it fails in every policy area needed to secure our border ad would actually insets bis more illegal emigration among its many flaws the bill expands work authorizations for legal aliens while failing to include critical asylum reforms even worse it is language allows legals to be released from physical custody and that would effectively indorse the biting fatten relay's policy the called shut down authority in the bill is anything but wilds with loopholes that grant far to much discretionary authority to secretary alahandro mazurkas the bill also fails to adequately stop the president's abusive para authority and provides for tax pay funds to fly and house legal emigrants in hotels through the feat shelter and services program in other words why does not jordan just due his job that is a senior of the house stop is same and the protestations by democrats that job needs more authority those are falling on defies beaus they are not true here is christmurphy trying to do that retain the senator from connecticut do you think the president by shun just unit this tissue way from the republicans who seem to be plank portthats with it then use every bit of his executive authority to address the border crisis at is on say basically well pass the legislation cab do myself without being constratigy for him what is the probgavid i the present kin the spy himself the present docent has the legal authority without he dis tonal legislation to control the borders fix the broken alien system in the way s ait means to be done and this is parton the action ta gets perpetuated of the magical public by republicans the f he wanted to passborder legislation last her n tat it was import end to an house for seniti that they mad e char so is the second build they introduced was soon as at the kings clear that by partisan border for legislation might pass republicisent holster screaming now the present does not need any ne laws he has all the authority he needs that is just not true ye it is true on the laws not only does he have the authority he is required for example to have ice to port people who are in the country illegally and he is not doing any of that is not interested in doing any of that the america public knows this and the reality is going to be very harsh for hoiden on that issue speaking of what eventually reality is going to set in with regard to the economy as well right now h our been floating above the economic precautions for having spent more money than god has ever seen become well the fedchair he says that they have to be careful about rate cuts at this point considering that the economy count continues to truly chug and we have good employment right now very very good employment numbers wages are finally starting to rise and as supposed to inflation and one the things he is worried about is injecting more money into the system but one of the things he is pointing out is that the future obstacle to growth is not going to be the inflationary rates right now the big ostobstacle to growth is going e the fact that government is going to eat up more and more of the private sector earnings in the united states and that's on to have to be made up somewhere here was fedsharpawel saying the united states don an unsustainable fiscal path for all the happy talk that we have beenhearing about the economy the reality is the long from physical future of the united states eventually will hit reality as well how do you see the national get we mostly try very hard not to comment on fiscal policy and and ah it struck congress on had to do their job point actually they have over side over us but is the national bet or danger to the economy in you review in the long run the us is on unsustainable disco fathers federal governments on unstable fiscal path and that just means wait the get is growing faster than the economy shall that is not curable if you think you can outgrow the get not at the rates that we are racking up debt but meanwhile jobidon continues to dare reality to clock him yesterday for example he was bragging about his attempts to go around a supreme court order telling him he cannot unilaterally relieves tun wonder and he says the supremecourt blocks but did not stop me again we used to call that dictatorial type language they blocked me but they did not stop me they literally told you not to do the thing in than you went you did the thing that is it that is an amazing statement by jobiton he is unilaterally raising debt at this point eventually there will be consequence because eventually there are always consequences the same holds true in the middleleast as well jobiton has sent extraordinary level of man signals on the one hand he on leash america strikes on eighty separate tar gat simultaneously hit on the other hand he will then tell israel that israel has to stop with regard to what is doing with cowbell on the north that is will has to be kinder to harass that what we really need to pursue as the united states is that we really need to persuade two states solution that incentivize illogic terrorism those man signals are being taken as weakness buy all the parties that hate the united states right now if job an actively wanted to stop potential conflict from bradeningin the last what he needs to do is say that america is a wall that america is not going to allow this to broaden into a larger conflict in the idlest that if hisballaw does not for example move north of a river that they're bound by international law to move north of the that disown in the south of lebanon is not to militarized the united states is going to fund israel to the extent that israel be able to basically destroy his bellawwhere it stands that is what the united states hold be doing if they want to prevent further war right now the biggest rob the united states has that is not a credible actor in he mddeleast there is no credible threat from the united states calling up america enemies and warning them about potential strikes is not exactly set to create a deep quaking and trembling in the cranial regime now the whorehouse is realizing that they're ring to walk at back the war reports before a set of strikes that a week ago that the out had warned the rocky government which is effectively run by on that america strikes were forthcoming now according to political the us is saying that i did not directly notify the rocky government america forces would strike inside the country on fridge contrary to an earlier white house statement you us forces conducted air strikes againsteroniand militant in rock and sermon fridge as retaliation for the killing of three o a soldiers in jordan by eonian proxy groups on money sate department spokes person radon fatal told reporters that there was not prenotification and the u s informed the rookies immediately after the strikes the rocky government quote understood therewould be response after the debts of our soldiers but that contradicted wet the national security council spokes person john hurry said in a called on fridge we to what we did inform the rocky government prior to the strikes occurring hurry then walked it back he said well i responded with in formation it'd been provided at the tempts what you believe the bi administration the by administration i tell you what i believe i believe that the by administration is basically warning the aronians to get their people out of harm's way which is leaving the aronians to think okay we can push jobidon pretty much as far as the want a push and in fact the strikes against americantargets have notseased at any point here is the pentagon press secretary major general trick rider confirming yesterday that there have been continue drone attacks on america target in terms of attacks in i rack in serious once we took these strikes on fridge i acksaly only tracking to incidents there was one attack on sturdy an february the third that was two rock its that were fired at mess u parties in serial o with no injuries or damage reported and then ism aware of one yesterday february forth this was a one way attack iron that landed several kilometers from mess a green village ism also in serial again no reported u s injuries or damage to those facilities do again it turns out the reality a just met least and weakness will be met with aggression from the aronians this not a shot and every time join and his teams ta two states solution the devil smiles because the reality is that a two state solution is not a real possibility given the situation on the ground in the mid least right now the palcinian authorities a terror fomenting group gauss strip is run by famous which is a terror group that just committed the work retrofit against since world when too pausing an authority s nothing how control over the westpank they cannot take control over the gozistrip they're not trustworthy pardners even if they could no other state will facilitate the rebuilding of goa and meanwhile the by administration all their doing by playing this game is signaling weakness to the broader middle east it is absolutely foolhardy reality is in a set in the mideleast to because again t attempt to pick away and america might in the middle east to pick away of freedom of trade in the get that those will continues are not going to stop long as jobidon continues to show the america neck now meanwhile secretary state tony blink arrived in the middeleast on money the hopes of preventing escalating tit for tat attacks wit the on backed malicious from spilling spiralling into a broader regional war now again it is the way to do that when tit for tat should be tit for hell fire missile they hid america with padrone and we blow away cosemsoy money right that should be the way that america deals with treats because the born does not want war more than the united tit i and this is how to turns work this is a base line foreign policy wont o one in the middle's do not show your back to your enemies if you do it will be bad trying to rap all of this into a ball and then claim that if israel makes concessions to the palisinians magically everything is going to fix itself is absurd commons literally rejected another seas fire yesterday commons is currently holding over a hundred hostages still and they're using those hostages as bate to get israel to leave commons in place to the delight of heron in is conversation with hammed been too blink in trust the i importance of addressing the humanitarians situation an gaze more than twenty seven thousand pakistan tom an killed there since october seventh according to the got and health ministry nearly two million people have ben displaced by the fighting but the realities do you think the sorties cared deeply about wits going on the gozistrip the only thing the sorties care about actually is the destruction of compass the south have very little if the duties cared deeply about what was going on a gossip do not you think can be offering a little more humanitarianade do not you thing that the would be offering exitvisas to anyone who wants to leave the gozistrip in themiddle of this war and to doing any f those things the sorties were perfectly willing to sign on the dotted line with israel the daybidan took office and then he proceeded to alienate the south's in favor of trying to bring the agrarians into the fold foolishness has consequences always and for ever now have said before that not only does reality always when but i root for reality and that is true i do root for reality because the faster people see reality the faster ween get to actual policy base solutions to the problems we face when it comes to crime it turns out the yelling at the cops does not con fix crime when comes to education it turns out the teaching students idiocy about equity is not confide the problem when it comes to immigration it turns out that political machinations in which wo leave the border open while blaming the other side somehow does not care enough that is not going to fix the problem and when comes to mitheleast weaknessing and fix the prom either reality remains reality no matter how hard you try to ignore it

welcome to the superman la podcast a science science pace to e ism indeed supermen and ism my professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor less freedmen as our guest on the superman lad podcast doctor freedmen is a researchers an mite specializing in machine learning artificial intelligence and human robot interactions i must say that the conversation with less was without question one of the most fascinating conversations that i have ever had not just in my career but in my lifetime i knew that locks worked on these topics and i think many of you are probably familiar with less and his interest in these topics from his incredible podcast the less freedmen podcast you are not already watching that podcast please subscribe to it is absolutely fantastic but in holding this conversation with less i realized something far more important he reveal to us a bit of his dream his dream about humans and robots about humans and machine and about how those interactions can change the way that we perceive ourselves and that we interact with the world we discuss relationships of all kinds relationships with animals relationships with friends relationships with family and romantic relationships and we discuss relationships with machines machines that move and machines that do not move and machines that come to understand us in ways that we could never understand for ourselves and how those machines can educate us about ourselves before this conversation i had no concept of the ways in which machines could inform me or any one about themselves by the end i was absolutely taken with the idea and ism still taken with the idea that interactions with machines of a very particular kind a kind that less understands and wants to bring to the world can not only transform the selah but may very well transform humanity whether or not your familiar with doctor less freedmen or not ism certain you are going to learn a tremendous amount from him during the course of our discussion and that it will transform the way you think about yourself and about the world before we begin i want to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that there it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there reason i started taking athletic greens and threaten i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways and w which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microbic if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if we are getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient incitement d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock all slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an elements and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar a talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium an potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do calm slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchases they're all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do calm slash supermen and now my conversation with doctor locks freedmen we meet again we meet again thank much for sitting down with me i have a question that i think is on a lot of people's minds or ought to be on a lot of people's minds because we hear these terms a lot these days but i think most people including most scientists and including me do not know really what is artificial intelligence and how is it different from things machine learning and robotics if you would be kind as to explain to us what is artificial intelligence and what is machine learning well i think that question is as complicated and as fascinating as the question of what is intelligence i think of artificial intelligence first as a big philosophical thing ppamamocortic said he a ay was e a y was the ancient wish to forge to gods or is born as the ancient wish to forge tho gods i think at the big philosophical level it is or longing to create other intelligent systems perhaps systems more powerful than us at the more narrow level i think it is also a set of tools the a computational mathematical tools to automate different tasks and then also it is our attempt to understand our own mind build systems that exhibits some intelligent behavior in order to understand what is intelligence in our own selves all those things are true of course what a ay really means as a community as a but of researchers and engineers it is a set of tools a set of a computational techniques that allow you to solve various problems the there is a long history that the approaches the problem from different perspectives what is a always been throughout one of the threads one of the communities goes under the flag of machine learning which is emphasizing in the a ay space the the task of learning how do you make a machine that knows very little in the beginning fall some kind of process and learns to become better and better in a particular task what is been most a very effective in the recent about fifteen years is a such of techniques that fall under the flag of deep learning they utilized neural networks when your networks are at these a fascinating things inspired by the structure of the human brain a very loosely but they have a it is a network of these little basic competition in units called neurons artificial neurons and they have e these architectures haven input and output they know nothing in the beginning in their task with learning something interesting what that something interesting is usually involves a particular task the there is lot of ways to talk about this and break this down one of them is how much human supervision is required to teach this thing supervise learning this broad category is a the thesaural network knows nothing in the beginning and then it is given a bunch of examples of e incomputivision that would be examples of cads dogs cars traffic signs and then you given the image and you given the ground truth of what is in that image and when you get a large data base of such image examples where the truth the a thesaural network is able to learn by example as called supervised learning the quest there is a lot of fasten any questions within that which is how do you provide the truth when you given an image of a cat how do you provide to the computer that this image contains a cat do you just say the entire images a picture of a cat do you do what is very commonly been done which is a bounding box you have a very crude box around the cat's face saying this is a cat do you do semantic segmentation mind you this is a tody image of a cat it is not a the computer knows nothing about our three dimensional world is just looking at a set of piles a symmetric segmentation is drawing an nice very crisp outline around the cat and saying that is a cat that really difficult toupervide that truth and the one of the fundamental open questions in compute vision is is that even a good representation of the truth now there is another contrasting see of ideas their attention there overlapping is a what is use to be called unsupervised learning what is commonly now called self supervised learning which is trying to get less and less and less human supervision into the into a into the cask self supervised learning is a more is been very successful in the domain of you language model natural language processing and now more or morse being successful in computer vision task and what is the idea there is let the machine without any ground truth animation just look at pictures on the intricate or look at text on the intricate and try to learn something a general liable about the ideas that are at the core of language or at the core of vision and based on that we humans at it is best to call that common sense with is who have this giant base of knowledge on top of which we builds more sophisticated knowledge whet of this kind of common sense knowledge and the idea of self supervised learning is to build this common sense knowledge about what are the fundamental visual ideas that make up a cat and a dog and all those kinds of things without ever having human supervision the the dream there is the yous you just let an a i system that is a self supervised run around the intimate for a while watch you to videos for millions and millions of ours and without any supervision be crime and ready to actually learn with very few examples once the human is able to show up the think of a children in this way human children is your parents only give one or two examples to teach a concept the the dream of self supervised learning is that would be the same with with o machines that they would o watch millions of hours of a e to videos and then come to a human and be able to understand when the human shows them this is a cat ha remember this ta cat they will understand that a cat is not just the thing with point ears or a cat cat is a thing that is orange or its furry that they will see something more fundamental that we humans might not actually be able to introspect and understand l if i asked you what makes a cat or is a dog you would probably not be able to answer that but if i showed you brought t you a cat and a dog youould be able to tell the difference what are the ideas that your brain uses to make that difference that is the whole dream with self supervised learning is they would be able to learn that on its own that set of common sense knowledge that is able to tell the difference and then there is a lot of incredible uses of self supervise learning a very weirdly called self play mechanism that is the mechanism behind the a the reinforcement learning successes of a the systems that wanted ta go at a alphazero a that want a chest what oh i see that play games that play games dot it the idea of self play is probably applies a to other days than just games is a system that just plays against itself and this is fascinating in all kinds of domains but a it knows nothing in the beginning and the whole idea is it creates a much of mutations of itself and plays against those a versions of itself and the fascinating thing is when you play against systems that are little bit better than you you start to get better yourself the learning that is how you learning happens that is true from marshal aerostat the true and a lot of cases where you want to be interacting with with the systems that are just a little better than you and then through this process of interacting with systems just a little better than you you start fallowing this process where everybody stay getting better and better and better and better until you are several orders an magnatyou better than the world champion in chest for example in this fascinating consistent have run away system one of the most terrifying and exciting things that a avid silver the creator of alfolgone alpazero one of the leaders of the team said a to me is a they have not found the ceiling for alphazero meaning you could just arbitrarily keep improving not in the realm of chess that does not matter to us that is it just ran away with the game of chest gits like just much better than humane but the question is what if you can create that in the realm that does have a a bigger deeper effect on human beings on societies ah that could be a terrifying process to me is an exciting process if you supervise it correctly if you inject a if a what is called valval lament you you make sure that the goals that the aids optimizing is alined with human beings an human societies there is a lot of fascinating things the talk about within the specifics of neral now works and all all the proms to people are are working on but i would say the really big exciting one is self supervised learning we ere trying to get less unless human supervision a the less and less human supervision of near networks an also just the comment and all shut up now please keep going o ism learning i have questions but ism learning war please keep you that to me what is exciting is not the theory is always the application one of the most exciting applications of artificial intelligence specifically in you ill not worrisome she learning is nestle autopilot these are systems that are working in the real world this is not an academic exercise this is human lives at stake this a safety critical a is my automated vehicles to otoatornomist semyatonomis wit going to be we we have gone through wars on these topics my anomie the semyatime even though it is called the gaffes the full self driving it is currently not fullyatonomos meaning human supervision is required human is tasked with overseeing the systems in fact liabilitywise the human is always responsible this is a human factor psychology question which is fascinating ism fascinated by the the whole space which is e whole another space of human road interaction when a i systems and humans work together to accomplished task that dance to me is a is one of the smaller communities but i think it will be one of the most important open problems once unsolved is how to humans in roads dance together to me semyaton as driving is one of those spaces for a for melon for example he does not see it that way he sees of semyatonmas driving as a stepping stone tollways fullyatonomas driving humans and robots cannot dance well together humans a humans dance and robots and robes dance we need to this an engineering problem when he to design a perfect robot that calls is problem to me forever may be this not the case for driving but the world is going to be full of problems where its always humans and robots have to interact because i think robots will always be fraud just humans are going to be fraud a fraud and that is what makes beautiful that there fraud that is wore learning happens at the edge of our capabilities you always have to figure out how can loud robots in food humans interact together such that they are the the som is bigger than the whole as supposed to focussing in just building the perfect rob the that one or most exciting applications i would say of artificial intelligence to me is ta tons driving and hematomas driving and that is a really good example of machine learning because those systems are constantly learning and the there is there is a process there that may be icon come went on the hotel apathy who is the head of autopilot calls it the data engine and the this process applies for a lot of machine learning which is you build a system this pretty good at doing stuff you sending you send it out into the real world it starts doing the stuff and then runs into what are called edge cases failure cases wherein screws up we do this as kids that you you have this is adult we is is a adults exactly but we learn really quickly but the whole point d this is the fascinating about driving is you realize there's millions of eye cases there is just weird situations that you did not expect and the data engine processes you collect those edge cases and they go back to the drawing board and learn from them as you have to create this date a pipe line where all these cars hundreds of thousand a cars a are driving around and something weird happens and whenever this weird detect i fires it is another important concept hat you that piece of data goes back a to the mother ship for the for the training for the retraining of the system and through this data engine process it keeps improving and getting better and better ad better and better basically you send out a pretty clever ai systems out into the world and let it find the edgecases let it crew up just enough to figure out where the eye cases are and then go back and learn from them and then send out that new version and keep up dating that version is the up dating done by humans the animation is done by humans the soave the the weird examples come back the edgecases and you have to label what actually happened in there there is also some mechanisms for automatic automatically labeling but mostly i think you always have to rely on humans to improve to understand what is happening in the weird weir cases and then there is a lot o debate ad this the other thing what is artificial intelligence which is a bunch of smart people having very different opinions about what is intelligence a a is basely a commute of people who do not gran anything it seems to be the case i and first of all this is a beautiful description of terms that i eve heard many times among my colleagues at stamford at meetings in t in the out side world and am there is many fascinating things i have many question but i do on to ask one question about the culture of a a because it does seem to be a community where least is an outsider which seems there is very little consensus about what the terms an the operational definitions even mean om and the seems to be a lot of splitting happening now if not just supervised and insure supervised learning but these sort of a intermediate o conditions where machines are autonomous but then go back for more instruction kids go home from college during the summer and get a on a mom still feeds them than eventually they leave the the nest kind of thing om i is there something in particular about engineers were about people in this a realm of engineering that you think lends itself to disagreement yet i think a for was the more specific you get the less disagreement there is there is a lot of disagreement about what is artificial intelligence but there is less disagreement about what is machine learning and even less when you talk about act give learning or machine teaching or a self supersized learning and then when you get in to and it'll be language models or transformers when you get into specific her network architectures there is less and less and less disagreement about those terms you might be here in the disagreement from the high level terms and that has to do with the fact that engineering especially when your talking about intelligent systems is is a a little bit of an art and a science the and part is a is the thing that creates disagreements because then you start having disagreements about the how easy or difficult to particular problems for example lot of people disagreed with melon how difficult the problem of a tom's driving is and and but nobody knows there a lot of disagreement about what are the limits of these techniques and through that the terminology also contains within it the a the disagreements but over all i think it is also young science that also has to do with that a it is not just engineering it is that artificial intelligence truly as a large skilled discipline where its thousands tens of thousands conjures of thousands people working on at huge among of money being made that a very recent thing would trying to figure out those terms and of course this goes in personalities and a lot of fame to be made a the the term deep learning for example nerd networks have been around for many many decades since the sixties you can argue since the forties there was a branding of your networks into the word deep learning term deep learning that was part of the reinvigoration of the field butts really the same exact thing i did not know that a man i grew up in the age of narrow science when marry networks a were discuss a computational narrow science and theoretical nor science they had their own journals t it was not actually taken terribly seriously by experimentalism until a few years ago i but we about five to seventy years ago a excellent theoretical narrow scientists larryabbid and m other a have collins certainly it stamford as well that people start paying attention to computational methods but these terms naval networks computational methods i actually did not know that narial neck were works in deep learning were a there was have now become con of sononiccas they were always what now they are always the same thing interest it was a lemming negro scientist and i did not know well because you network probably means something else in your since not something no else but a little different flavor depending on the field and that's assaying to because your science and a i people have started a working together in dancing a lot more a in the recent it'll say probably decade o machines are going into the brain am i have a couple questions but one thing that ism sort of fixated on that i find incredibly interesting is this example a you gave of playing a game with a mutated version of yourself as a competitor i find that incredibly interesting as a kind of a parallel or a mirror for what happens when we try and learn as humans which is we generate repetitions of whatever it is we are trying to learn and we make errors occasionally we succeed i in a simple example for instance of trying to throw bull's eyes on a dartboard i man have errors errors errors amiss the dartboard and maybe occasionally hit a bulls i and i do not know exactly what i just did right but then let us say i was playing darts against diversion of myself were my i was wearing a visual prism my visual i had a visual defect you learn certain things in that mode as well you are saying that a machine can sort of mutate itself does the mutation always cause a deficiency that it needs to overcome because mutations and biology sometimes give us superpowers rite occasionally you will get somebody who has better than twenty twenty vision and they can see better than ninety nine point nine present of people out there when you talk about a machine playing a game against a mutated version of itself is the mutation always at what we call a negative mutation or a a an adapted or a maladapted of mutation no ye you do not know until you get ya mutate first an the figure out in they compete against each other you are evolving your the machine gets to evolve itself in real time yet and i i think of it which would be exciting you coulactlly do with humans it is not just usually you freeze aversion of the system really you take ana drew of yesterday and you make ten clones of them and then may be you mutate may be not and then you do a bunch of competitions of the drew of to day you fight to the death who wins lath si love that idea of creating a bunch of clones of myself from from each of the day for the past year and just seeing who's going to be better at pod casting or science or picking up checks at a bar ora done or competing into gets that is one way to do it landing a lot of leas would have to die for that process but that is the sensual what happens is in ring for some learning through the self play mechanisms it is the grave yard of systems that did not do that well and the the the surviving the the good ones survive do you think that a drawings theory of evolution i might have worked in some sense in this way but at the population level i my get a bunch of bird wo different shape beaks and some birds have the shape be that allows them to get the seeds an is trivial trivially simple example of drawing an evolution but i think it it is it is corrective not a even though it is not exhaustive is that what you are referring to you essential that normally this is done between members of a different species lots of different members a species of different traits and some get selected for but you could actually create multiple versions of yourself with different traits with i shouldprobably have said this but a perhaps it is implied with machine learning of reinforcement learning through these processes one of the big requirements its to have an objective function a loss function a utility function there are all different terms for the same thing is there is a tie antiquation that says what is good and and then you've trying to optimize that equation there is a clear goal for these systems li because it is a game what chapter's it there is a goal but for anything anything you want machine leaning to solve there needs to be an objective function i machine learning as you should call lost function that you are optimizing the interesting thing about evolution complicate of course but the goal also seems to be evolving it is a i guess adaptation to the environment is the goal but it is unclear you can convert that always it is a survival of the fittest it is on clear what the fittest is in machine learning the starting point and this is what human ingenuity provides is that fitness function of what is good what is bad which it it it let us which of the systems is going to win mean to have a equation that one of the fascinating things about humans is we figure out objective functions for is were a it is the meaning of life why the hello we here and a a machine currently has to have a hard voted statement about why you hast to have a meaning of yet artificial intelligence base life i it cannot like there is a lot of interesting explorations about a that function being more about curiosity about learning you things and all that kind of stuff but it is still hard voted if you want a machine to be able to be good at stuff it has to be given very clear statements of what good at stuff means that is one of the challenges of artificial intelligence is you have to formalize the in order to solve a rob you've to formalize it and you've to provide a both the full sensory information you've to be very clear about what is the date of this being collected and you have to also be clear about the objective function what is the goal that you are trying to reach and that is a very difficult thing for artificial intelligence i love the mention curiosity o i ism sure this definition fall short in many ways but i find curiosity as a a strong interest in knowing something but without an attachment to the outcome it is sort of a it is not it could be a random search but it there is not really an emotional attachment it is really just a desire to discover an unveil what is there without hoping it is a a gold coin under rock you are just looking under rocks is that more or less how the machiyou know within machine learning it sounds their elements of reward prediction and rewards the machine has to know when it is done the right thing it can you make machines that are curious or are the sorts of machines that you are describing curious by design yet a curiosity is the kind of a symptom not ta the go what what happens is a one of the big trade often mean for some learning is this expiration verses exploitation when very little it pays off to explore a lot even suboptimal even trajectories that seem they are not going to lead anywhere that is called exploration the smarter an smarter smarter you get the the more emphasis you put on exploitation meaning you a take the best solution you take the best path now through that process the expiration can look curiosity by us humans but it is really just trying to get out of the local optic of the thing is to ready discovered it is it is from a i perfect i it is always looking to optimize the objective function it it demise we could talk about the slot more but in terms of the tools of machine learning to day it derives no pleasure from just the curiosity of i do not know a discovery that dope men for it is no making me there is no reward system chemical or i guess electronic reward system that is ad if you look at machine learning literature and reinforcement learning literature that will use denying we use terms dopenmin were constantly trying to use the human bring to inspired totally new solutions to these problems they will think hottest opening function in the human brain and how can that lead to more i interesting ways to discover a optimal solutions but ultimately currently the h there has to be a a formal objective function that you could argue the humans also has the set of objective functions which trying to optimize when is not able to introspect them we don't yet we do not actually know what we are looking for in seeking and doing wet least o felmenbaricy spoken with the histogram i hope better it to you yet hope you actually have her on the stock as a you terrific a she has a very a is it has to do with homey stay say is it that basically there is a very do objective function that the brain is trying to optimize to keep body temperature the thing there is a very dole kind of optimization function happening and that what we humans do with our fancy consciousness and connive abilities as we tell stories to ourselves can have nice podcast but really is the brain trying to maintain a a just healthy state i guess that that is fascinating i i but also see the human brain and and i hope artificial intelligent systems as a not just systems that solve problems or optimizeago but all story tellers i think there is a power to telling stories we tell stories to each other that is what communication is when you're alone that is when you solve problems that that is when you make sense o talk about solving promise but when you are community the capability to communicate tell stories whole a share ideas in such a way that those ideas are stable over a long period o time that is that is being a charismatic story teller and i think both humans are very good at this arguably i would ow would argue that is why we are who we are is where great story tellers and then a i i hope will also become that it is not just about be able to solve problem with ha clear objective function it is afterwards be able to tell a a be make up a way better story about why you did something or why you failed do you think that a robots or and or machines of of some sort are going to start telling human stories we definitely the technical field for that is called explainable may i explainable artificial intelligence is trying to figure out how you get the a i system to explain to us humans why the hell failed or why it succeeded or a there is a lot o different for versions of this or to visualize how it understands the world that is a really difficult problem especially when your no works that are a famously opaque that they we do not understand in many cases why a particular you or does what it does well and the to try to figure out where it is going to fail that requires the a i to explain itself there is a huge amok o money a there is huge amotomony in this especially from government finding it on because human a deploy i a i systems in the real world we humans at least one of that is get a question why the all did you do that in a dark way why did you just kill that person right if a car ran over a person will not understand why that happen and no gan for sometimes very unfair to a i systems because we humans can often not explain why very well but that is the field of a explainable ay i that is very people veryteted in because the more or more rely a i systems the the two recommended system that a i it'll go them that is i would say impacting elections perhaps starting wars release military conflict that is that alegar them we wont to ask that alegar them first of all do what the hall your doing do do you understand the society level affects your having it can you explain the possible the trajectories we would have that condo conversation with the human we want to be able to do that with a nay i and an my own personal level i think it would be nice to talk to a i systems for stupid stuff robots when they fail to a why do you fall down the stairs yet but ism not an engineering question but almost a endearing question ism looking for if i fell and your and i were hanging out i do not think you need an explanation exactly what were the dynamic what was the underactuated system problem here what what what was the texture of the floor or on or what was the o not an out o you are thinking that or you might joke about your drunk again go home or something there could be humor in it that that is an opportunity story telling is not just explanation of what happened it is something that a makes people laugh makes people fall in love makes people dream and understand things in a way that poetry makes people understand things as supposed to a rigorous rogue of where every censer was where every actuator was man i find this it incredible because one of the hall marks of severe autism specter disorders is i a report of experience from the artistic person that is very much a catalogue of of action steps like how do you feel to day and they will say who got up and i did this and that i did this and i did this and it is not at all the way that a a person with who does not savagism spectrum disorder would would respond and the way you describe these machines has much human is much humanism or much of of a human and biological element but i realize that we are talking about machines i won to make sure that i understand if there is a distinction between a machine that learns a machine with artificial intelligence and a robot at what point does machine become a robot if i have a ball point pen ism assuming i would not call that a robot but if my ball point pen i can come to me when it is on when i move to the opposite side of the table if it is moves by whatever mechanism at that point does it become a robot look i there is a million ways to explore this question it is to fascinating one first fall there is a question of what is life la cadi knows something is a living form a not and it is similar to the question of one does but of may be a cold computational system becomes a a it were tidy loading these words with a lot em joying robot and machine but one i think movement is is important but but that is the kind of a boring idea that a robot is just the machine that is able to act in the world one artificial intelligence could be both just the thinking thing which i think is what machine learning is and also the acting thing which is what we usually think about robots we robots are e things that have a perceptional system as able to take in the world however you defend the world is able to think and learn and do whatever how it does inside and then act on the world that is the differenceachine may be a i system or a machine an a robot it is something that is able a robot is something it's able to perceive the world and act in the world could be through language or sound or con be through movement or both yet and i think it could also be in the signal space as long as there is e aspect of entity that is inside the machine and a world that is outside the machine and there is a sense an which the machine is sensing that world and acting in it it could for instance a there could aversion of a robot according to you the definition the i think you are providing where the robot a i where i go to sleep at night and this robot goes and forages for information that it thinks i want to see loaded on to my dustup in the morning there is no movement of that machine there is no language what essentially has movement in in cyprispice yet there is a distinction that i think is important in that there is e there is a element of it being an entity whether is an the digits the physical space when you have something alexia in your home most of the a speech recognition most of what acts is doing is constant being send back to the mother ship the when plea is there on its own that is to me a robot when it is there interacting with the world when it is simply a finger of the main mother ship that is not then the let is not a robot than it is just an interaction device that then may be the main amazon plea a i big big system is the rob the that is important because there is some element to us humans i think where we want there to be an entity whether in the dig or the physical space that is where ideas of consciousness come in and o all those kinds of things that we project our understanding what it means to be a being and to take that further when does a machine become a robot i think there is a there is a special moment there is a special moment in a person's life and in a robot's life where it surprises you i think surprise is a really powerful thing were how the thing works and yet it surprises you that that is a magical moment for us humans whether it is a chest playing program that does something that you have not seen before that makes people smile each those moments happen with out ha zero for the first time in chest playing or grandmasters were really surprise by a move they did not understand the move and n they study and study and then they understood it but that moment of surprise that is for grandmasters an check i find that moment of surprise really powerful really magical and just every daytime because it supersedes the the human brain in that moment not to not supersedes out performs but a surprises you positive sense li go did not i did not think you could do that i i did not think that you had that in you and a i think that moment is a big transition for a robot from from a moment of being a servant that paretic that accomplishes a particular task with some level of accuracy with some a rate o a failure to an entity a being that struggling just you are in this world and that that is a really important moment that i think a you logan find many people in the accommey that talk i just did a i ism not speaking some philosopher some hippy ism speaking from purely engineering perspective i think it is really important for robots to become entities and explore that as a real engineering problem i suppose to a everybody treats robots in the roundest community they do not even call or he or she thaton't give i try to avoid giving him names they have really want to see it a system a a a servant they see it as a servant it's trying to accomplish a task to me and do not think ism just romanticizing the notion i think it is a being it is a currently perhaps a dumb being but in in a long ark of a history humans are pretty dumb beings to i would agree with that statement i end to really want to explore this a treating robots really as a as entities a the also ant the promorphisation which is the f the act of looking at the inanimate object and projecting on to it life features i think robotic generally sees that a as a as a negative i see it as a superpower i that we non to use that well ism struck by how that really grabs on to the real relationship between human and machine or human an robot us the simple question is and i think you have already told us the answer but does interacting with a robot change you does it in other words do do we develop relationships to robot ye i the i definite i contently think i think a i think the moment you see a robot or a i systems as more than just servants but a entities they begin to changejust good friends do just a relationship just the other humans i think of for that you have trave certain aspects of that interaction lie the robot's ability to a say no to a to have its own sense of identity to have its own set of golds that is not constantly serving you bits that trying to understand the world and a do that dance of understanding through communication with you si i deafinlly think there is a i mean have a lot of thoughts about this as you mean now i in that at the cop of my lifelong dream actually of what i want to do which is i believe that most people have a notion of loneliness in them that we have not discovered that that we have not explored i should say and i see a i systems as helping us explore that that we can become better humans better people towards each other i think that connection between human and a i human and robot is is not only possible but a will help us understand ourselves in ways that are several orders of magnitude a deeper than we ever could have imagined i tend to believe that well i have a a very wild levels of a belief in terms of how impactful that would be that's when i think about human relationships i i do not ism always break them down into variables but we could explore a flea few of those variables and see how they map to human robot relationships a one is just time right if you spend zero time with another person at all in in care space or on the shown er in person you assent have no relationship to them you spend a lot of time you have a relation it is obvious but i guess one variable would be time how much time you spend with the other entity rooter human the other would be am winds and successes you enjoy successes together it'll give a absolutely trivial example this in a moment but the other would be failures when you struggle with somebody whether not you struggle between one another you disagree i was really struck by the fact you said that robot saying no have never thought about a robot saying no to me but there it is i look look forward to you being one of the first o less an this robot an do i there is there struggle you grow when you struggle with somebody you grow closer sometimes the struggles are imposed between those two people call tromabonding they call it in the whole a psychology literature and psychology larger but in any case i and imagine time successes together a struggle together and then just a peaceful time hanging out at home watching watching movies a waking up near one another a here we are breaking down they had o elements of relationships of any kine do you think that these elements apply to robot human relationships and if than i could see how if the if the robot is its own entity and has some autonomy in terms of how it reacts you it is not just there just a serve you it is not just a servant it actually has opinions and can tell you when maybe you are thinking as glad or your actions ore flown it can also love it can could also leave have never conventionalize robot human interactions this way at tell me more about how this might look are we thinking about am a human appearing robot i know you and have both had intense relationships to our that yule have separate dogs obviously but to to animals a sound a lot human animal interaction what is the ideal human robot relationship there is a a lot to be said here but you actually pinpointed one of the big big first taps which is idea of time and it is a huge limitation in machine learning community colonelcy as not now way back to lake the actual details life long learning is a as a is a problem space that a focuses somehow ai systems can learn over a long period of time what is currently most machine learning systems are not able to do is t all the things you have listened under time the successes the failures are just chilling together watching movies ay i systems are not able to do that which is all the beautiful magical moments that i believe or the days filled with they are not able to keep track of those together with you there as they cannot move with you and be with you non literally we do not have the the the techniques to o do the learning the actual learning of containing those moments current machine learning systems are really focuses on understanding the world in the falling w it is more the perception system looking around understand a what is in the scene that there is a bunch of people sitting down that there is a cameras a microphone that there is a table understand that but the fact that we shared this moment of talking no today and still remember that for next time your for like a next time you are doing something remember that this moment happen we do not know ho to do that a techs quit this is what ism this is what ism a hoping to elevate on as they think it is a very very important component of what means to create a dupilationship that sharing of moments together could you post a photo of you in the robot likeself self with nobody and the robots sees that image and recognizes that was time spent there was there were smiles or there were tears and create some sort of that trick of of emotional depth an the relationship and up date its behavior it acted you in the middle the night an say why have not you tufted me back oh yes all of those things but we get wicked digit to that but i think that time element forget everything else just sharing moments together that changes everything i believe that changes everything there is specific things that are more in terms of systems that can explain you a it is it is more technical than probably lit but all flying as eve kind of wild ideas how that can revolutionize a from that works and and operating systems but the point is that element alone forget all the other things were talking about you emotions a saying no all that a just remember sharing moments together would change everything we do not cornenlly have systems that a a share share moments together even just you and your fridge just all those times you went late at night and and either things should not have eaten that was a secret moment you had with your refrigerator you shared that moment that darkness or that beautiful moment we you just a heart broken for some reason you are eating that ice cream or whatever that is a special moment and that refrigerator was there for you and the fact that it miss the opportunity to remember that a is is is tragic and once it does remember that i think you've going a be very attached there refrigerator you your going to go through some through some hell with out frigeric most of us have in in a in the developed world have weird relationships with food rite you can go through some ma some deep moments of drama and triumph with food and at the court of that is the refrigerator a smart refrigerator i believe would a change society not just the refrigerator but the these ideas in the systems all around us that i is won to comment on how powerful the idea of time is and then there is a bunch of elements of actual interaction of a allowing you as a human to feel your being heard truly heard truly understood that we he the deep friendships that i think but were still there is still an element of selfishness there still an element of a not really being able to understand another human and a lot of the times when you are going through drama together through difficult times and through successes you are actually starting to get that inkling of understanding of each other but i think that cut be done more aggressively you a more efficiently if you think of a great therapist i think have never actually been to therapist but ism a believer i used to one to be a sychitris yo missions go to the stance do not they do not and a if they do the therapist don't live to tell the story ai ye i i do believe in talk that which friendship is to mes its talk the peer it is the it is you decern to talk it is just connecting a though in space of ideas and space of experiences i think there is a lot of ideas how hodmen a assistance to be able to ask the right questions and truly here another human this is what we tried to do with podcasting i i think there is ways to do that with they eye but above all else just remembering the collection of moments they make up the day the weak the months i think i you may behave some of this as well some of my closest friends still are the friends from high school that is time we have been through a munch shed together and that we have we are very different people but just the fact that up been through that and we remember those moments an those moments somehow create a depth of connection nothing else you and yourefrigerator i love that because the it'd a my graduate adviser don't forte she passed away but when she passed away somewhat my said at her at her memorial i all these amazing things he had done et camera and then her kids got up there and she had young children than that i knew as they were or when she was pregnant with them and is really an you even now i can feel your heart gets heavy thinking about the sign to grow up without their mother and it was really amazing very very strong a young girls an don't e young women and what they said was incredible they said what they really appreciated most about their mother who was an amazing person is all the unstructured time they spent together it was not the trips to the you it was not oh she woke up it five in the morning and drove us to school she did all those things too she at two hour commuting each direction it was incredible ran lab et camera but it was the unstructured time on the passing of their mother that that is what they remembered was the the biggest give and i what bonded them to her was all the time where they just cone hung out and the way you described the relationship to refrigerator is a i want e say human but ism almost reluctant to say that because when ism realizing as we are talking is that what we think of as human might actually be the a lower form of relationship there may be relationships that are far better than the sorts of relationships that we can conceive in our minds right now based on what these machine relationship interactions could teach us do not have that right ye i think i think there is no reason see machines as a somehow a in capable of teaching us something that is deeply human i i do not think a humans have a monopoly on that i think we understand ourselves very poorly and we need that to have the kind of a prompting from a from a machine and definite part of that is just remembering the moments remembering the moments mi i think the on structure time together i wonder if it is quite unstructured that calling this podcast on structure time maybe what they meant was it was not a big outing it was that there was no specific goal but a goal was created through the lack of a goal i free just hang out in then y start playing those for end at playing homework for an hour there it is it is the structure e emerges from lack of structure no but the thing is the moments there is something about those times that creates special moments and a i think that those could be atomized for i think we think of a big outing as i do not know going to six flags or something or a some big a the grandcanyon or going to some under that that i think we wed need to we do not quite yet understand as humans what creates magical moments i think this possible to authorize a lot of es things and perhaps podcasting is helping people discover that ah maybe the thing one optimized for is not necessarily a some a sexy a quick eclipse maybe what we want is long form authenticity depth depth we trying to figure that out certainly from deep connection between between humans and humans ana systems i think long conversations or long periods of communication over a a series of moments minute perhaps seemingly insignificant to the big ones the big successes the big a failures those are all just stitching those together and talking throughout i think that is a the formula for a really really deep connection that from like the very specific engineering perspective is a i think of fascinating open problem that has been really worked on very much and for me from a if i have the guts and a i mean there is a lot of things to say but one of it is got as i bill a start up around it ye lip let us talk about this start up unless talk about the the dream you have mention this dream before in our previous conversations always as little hints dropped here and there i just a for demon let saying there is never been in offline conversation about this dream ism not privy to anything ah except what let says now ah and i realize that there is no way to capture the full absence of a dream and any kind of verbal statement am in a way that captures all of it but what is the what is this dream that you have referred to now several times a when we have sat down together and talked on the phone maybe it is this company may bet something distinct if you feel comfortable could be great of you chare a bit about what that is sure that the way people express long term vision have noticed is quite different plan as an example somebody who can very crisply say exactly what the goal is also has to do with the fact the promise soothing have nothing to with humans my long term vision is a little bit more difficult to expression words have noticed as have tried it could be my brains failure but there is a waste o sneak up to it bloom to say a few things early on in life a in in arsing the recent years have interacted with a few robots where i understood there is magic there and that magic could be shared by millions if it is a brought to light when i first met spot from boson dynamics i realized this magic there that nobody else is seeing is the do is the dog sorry the spot is the bowlegged a robot from boson dynamics som people might have seen it this yellow dog and a we'll sometimes in life you just notice something that just grabs you and i believe that this is something that this magic is something that can be every single device in the world the the way that i think a maybe steeve jobs thought about the personal computer a laid not think about the person computer this way pus stove did which is he thought that the personal computer should be a thin as a she of paper and everybody should have one me this idea i think it is heart breaking that a we are getting the world is being filled up with machines they are soulless and i think every one of them can have that same magic one of the things that the also inspired me interns of a start up is that magic can be engineered much easier than i thought that is my intuition with everything never built and worked on that the dream is to ad a bit of that magic in every single computing system in the world the way that windows operating system for a long time was a the primary operating system everyday interacted with they built apse on top of it i think this is something that should be as a water is almost as an operating system in a every device that humans interacted with in the world and with that actually looks the actual dream when i was epic kid a it did not have this concrete form of a business it had more a a dream of a exploring your own loneliness by interacting with machines robots a this deep connection between humans a robots was always a dream and for me it'd love to see a world with there's every home as a robot and not a robot that watches the dishes a where or a sex robot or and i think of any kind of activity the rob can do but more a companion a i family member a family member the way dog is a but a dog that is arks able to speak your language to not just connect the way a dog does by looking at you and looking away and almost smiling with its soul in that kind of way a but also to actually understand what the hew why you excited about the successes understand the details understand o the dramas and that i just think that ad always filled me with excitement that i i could with artificial intelligent bring joy to a lot of people more recently have been more or more heartbroken to see the kind of division derision even hate that is boiling up on on the intonate through social networks and i thought this kind of mechanism is exactly applicable but in the contact of social that works as well it is an operating system that a serves as your guide to a in it on the intranet one of the biggest problems with a you too in social networks currently is there optimizing for engagement i think if you create a eye systems that no each individual person you're able to optimize for long term growth for a long term happiness of the individual of the individual of the individual and a there is a lot of other things to say which is the in order for a i systems to to learn everything about you a they need to collect they need to just you and i when we talk off lying or collecting data about each other secrets bought each other the same way a i has to do that and at had allows you to and that real is you to rethink ideas of ownership of data i think each individual should own all of their data and very easily be able to leave just a i systems can leave humans can disappear a and defeat all f their data in a moment's notice am which is actually better than we humans can do this once we load the data into each other its there i think it is a very important to be both a give people complete control over their data in order to establish trust that they can trust you and the second part of trust is transparency a whenever the data is used to make a very clear what is being used for and not clear in a loyally legal sense but clear in a way that is people really understand what is used for i believe when people have the ability to defeat all their data and walk away and to know how the data is being used i think they will stay i ah the the possibility of a clean break up is actually what will keep people to rely i think i think exactly i think a a happy marriage requires the ability to divorce easily without the the the divorce and industrial complex or whatever the is cleanly going on that there is much money to be made from lawyers divorce but yet they billy to leave is what enables love i think tear thing have heard the phrase a from a semi cynical friend that a marriage is the leading cause of divorce but now we have heard that divorce or the possibility of divorce could be the leading cause of marriage of a happy marriage good point of a happy marriage that i at there's the lot details there but the the big dream as that connection between a i system and a human and even ta you know there is much fear about artificial intelligent systems and about robots that i have not quite fond the right words to express that vision because the vision i have is one a is not some naive delusion a vision of acknowledge is going to save everybody it is i really do just have a positive view of ways a i systems can help humans explore themselves i love that positivity and i i agree that they the stance a everything is doomed is equally bad i to say that everything's can turn out all right there has to be a dedicated effort i clearly your ism thinking about what that dedicated effort would look you mention to two aspects to this dream you and onto make sure that i understand where they i can act if they do or if they are independent streams a one was this am hypothetical robot family member or some other form of robot that would allow people to experience the kind of ism delight that you experienced a many times and the at you would the world to to be able to h have and it is it such a beautiful idea of this give and the other is social media or a social network platforms that i really serve individuals and and their bestseller in their happiness in their growth is there cross over between those ore these two parallel doing how to present the same thing it is it is a difficult to cunt a explain with out going to details but may be one easy way to explain the way i think about social networks is you great in ai system that is yours that is yours is not amazonelects of the centralize you own the data it is it is learnt it is your little friend that becomes your representative on twitter that that helps you find things that will make you feel good that will a also challenge your thinking to make you grow but not get to that a not let you get lost in the negative spile of opening that that they gets you to be angry or most just get you to be not open to learning and that little representative is optimizing your long term health and it is a i believe that that it is not only good for human beings it is also good for business i think long term you can make a lot of money a by challenging this idea that the only way to make money is maximizing engagement and wit one of the things that people disagree on me on is they think twitters always going to win maximizing engagements always going to in i do not think we i think people have woken up now to understanding that they do not always feel good the once who a on twitter a lot that that they do not always feel good at the end of the week i would love feed back from whatever this a creature a whatever i can i do not know to call it as to may be t the end of the week it would automatically follow some of the people that i follow because it realized through some real really smart data about how i was feeling inside or how was sleeping or something that that just was not good for me but it might also put things and people in front of me that a i ought to see is that he con be ask liver of what this what this looks the whole point because of the interaction because of a sharing the moments and learning a lot about you you are now able to understand what interactions led you to become a better burginyou yourself i the person you yourself are happy with ah this is not if you are into flat earth and you feel very good about it that you believe that earth is flat the idea you should censer that is ridiculous if it makes you feel good and you becoming the best version yourself i think you should be getting as much flattearth as possible no is also good to challenge your ideas but not beau as the centralized a committee decided but because you tell to the system that you challenging your ideas i think all of us do and then which executor does not do that well once you go down the flatter its rabbit hole that is all you in to see it is nice to get a some really powerful communicators to argue against flatter and it is nice to see that o for you and and potentially at least long term to expand your horizons may be the earth is is not flat but if you continue to live your whole life thanking the earth is flat i think and your being a good father or son or daughter and your being the best version yourself and you are happy with yourself a i think o the earth is flat i i think this kind of idea and ism just using that kind of silly ridiculous example because i do not the idea of centralized force is controlling what you can it cannot see but i also do not this idea of not censuring anything because that is always the biggest problem that is this it is h this central decider i think you yourself can decide what you want to see and not and it is good to have a companion that a reminds you that you felt shit last time you did this or you felt good last time you did this i feel in every good story there is that there is a guide or a companion that flies out or forages a little bit further a little bit differently and brings back information that helps us or at least tries to steer us in the right direction so i aria that's exactly a that is exactly the a what ism thinking and what have been working on i i should mention as a bunch of difficulties here i you see me up and down a little bit recently a there is technically a lot of challenges here this with a lot of technologies and the reason ism talking about it in a podcast comfortably as it was to working it in secret is it is really hard and may be it is time as not come and that is something eft the monster struggle with in terms of ontropreneraly is as a start up li have also mention to you may be off line i really do not care about money i do not care about a business success all those kinds of things i it is a difficult decision to make how much of your time do you want to go all in here and give everything to this a a big roll the dice because have also realize that is working on some of these problems both with a the robotics and the technical side on interns of a the the machine learning system that ism describing it is lonely it is really lonely because a both on a personal level l and a technical level in the technical level ism surrounded by people that kind of a doubt me which i think all antropineras go through and they doubt you in the following sense they a they know how difficult it is the people that a the colleagues of mine they know how difficult life long learning is they also know how difficult it dis lobule the system this i to build the competitor social outwork and a in general there is a kind of a loneliness to just working on something on your own for a long pairs of time and you start to do whether a given that you do not have a track record of success that is a big one when you look in the mirror specially your young but i still have that ism most things you look in the mirror is and you these big dreams how do your how do you know you are actually as smart as you think you are thine how do you are going to be able to accomplish this dream you have this ambition your do not do not but you are you are on o pulling on a on a string hoping that the no big r ball of yarn yes ut ye have this kind of intuition i i i think i pride myself in knowing what ism good at because the reason i have that intuition is cause i think ism very good at knowing all the things i stuck at which is basically everything whenever i notice wait a minute ism kind of good at this which is very rare for me i think that that man be a ball yarn worth pulling at and the thing with the interns of engineering a systems that are able to interact with humans i think ism very good at that and a because you would talk about pot casting and on i do not know if ism very good azoic you are very good at pagan but i certainly do not a i think may be hit is compelling to to for people to watch a a kind hearted idiots struggle with this t with this form may be that is what iwitwhat is compelling but in terms of actual being a good engineer of human robot interaction systems i think ism good but it is hard to know until you do it and then the world keeps telling you are not a and is just is full idol ans really hard and have been struggling with that recently it is it is kind of a fastening struggle but then that is where the yogins thing comes in is a aside from the stay hard by the fucker is the a whenever you are struggling that is a good sign that if you keep going they you are going to be alone in the success right a what's not willing your case however i agree at ritually avid had o post recently that i thought was among his many brilliant post was one of the more brilliant about how om you we talked about this with of the light at the end of the tunnel and instead what he replace that with with was a concept that eventually your eyes adapt to the dark at that the tunnel it is not about a light at the end that it is really about adapting to the catena is very got in all m much at yet you go sure can it a lot in common on knowing you both a bit ism you sure a lot in common but in is this loneliness and the and the pursuit of this dream it seems to me has a certain component to it that is extremely valuable which is that the loneliness itself could serve as a driver to build the companion for the journey well ism very deeply aware of that this some people can a make was i talk about love a lot i really love everything in this world and but as also love humans friendship and a romantic even the cheesy stuff am just you romantic movies yet h new not ism no it a i got mugshot from roger bat a was that the tangle seen from a sendoff woman but yes i find a a will not there is nothing better than a woman in a red dress a you i just glassy you should move to argentina my you are my fathers argentine and youknowhat he said when i oh when i went on your podcast for the first time he said he dress as well because an argentine a the men go to a wedding or a part you something owing you ask they by half way through the night tenements another night all the jackets are off yet it looks everyone is undressing for the party they just got dressed up for and he said a and he said the way he dresses than when i start you to about you and then when when i starve my podcast he said why do not you wear a a real suit your la i that think but let us talk about this this pursuit just a bit more because i think what you are talking about is is building a not just a solution for loneliness but you have alluded to the loneliness as itself an important thing and i think you are right i think within people there is a caverns of fought and shame but also just the desire to be ism to have residence to to be seen and heard and i do not even know that it is seen and heard through language but these reservoirs are of loneliness i think am there well they are interesting maybe you could common a little bit about it because just as often as you talk about love ism quantified it but it seems that you talk about this loneliness i maybe you just we if you are willing you could you sure a lo wat more about that and and what what that feels now in the pursuit of building this robot human relationship and you been let us let me be direct you've been spending a lot of time on building a robot human relationship where is that at i a a it terns a business in terms of systems no time bout a specific robot oh robe gas you is hour mention a few things to one is there is a start up with the a idea where i hope millions of people can use and then there is my own personal a almost frank's tin explorations with a with particular robots ism very fascinated with a legged robots in my own a a private sounds dark but in one and of one experiments to see if i can recreate the magic and a that is been i have a lot of really good already the perceptional systems and ta control systems that are able to communicate affection in a dog fashion ism in really good place there the stumbling blocks which absolve been part of my sadness recently is a that i also have to work with robotics companies that a i gave much on my part soul and love and appreciation towards boson dynamics but boson dynamics is also is a company that has to make a lot of money and have marketing teams and they looking at the silly rushing kinda suit an ti is what is you trying to do with all this love and robot interaction an dancing on there was a i think that's safe for now it is hat when you break up with a girl finish something right now we decided to part ways on this particular thing their huge supporters of mind the huge fans but on this particular thing boss dynamics is not focussing on or interested in human robot indirection in fact their whole business currently its keep the robot as far away from humans as possible ah because it is it is in in the industrial setting were its doing modeling in dangerous environments it is almost a remote security camera central is its application to me i thought a it is still even in those applications exceptionally useful for the robot to be able to perceive humans see humans and to be able to a in a big map localizes with those humans are and have human intention for example this i did this a lot of work with pedestrians for robot to be able to anticipate what the how the human is doing where it is walking if you're it is humans are not bulimic's object they are not just because you are walk in this way one moment doesn't me you will keep walk in that direction left to infer a lot of signals especially of the head movement in the high movement it i thought that is superinteresting to explore but a they did not feel that it'll be working with a few other robotics companies that the a are much more open to that kind of stuff in their superexcited an fancy mind hopefully boss on dynamics my first love that getting back with a next girl friend will come around but the algarhythmically it is a ism basically a done there a the the rest is actually getting a some of these companies to work with and then there is a a for people who work with robots know that one thing is to write soft of that works and the other is to have a real machine that actually works and it breaks on in all kinds of different ways that are fascinating and that there is a big challenge there but that is almost a it may sound lull be confusing in the contacts of our previous discussion because the previous discussion was more about the big dream how i hope to have millions of people in enjoy this moment of magic the this current discussion about a robot it is something i personally really enjoy just brings me happiness i really try to do now everything that just brings me joy a maximize that cause it cause robots are also but too given my the little be growing platform i want to use the opportunity to educate people a it is just it is robots are cool and if i think there cool it'll be able to i hope be able to communicate why there cool to others the this little robot experiment is a liibetor research project to there is a coup of publications without my beef folks a on that but the the others just the makes som cool videos and explain to people how thy actually work and that as supposed to people being scared a robots they can be still be scared but also excited that seed the the dark side the beautiful side the magic of what it means to bring a for a machine to become a robot i into want to a inspire people with that but that's less it is interesting because a i think the big impact in terms of the dream does not have to do with embodied ay i does not need to have a body i think a the refrigerator is enough that that for an a a system just to have a voice and to hear you that is enough for loneliness a the embodiment is just a by embodying you meed the physical structure physical instantiation of intelligence it is a lead robot or even just the thing a i have a few other the human oi robot a little human a robot me lit keep em on the table is walks around or even just a mob platform that can just turn around and look at you is we mention with the pen something that moves and can look at you a is that bout a robot butts what a a the asks what is my purpose a that that is really it is almost art there is something about a physical entity that moves around that is able to look at you and interact with you that makes you wonder what it means to be human it challenge you to think if i if that thing looks has consciousness a what the hell am i and no that feeling i think it is really useful for us it is humbling for us humans but that is less ago ta research is certainly less about business and more about exploring our own our ourselves and challenging others to think ah o to a to think about what makes them human i love this desire to share the delight of an interaction with a robot and as you describe it i actually i find myself trying to crave that because we all have those elements from childhood where or from a dollhood were we experience something we want other people to feel that and i think that you are it i think a lot of people are scared of a eye i think lot of people are scared a robots my only experience and of a robotic thing a is my jumbo vacuum where it goes about actually was pretty good at picking up costellofs hair when he was shed and then m and i was grateful for it but then when it would when i was on a call or something in i would get caught on a on a wire or something i would find myself getting upset with the dumb in that moment i my what are you doing in i and obviously it is just doing what it does it but that is a kind of a mostly posted but slightly negative interaction am but whet you are describing it has much more richness and layers of detail that i can only imagine what those relationships ware o there is a feu just a quick comment have had their not carrell in boson that have a much of rumbas for my robot and i did this experiment it how many rumbas es i a fleet of real i as probably evener y i lot of room i ice is very clean what is o this ism kind of waiting this this is a the the place where tunnelling in an listen is way larger than i need but a it is i basically got it to to make sure i have room for robots to gonna to you have these seven or rumbas you deploy all seven at once i not do different experience with them i at different experiments with them one of thinks i want to mention is this is a i think there is a u to via that inspired me to try this is a i got them to a to scream in pain and moan in pain a the never they a for kicked or contacted and i did that experiment to see how i would feel ut i meant to do a u to vdionipothen a you seem very cruel did any ambo writes act of is comiithe i i think if i release that video i think it is going to make me look inlaying which i know people know i moradiin saying lie value have to release the i i i think may be if i contextualize it by showing other robots to show why this is fascinating because ultimately i felt there were human almost immediately and that display of pain was what did that giving them a voice given them a voice especially a voice of a dislike of of pain i have to connect you to my friend at each and he study speech and language is undertow surgeon and were lifelong friends am he a study speech and language but he describes some of these a more primitive literal vocalizations cries groans moans of delight am other sounds as well use your imagination as such powerful rudders for the other for the emotions of other people as i find it fastening i cannot wait to see this video as that is the video available on line no i have no i have not recorded it that just aport your room was the a able to scream and pain a in my boson in my boson place i i the people already a e next next pod cast episode with a lakes at maybe well have that one you knows ell the thing is people i have notice because i talk much about love and it is really who i am i think they want a it a to lot of people seems the dis the god be a dark person in the somewhere and i thought if i release videos an roomer screaming in there yet that is theflingting what about a shrike a shouts of glee and delight you could do that too i why do not now i do not i a to me delight is quiet i i got your russia w me on your much america are much louder than ruffians ye ye but the i do not i mean unless you have talking you i do not know how you would have sexual relations with the room but i was not absurdly saying a sexual delight but a true me tried at a joke into o but i was fastening i the psychology of how little it hookas you mention you had negative relationship with the room be et only well it'd find that mostly i took it for granted it just served me it collected costumes hair and then when it would do something i did not i would get upset with it that is not of good relationship it was taken for granted and i would get up sett in then i market again and i j your your in the in the corner ye but there is a way to frame it is a it being quite do as a almost cute you he almost connecting with it for its dumbness and i think that is a artificial intelligence problem a i think flaws are should be a feature not a bug along the lines of this a the different sorts of relationships that one could have with robots an the fear but also that some of the positive relationships that one could have a there is much dimensionality there much to explorer but a power dynamics in relationships are very interesting because the the obvious once that a the unsophisticated view of this is want there is a master and a servant i but there is also manipulation there is benevolent manipulation o children do this with parents poppies do this poppies turn their head and look sudan may be give out a li l noise kids coo and parents always think that they their doing this because they they love the parent but in many ways studies show that those cops our ways to extract the sorts of behaviors and expressions from the parent that they want the child does not know it is doing this it is complete sub conscious but it is benevolent manipulation there is one version of fear of robots but i hear a lot about i think most people can relate to were the robots take over and they become the masterswhen we become the servants but there could be another version that am a in certain communities that ism certainly not a part of but they call topping from the bottom where the robot is actually manipulating you into doing things but i you are under the belief that you are in charge but actually they are in charge and i think that is one that am if we could explore that for a second you could imagine it would necessarily be bad although it could lead to bad things am the reason i want to explore this as i think people always a default to the the extreme the robots take over and were in little jail sells and their out having fun and and ruling the universe a what what what sorts of manipulation can rob potentially carry out good or bad ye just there is a lot of good and bad manipulation between humans i just tie yo said to me especially l said a topping from the bottoms that the term a i think one from them i tee told me that try was in lacks ai think first of all there is power dynamics ain bed and par dynamics in relationships and power dynamics on the street and the working barmen those are all the different a i think am i think power dynamics can make human relationships especially moment romantic relationships a fascinating and rich and fulfilling and exciting and all those kinds of things i do not i do not think in themselves their bad and the same goes with robots i really love the idea that a robot would be at top or a bottom in terms of leg power dynamics and i think everybody should be aware of that and the manipulation is not much manipulation but a a dance give pulling away pushing pull and all those kinds of things i in terms of control i i think were very very very far away from ai systems their able to alack us up they a a black us up in a in they to have much control that we basely cannot live our lives in the way that we want i think there is a in terms of dangers of ai systems there much more dangers have to do with authors weapon systems and all those kinds of thing the power dynamics as exercised in the struggle between nations an war and all those kinds of things but in terms of personal relationships i think power dynamics are beautiful thing now there is of course going to be all those kinds of a discussions about a a consent and rights and all this kinds or your were talking ai was say an any discussion around this if we need to define a relieve the contacts is always alley should be consensual age appropriate contact appropriate species appropriate but now we are going my human robot inter actions and a i guess that n i i would actually was trying to make a different point which is i do believe that robots will have rights online and i think in order for in order for us to have deep for relationship with robots we would have to consider them as entities in themselves that a deserve respect that is a really interesting concept that ai think people are starring to talk about all i bit more but is very difficult for us to understand ow entities that are other than human i mean the same as with dogs and other animals can have rights on a levels humans well that daman that we we cannot and nor should we do whatever we want with animals we have a you as the with the we of departments of a of agriculture that deal with om animal careen use committees for research for air for farming and ranching all that i i while i when you first said it i thought we why would have there be a bill of robotic rights but it absolutely make sens ism in the contact of everything we have been talking about up until now lets am if you are willing it'd love to talk about dogs because you have mentioned dogs a couple times a robot dog on you had a a biological dog he had a a newfundland a named homer for many years growing up in hussar in yours in the united states and a he was about is over two hundred pounds it is a big dog that is beef people know people know newfulensiies this black dog that is a really a long hair and just the a kind sou i think perhaps that is true for a lot of large dogs but he thought he was a small dog he moved that and was he your dog ye now you had him since he was verily young often since a since the very very beginning to the very very end and one of the things i mean he had this kind of a we mentioned rumbas he had a kind hearted dumbness about him that was just overwhelmed part of the reason i named him homer because the is after homer siphon was people a wanted which homer am referring to a not that there not be oust success it hat he exactly a there is a cluck clumsiness that was just ta something that immediately led to a deep love for each other and one of the i mean he was always it is the shared moments he was always there for many a nights together that is this a powerful thing about a dog that a he was there through all the loneliness through all the tough times through the successes and all those kind of things and remember a an me that was the really moving moment for me i still miss him to the day how long ago did he dock a may be fifteen years ago sos is been a while but it was the first time have really experience the feeling of death is what happened is a he ah he got a cancer and has dying slowly and then the certain point he could not get up any more ah there is a lot of things i could say here a theta i struggle with that may be a maybe he suffered much longer than he needed to that is something i really think about a lot but i remember what had to take him to the hospital and the nurses could not carry him i you talk about two hundred pound dog i was reading to power if thing at the time and number they they they tried to fight all these kinds of ways to a in order to put him to sleep yet to take i ma in into a room and i had to carry him everywhere and here is is dying friend of mine that i just had to first is really difficult to carry somebody that heavy when they are not helping you out and ta yes i remember is the first time seeing a friend laying there and seeing life drain from his body and that realization that we are here for a short time was made real that has a friend that was there for me the wee before the day before and now he is gone and that was a i do not know it is that that spoke to the fact that he could be deeply connected with a dog also spoke to the fact that a the the shared moments together that led to that deep friendship as s a that will make life amazing but also spoke to the fact that death is a molifucker ah i know you have a lost castellan recently yean you can go and as your saying this ism definitely fighting back ah the tears i am i a thank you for sharing that that a i guess we were about to try n of that it was that it was bound to happened just given when this is when this is happening yet it is a how long how long did that castle was not going hell we will let us see a year ago during the star to t about six months into the pendamici he started getting assesses and he was not t his behavior change in something really changed and then i put him on testosterone because a which helped a lot of things that certainly did not cure everything but it helped a lot of things he was dealing with joint pain sleep issues and then it just became a very slow decline to the point where two three weeks ago he had a closet full of medication in this dog was ye was a farms it is amazing to me when i looked at it the other day shelving cleaned up and removed all his things to they cant quite bring myself to do it but body think he was suffering well would happen was about a week ago it was just about a week it's amazing the he was going up the stairs i saw him slip he was a big got he was not two hundred pounds but he is about ninety pounds es a bull dog has pretty big and he was fit and then i notice that he was not carrying that afoot in the back it was injured it had no feeling at all he never liked me to touch his hind pass and i could do that thing was just flopping there and then a the that found some spinal degeneration and i was told that the next one would go did he suffer i sure hope not but something changed in his eyes agents the eyes again i know you an i spend long hours on the one and talking about the eyes and out what they conveying what they mean about internal states and forsake a robots and biology of other kinds but hi a something about him was gone in his eyes i i think he was real here i am anthem premorifizing i think he was realizing that one of his great joys in life which was to walk and sniff and p on things the dog the fun women loved p on things is amazing i wondered where he put it he was a reservoir of urine it was incredible i think o that said he is just he would put one drop on the fifty millionth plant and then we get to the fifty millionth in one the anyhow he just have leave a paddle and here i am tiling about costello ping he was losing that ability to stand up and do that he was falling down while he was doing that and i i do think he started to realize and the the passage was easy and peaceful but it'll say this i ism not ashamed to say it i mean i wake up every morning since then just i do not even make the conscious decision to allow my self to cry wake up crying and ism fortunately able to make it through the day thanks to the great support of my friends and and you and my family but i miss him and i miss him yet i miss him and i feel i he homer costello you know the relation ship to one'stogust specific but ah that that party is gone that is the hard thing ah what is what what i think is different is that i made the mistake i think when i hope it was a good decision but sometimes i think i made the mistake of i brought costello a little bit to the world through the pod was posting about him i gave i answer for more advised about him in public let us broncs i have no idea what his mental life was or his relationship to me and ism just exploring all this for the first time because he was my first dog but i raise him since he was seven weeks yet you got to hold together i notice the that posted a you are least on money you mention casually you you brought him back to life for me for that brief moment nebothes es he is gone you was that is the he is going be gone for a lot of people too well this is what ism struggling with i think that maybe you are pretty good at this have you done this before ah this is the challenge is i actually a part of me i know t to take care myself pretty well ye not perfectly but pretty well and have good support i i do worry one bit about how it is on a land and how people will feel ism ism concerned about there internalization ah that something ism still ism still iterating and you have the that the watch yo struggle which is assay right and i i mostly been shielding them from this but ah what would make me happiest if is if people would internal eye some of hostelled is best traits and his best traits were that he was incredibly tour i mean he was a going too inch not bull dog the whole thing he was just born that way what was what was beautiful is that his puffiness is in ever what he rolled forward it was just now sweet and kind he was and if people can take that then a than there is a win in their some place i i think there is some ways in which he should probably live on in your podcast to you should a i mean it is such a one of things i loved about the his rolling your pit last is that he brought much joy to you we mention the robots right i think a that is such a powerful thing to bring that joy isn't it allowing yourself to experience that joy to bring that joy to others to share with others ah that is really powerful and i mean not to this is this is the russia thing is it is i it touched me when a juicy my had that moment that i keep thinking about in this a his show louis where an old man was criticizing louis for whining about breaking up with his girl friend and you saying the most the the most beautiful thing a about ta love they me song the catch now that is now making you feel horrible saying but is the loss the loss really also is making you realize how much that person that dog meant to you and allowing yourself to feel that loss and not run away from that loss is really powerful and in some ways that is also sweet just the love was the loss is also sweet because that you felt to lot for that a for your friend i and they continue bringing that joy i think it would be amazing to the pokes a i hope to do the same with robots or at whatever else is the source of joy i am and may be ad you think about one day getting ah another dog ye in time am you are hitting on all the key buttons here ah hi want that to we are thinking about ways to kind of immortalized hostelled in away that is real not just creating some little logo or something silly you costello much avid yogins is a a person but yogins also has grown into kind of a verb you gin a yogins this or y and there is an adjective that is extremely it ah i think that for me castellan was all those things he was a he was a being he was his own being he was a noun a a verb and an adjective and yet this amazing super power that i wish i could get which is this ability to get everyone else to do things for you without doing a damn thing the costello effect i call i is an idea he lives on yes ah thank you for that this actually has every theryouah which which you actually brings me to a a question a we are friends were not just a cot scientist colleagues and working on a project together and m a and in the world a that is somewhat similar just just to two dogs just two dogs basically ah but let us talk about friendship because i think that at i certainly know as a scientist that there are elements that are very lonely of the scientific pursuit there are elements of many pursuits that are lonely music math always seem to me there the loneliest people h who knows if that is true or not also people work in teams and sometimes people are surrounded by people in her actuate people they feel very lonely but for me and and i think as well for you friendship is an incredibly strong force in making one feel certain things are possible or worth reaching for a maybe even making us compulsively reach for them when you we are growing up you go up in russia until what age thirteen i and then and then he moved directly to philadelphia you to a chico you chico and then philadelphiaa and san francisca and boson an on but really to chico that hon i went to high school you have sibling brought older brother a most people on know that a ahead is a very different very different person but somebody i defiantly look up to he is a wild man he is extravert he is a he was into i mean he is he is also scientist a by engineer but his when we were growing up in he was a the person who did a drank an did every drug and but also was the life of the party and and i just thought he was the know when your the older brother five years older he was the coolest person a that i a ways going to be him to that he was he define had a big influence but i think for me on terms of friendship growing up i had a i had one really close friend and then when i came here at another close friend but ism very i believe a i do not i believe but i draw a la of strength from deep connections with a without the people and just ha small number of people just the really small number of people that is when i moved to the country i was really surprised how a the these these a large groups of friends quontlled quit but they that the that the depth of connection was not there at all from my sort of perspective now why i moved to the suburb of chico was naprville it is more a middle class may be upper middle class sos people that a cared more about material possessions than deep human connection that added to the thing but i i drop more meaning than almost anything else was from friendship early on i had best friend his name was here his name is you a a i do not know how to say it in english ai you say in russia you what is it last same do you remember a a mire cool of i you a mircool of a we just spend all our time together there is there is a there is also group of friends i do not nits tike i ate guys in russia growing it is a parents did not care if your coming back at certain hour we spend all day all night this playing soccer usually called football a and just talking about life and all this kinds of things even at that young age that i think people in russia an soy union grow up much quicker a h i think the educations system at the up universe y level is work class in in united states in terms of really creating really a big powerful minds a at least he used to be but i think that they aspire to that but the education system for for younger kids in the movie union was incredible they did not treat us as kids we the the level of literature toast dostayowsky when you pushily small child yet that is asourand matin the level of mathematics and you were made to feel she if you are not good an mathematics we i think in this country there is more speech young kids tat are cute there being babied a we only start to really push a dull later in life if you want to be the best in the world that this than you get to be pushed but we were pushed at a young age everybody was pushed and that brought out the best in people i think a it really forced people to discover discover themselves in the login style but also discover a what there actually passion about wont there not is all true for boys and girls where they pushed equal either a they were pushed the the pushed equally i gutsy there is blow see there is more not obviously but there at least for my memories a more of a what is the right way to put it but there is gender rolls but not in a negative connotation it was was the red dress verses the sudden tie kind of connotation which is there is you guys lifting heavy things and girls creating beautiful art and a there's more tradition over you regent more a nineteen fifty sixties but we did not thank in terms of at least at that age in terms of rolls and in a home maker something that or now it was more about what people care about a girls cared about this set of things and guys cared about this set of things i think mathematics and engineering was something that guys cared about instead of at least my perception of that time and then girls create about girls cared about beauty s guys want to great machines girls went a great beautiful stuff and not of course that i do not take that forward in some kind of philosophy of life but just the way i grow up in the way i remember it but all everyone worked hard the the value of hard work was a instilled in everybody and a through that i i think it is it is a lutanist of hardship of course also economically everybody with poor especial i the philosophies of union there is poverty everywhere you did not notice it as much but there was a because there is much not much material possessions there is a huge value placed on human connection just a meeting with neighbors everybody knew each other we lived in an apartment building very different than you have in the united states these days everybody knew each other a you get to gather drink not go smoke cigarettes and play guitar and sing ma sad songs about the about life it was with the the sad songs in the russia thing i may not i ruffians that do i express joy i from time to time the on certainly you do a but a what do you think that is about is it cause it is cold there but it is cold other places to i think a was us the first of all the movie union a the echoes o world wore too and the millions on millions on millions of people the civilians the were slaughtered and also starvation is there right the echoes of that of the ideas the literature the art is there that the grand parents that is parents that is all there that contributes to it that life can be absurdly unexplainably cruel at any moment everything can change that is in there then the i think there is an empowering aspect to finding beauty and suffering that then everything else is beautiful to if you just linger it is why you meditate on death is if you just think about the worst possible case and find beauty in that than everything else beautiful to and you write songs about the dark stuff and a that somehow helps you deal with whatever comes there there is a hopelessness to a the the movie union that inflation all those kinds of things were people or sold dreams and never delivered and there is a there is a if you do not sing songs about sad things you are going to become cynical about this world they do not want to give into cynicism now all live people did you ka one of the but that it is the battle against cynicism one of the a things that may be common in russia is a kind of cynicism about if i told you the thing i said earlier about dreaming about robots it is very common for people to a dismiss that dream of saying now that is not that is too wild whole do that did that or you want to start upon gas who else nobody's making money on pod gasps why d you most start point that kind of minds that i think it is quite common which is why i would say ontraprinuraship in russia is still not very good which to be a business that to be not to procurer you have to dream beg and yet the have others around you friends and s the poor group that makes you make you dream big but if you do not given cynicism an appreciate the beauty in a the the unfairness of life the absurd unfairness of life than i think it just makes a makes you appreciative everything is a it is a prerequisite for gratitude and yet that i think that in stilled to me billy to appreciate everything just everything everything's amazing and then also there is a culture a a rat a romanticizing everything it is almost i sheetlike romantic relationships worse were very sop opera it is very over the top dramatic and i think i think it that was it still o me too not only do appreciate everything about life but i get emotional about it in a sense i get a mistral feeling of joy for everything an the same with the n or friends or people of the opposite sex there is a deep emotional connection there that that is way to dramatic to i guess relative to what the actual moment is but i i derive much deep dramatic joy from many things in life and i think i would a attribute that to the obliging i russia but the thing that sticks most of all is a the friendship and have now since then had a one other friend that in a in the united states he live in chico his name is mat and slowly a here and there accumulating really fascinating people but am very selective with that funny enough the few times it is not few is a lot of times now interaction with yo organ it is sounds to real to say but there is a kindred spirit there that had connected with him a and there is been people that also in the grappling sports that are really connected with have actually struggled which is why ism ism glad to be your friend it is a struggle to connect with scientists lite that can be a little bit wooden some ti ye even the biologists i mean one thing that i ism you well ism struck by the fact that you you work with robots your engineer eh i you science technology and that all sounds hardware right but what your describing and i know it is true about you is this deep emotional life and this residence an i it is really wonderful actually think it is one of the reasons why many people scientists and otherwise have gravitated towards you and your podcast is because you hold both elements you known that heroin has his book and of your narcissist and golden write its about these elements of the logical rational mind and the the the emotional mind and how those are woven together and if people have not read it they should and you embody that the full picture and i think that much of what draws people to you give read every german has a bog i as usual as usual have done about nine per cent of i i what live it it know it is true you will you mention job who is a a phenomenal human being not just for his amazing accomplishments but for how he shows up to the world but one on one i think i heard him say the other day on an interview a he said there is no police or private version of him is this is this is me he said the for it was beautiful he said um the fish they got through the net now there is no on stage offstage prison you are absolute right and i it will you go good i have a question or actually about but that is a really good point about public and private life i he is o huge if i can just comer you but a that he was a have been a fan of job for a long time but he is been in inspiration to a to not have any difference between public in private life actually a had a conversation with of all about this and he said that you cannot have a rich life a exciting life if you are the same person publicly in privately and a i think i understand that idea but i do not agree with it i i think this really fulfilling and exciting to be the same person privately in publicly with very few exceptions now that said i do not have any really strange sex kinks i feel i can be open with be everything i do not have anything ism ashamed of a there is somethings that could be perceived poorly the screaming rumbas but ism not ashamed of them i uldpresent them in the right contacts but there is a this freedom to been the same person in private as in public and that job made me realize that if you can you can be that and also to be kind to others it sounds it sounds kind of absurd but i really i really always enjoyed being good to others just being kind towards others but i always a felt the world did not want me to be there is much negativity when i was growing up just a wrong people if you actual just notice how people talk they a from complaining about the weather or this could be just the big cities that i visited but there is a general negativity and positivity kind of a suppressed you are not one you not seen us as very intelligent and too there is a kind of you seen is limitable weird of and always felt i had to hide that and when job made me realize one i have i could be fully just the same person private in public and too i can embrace being kind and just in the way that i in the way i i know how to do and sort of for me in twitter ah or publicly whenever i say stuff that means saying stuff simply almost the point of cricket and i have the strength now to say it even if ism being mocked you do not mean just it is o quiet ifs everything's going to be coquet el kat some people will think you are do there probably right the point is just enjoy being yourself and that jo more than almost anybody else because he is successful a at it ah inspire me to do that be kind and be the same person private in public i love it and i i love the idea that authenticity does not have to be overhearing right that it does not mean you reveal every detail of your life what it it is a way of being true to an essence of oneself right you are not there is never a feeling when you deeply think and intersect that you are hiding something from the world are you being dishonest the some fontomot thewy a yes it that that a that is truly liberating it allows you to think it allows you to a think freely to speak freely to a just to be freely that said it is not it is not this not still a responsibility to be the best version o yourself you not very careful with the way i say something the whole point it is is not simple to a express the spirit that is inside you with words it and means some people much better than than others i struggle oftentimes when i say something and i hear myself say it it sounds really dumb and not at all what i meant that is the responsibility you have is not just a being the same person publicly privately means you can just say whatever the how it means a there still responsibly to try to be to express what you truly are and that that is that is a that is hard it is hard and i think that s we have this am pressure all people when i say we i mean all all humans maybe robots to ah feel this pressure to be able to express ourselves in that one moment in that one form and it is beaus beautiful when somebody for instance can capture some essence of love or sad anas sore anger or something in a song or in a poem or in a short quote but perhaps it is also possible to do it in aggregate all all the things how you show up your french is one of the things that initially drew me to want to get to know you as a human being in a scientist and and eventually became friends was the level of respect that you brought to your podcast listeners by wearing a suit ism being serious your i think i was erased thinking that if you overdress a little bit overdressed by america certainly by america standards you are overdress for a podcast but this is but it is genuine you are not doing it for any reason except i have to assume and i assumed at the time that it was because you have a respect for your audience you respect o them enough to show up a certain way for them it is for you also but it is for them and i think between that and your commitment to your friendship'sthe way you talk about friendships and love another we you hold up these higher ideals i think at least as a consumer of your content a end is your friend i what i find is that aggregate you are communicating who you are it does not have to be one quote you're something and i think that you we were sort of obsessed by the one in skin quit or the one e line of a poetry or something but it is the i think you embody the way that and job is well it is about how you live your life and how you show up as a collection of things and said and done you that that fast the aggregate is is the go the the the tricky thing and german person talks about this because he is under attack away more than you and i will ever be but that for anowright this is very true now a that a a the people who attack on the internal this is one of the problems wit twitter is a they do not consider the aggregate they they take a single statements and one of the defense mechanisms again why job has been in inspiration is that when you aggregate are good person a lot of people will know that and that makes you much more immune to the attacks of people that bring out a individual statement they may be misstatement of of some kind or does not express a who you are and that ah i that idea that is the aggregate and the the the power the pod cast is you have hundreds of ours out there and being yourself and people get to know who you are and once they do and you and you post pictures of screaming rumbas as you kick them ah they will understand the you don't mean while by the way is is a side comment i do not know if wen to release this because s not just the rumbas you have a whole dungeon of rob look this is this is a problem this the boss dynamic came up against this problem but me just me work this workshop this out with you a and may be because we will post this people will let me know a there is legged robes they look a dog they have a very ism trying to create a very real a human rob connection but they are also incredible because you can throw them awful building an the land fine and is beautiful that thing amazing have seen that in star envies are cats getting jumping off o fit story brings and than walking away a no one should throw their cat wat this is the problem experiencing a all certainly kicking the robots it is really fastening how they recover from those kicks but just seeing myself do it and also seeing others do it it just does not look good and i do not know what to do with that cause i it is such a tit you i see but you do not i you could you atom now ism getting know now ism it is interesting before to day's conversation i probably could do it and now i think ism thinking about robots bills of rights and things ism actually and not not for any not to satisfy you ere to satisfy anything except that if i if they have some sentient aspect to their being then i would loath to kick i do not think they will be able to kick it you might be able to kick the first time o not the second this this the prove of experience one of the cool things is a one of the robots o ism working with you can pick it up by one leg and is dangling you can throw it any kind of way an o land correctly is really men you at a cat that i an we look forward to the letters from the cat oh norm not suggesting any one did but yet he had this cat and the cat he would just you not throw it on to the bed from across the room and that it would run back for er more somehow they had that was though nature of the relationship i think most no one should do that to an animal but a i this cat seem to return for it for whatever a the robes e rob is fastening to me how hard it is for me to do that it is unfortunate but i do not think i can do that to robot it i i struggle with that i for me to be able to do that with a rob i have to i most get into the state that i imagine doctors get into in the do surgery i have to start have to do what robotics colleagues of mine do which is start seeing it is an object associate like dissociate we just fascinating that i have to do that in order to do that with a robot i win t i take that little bit of a tangent no i think it is an important thing i man i am not m ism not a shy about the fact that for many years i have worked on experimental animals and and that is been of very challenging aspect of being a biologist mostly mice but in the pass no longer o thank goodness cause i just do not doing it on larger animals as well and now i work on humans which i can give consent verbal consent om i think that it is extremely important to have an understanding of what the guide lines are and wear one's own boundaries are around the sit it is it is not just an important question it might be the most important question before any work can progress you you ask me about friendship i know you have a a lot of thoughts about friendship what you think is the value of friendship in life well for me personally a just because of my my life trajectory and ark a friendship and i should say i do have some i female friends that are just friends are completely platonic relation it but it is been mostly male friendship to me has been has been all male friendships to me actually interesting yet it is been a i an absolute life lime they are my family i have a biological family and i have great respect and love for them and appreciation for them but it it provide it is provided me i the i wont event say confidence because there is always an anxiety and taking any good risk i any risk worth taking it is given me the sense that i should go for certain things and try certain things to take rest to to weather that anxiety and i i do not come concern myself a particularly competitive person but i would sooner die then disappoint or let down one of my friends i can think of nothing worse actually than disappointing one of my my friends everything else a secondary to me what disappointment disappoint meaning i not i meant certainly a i strive always to show up as best i can for the friendship and that can be in small ways if hi can mean you do not making sure the phone is away sometimes it is about i you ism terrible with punctuality cause ism an academic and i just get lost in time and i do not mean anything by but ye striving to to listen to to enjoy good timestip and to make time you knowing honey goes back to this first variable we talked about to make sure that i spend time and to get time in person and check in and i it is i think there many ways in which friendship is vital to me it is it is actually to me what makes life worth living yet wet there is a i am surprised with the high school friends how we do not actually talk that often these days intimas e time but every time we see each other it is immediately if i back to always tarted i you know i struggle with that how much time your the plicate team for the for the friendship to be deeply manful because there are just ere always there with me even if we do not talk often i there is a kind of loyalty i ti think a maybe it is a different style but i think i much to me friendship as being there in the hard times i think i i ism much more reliable when you are going through shit then then your mi of reliable anyway no but if i years if you are a wedding or something that or a i do not know like you want unaware of some kind i ye ghati'll congratulate teethe said i do you but thine that is not and it'll be there but that is not as important to me as being there when nobody else is i just being there when sheds gets a shit it is the fan or something is tough for the world turns there ill back and you all those kinds of things that to me that is what friendship is manful i know that to be true about you and that is a felt thing and a real thing with you let me ask one more thing about that actually because ism not a practitioner ggetzou i know you are job is but a years ago i read a book that i really enjoyed which is say sheridan's book a fighter's heart he talks about all these different forms of martial arts and am and maybe he was in the book maybe was in an interview but he said that fighting or being in physical battle with somebody jugetzu boxing or some other form of physical direct physical contact between two individuals creates this bond unlike any other because he said it is it is a one night stand your sharing bodily fluids with somebody that you barely know and i it and tat chuckled about it cause it is it is kind of funny and a kind of tongue and cheek but at the same time i think a this is a fundamental way in which am members of a species bond is through physical contact and certainly there are other forms there is cuddling and there is hand holding and there is am and there sexual intercourse an wit all sorts of thing let us cuddling i have not heard of it i heard this recently i did not know this term but there is a term am they have turned the noun cup cake into a verb cup caking it turns out i just learned i is cup caking is when you spend time just cuddling i did not know about this you heard it here first although i heard it first just the other day cup caking is actually cuddling is everything it is not just is it in bed or on the cops what is cut cuddling i ain't to bookable curling we need to look a this up en we need to define the variables i think et i evilly has to do with physical contact i even told but am but in terms of battle a a competition i am and the sherirding quit ism just curious do you get close or feel am a bond with people that for instance you rolled jugitszo with or even though you do not know anything else about them is he it was he write about this yea i mean ism many levels he else has the book what a fighter's mind a thus rein one he is at he is action excellent writer what is interesting about him just briefly about sheridan i do not know what i didloebut a research he a he went to hazard he is an art major t hazard he claims all he did was smoke cigarettes and and do part i do not know his art was any good and am and i think his father was in the seal teams and then when he got out of hazard graduated he took off round the world learning all the forms of martial arts and was early to the kind of ultimate fighting kind of a makes marshal art and things great great book yeast is it is amazing i i do not if you remember it but i read it i remember thinking to amazing encapsulation of what makes fighting the the art what makes it compelling am i would say that there is many ways that ggetszo grappling rattling combats voice in general is one of the most intimate things you could do ado to described in terms of bodily liquids and all those kinds of things i think he was more or less joke in you li i i think of there is a few ways that it does that one because you are vulnerable that the honesty of stepping on the mat and a often all of us have ego thinking were better than we are at this particular art and then the honesty of being submitted or being worse than you thought you are and just sitting with that knowledge that kind of honesty we do not get to experience it in most of daily life we can continue living somewhat of an illusion of our conceptions of ourselves cause people are not going to i hit us with the reality the mat speaks only the truth that the reality just hits you and that vulnerability is the same as a the loss of a love dwindle it is the loss of a reality that you knew before you now have to deal with this new reality n when you are sitting there in that vulnerability and there is these other people that are also sitting in that all desirability you get the rely connect fuck ism not special as i thought i was and life is not life as harsher than i thought i was and were just sitting there with that reality some of us can outwards to them some we can i think that defining is a thing that least to intimacy a that the other thing is is the human contact there is something about i mean a big hug during bovid very few people hug me and i hug them and always felt good when they did that we are all tested and spell now were vaccinated but there is still people this is true of san francisco s is then boson that one keep not only six feet away but stay at home and never touch you that that was a that loss of basic humanity is the opposite of what i feel injugitu where it was that that contact where you are i do not give a shade about whatever rules were spoke to have in society where you're not the to keep a distance in all that kind of to just the hug that the intimacy of a hug that is a good bear hug and your just controlling another person and also there is some kind of love communicated through just trying to break each others arms i do not exactly understand why highlands is the such a close neighbor to love but it is what in in the hypothalamus the anurans that control sexual behavior but also nonsexual contact or not just near by the neurons that control a egression and fighting they are salt and pepper with those car on it is a very interesting and you know it almost sounds kind of risky and controversial insult there ism not but enterpromorphizing about what this means but in the brain this structures are interdigitate they they you cannot you cannot separate them except at a very fine level and he here your the we you describe it is the same tat as a real thing i i i do one make an interesting commit again these this things that could be taken out of contacts but a i one of the amazing things about jugitzus is both guides and girls train it and was surprised a ism a big fan of yogopans a a it you not at the gam kind of thing it is a reveals the beauty of a of the female form but the the thing is girls are dressed and skintight clothes in suits often and i found myself not at all thinking that at all with when training with girls will the contact is very nonsexual but that that i was surprised to learn that i when i first a units i thought it would not be kind weird to train with the opposites in something intimate boys and girls men and women they they rolled jugitzy together completely interesting and the the only times girls kind of try to stay way from gives mean their two contacts of course as always going to be creeps in this world t everyone knows who who kind at to stay away from and the other is there is a size ti parity girls will often try to roll with people would be closer went wise but no the that is one of the things that are empowering to women that that is what they fall in love with when they star ting jugitzas i i can first of all they gain in awareness and a pride over their body which is great and then second they get especially later on start submitting big dudes these a a a brose that come in for all shredded and muscular and they get to technique a to a exercise dominants over them and that is a powerful feeling to you have seen women force a a larger guide to tappet or even choke hin well i was a always deadlything a a a for ah boy i think it is for ninety five s always really to power the thing when a start git gigitza and arm order being submitted by i thought i walked in feeling ism going to be if not the greatest fighter have at least top three and so as a white belt you roll in all happy a and then you realize that a as long as you are not applying too much force the your having ism over being submitted many times by a hundred thirty hundred twenty pond girls hat thus a balance dials in philadelphia that a lot of incredible female jugitzi players and that is really humbling to that technique a can overpower in in combat a pure strength that i that is the other thing that there is something about combat that is primal that there it just feels it feels a we were born to do this that the we have circuits in our brain that are metic ate to this kind of interaction there is no there is no question it this that is what have felt it it was not that ism learning in you skill it was somehow i am a remembering echoes of something have learned in the past wet's getting puberty a child before puberty has no concept of boys in girls having this a attraction regardless of whether not the attracted to boys a girl does not matter at some point most people not all but certainly but most people when they hip puberty suddenly people appear differently and certain people take on i a romantic or sexual interest for the very first time and it is it is revealing a circuitry in the brain it is not they learn that it is nature and i think it when i hear the way you describe a you git to an and in rolling jugitzo remind your of it job was telling me a recently about the first time you went hunting and he felt it revealed a circuit that was that was in him all long but he had not experience before ye that that is dele there and and of course there is the physical activity one of the interesting things about yugitzu is at it is one of the really strenuous exercises that you can do late into your adult life into your a fifty sixty seventies eighties have when when i came up a there is a few people their cities that were training and as long as your smart as long as you practise techniques and pick your partner's correctly you can do that kind of art it is lady to life and you see getting exercise there is not many activities i find that are a amenable to that because it is such a thinking game that that the jugs in particular is an art where technique pays awful lot you can a still maintain first of all remain injury free if you's good technique and also through good technique a be able to go you be active with people that are much much younger and i that was to me that and running under the two activities you can kind of do late in life because to me a healthy life is has exercises as the piece of the puzzle absolutely and have been glad they were on the physical component because i i know that there is for you a you have take before about the cross over between the physical and the intellectual and the mental and are you still running ridiculous hours of the night for ridiculously long yet in a definitely have been running late at night here notion people tome ex the area wherein now people says the dangerous area which i find laughable coming from the bigger cities a now i run late at night there is something if you see a got running through busting at two a m in a sultan tie it is probe well yet i mean i do think about that as i get recognize more a more and often i worry that not really that beget recognize s late at night a you know a but there is something about the night that brings out those deep philosophical thoughts in self reflection that really enjoy but recently am i started getting back to the grind some good a be competing are hoping to be compete in the in september and october u jobs injojous o ye to get back to competition and that requires getting back into great carrier shape i been getting a running as part of my daily routine you to now i why always know i can reach you regardless of times own in the middle of the night ah wherever that happens to part o that has to be just being single and being a programmer those those two things just do not work while in terms of a steady sleeps cell it is not banker's hours kind of work now i near want it you mention single i want to ask you lobe about the other form of relationship which is a romantic love om your parents are still married still carry's still happily married that is impressive a rare thing noway you go up with that example ye i guess that is a powerful thing i if there is an example that thing an work it ye i did not have that in my own family but am when y when i see it it is it is inspiring an its and it is beautiful the fact that they have that and that was the norm for you i think is is really wonderful it is of a in t guess of my parents was interesting to watch cause there is obviously tension there's be times with they fa in all those kinds of things they a the obvious to get frustrated with each other and that they but they fine mechanisms how to communicate that to each other to make fun of each other a little bay to tees to get some of that frustration out and then ultimately to reunite in in undefined their joyful moments and be that the energy i think it is clear cause i got together in the i think early twenties very very young i think you grow together as people yer you've still in critical period of brain last is and a also it me is just a divorce was frowned upon that you stick it out and i think a lot of couples especially from that time in soy union that is probably applies to lot of cultures you stick it out and you put in the work you learn how to put in the work and once you do you start to get to some of those rewarding aspects of being through time be ha sharing many moments together that a that is dating something that m that was in inspiration to me but maybe that is where i have i have a similar kind of longing to have a life long partner that have that kind of view where same with friendship life long friendship is the most meaningful kind that there is something with that time of sharing all that time together till death to us part as a powerful thing not by force not because the religion said it or the governments that it or you capture said o but because you want to do you want children deal ye defy want children it is it is company rooms do you have how i thought you should no nomen child not human human child as i ready have the children exact i a saying in d at least as many a human children as you do from was big family small family ah on your mind's eyes there big a there bunch of bunch of who freedman's running around it'll tell you realistically i i can explain exactly my thinking it in this a similar to the robotics work is if ism purely logical it now my answer would be i do not want kids because i just do not have enough time have much going on but when ism using the same kind of vision i use for the robots is i know my life will be transformed with the first i i know wild love being a father and as to the question of how many i that that is on the other side of that hill it it it could be some ridiculous number i just know that i i have a feeling and i could be i i do not have a crystal ball but a i do not know is i see an upwards of of certainly three or more come comes to mars much of that has to do with a the partner you are with to that that is such an open question especially in the society of what the right partnership is some idea ism ism deeply apathetic i want to see to me or what i look for in relationship is a for me to be really excited about the passions of another person whatever there in to does not have to be a career success any kind of success just to be excited for them and for them to be excited for me and share in that excitement in build and build and build but there is also practical aspects of what kind of ship o you enjoy doing i together and i think families of real serious undertaking oh it certainly is i man i think that have a a friend ism who said it i think best chichis that om you first have he is in a very successful relationship an a and has a family an he said o you first auto defend the roll and then you have to cast the right person for the role wo ye that there there is some deep aspect to that but there is also an aspect to which you are not smart enough from this side of it to define the right to define the roll i this part of it that has to be a leap that you have to take a and i i see i i i see having kids that way you just you just have to go with it figure it out also as long as there is love there what the hell is life or even have have a there many incredibly successful people that i know i that have got in to know that all have kids and the pray sense of kids for the most part has only been something that energize them something they gave a meaning something that made him the best versions themselves made them more productive not less just fascinating to me it is fascinate i may you imagine if the way that you felt about homer the way that i feel in felt about costello is is at all a a a glimpse of what the must be than exactly the the downside the thing i worry more about is a the a teethe pardner side of that have seen a the kids are almost universally a source of increased productivity enjoy and happiness that there a paying the ass he has complicated ya says on forth people to complain about kids but when you act you look past that little shall lay of complain kids a great the source of paying for a lot of people is the if when the relationship does not work and ism very kind o concerned about we waiting is very difficult and ism a complicated person and is there has been very difficult to find a to find the right kind of person but that that statement does even make sense because ism not on dining as i do not see people you are the first person i saw in a while s tike you michael malice and job i a i i do not think have seen a a a females what is it a an element of the female species in quite a an quite a while i think you have to put yourself out there a what is it a dance poison says true love will find you but only f your looking there some element of really taking leap in putting yourself out there in kind of different situations and isn't know how to do that when you are behind of computer all the time well yet your a you are a builder and you are a problems alter and om i your you find solutions and ism confident this solution is a the solution is out there and think you are implying that's going to build the girl friend which i think weather you we well and maybe we should not separate this a friendship am the notion of friendship and community and the act if we go back to this concept of the aggregate maybe you will meet this woman through um through a friend er maybe or something of that o one of things i do not now you ah if you feel the same way i deafinilly one of those people that just falls in love and that is it i cannot say i that we yous costello wo was instantaneous ye it really was i mean to i know it is it not it is not romantic love is instantaneous no i i but that is me i not i think that you if because that that is a that is a good thing that you have what it is a ism very careful that because you do not a am of for the wrong person i try to be a very kind of careful wit i give noticed this because i fallen o with one this m mug everything i fall in love with things in this world i guard by really careful because a a a girl comes up to you and says she loves dustievsky i that does not necessary being you to marry her to night yes ani the way you said that out loud that you heard it i it does not mean you needs a me here yo to night exactly right i mean but people people are amazing and people are beautiful and that is a i ism fully embrace that but i else hat to be careful with relationship an at the same time i a mission to or fine and i do not a the something about me that appreciates swinging for the senses and not dating doing sell dating a dating around that you are one guy one girl connect yet a said that and it is it is tricky because i you on we on to be careful of that kind of stuff especially now there is a growing platform that have a ridiculous amount of female interest of o a certain kind but ism looking for deep connection and and ism looking by sending home alone and every once in a while i talking to staffer professors perfect son we perfect colic work great it it is well incorporates on i part of that constitutes machine learning of sort ye of sort would do you mention i what has now become a quite extensive and expansive a public platform which is incredible mean the number of people out when first time i saw your podcast i nose visit us you respects his audience which was great but i also thought this is amazing you people are showing out for science and engineering into acknowledge information and those discussions and other sorts of discussions now i do want to talk for a moment about the podcast my two questions about the podcast or when you started it did you have a plan and regardless of what that answer is ut do you do where you are taking it or ism would you to leave us i do believe in an element of surprise is always fun but what about the podcast you enjoy the podcast i mean your audience certainly includes me really enjoys the podcast it is incredible i love talking to people and there is something about microphones that really bring out the besting people would you do you do not get a chest to talk this if you and i were just hanging out would have a very different conversation in the amount of focus we all ligate to each other would be having fun talking about the stuff and doing other things there would be a lot of distraction there would be some for use and all that kind of stuff a but here we are one hundred per cent focus on each other and focus on that idea and sometimes plain with ideas that we both do not know the answer to a question we do not know the answer to were both fumbling with a trying to figure out trying to get some insights tat something we have not really figured out before and get the arriving at that i think that is magical i do not know why we need microphones for that but we somehow do feels doing science it feels doing science for me defiantly that is exactly a then an i really glad you said that because i do not actually often say this but that is exactly what i felt i wanted to talk to o friends and college that i my tea to do real science together is for how i felt about it to really talk through problems that are actually interesting as suppose to like incremental work that were currently working for a for particular conference it really asking questions what are we doing wheres as headed to what are the big is this really going to help us of love in the case of a i solve intelligence is this even working on intelligence there is a the certain sense which is why initially called it artificial intelligence is most of us are not working on artificial intelligence your your working on some very specific problem and a set of techniques it the time it is machine learning to solve this particular problem this is not under take us to a system that a is anon work close to the generalizeability of the human mind the kind of thought the human mind can do in time of memories terms of cognition terms of reasoning common sense reasoning this dis does not seem to take us there see the initial impulse was can i talk to these folks do science together through conversation and i also thought that there was not enough not i did not think there is enough good conversations with worldclass minds that i got to me and not the ones with a book or hat this was a thing oftentimes you go on this tour we have a book but there is a lot of mines that do not write books the i the books constrain the conversation e cause an your talking about this thing the same book but there is i have notice that with people have not written a book who are brilliant we get to talk about ideas in a new way we both have not actually when we raise a question we do not know the answer to it one the question is raised and we try to arrive there i i n i remember asking questions of world class researches in a deep learning of why do your nut works work as well as they do that question is often loosely asked but when you have microphones and yet have to think through it and yet thirty minutes to an hour to think through it together i think that is a that science i think that is really powerful to those those the one go the other one is o i i again do not usually talk about this but there's some sense in which i wanted to have dangerous conversation s a part of the reasons i wanted to wear a so is i wanted to be fearless that the reason i don't was you talk about it is because i feel a not good conversation it looks it does not match the current skill level but i wanted to have really m a dangerous conversations that i uniquely would be able to do young you completely uniquely but ism a huge banjo organ and i had to ask myself what conversations can i do that jo roger cannot for me i know i bring this of but for me that person i thought about at the time was prudent the that is that is why i bring him up he he is he is a just with castellan he is not just a person he is also an idea to me for what i strive for is to have those dangerous conversations and the reason ism uniquely qualifies both the russia but also there is the judo in the marshal arts there is a lot of elements that make me have a conversation he has not had before and am and there is a few other people that a i kept a mind the don can't he is computirous scientist o from stamford that i thought is one of those beautiful mines ever and nobody really talk to him really talk to him hes did a few lectures which people love but really just have a conversation with him i is a few people that one of them pass away john convey that i never got we agree to talk but he died before i did this a few people that that i thought it is such a crime to not here those folks and a i have the unique ability to a know how to purchase and a microphone and amazon and plug it into a device their cords audio and then publish it which seems relative unique it is that is not easy in the scientific community people knowing how to plug in a microphone no they can build faraway cages and toots on microscopes and a but the big engineer all sorts of things but a the idea that you could take ideas and export them into a structure or suit of structure that people would benefit from seems a cosmic achievement to them i do not know if it is a fear or just a basically t y have not try as tat they have have not learn the skill level but i think they are not trained at a we riff on this for a while but i think that but it is important and i me r should which is that it is they are not train to do it they train to think in specific aims and specific hypothesis and and many of them do not care to right they they do not they they became scientist because a that is where they felt safe and why would they leave that haven of safety or that they also do not necessarily always see the value in it it is it is we are all tore the learning you and i are learning the value of this i think you are probably you have an exceptionally a successful and amazing packs the you started just recently thanks to your encouragement well but there is there is a raw skill there that it that is youyour dealing an inspiration not to me in how you do the packs in the in the level of excellency reach but i think you have discovered that that is also an ampactful way to do science that packs and i think a lot of a scientists have not yet discovered that that this is a if they apply a the same kind of rigor as they do to academic publication h or to even conference presentations and they do that rigor and a effort to a typecast whatever that is that could be a five mean peas a to our packs hit could be conversational or can be more lecture if they apply that effort you have the potential to reach over time tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of people and that that is really really powerful but yet for for me giving a platform to a few of those folks a especially for me personally maybe you can speak to what fields you are drawn to but i thought computer scientists a were especially bad at this as there is brilliant computer scientists that i thought a would be amazing to explore their mind explored their thinking and that i took that almost as a on as an effort and at the same time i had other a guests in mind or people that connection my own interest that the wrestling a wrestling music a football both america fall and answer i have a few particular people that ism really interested and a abovisasati of the sit car brothers i even could be for wrestling just talk to them as of as you can you yes can communicate in russia and in wrestling i as wrestlers and as ruffians and a to that that little sat an opportunity to explore a mind that a that i ism able to bring to the world and it and also it a i feel like could me me a better person just that being that vulnerable and exploring ideas together i do not know good conversation i not know how often you have really o conversation with friends but casts are that and a it is is deeply moving ta best an and what what you have brought through et me when i saw you sit down with pentose you know know about prize won't physics in these other folks i is not just as he has a bells but comes out of his mouth is incredible an what you were able to on to hold in that conversation was much better light ears beyond what he had any other interview er at an what you call your inter yours rally about conversation years beyond what any one else had been able to i engage with him what is was such a beacon of what is possible and i i know that i think that is what people are drawn to and and there is a certain intimacy that a certainly to people are friends as we are and they know each other that there is more of that but there is an intimacy in those kinds of private conversations that are made public and u what the that is the with you you are probably saying to realize and casually is part of it because you are authentic and your putting yourself out there completely people are almost not just consuming the the words your saying they also enjoy watching you drew struggle with these ideas or try to communicate these ideas they the flaws they hey a human being it as then i i deals bet isn't cause i got plenty of he they the the self critical aspects act where you're very care where where you're very self critical about your flat i mean that in in that same way it is interesting i think for people to watch me talk to pentose not just because pentose it is communicating ideas but here is this silly kid trying to explore ideas that they know this kid that there is a human connection that is really powerful say mi think with punter i that it is not just its i a a good interview with paten it is also hearts this kid struggling to are to talk with one of the most powerful a some what argued dangerous people in the world that they love that de teethe authenticity that led up to that that an and in return i get to connect everybody i run to in the street and all those kind of things a there is a depth of connection there almost within a minute or two that is unlike any other a there is an intimacy that you have formed with we yet we have been on this journey together an you have the same thing with jo roger before ever met am i i was because i was a fan of job for many years yet that there is something this it is a kind of friendship as absurd it as it might be to say in podcasthing and listening to podcast yet maybe it maybe it feels in a little bit of that ere solves a little bit of that loneliness ya talking about until the robots a here i have am just a couple more questions but one of them is on behalf of your audience which is ism nothing to ask you the meaning of the hedgehog but i just want to know does it have a name and you don't to tell us the name but just does it have a name yes or no well he's a there is a name he likes to be referred to as and then there's a private name in the private or own company that we call each other now i ism not that in saying now his name is had am he is a hedgehog i do not stuffed animals ah but his story is a one of minimalism i gave away everything i own a now three times in my life by everything i mean almost everything kapgene's an shirt and e laptop and i recently also been guitar o things that but he survived because he was always in ta at least in the first two times was in the laptop bag an he just got lucky and i just the perseverance of that and i i first saw him in the a the reason i got a stuffed animal and i do not have other stuffed animals is a it was in a thrustor i into giant pile of stuffed animals and he jumped out at me because unlike all the rest of them he is this intense ah mean look about him that he is just he is upset at life ah at the cruelty of life and just especially the contrast of the other stuffed animals that have this dumb smile in there face he feel an most stuffed animals that this dumb look on their face and they are just happier and pleasant vile it is always saying tor a since they've a smooth tarmac not yet not many is exactly and this had saw through all of it it he was a a a dustiusky's man from underground and there is a sense that he saw the darkness of the world and persevered is and a there is also a famous russia cartoon a he frog in the fog that like i grew up with that connected with people who know of that cartoon you count see it on yet too it is a hedgehog in the fog here he tit is just as you would expect especially for my early soli cartoons it is a hedgehog sad walking through the fog exploring loneliness and sadness it is but it is beautiful it is a piece of a people shut even if you do not speak russia you will see you will understand oh it is it i the most you said that i was can ask it is in russia but at courses an it is in russia but it is more a is very little speaking in it it is almost a that there is an interesting exploration of o a how you make sense of the world when you a see it only vaguely through the fog he is trying to understand the world he really picking mouths yet we have bug's bunny we have all the you are crazy what animals than you have the hedgehog in the fog there is a there is a certain period and this is again a i soft know what its to attributed to but is really powerful which does a period in soba history i think probably seventies and eighties a where especially kids were treated very seriously they were treated their able to deal with outwith the weediness of life and that that was reflected in the cartoons a and there is a he was a lowed to have like really artistic contact not do cartoons their trying to get you to smile and run around but great art stuff that how short cartoons of short films can win osiers that is what they are swinging for what what strikes me about this kilobit i which i at the suit earlier it is almost they treat kids with respect ye lie that they have that have an intelligence and they honor that intelligence yet there really just adult in a small body i you want to protect him from the true cruelty of the world up but in terms of their intellectual capacity or philosophical capacity they are right there with you and that the cartoons reflected that the art that they consumed a education reflected that he represents that any there is a there is a sense because hi survive long and because i do not stuffed animals that it is we have been through all this together and it is is the same sharing the moments together it is the friendship and there is a sense in which if all the world turns on you and goes to hell at least we got each other that a and he does not die because he is an inanimate object until you animate him at the a to i animate him and then i probably would not want to know what he was thinking about the whole time a he is probably really into tailor swift or something that it is that i would not even want to know an i what a will i now feel a connection to hey the hedgehog that i certainly did not have before and i think that encapsulates the kind of possibility of connection om that is possible between human and and other object in through the through robotic certainly a there is a saying that i heard when i was a gradulitstuing that i that is just been ringing in my mind throughout this conversation in such a i think appropriate way which is that i likes you are in a minority of one you are truly a extraordinary in your ability to uncaps dilate many aspects of science engineering public communication about many topics martial arts and the emotional depth that you bring to it and just the purposefulness and i think if it is not clear to people it absolutely should be stated but ism think it is abundantly clear that just the amount of time and thinking that you put into things is a it it is the ultimate mark of respect i ism just extraordinarily grateful for your friendship and for this conversatianma proud to be our friend and i just wish you showed me the same kind of respect by wearing a suit and make you a father proud maybe next time next time indeed thank much my friend thankyou thank you

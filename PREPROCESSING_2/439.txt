welcome to the supermen lapontens nits a science science pass to i am indruhubermen and of a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to discuss salt also refer to as sodium most of us think of salt as something that we put on in in our food may be something to avoid may be some of you are actually trying to get more salt some of your tying to get less salt we all seem to associate salt with things blood pressure at camera to day we are going to go down a different set of avenues relate tod to salt we will certainly cover how salt regulates blood pressure we are also going to talk about how the brain regulates our appetite for salt or our aversion for salt we are also going to talk about how our sensing of salty tastes actually mediates how much sugar we crave and whether not we invest more or less sugar than we actually need what you are going to learn to day is that the called salt system meaning the sells and connections in our brain and body that mediate salt craving and avoidance our regulating many many aspects of our health and our ability to perform in various contacts things athletic performance things cognitive performance we are also going to talk about aging and dementia and avoiding aging in dementia and what roll salt and salt avoidance might play in that we are going to touch on some themes that for some of you might seem controversial and indeed if they are controversial i will be sure to highlight them as such ism gain to cover a lot of new data that point to the possibility i will not emphasize the possibility that for some people more salt might help them in terms of health cognitive in bodily functioning and for other people less salt is going to be better em n to talk about what the various parameters are ism ne given some guide lines that in concert with you are physician who should absolutely talk to before adding or changing anything to your diet or supplementation resume can help you arrive at a salt in take that is going to optimize your mental physical health and performance win to cover neurobiology were going to cover hormone biology were in talk about liver function we are going talk about kidney function and of course brain function ism excited to share this information with you to day ism certain an come away with a lot of information and actionable items before we dive into the topic of to day's episode on a high light of really exciting new study this is a study from dingo horses slab at duke university the mores lav studies interactions between the gut and the brain and has made some incredible discoveries of these called sauropod sells sauropod cells are neurons nerve cells that reside in our gut and that detect things fatyacids and men acids and some sauropod sells sense sugar previous work from this laboratory has shown that when we invest sugar these sauropod sells respond to that sugar and send electrical signals up a low wire that we call an acts on through the vaguest her for those who e they want to know and into the brain and through subsequent stations of nerd processing evoke the release of dopamine dopamine is a molecule known to promote craving and motivation and indeed action and what these sauropod cells that sent sugar are thought to do is to promote seeking and consumption eating of more sugary foods now the incredible thing is that it is all subconscious this is a taste system in the gut that is not available to your conscious awareness now of course when you unjust sweet foods you taste them on your mouth too and part of the reason tat you crave sweet foods perhaps is because they taste good to you and the other reason is that these sauropod cells are driving a chemical craving below your conscious detection there really two systems your gut is sensing at a subconscious level what is in it and sending signals to your brain that work in concert in parallel with the signals coming from your mouth and your experience of the taste of the food now that alone is incredible and has been the subject of many important landmark papers over the last decay or you can imagine how the system would be very important for things hidden sugars when nowadays in a lot of process foods there putting hidden sugars i they are putting a lot of things that cause your gut to send signals to your brain that make you crave more of those foods for those of you that really love sugar just understand its not just about how that sugar tastes the new study from the bores lab deserves attention i believe this is a paper publish just recently february twenty fifth this year twenty twenty two in nature enrol science and excellent journal and the title of the paper is the preference for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sense a cell the borer's lab is now discovered a sauropod cell meaning a category of neurons that can distinguish between sweet things in the gut that contain calories for instance sugar and things in the gut that are sweet but do not contain calories artificial sweetness ascertain sucres and forth there are also of course inartificial non colonic sweeteners stein monfruid et camera they did not explore the full gallery of artificial sweetness what they did find however ought to pertain to all forms of sweet non colonic substances what they discovered was that there is a signature pattern of signals sent from the gut to the brain when we invest artificial or noncaloric sweeteners this is important because what it says is that at a subconscious level the gut can distinguish between sweet things that contain calories and sweet things that do not now what the downstream consequences of this tensing is or what they are is not yet clear now i believe everyone should be aware of these kinds of studies for a couple of reasons first of all its important understand that what you crave meaning the food you crave in the drinks you car we is in part due to your conscious experience of the taste of those things but also due to big chemical and neural events that start in the body and impinge on your brain and cause you to seek out certain things even though you might not know why your seeking out more sugar you find their craving a lot of sugar or your craving a lot of foods with artificial sweetness and you do not necessarily know why now artificial sweeteners themselves are a somewhat controversial topic i want to high that some months back i described o study from yell university about how one concondition the insolent system insolent is involved in mobilizing a blood sugar and forth in the body as many of and i describe some studies that were done from yell university school of medicine looking at how artificial sweeteners can actually evoke an insolent response under certain conditions now a couple of teachings i got a la bit of push back after covering thus studies and i encourage push back all the time it is push back as one of those things that forces all of us to drill deeper into a topic i want to be clear first of all i am not one to demonize artificial sweetness there is evidence in animal models in animal models that artificial sweeteners can destroy the gotmacrobayom but those were fairly high doses of artificial sweetness and it is unclear of the same thing pertains to humans still unclear i should say has not been investigated thoroughly some people do not the taste of artificial sweeteners some people do some people find that they really help them avoid excessive cleric an take some people believe and yet i should emphasized their still is not evidence that they can adjust the insolent response in all people a sone repeat that three times that a people are clear on that fact what these new data emphasize however is that we need to understand how artificial sweeteners a consumed at the level of the gut or i should say registered at the level of the gut and how that changes brain function because one thing that ism familiar with hen that many people report is that when y they first taste artificial sweetness they taste sort of not right to them they do not the taste but overtime they actually start to crave that taste have experience this i used to drink a lot of diet sodas when i was in graduate school to be ascertain and i found that i would neat i actually needed them now maybe was the caffeine may be i dislike the sweet taste of the carbonation we actually have i a drive for carbonation which is he topic of a future episode but when i finally quit them for reasons that were independent of any fear of artificial sweetness i found that i did not the taste nowadays i only occasionally drink a diet soda i usually do that corona plain and there is nothing else available to me i do not demonize them i might a drink one every once in a while no big deal i also want to be clear i consume stein an a number of different a supplements and foods that i consume stein of course is a plant baste non colonic sweeter i myself consume artificial sweetness many people hate them many people them and find them useful for their nutrition and in fact to keep their color can take in arrange that is right for them and many people myself are curious about them and somewhat weary of them and yet continue to consume them in small amounts i think most people probably fall into that category i should also mention that many food manufacturers put artificial sweeteners such as scrolls et camera into foods and it is always been unclear as to why they might want to do that and yet we know that the sweet taste consumption even if it does not contain calories can drive more craving of sweet food there may be a logic or a strategy to why they do that again a topic for exploration on to day's podcast and in future podcast because where were headed to day is a discussion about how salt and salt sensing both consciously and unconsciously can adjust our craving for other things sugar and water and on i want a dislike this beautiful work from the bores lab will put a link to the study i want to open this as a chapter for further exploration i to think that the listeners is of this podcast are looking for answers where we have answers but are also i would hope excited about some of the new and emerging themes in what we called nutritional neurobiology and indeed the boors lab really stands as one of the prefer laboratories out there that is looking at how foods as consumed in the gut are modifying our nervous system the foods we crave and how we utilize those foods before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and scenes relax the tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gut microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock am slash supermen and claim a special offer he will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of data now showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if fore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin three and k too is also important because it regulates things cartyvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fiery travel packs and the year supply of vitamin three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and none of the things you do not that means it has salt magnesium and potassium called electrolytes which are critical for coronal function and a lot of other biological functions as i mention on the podcast before ism a fan of salt i believe in investing appropriate amounts of salt and by appropriate i mean depending on what your background blood pressure happens to be what your activity levels are how much you sweat what your connive and physical demands are to day organ a talk about how to determine what those needs are ism always trying to stay on top of my hydration and as you will also learn about to day salt and water in take and hydration are intimately related with element ism sure to get the potassium the sodium and the magnesium that i need and i do that in a great tasting drink and as i mention before it has no sugar if you to try element you can go to drink element do cam that drink el m and t doc am slash superman to claim a free element sample pay you only cover the cost of shipping otherwise its completely free again that drink element el m and t doc cam slash superman to claim a free sample pack of element oke let us talk about salt salt has many many important functions in the brain an body for instance it regulates fluid balance how much fluid you desire and how much fluid you excrete it also regulates your desire for salt it half meaning your salt appetite you have a homeostatically driven salt appetite it'll talk about the mechanisms to day make them all very clear what that means is that you crave salty things beverages foods when your salt stores are low and you tend to avoid salty beverages foods when your salt stores are high although that is not always the case their circumstances where you will continue crave salt even though you do not need salt or indeed even if you need to eliminate salt from your system salt also regulates your appetite for other nutrients rings sugar rings carbohydrates and to day will explore all of that technically salt is a mineral and i should mention that when i say salt i am indeed referring to sodium in most cases although i will be clear to distinguish salt from soda meaning for table salt from sodium most people do not realize this but one graham of table salt contains about three hundred and eighty eight milligrams of sodium technically we should be talking bout sodium today and not salt i will use them interchangeably unless ism referring to some specific recommendations or ideas about trying to define your ideal salt ace sodium intake chase this is important i think right off that a lot of people get themselves into a place of confusion and protect even to a place of trouble by thinking that table salt in grahams always equates to sodium in grahams in that simply not the case to day we are going to explore the neural mechanisms by which we regulate are salt appetite and the way that the brain an body interact in the context of salt seeking salt avoidance how to determine when we need more salt when we need less salt well talk aba kidney function weight into all of it and we arguing to do it very systematically let us start in the brain we all harbor small sets of neurons we call these sets of neuron's nuclei meaning clusters of neurons that since the levels of salt in our brain and body there are couple brain regions that do this and these brain regions are very very special special because they lack biological fences around them the other brain areas have and the those fences r idiots a that fence goes by a particular name and that name is the blood brain barrier or b b b most substances that are circulating around in your body do not have access to the brain in particular large molecules cannot just pass into the brain the brain is a privileged organ in this sense there a couple o other organs that are privileged and that have very strict barriers very particular fences if you will those other organs include things the ovaries and testes and that makes sets for the falling reason first of all the brain at least most of the brain cannot regenerate after injury you just simply cannot replace brain cells after injury i know people get really excited about nurogenesists the birth of new neurons and indeed nurgenesis has been demonstrated in animal models and to some extent it exists in humans in a few places for instance the factory bulb where neurons are responsible for detecting operant in the environment for smell that is and in the little subregion of the hippocampus of memory aria there is probably some autogenesis but the bulk of really good data out there point to the fact that in humans there is not much turn over of neurons what that means is that the neurons you are born with are the ones that your going to be using most if not all of your life in fact you are born with many more neurons than you will have later and there is a process of naturally occurring sell death called a proptosis that occurs during development you actually are born with many more neurons an you have later in life and that is the reflection of a normal healthy process of nerve sell elimination the estimates vary but anywhere from a third to may be even a half or even two thirds of neurons depending on the brain arranges can a tie across development there might sound terrible but that is shall one of the ways in which you go from being count of a old potato bug flopping around helplessly in your crib to being an organism that can walk and talk and articulate and a calculate math or do whatever it is that you do for a living the brain has a set of elements these nerve cells and other cells and it needs to use those for the entire life span having a b b b a blood brain barrier around the brain is absolutely critical the ovaries and testes have a barrier for we assume the reason that they contain the genetic material by which we can pass o n agents to our offspring progeny meaning make children and those children will have organs a at least half of them the other half from the partner of course if the cells within the ovaries untested are mutated well then you can get mutations and offsprings that is very costly in the evolutionary sens it jakeses that you have a barrier from the blood if you invest what is called the mutagen if you unjust something that can mutate the genes of of cells e can imagine why there would be a premium on not allowing those mutagens to get into the brain the ovaries of the testes the brain has this babe this blood bring barrier around it which makes it very very hard for substances to pass into the brain unless those substances are very small or those substances and molecules a are critically required for brain function however there are couple of regions in the brain that have a fence around them but that fences weaker a it sort f going from a really big wall thick a electronic twenty four hours surveillance fence where nothing can pass through except only the exclusive cargo that is allowed to go through to having a little cyclone fence with a couple holes in et are that kind of a picket sense that is falling over and substances can move freely in from the blood circulating in the body into the brain and it turns out that the areas of the brain that monitor salt balance and other features of what is happening in the body at the level of what we call molarity at the concentration of salt reside in these little sets of neurons that sit just on the other side of these weak fences and the most important and famous of these for ts sake of to days conversation is one called oi let novelty stands for the organic vasculum of the lateral terminals hint is what is called a circus ventricular organ why circumventricular well not to bog you down with neurananomy but your brain is a big squishy mass of neurons and other retypes but it has to be nourished and through the middle of that brain there is a tube there is a hollow that create spaces in those spaces are called ventricle the ventricle are spaces in which cerebral spinal fluid circulates and it nourishes the brain it does a number of other things as well the circus ventricular organs are areas of the brain that are near that circulating fluid and that circulating fluid has access to the blood stream an the bloodstream has access to it and the structure that are referring to oi let organobasculosume of the lateral terminals has neurons that nonsense the conte contents of the blood and to some extent the cerebral spinal fluid there are couple other brainarieas that can do this as well they go also by the name of circumventricular organs and it'll talk about the names of some of those other airs but for to day and i think for sake of most of the discussion understand that the joviality is specials why because it does not have this thick barrier fence which sounds a bad thing and yet it is a terrific border detector the neurons in that region are able to pay attention to what is passing through in the bloodstream and candetect for instance if the levels of sodium in the blood stream or too low if the level of blood pressure in the body is too lower too high and then the joviality can send signals to other brain areas and then those other brain areas can do things release hormones that can go and act on tissues in what we call the periphery in the body and for instance have the kidneys secret more urine to get rid of salt that is excessive salt in the body or have the kines hold on to burin to hold on to whatever water or fluid that one might need before i go any deeper into this pathway just understand that the vial has a very limited barrier it can detect things in the blood stream and this incredible area of the brain almost single handed sets off the cascades of things that allow you to regulate your salt balance which turns out to be absolutely critical not just for your ability to thing can for your nuance to work but indeed for all of life if the joviality does not function correctly our effectively dead or dead soon this is a very important brain region let us talk about the function of the opiate and flesh out some of the other aspects of its circuitry of its communication with other brain areas and with the body in the contacts of something that we are all familiar with which is thirst a your wonder just why you get thirsty well it is because neurons in your vial the are detecting changes in your blood stream which detect global changes within your body and in response to that your joviality sets off certain events within your brain and body that make you either want to drink more fluid or to stop drinking fluid their two main kinds of thirst the first one is called osmotic thirst and the second is called hypo polemic thirst osmotic thirst has to do with he concentration of salt in your blood stream let say you invest something very very salty let say you invest i know a big bag of i id confess an on eat these very often but i really those kettle potatochips and their pretty salty out of never actually measured how much sodium's in them sure the information hare every once in a while from particularly interested in doing it'll just down bag of those things and i really them in their very salty but they almost always make me feel thirsty and the reason is that by eating those have invested a lot of soda again not a frequent occurrence for me but happens every now and again and i do not have too much shame about that because i thing i have a pretty healthy relationship to food and i enjoy them and i understand that it will drive salt levels up in my blood stream and that will cause me to be thirsty but why why because neurons in the joviality come in to main varieties one variety senses the osmalarity of the blood that getting across that weak little fence that we talked about before and when the similarity meaning the salt concentration the blood is high it activates the specific neurons in the ovialti and by activates i mean it causes them to send electrical potentials literally send electrical signals to other brainareas and those other brainareas inspire a number of different downstream events to what are those other bring areas wile the ovialti signals to an area called the superoptic nucleus the name and why its call the superoptan nucleus is not necessarily important it also signals to the called paraventricular nucleus another nucleus that sits near the ventricle and commoner the qualities the chemical qualities of the cerebrospinal fluid as well as probably the blood stream is well and the consequence of the that communication is that a particular hormone is eventually released from the posterior pituitary now the pituitary is a gland that sits near the roof of your mouth it releases all sorts of things growth hormone and utilizing hormone utilizing hormone will stimulate things estrogen and testosterone production and release from the overiesantestes and on the pituitary has a bunch of different compartments and functions but what is really cool about the pituitary is that certain regions of the pituitary actually contained the acts on the wires of neurons and the neurons reside in the brain and the superoptic nucleus gets a signal from the opiate the signal is purely in the form of electrical activity remember neurons are not talking in one another about what is happening out there that saying stay there is too much salt in the blood stream that's do something about it all they receive are are called action potential waves electricity the neurons in the superoptic nucleus then release their own electrical signals within the pituitary and some of those neurons and near by neurons are capable of releasing hormones as well as electrical signals from the pituitary there is a hormonal signal that is release called vazopressin vesopressan also goes by the name antidiaratic hormone and antipyretic hormone has the capacity to either restrict the amount of urine that we secrete or when that system is turned off to increase the amount of drone that we secrete there is a complicated set of cascades that is evoked by having high salt concentration in the blood there is also complicated see of cascades that are evoked by having low concentrations of sodium in the blood but the pathway is none the less the same it is ovialti is detecting those similarity changes communicating to the superoptic increase supersonic rules is either causing the release of or is releasing ten oppress and antidaeratic hormone or that system is shut off that the antydiaretic hormone is not secreted which would allow ruin to flow more freely ripe antipyretic means anti release of urine and by shutting that off you are going to cause the release of urine your sort of allowing a system to flow to speak the second category of thirst is hypovolemic thirst hypovolemic thirst occurs when there's a drop in blood pressure och the vial ta as i mention before consents molarity based on the fact that it has these neurons that can detect how much fault is in the bloodstream but the loyalty also harbors neurons that are of the barrio receptor merchant receptor category now more on barrio receptors and merchant receptors later but barrio receptors are essentially a receptor a meaning a proline that in a cell that responds to changes in blood pressure there are number of things that can cause decreases in blood pressure some of those include for instance if you lose a lot of blood right if your bleeding quite a lot or in some cases if you vomit quite a lot or if you have extensive diarrhoea or any commination of those and there are other things that can reduce blood volume and we will talk about some of those later but in the classic case of hypovolemic thirst one is simply losing blood and therefore blood pressure goes down o very simple the to imagine your monte of these types which are the arteries veins and calories and when you lose some blood volume the pressure in those arteries veins an capillaries goes down vial t has neurons that consents that reduction in blood pressure because the reduce because of the presence of barrel receptors in joviality therefore other elements that also play in to the response to what we call hypovolemic thirst for instance the kidney will secrete something called renin rennin will activate something called angiotensin to from the lungs of all things amazing an angiotends into itself can act on vial organobasclos on trilateral terminals which in turn will create thirst cha in both cases rite the molarity sensing system meaning osmotic thirst and in hypovolemic thirst where blood pressure has dropped the end result is a desire to drink more and that desire to drink more comes to a variety of pathways that are both direct and indirect include vest present and do not include vest present but i think for just sake of general example and even for those of you that do not have any biology background of physiology background just understand that their two main types of thirst both types of thirst om osmotic thirst and hypovolemic thirst are not just about seeking water but they also are about seeking salt in very general terms salt a cassodium can help retain water now that does not mean that salt always retains water if you have excessive amounts of salt will you retain excessive amounts of water well sort of as will soon learn it is all contextual but for most cases we can say that by having salt in our system our brain in our body can function normally provided the levels of salt are adequate and not too high or too low and thirst while we often think of it is just a way to bring fluid into our body is design as a kind of a in terreceptive perception what i mean by that and terreception as many of now from messing this podcast is a paying of attention or or a recognition rather a conscious recognition of the events going on within our body when we are thirsty it is a certain form of interception we owe i i need something or i crave something you may not know exactly what you need but when you are thirsty you're not just seeking water your also seeking to balance your molarity which means you may be seeking salty fluids or foods in some cases you will try no to accomplish us by eating or it may be that you are trying to avoid or you will be inspired to avoid salty fluids and foods but if you want to understand sodium and its rolls in the body you have to understand thirst and if you want understand thirst you have to understand how fluid balance is regulating the body that is not surprising it all but sodium and water work together in order to generate what we call this sodium water work together in order to either retain water or inspire us to let go of water to urinate before we can dive into the specific surround salt and how to salt for performance and various recommendations and things to avoid we need to drill little but deeper into this fluid balance mechanism in the body and for that reason we have to pay at least a little bit of attention to the kidney the kidney is an incredible organ and one of the reasons that inner is amazing is that it is responsible for both retaining holding on to or allowing the release of various substances from the body substances glucose or men acids your metric acid salt potassium magnesium it is basically a filter but it is a very very intelligent filter intelligent meaning it does not have its own mind but the way it works is is really beautiful basically blood enters the kidney and it goes through a series of tubes which are arranged into loops if you want to look more into this there the the beautiful loop of hence and other aspects of the kidney design that allow certain substances to be retained an other substances to be released depending on how constant treated those substances are in the blood the kidney responds to a number of hormonal signals including vesopresson in order to for instance antidiraticormon in order to hold on to more fluid if that is what your brain and body need and it responds to other hormonal signals as well it is a pretty complex organ none the less there is a key point which i already mention that i think most people do not realize that this actually something that i to tell kids when i meet them provided that there a appropriate age it'll say a oftentimes if it kids learn ism a scientist the will the lanka he question about something relate tho science and hopefully for my sake get something abut burro science a but one thing that it'll tell kids it'll say do that your our urine your pe is actually filtered blood and occasionally that will really terrify a kid but on that also occasionally really terrifies an adult abut indeed your urn is filtered blood its we blood gets into the kidney the kidneys can a filter out certain things certain things r can be allowed to pass through and others are not q the way the kidney is designed is that about ninety per cent of the stuff that is absorbed from the blood is going to be absorbed early in this series of tubes and only a small percentages going to be regulated or worked out as you get into what is called the distal kidney distal just means the fourth the furthest part away of the proximal is up close ism your shoulder is proximal to your midline of your body and your hand is distal in biological try to hear about proximal distal which douce means near or far from just to give a really simple example let say that you are very low on fluid you have not had much to drink in a while make your walking round on a hot day chances are that the neurons in your oi l t will sense the increase in similarity right the concentration of salt is going to be increased relative to the fluid volume that is circulating this of course assumes that you have not excreted a lot of sodium for one reason or another but that increase in similarities detected by the volt the volt is going to signal a bunch of different cascades through the superoptect cleats et camera and then veto pressing is going to be released into the blood stream and vena pressor again also called antitiaretic hormone is going to act on the kidney and change the kidneys function in a couple of different ways some mechanical some chemical of in order to make sure that your kidney does not release much water does not make you want to your in ate and in fact even if you would try to your in ate your bodies going a tend to hold on to its fluid stores it is a very simple straight for it example we can also give the other example whereby if you are investing a lot a lot a lot of water and it is not a particularly hot day nor not sweating very much must assume your sultan take is constants or is low for whatever reason well then the molarity the sal concentration in your blood is going to be lower your opiate will detect that because of these onto sin sing front in yourovialte your ovialtee will fail to signal to the superoptic nucleus and there will not be the release of vesoppressin antipyretic hormone and you can excrete a all the water that o your body wants to extra meaning you will be able to urinate there is no holding on to water at the level of the kidney i get very simple examples but hopefully to illustrates how events within the blood meaning the concentration of salt relative that the amount of fluid it that is what molarity is is detected by the opiate the brain then communicates to the pituitary the pituitary sends a hormone out in the blood and the hormone acts on the kidney to either hold on to or let go of fluid meaning to prevent you from wanting to urinate or from stimulating you to want to urinate very very simple kind of yes no type situation here there is a lot of wants to this in reality their a lot of other hormones in his pathway but i think for least the stage of the discussion this should be sufficient some of you may have noticed that a molecule we have been talking a lot about to day vesoppressin was also mention on a previous episode of the hubroane lapped was but in a very different context molecule on referring to his vesoppressin and mention it is a hormone involved in anti dieresis meaning preventing urination it is an antidiaretic but we also talked about ten oppressing in the content of desire love and attachment we talked about in the content of monogamy and nonmonogamy in a species of animal called the prairievol you can check it out that episode i believe a vesoppressin and the nonmonogamis a prairie vows are a mentioned in the timestamps or should be easy to fine ten oppression is made at multiple locations in the nervous system mainly the superoptic nucleus and indeed it is also involved in aspects of sexual behavior and making now it does that through mechanisms that are distinct from it is antipyretic effects in fact there are people and who take vesoppressin as an aphrodisiac now ism certainly not suggesting people do that but i have all the confidence in the world that the moment i talk about vesoppressind some one in the comment as can say what d you think about vesoppressin nasal sprays in this kind thing esopressin end indeed ox toxin another a hormone that is involved in perabonding and various aspects of brain anybody function are available as a nasal sprays ah that can get up into the deep recesses of the brain and can impact some of these for what we call hypothalamic functions these primitive drives and hypothalamic functions i would encourage a lot of caution on may be even extreme caution in recreational use of things vesopressin and oxytocin less you are working with eddy and eddy excuse me and they prescribe ever they really know what they are doing these are powerful hormones that have a lot of different effects on the brain and body the way that they oppressed meaning antidiarretic hormone prevents the release of fluid as urine from the body is pretty interesting it acts directly on the kidney as i mention before blood flows into the kidney a number of things are retained in the early part of the kidney they oppression acts at a fairly distal meaning n out and and game a part of the of the loops of tubes through the kidney and it increases the permeability of those tubes in other words it make sure that the fluid that would otherwise pass into a collecting duct an than go out to the flatter never actually makes it to the blade i point this out because what antidiaretic hormone does as it prevents the flatter from filling at all it is not as if it locks fluid in the flatter and prevents you from urinating i think the way give been describing the gs up until now the way you will hereabout antidiaretic torment might sound it and a locks up the bladder prevents you from being able the urinate be hove a full flatter that will be very uncomfortable that is not the way it works it actually causes the tubes headed towards the flatter from the kidney to become permeable meaning to a low fluid to go back into the blood stream into the rest of the body that fluid never actually fills the flatter also you never feel the urge to urinate now this is an episode about salt a anything to understand about the kidney is that the kidney uses sodium in order to conserve water which has everything to do with the fact that sodium can actually hold water put differently water tends to follow sodium where we have sodium we tend to have water and sodium when it is concentrated can hold on to water and that is one of the main ways that the kidney holds on to water in the body and as will soon learn it is there is no simple and direct formula to say for instance okay if salt levels are high a lot of water is retained and if salt levels are low a lot of water is released on the one hand that can be true but it is also the case because these systems are homeostatic meaning that always seeking balance both within system within the salt system and between systems the salt and water system it is also the case often that if we have enough sodium well then we can secrete sodium and some water will follow or if we do not have enough sodium then yes indeed because we are not holding on to water more fluid can be excreted but if that condition of sodium lasts long enough than we start to retain water because the body recognizes ah salt is low and waters being excreted and eventually a system will kick in to retain water it'd love to give you a simple black and white yes or no answer for sodium highsodium moderate sodium and water balance but it is all contextual and when i say contextual i mean it will depend on blood pressure high pretension prey pretension if that is there may be normal tension hormone levels exercise et camera et camera a pretty good example of how complicated this connolby is one that some of you may be familiar with it is pretty well known that during certain phases of the menstrual cycle when estrogen and progesterone and other hormones are fluctuating that water can be retained in the body there is it is what is called editor or a swelling sometimes the the common assumption and indeed it can be true that when estrogen levels are high there is water retention in the body also in male if estrogen levels are high there can be water retention the body this is one of the reasons why a athletes and in premolar body builders who take anabolic steroids testocterom which can be converted into estrogens sometimes they will look they'll walk around they look they were partially inflated they look there get a pop and its in its it looks a swelling of the skin not just because they have large muscles and that not always but often water retention do to testosterone conversion into estrogen now that all sounds consistent right estrogen levels fluctuated in the menstrual cycle in mails where there is an increase in estrogen there is pretension of water but actually estrogen acts as a dramatic one would think locate when estrogen levels go up there should be a lot of fluid excreted but i bring up this example to point out that it is a very complicated in dynamic balance between hormones and salt and fluid you cannot draw one to one relationship there and that turns out to be a very important point and we can use that not as a way to further complicate things but is away to understand under which contacts less do you men take or more do you men take can be beneficial that shaw i to turn our intension now how much salt do we need and what can we trust in terms of trying to guide our ingestion of salt first of all i want to be very very clear that there are a number of people out there that have prey pretension or high pretension you need to know if you have prey pretension or hug pretension you need to know if you have normal tension meaning normal blood pressure every one should know their blood pressure the absolve crucial measurement that has a lot of impact on your immediate longer health out comes it informs a lot about what you should do should you be doing more carton of vascular exercise should you be insulting more or less salt should you be adjusting any number of different lifestyle factors you need to know that and without knowing what your blood pressure is i cannot give a a one'seyes fits all recommendation and indeed ism not can to give medical recommendations ism simply get spell out what i know about the research which hopefully will point you in the direction of figuring out what is right for you in terms of salt and indeed fluid intake there is a school of thought that everybody is consuming too much salt and i do want to highlight the fact that there are dozens if not hundreds of quality papers that point to the fact the hat a quoting quote high salt diet can be bad for various organs and tissues in the body including the brain it just happens that because fluid balance both inside and outside of cells is crucial not just for your heart and for your lungs and for your liver and for all the organs of your body but also for your brain that if the salt concentration inside of cells in your brain go becomes too high neurons suffer might they will draw fluid into those cells because water tons to follow salt as i mention before and those sells can swell you can literally get swelling of brain tissue conversely if salt levels are too low inside of cells in any tissue of the body but in the brain included then the cells of the body and brain can shrink because water is pulled into the extra cellar space away from cells and indeed under those conditions brain function can suffer and indeed the over all health of the brain can suffer there are many reports out there indicating both an experimental models and to some extent in humans that over consumption of salt is bad for brain function and longevity and yet there is also decent evidence in both animal models and humans that if salt consumption is too low then brain health and longevity will suffer as will other organs and tissues of the body most things ideology you do not want things too high or too low now i would say that the vast majority of studies out there point to the fact that a high salt diet is detrimental to brain health and function most of the studies have focussed on that aspect of salt balance and its consequences on brain function one critical issue with many of those studies however is that the high salt diet is often coupled to other elements of diet that are also unhealthy things excessively high levels of carbohydrates or fats or comminations of carbohydrates and fats and while i know there many burning questions out there about how much salt one needs if they are on a low carbohydrate diet or if they are fasting or if they are on a vegan diet there have simply not been many studies that have explored the low moderate and high salt conditions on a back drop of very controlled nutrition and that is probably reflective of fact that there are not a lot of very well controlled nutrition studies out there there are some of course but it is very hard to get people to adhere to nutritional plans in a very strict way and to do that for sufficient periods of time that would allow that the various health outcomes to occur none the less there some interesting reports that indicate that the amount of sal it in take can indeed predict health outcomes or what we call hazardous events i things alike party vascular events and stroke and forth and what is interesting is that indeed a lower not sing low mi because i do not believe that you want your diet to be truly low in anything except perhaps poison but a lower salt diet can reduce the number of these called hazardous events but it is a somewhat of a shallow you shaped function such that less indeed a high salt in take can be very detrimental for your health both in terms of party vascular events stroke and and other deleterious health events but somewhere in the middle that actually sits quite to the right meaning higher than what is typically recommended for salt and take can actually reduce the number of these hazardous events at least some reports point to that and i one emphasize what one of those particular reports says and i also one to be sure to counter it from the perspective of the contacts at that study was see in because again my gold here is not to give you a strict set of recommendations at all is to point you to the literature try no make that ligature is clear as possible and allow you to evaluate for yourself i do not you say that to protect us i say that to protect you because indeed you are responsible for your health in your health choices the paper that i am referring to the very interesting one we of course never want to put too much weight on any one report but this is a paper that was published in two thousand eleven in the journal of the america medical association the title of the the paper is urinary sodium and potassium excretion and a risk of cardiovascular events we have not talked much about potassium yet but sodymin potassium tend to work in concert in the brain embody in order to regulate various physiological functions and health and will talk more about potassium's time goes on the key plot or set of data in this study a for those who do want to look it up we will link to it there allot of data in here it but is figure one which is basically evaluating the amount of urinary excretion of sodium which is a somewhat indirect but none the less valuable measure of how much sodium people were ingesting and plotted against that is what they call the hazard ratio and the hazard ratio points to a the composite of cardiovascular death stroke myocardial in faction and an impact is an injury and hospitalization for congestive heart failure and what it points to is the fact that the hazard ratio is low is at sodymixcretion of about two grahams per day but then continues to go down until about four point five to five grahams per ay that remember this as sodiumicscretion it is reflective of how much sodium was in the body which is reflective of how much sodium was ingested and then the hazard ratio increases fairly dramatically a very a steep slope heading anywhere from seven to eight to ten and outwards twelve grams of sodium excretion per day the simplest way to interpret these data are that at fairly low levels of sodium meaning it about two grams per day you run fewer health risks but the number of risk continues to decline as you move towards four and five grams per day and then as you increase your salt in take further then the risk dramatically increases no study is wholly nor is any figure in any study or any collection of studies wholly rather we always want to look at what the bulk of data in a particular field reveal none the less i think that the plot that we described meaning the the graftthat we described as pretty interesting in light of the twenty twenty to twenty twenty five dietary recommendations for america which are which is that people consume no more than two point three grams meaning twenty three hundred milligrams of sodium per day that is about half a teaspoon of salt per day now most people are probably consuming more than that because of the fact that they are investing process foods and process foods ten to have more salt in them the non process foods now of course that is not always the case right see salt is not a process food in most cases of and there are a lot of on process foods that can be high in sodium but process foods in particular and have alto sodium you can see this simply by looking at the packaging of any number of different foods but if we are to take this number of two point three grams that is the the recommended cut off for ingestion of sodium it actually falls and a portion of the curve that we were talking about a moment ago that indeed is associated with low hazard out lo low incidents of hazard is outcomes cardiovascular vent stroke et camera but the invest according to that plot the ingestion of four or five grams of sodium almost double or more sodium than is currently recommended is associate with even lower numbers of of hazardous events we need to think about this and we need to explore it in the context of other studies of course and we need to evaluate t in terms of this thing that we have been going back to again and again which is context right these recommendations of two point three gram per day cut off is in the context of a landscape where some people do indeed have my pretension or prehyperetension the incidents of high pretension as gone up dramatically in the last hundred years and seems to continue to go up whether or not that because of increase salt intake or whether not because of increase salt in take and other things such as highly processfoods that is not clear again pointing to the the challenge in doing these epic gemological studies and really parsing what aspects of a change in a some halthmetric is due to for instance the ingestion of more sugar's verses more salts or simply because of the ingestion more salts it is a complicated almost barbed wire topic by now but we can start to pull apart that barbed wire tangle and start to a valuate some of the other people in other conditions that exist out there may be for you that actually warrant more sodiamen take i where more sodium and take might actually be beneficial again i want to be very very clear that you need to know your good pressure if you have high blood pressure or your preside pretense you should be especially cautious about doing anything that increases your blood pressure and as always you want it of course talked your doctor about doing anything that could adjust your health in any direction but none the less there are some important papers have been published in recent years i want of point to one of them in particular this is a paper that was published in the journal autonomic nor science basic and clinical because this paper several other papers ask the question and indeed they asked the question in the title its a review dietary sodium and health how much is too much for those with orthostatic disorders now orthostatic disorders come in a bunch of diffentvarieties and erelong to talk about those in a moment but there are a number of people out there that have low blood pressure i people that get dizzy when they stand up people that are feeling chronically fatigued and in some cases not all those groups cannectually benefit from increasing their soda men take several episodes to go on the suborn alpacas i gave it what it just clearly what we call anecdota which is not even really data just anecdotal data of an individual who was always feeling hungry and craving sugar and based on the fact that they also had low blood pressure i had them talk to a physician and they got permission to try a hominy experiment on themselves and they did and that many experiment was any time they felt they were craving sugar or they were feeling a light headed and dizzy rather than reaching for something with colonic an take they took a little bit of seesaw a little pinch of peasant and put it into some water and drank it or in a the case of this individual thy would rashly take a little desalt packet and hey would huge down as seesaw packet and for them that provided tremendous relief for their dizziness but that of course was in the contact of somewhat abnormally low blood pressure i do not think that they are alone in the fact that many people out their suffer from a low blood pressure condition many people out their suffer from a high blood pressure condition know your blood pressure and understand that blood pressure in part is regulated by you soda men take and your sodium balance why well because of the similarity of blood that we talked about before where if you have a certain concentration of sodium meaning sufficient sodium in your blood stream that will tend to draw water into the blood stream and essentially the pipes that are your capillaries arteries and and veins will be full the blood pressure will get up to your head whereas some people their good pressure is low because the similarity of their blood is low and that can have a number of downstream consequences i should also mention it can be the consequent itself of challenge is or or even deposits and kidney function but all of these organs are working together the encouragement here is not necessarily to ingests more sodium is to know your blood pressure and to address weather not in increase in body men take would actually benefit your blood pressure in a way that could relieve some of the dizziness and other symptoms of things orthostatic disorders but of course to do that in a safe context and to never play games with your blood sugar or your blood similarity that could set your system down a cascade if negative events let us look at what the current recommendations are for people that suffer from orthostatic disorders orthostatic hypo meaning too low tension orthostatc hypotension postural tactic cardiac centrum some times refer to as pots p o t s or idiopathic orthostatic tactic cardiac and syncope these have incredibly elaborate names those groups are often told to increase their salt in take in order to combat their symptoms the america society of my pretension recommends anywhere from six thousand to ten thousand these are very high levels this is six grams to ten grams of salt per day keeping in mind again that salt is not the same as sodium o that equates to about twenty four hundred to four thousand milligrams of sodium per day cannot if you want to learn more about this and get more of the citations i it'll refer you back to this a study on dietary sodium and health how much is too much for those of thorthostatic editors we will put a link to this in the the caption shownotes that is conscious in the you as the salt recommendations from the canada party of archer society are ten thousand milligrams of salt pedalo four grams of sodium is what that equates to and on and on and on four things pots for these postural centrums that result from or i should say from these centrums that involve low blood pressure when people stand up or in certain postures i point out this paper and i point out these higher salt recommendations to emphasize again that context is vital right that people with high blood pressure are going to need certain amounts of salt intake people with lower blood pressure and maybe with some of these postural orthostatic syndrome are going to need higher mounts of salt and for most people out there you are going to need to evaluate how much salt in are is going to allow your brain and body to function optimally and there are some fairly straight forward ways to explore that and there some ways to explore that in the context of what you already know about thirst and salt appetite that can make that exploration one in which it is not going to be a constant wandering around in the dark and where you can figure out what is right for you for most people a modern increase in salt in take is not going to be detrimental provided that you consume enough fluids in particular water i meaning if you happen to over eat salt a bit you will get thirsty you will ingest more water and you will excrete the excessodium there is evidence that the body can store sodium in various organs that storage of sodium may or may not be a detrimental thing in general access storage of sodium and tissues in organs of the brain and body is not thought to be good for long turn health eating much more sodium than you need for long periods of time is indeed bad for you earlier i mention that salt and your hunger and thirst for salt is homiostatically regulated a indeed that is the case much temperature is homeostatically regulated what that means is if you pay attention to it if your salt levels are low you will tend to crave salt and salty beverages and salty foods and in most cases you should probably follow that craving provided those salty beverages and salty foods are not bringing in a lot of other things or anything ideal that is bad for you i think it is fair to say that whether not your vegan vegetarian carnivore omnivore that we should all try to limit our ingestion a process foods i my read of the literature is that sure some process foods are acceptable for us and are notion to kill us outright but that for most people in the world eating fewer process foods is just going to be a good thing to do following your salt hunger and thirst in most cases is going to be beneficial provided that it is in the context of eating healthy non process foods on whatever backdrop of nutritional dietary recommendations is right for you i simply cannot tell you what to eat and what not to eat because i acknowledge the fact that some people are vegans because of ethical reasons related to animals or some people are vegans because of you do not reasons related to a the climate and and the environment other people am do it for specific health reasons likewise i know plenty of people that eat meat and avoid vegetables believe or not and i know people that eat both and they do this often each i should say all sitting literature that supports their particular camp in their particular view it is not a her oratory i want to get into but with respect to salt in take and the fact that home that salt in take is homiostatically regulated it is the case that if your craving salt you probably need it for those of you that are sweating excessively or even if you're in a very hot environment a and you are not exercising in your just losing a your losing water and salt from your system remember also that you can be in a very cold environment very cold dry environments often go together and you can be losing a lot of fluids from your body and you will crave fluids and salt even though it is cold and your not ashy a person noticeably perspiring if your exercising lot of your particular cold dry environment or particular hot environment you ought to be in wasting sufficient amounts of salt and fluid a rule of thumb for exercise based replenishment of fluid a comes from what i a some episodes back referred to as the gain equation a the galloping equation a i named it ill the after andegalpin and i think that is the appropriate attribution there a and galloping is an exercise physiologist at a castrate fullerton i believe a and he's going to be a podcast last here on the hovering lapodcassties in exceptional muscle physiologist he also lives in the practical realm where he gives recommendations about a exercise to expert athletes as well as the everyday person the galloping equation is based on the fact that we lose about one to five pounds of water per hour which can definitely impact are mental capacity and our physical performance and the reason that loss of water from our system impatsmental passing physical performance has a lot to do with literally the changes in the volume of those cells the side of those cells based on how much sodium is contained in or outside those sells and something that i have alluded to before on the podcast and it'll talk about more a in a moment which is that neurons signal to one another by way of electricity through something all the action potential and that actual requires sodium and potassium and magnesium the galloping equation suggests that we start exercise hydrated with electrolytes not just with water that means water that has some sodium potassium and magnesium their simple low castaways to do that will talk about and the formula for hydration the local gallant equation is your body weight in pounds divided by thirty equals the ounces of fluid you should drink every fifteen minutes that may turn out to be more fluid than you can comfortably consume during the activity that your performing now the galloping equation is mainly design for exercise but i think is actually a very good rule of thumb for any time that you need to engage mental capacity notjust physical performance your bodyweight impounds divided by thirty equal the the ounces of fluid you should drink every fifteen minutes does not necessarily mean you have to invest it every fifteen minutes on the dot and i think many activities physical activities but also connive activities fume meetings or in person meetings or lecturing or running or cycling are going to make it complicated to invest the appropriate amount of fluid every fifteen minutes on the dot ism not gin to speak for and for doctor galloping but i think he would probably agree that these are averages to shoot for and that unless your hyper ceramic the idea is to make sure that your entering the activity cognitive or or physical sufficiently hydrated and that throughout that activity your hydrating regularly and it points to the fact that most people are probably under hydrating but notjust under hydrating from the perspective of not investing enough water that thee probably not getting enough electrolytes as well social potassium and magnesium have said two somewhat contradictory things on the one hand i said follow your salt appetite follow your salt thirst if your craving salt in jest some salt until you stop craving the salt on the other hand have given you this on fairly specific recommendation based on the galpanequation that you should invest your body weighting pounded about end by thirty that is how many ounces of fluid you should drink every fifteen minutes which ism guessing for most people is going o be more fluid than their currently drinking on average and how could it be that you can have a recommendation for what is optimal that is different than the amount that you would reflectively drink and it has to do with the fact that a lot of the hormone systems the press an antideeratic hormone other hormones aldosterone and a lot of the neural and hormonal signals that govern salt and water balance are fairly slow to kick in for instance if you eat a fairly salty meal and you sense that salt you will probably meaning you detected and perceive it because the for taste salty you will probably want to drink a fair amount of fluid with it whereas if some of the salt is disguised by other flavor something that will talk about in a few minutes when we talk about the curl representation of things salty and sweet well then you might not notice that something salty and then a few minutes or hours after investing that meal you might feel very very tired you might even wonder whether or not it is because of some blood sugar effect maybe it is a crashing blood sugar you might think am or something else related to that meal or maybe you think it is because of you or some other event in your life but actually what you what has happen as your dehydrated because you did not recognize that you needed to drink more fluids i want of acknowledge the a the contradiction in the idea that everything is homeostatically regulated and therefore you are aware of what you need and the counter a ament that i you need to follow these strict recommendations is as h gan to be somewhere in between and of course your body and bring can start to adapt to certain levels of salt intake there is a now fairly a famous study a that was done in germany which looked at different phases of salt intake meaning they had subjects in jest either twelve grams of salt per day or nine grams per day or six grams per take for fairly long periods of time and they collected yourein for testing this is eta very controlled study i just can a paraphrase from the a national institutes of health a report on the study because am they did a very nice right up of it a and they say that a big surprise of these results is that whatever the level of salt that was consumed sodium was stored end released from the subject's bodies in fairly regular weakly and monthly patterns meaning people tended to adapt to a certain level of salt intake and then led to a fairly constant amount of salt retention and your in fluid excretion and that is because of the various hormones aldosterone which regulate sodium creation from the kidney and luccocorticoids which will talk about more in a moment which help regulate metals an lucocorticquoids are a released from the adrenal glands which ride the top the kidneys and there's a very close relationship between the stress system gluccocortiquoids and the salt system the the reason why your salt appetite is not a perfect redoubt of how much salt you should invest and why it might be helpful to follow some of these formulas the galpanequation especially if you're engaging an exercise where you are going to be perspiring of course is that your body will tend to adapt to a certain amount of salt in take over time and then your appetite for salt will not necessarily be the best indication of how much salt you should in jest or avoid before i move on i want to really re emphasize the fact that inside of the gallant equation there is that mention of every fifteen minutes and people have come back to me again and again about the saying i cannot drink that much water every fifteen minutes it is too much a volume of fluid in my stomach i cannot run with that at camera remember these are averages that is what you want to average around of particular activity these are not strict recommendations where a buzzer goes off in every fifteen minutes you after chug that exact amount of electrolyte containing solution another key feature of the study that i was referring to before of which incident was publish in the journal clinical investigation is that the body regulates it salt and water balance not just by creating sodium i but by retaining o releasing water and this is because of the relationship between sodium and water that we are talking about before and the advantage of this mechanism they state here on paraphrasing is that the long tern maintenance of body fluids is dependent is not as dependent on external water as once believed it what this system probably evolved to do what to adjust the different levels of sodium avail of ability in the environment and that raises a really key element of salt and its importance in human history in human evolution and human health even talk too much about this and their several very good books about the history of salt you knows salt was that was a very valuable and heavily caught after substance throughout much of human history much that their actually written reports of people being paid for labor in the form of salt and ya salt at when it scarce could has been quite expensive in certain regions of the world especially regions located further away from the sea and a a friend of mine who a has deep roots within the culinary community told me about traveling to a to some somewhat impoverished areas of of rope some years ago and going into homes where in the middle of the kitchen table there was a a fish a salty fish hanging from a thread a above the table and that because of a lack of availability of table salt the common practice was to take any food that needed some salt for additional flavoring and shall rub that food on this salty fish or to squeeze the fish a bit on to a on to the food substance in order to get salt from it that is a very a con extreme example nowadays we can of take salt for granted and a mot most of the discussion out there is about excess salt but as i pointing out that salt for a long time has a been a very caught after commodity and one that people really cherished for their health in the episode that i did on metabolism i talked about the relationship between salt and iodine if you are interested in iodine and whether no indie salt or noniodize salt is best or required a id encourage you to listen to that episode which was about again metabolism a some people may need more iodine intake some people perhaps do not some people might even want in just things help some people might not a please listen to that episode if you are interested in the iodine aspects of salt which have direct impact on theroid harmony and theroid function which of course relates to metabolism now days there is a lot of interest in and even a kind of proliferation of a what i call fancy salts whether not you should been busting sea salts or common whether not common table salt will suffix a will suffice in most cases a for what were discussing here common table salt is fine a but i should point out that sea salt often contains other minerals which can be very useful and we will do entire episodes on those other mineral sea salt can contain a it dozens or more of mineral some of which can be quite valuable to our health others of which are are less less important at only need to be consumed in trace amounts but you re not going to get many minerals if any from common table salt and that is why in addition to the pretty colors and perhaps some people report that they actually taste ever some of these of called fancy salts or sea salts you might want a consume a a more advanced form of salt if you will although i supposes actually the more primitive a form of salt of its actually the one that comes from the ocean we have all heard about how excessalt is bat for blood pressure damage the heart the brain et camera i do on to give some voice to situations where too little salt can actually cause problems and this has everything to do with the nervous system without getting into excessive amounts of detail the kidneys as we talked about before are going to regulate salt and fluid balance the a dermal glands which ride adopt the codes are going to make lucocordicoids aldosterone and those are going to directly impact things fluid balance and in part they do that by regulating how much craving for and tolerance of salty solutions a we have and o there some really nice studies that have looked at called a dremelectimes now this an extreme case and its typically done in animal models but it illustrates the roll of the adrenals in salt preference basically when the glucocordicoid system meaning the release of these particular hormones from the adrenal glands is eliminated by a dreamalectinmy economy means removal then the threshold for what is consider too salty really shifts cha typically when the adrenals are intact a animal are a human will prefer a mildly salty to moderately salty solution if given a choice and that some point its salty that it is feels avers if it just taking a gulp of sea water is almost always a verse if i canting of an instance where it is not a verse if in actually drinking sea water can kill you because of the high molarity of sea water he certainly do not want to drink sea water under conditions where the adrenals are missing animals an humans will tend to prefer a higher sodium concentration fluid and they will be willing to tolerate in jesting very high concentrations of sodium now that is a very crude experiment and not one that you want to do i promise you but i mention it because it illustrates the very direct relationship between the stress system which is the gluccocorticoid system and the salt craving system and this hi make sense earlier as we retognahypovolemic thirst when there is a loss of blood pressure from usually do to a loss of blood from the body there is a salt craving in order to bring that blood volume back up because by investing salt you bring fluid into the blood stream your increasing that blood pressure and you can restore the blood that is lost now there are many examples where if sodium levels get too low in the blood stream either because people are investing to little salt or they are investing too much water and therefore excreting too much salt that it can cause stress and anxiety there some really nice data that point to the fact that low dietary sodium can actually exacerbate anxiety in animal models and to some extent there is evidence for this in humans as well and that should not come as a surprise the whole basis for a relationship between the adrenal system these glucocorticoides things aldosterone and the craving for sodium is that the stress system is a generic system designed to deal with various challenges to the organism to you or to me or to an animal and those challenges can arrive in many different forms the can be an infection it can be famine it can be lack of water and on but in general the stress response is one of elevated tartrate elevated blood pressure and an ability to maintain movement and resistance to that challenge i i said this before but it'll emphasize it again there is this common is perception that stress makes us sick and indeed if stress last too long it has a number of negative effects on our health but more often than not if we are pushing pushing pushing were studying or taking care of somebody or traveling crazy we do not tend to get sick under those conditions but as soon as we stop as soon as we reduce her renal an output as soon as we reduce our glucocorticuoite output from our adrenals then we will get sick that is a very common currents and it is because stress actually activates armies system in the short term it'd to a trying to spell this with that stress actually suppresses the umiak system at least not in the short term or long true stress different issue you do not want long term on going stress muscly of several weeks or more none the less it make sense that bringing sodium into the body would be at least one way that we would be wire to counteract or to a resist stress ores i stresses being the things on the outside coming at us it can be stressful relationships stressful job situation again infection and on it is clear from a number of studies that if sodium levels are too low that our ability to meet stress challenges is impaired now that does not mean to place your dime take cosmically high but it does point to the fact that if your feeling anxious perhaps from low blood pressure which can also give seems of anxiety as we talk about before but even if its independent of low blood pressure that slightly increasing sodium take gain i would encourage people do this not in the context of process foods and drinks but ideally in the form of maybe a low bit of of sea salt and water or salting one's food a obit more that that can stable eyes blood pressure and one's ability to lean into stresses in challenges and i say this because i think that most people assume om that adding salt is always bad when in fact that simply not the case there are conditions such as when we are under stress challenge when there is a natural craving for more sodium and that natural craving for more sodium is hard wired into us as a way to meet that challenge it is hard for me to know whether not people out there special the listeners of this podcast are getting too much just enough or too little sodium i cannot know that ism shouting into a tunnel here you have to decide how much sodium sure ingesting but i think that there is some for most people especially people who are not high pretense premie pretense there some will room to explore whether more intake of sodium could actually be beneficial for suppressing some of the anxiety responses that they might feel under conditions of stress again more studies need to be done is certainly more studies an humans need to be done but the relationship between stress and sodium in take in the fact that additional sodium in take may be beneficial and indeed is naturally stimulated by stress should not be necessarily looked as a pathological event i know when some people get stress they crave salty foods that actually hard wired biological phenomenon that you see notjust inhuman but in animals because this is a very primitive mechanism whereby your body is preparing to meet any additional challenges in stresses now we cannot have a discussion about sodium without having a discussion about the other electrolytes magnesium in potassium magnesium is important enough in an an extensive enough topic that we should probably do an entire episode just on magnesium for purposes today's discussion i just will briefly touch on some of the forms of magnesium that we discussed on the podcast before in different contacts one emphasize that many people are probably getting enough magnesium in their diet that they do not need to supplement magnesium some people however opt to supplement magnesium in ways that can support them and therefore many different forms of magnesium and just in very brief passing it'll just say that there is some evidence that you can reduce muscle soreness from exercise by ingestion of magnesium maleate anal a t e have talked before about magnesium three inmate t h are e n o a t e magnesium three name forsake of promoting the transition into sleep and for depth of sleep and perhaps again highlighted perhaps cans write now since mainly animal studies and on going human studies but the data anilin perhaps magnesium three innate can be used as a way to support connive function and longevity that was discussed in the episode with doctor jack headman from stole typically magnesium three in ate is take thirty a sixty minutes before bedtime in order to incurve sleep you can go to our normal that work news letter and look for the one on sleep and you can see the recommendations or i should say the the a options for that because again you should always a check with your physician those are strict across the board recommendations and then there r other forms of magnesium magnesium bisglicinate which is some one of all alternative to three in eye a not known to have cynic enhancing effects but a seems at least on par with magnesium three in eye in terms of promoting transition into in depth of sleep and on there are other forms of magnesium magnesium citrate which a has other functions actually magnesium citrate is a is a fairly effective a laxative am a not known to promote sleep and things that sort a lot of different forms of magnesium and their still other forms out there many people are not getting enough magnesium many people are o a that is magnesium any time were talking about sodium balance we have to take into consideration potassium because the way that the kidney works and the way that sodium balance is regulated both in the body in the brain is that sideman potassium are working in close concert with one another there a lot of different recommendations about ratios out there and they range widely from two to one ratio of potassium to sodium have heard it in the other direction too i have heard a two to one sodium to potassium a the recommendations vary one of the sponsors of this podcast for instance element sh have talked about in this episode in before the ratio there is a gram of sodium to two hundred milligrams of potassium sixty milligrams of magnesium there they adopted for a a a five to one ratio of sodium to potassium and of course many people out to make their own hydration electrolyte formulas though put see salt in some water maybe even in just a potassium tablet it all depends on the context and important contextual element is your diet for instance carbohydrates hold water in the body regardless how much salt and how much fluidyor in jesting if your njustin carbohydrate and you drink fluids water some of that fluids can be retained in the body now for people that are following low carbohydrate diets one of the most immediate effects of a lowcarborhydrate diet is that you are going secrete more water and under those conditions you're also going to lose not just water but you will probably also lose sodium in potassium and some people many people in fact find that when they are in a lower or low carbohydrate diet then they need to make sure that there getting enough sodium and enough potassium and some people do that by taking ninety nine milligram potassium tablets every time they eat some people do that by investing more foods that contain potassium a and of course some people who are on low carbohydrate diets do in jest vegetables or other forms of a food that that carry along with them potassium it is quite variable from person to person am you can imagine if carbohydrate holds water water and salt balance an potassium go hand in hand and hand that if you are on a low carbohydrate diet that you mine to adjust your salt in i in potassium and conversely that if your on a carbohydrate rich diet or a moderate carbohydrate diet than you may need to in just less sodium and less potassium and in fact a certain amount of water is probably coming in through the foods you eat as well i do not say all this to confuse you again i say this because it all depends on the contact ill give yet another contacts that i think its fairly common nowadays which is many people are following a pattern of eating that more or less resembles intermitting fasting or at least time restricted feeding their eating between particular feeding windows and then in the certain parts of the twenty for hour cycle not just sleep but during semen parts of their waking cycle there also actively avoiding food a banking on i think a either the possible on say possible longevity promoting effects of entertain fasting or and or i should say they are banking on the fact that for many people not eating is easier than portion control for certain parts of the day and they find it beneficial to limited calories over all a to a given amount depending on what their goals are by not consuming food for certain periods of the day but usually during those periods of day they're consuming fluids and oftentimes those fluids include not just water but caffeine and caffeine is a diuretic it actually causes the excretion of fluids from the body in part because it causes the excretion of sodium all of that to say that if your somebody who for instance eats your first meal around noon or one or two p m and your fasting for the early part of the day and your drinking coffee or tea or and or investing a lot of water you are going to be exceeding sodium along with that water and many people including myself find that it is useful especially when i am drinking caffeine during that called fasting or a non food in take part of the of time or stricter feeding that am making sure to get enough salt either in the form of something element a an electro drink or putting some peasant into some water or certainly any time one is in jesting caffeine replacing some of the lost water by increasing one's water intake there is some simple rules of thumb around this that i think can get most people a into a place where their a more comfortable and functioning better which is for every ounce of coffee or tea that you drink shows a caffeinated coffee tea that you drink that you consume one and a half times as much water the say you have an eight valence coffee you no trine drink about you do not t to be exact betaine drinking about a twelve ounce glass of water and you might want to put a tiny bit of sodium into that by tiny bit i just mean a tiny pinch of sodium cause remember even if we are talking about increasing the amount of sodium in take over all the total amount of sodium contained in salt is sufficiently high that even just en a quarter teaspoon is going really start to move that number up towards that range a that still within the safe range but you can if you keep doing that all day long or very quickly gin a t into that excess of salt in take range that is deleterious for health again if your consuming more cafinioar going to be excreting water and salt and potassium and you can have to find ways to bring water salt an potassium back in again this has to be evaluated for each of your own individual situations if you are exercising fast it and your doing that after drinking caffeine then before during and certainly after exercise your got on to replenish the fluids and electrolytes that you lost including sodium you can imagine how this all starts to become pretty dizzying and yet it does not have to be dozen we can provide some useful ranges that for most people will work and let us talk abut with those ranges are and i one a point you to a resource that explores what those ranges are in these various contacts of nutrition exercise and on the resource is a book that was authored by doctor names d nicolantonio a he is not a medical doctor he is a a scientists a to is cardiovascular a physiology as well i believe is a doctor of pharmacy and the title of the book is the salt fix the salt fixes an interesting read because it points to first of all the history of salt a in society and as it relates to health it actually emphasizes some of the major missteps maybeven pretty drastic errors that have been made in terms of trying to interpret a the roll that salt has in various a diseases and emphasizes some of the ways in which perhaps increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes and i think it strikes a pretty nice balance between what is commonly known about salt and what i believe ought to be known about salt or at least taken into consideration ye they the book does provide certain recommendations a and i tally reach out to the author i have never met him in person or talked him directly and i asked him a outright ai said how much salt a you recommend people take on average and a he gave of course the appropriate caveats about press pretension his pretension et camera but made a recommendation which it'll just share with you and and if you want to learn more about the a support for this recommendation you can check out his book the the recommendation he made was anywhere from eight to twelve grahams of salt to day which corresponds to three point to to four point eight grahams of sodium going back to the current a recommendations that we talked about before two point three grams of sodium pray this is about one and a half times to you double the amount of sodium that is currently recommended a in most circles and what this corresponds to is about one and a half to to teaspoons of salt per day to arrive at that three point to for pointing grams of sodium again s the recommendation that was passed along a for most people most conditions barring a specific health a health's shoes now what was also interesting as he pointed to a sodium to potassium ratio which is a four grams of potassium and he also mention four hundred milligrams of magnesium and pointed out and i generally agree here that many people are deficient in magnesium again o that was a three point two to four point grams of sodium four grams of potassium you might think were gachetza one and half to two times the current recommendation but we can go back to that study that was mentioned earlier in the episode that two thousand eleventh study are described this of sort of a ashamed curve in which when you look at the currents of these negative health events they were fairly low at lowsodiumen take lower still at slightly higher sediment take much in line with the recommendations that are made a that were that of doctor a de nicolantonio on passed along to me and then they increase write those talk a riskincrease quite substantially as one moves outpost six crams of sodium sevengrams of sodium prepay that is when things a really do seem to get hazardous a and really it make sense i think given that consensus around this to really avoid very high salt intake the salt fix describes the rational behind those recommendations salt fix also describes in quite o beautiful detail the relationship between salt in take potassium take and the relationship to the sugar consumption system it'd to pick up on this idea of the relationship between salt and sugar because i think that one key aspect of the way that salt can work and can benefit us or and harm us has to do with the way that sodium and sugar are regulated and actually perceived by the brain and how under conditions of certain levels of sodium take we might be inspired to seek more sugar or to crave sweets more or less slap until now we have been talking about salt as a substance and a way to regulate fluid balance and blood volume and on even talked a lot about salt as a taste or the taste of things that are salty and yet we know that we have salt preceptors meaning neurons the fire action potentials when salty substances are detected much in the same way that we have sweet detectors and bitter detectors and we have detectors of mama the savory flavor on our tongue and earlier at the beginning of the episode i talked about the fact that we have sweet receptors neurons that respond to the presence of sugar or even non colonic sweet things in the got in that signals up to the brain through the vaguest nerve and those signals converge on pathways t relate to dopamine and on well we also have salt censors at various locations throughout our digestive tract although that the sensation in the taste of salt shall exerts a very robust effect on certain area s of the brain that can either make us crave more or sate meaning fulfil our desire for salt and you can imagine we this would be important your brain actually has to register whether not your bringing in salt in order to know whether or not you are going to crave salt more or not and beautiful work that's been done by the super lab we cater sour lab at colombia university as well as many other labs have used imaging techniques and other techniques such as molecular biology to define these call parallel pathways parallel meaning pathways that represent sweet or the presence of sweet tastes in the mouth an gut parallel pathways meaning neural circuits that represent the presence of salty tastes in the mouth and gut and on and that those go into the brain move up through brains stemcenters and up to the no quarter indeed where see of our conscious perception is to give us a sense and a perception of the components of the foods that we happen to be investing and a sense in a perception of the fluids and the components of those fluids that we happen to be investing now parallel pathways as ism describe in them are a fundamental feature of every sensory system not just the taste system but also the visual system we parallel pathways for perceiving dark objects or to light objects for perceiving red verses green et camera this is a fundamental feature of how we are built and how our nervous system works and in the taste system much in these other systems these pathways are indeed parallel but they converge in that can influent one another and i think the simplest way to put this is in the context first of the visual system whereby durability to detect the color red has everything to do with the fact that you have neurons in your eye that absorb long wave lengths of light that we call reds red wave lengths of light which are longer wave lengths than say blue light to shorter wavering but it is really the comparison of the electrical activity of the neurons that absorb red light with the activity of the neurons that absorb green light which actually gives you the perception of red that might seem a little counter intuitive but indeed its not it is actually because something is red and has less greenness that we perceive it as more red than the green and this is actually the way that your entire nervous system works is that we are not really good at a valuating absolute levels of anything in the contact of perception its only by comparison and actually there is a fun experiment that you can do i think you probably find easily on line you could also do this experiment at home you can stare at something that is red or green for that matter for a while you make an active decision to not blink and to stare at something that is red and then you look away from that thing in you will actually see a green after image of that red object conversely if you look at something that is green frown you strata you look away yum you will see the red after image of that thing now the taste system does not have quite the same after taste a type effect a but none the less the pathways the parallel pathways for salty in the parallel pathways for sweet and bitter and on can actually interact and this has important relevant in the contact of food choices and sugar raving one of the things that common place nowadays is in many process foods there is a business literally a business of putting called hidden sugars and these hidden sugars are not always in the form of colonic sugars there sometimes in the form of artificial sweetness into various foods and you might say well why would they put more sugar into a food and then disguise the sugary taste given that sweet tastes often compel people to eat more of these things well it is away actually of by passing some of the homeostatic mechanisms for sweet know even though we might think that the more sweet stuff we eat the more sweet stuff we crave general people have a threshold whereby they say have had enough a sugary stuff you can actually a experiences if you ever feel something is really really sweet take a little sip of a water with a habit of lemon mucin it or vinegar and it will quickly quench that overly sweet sensation or perception it will disappear almost immediately there is aptly a practice in a fancy meals of cleansing the palate through the ingestion of different foods and that is the same idea that your cleansing the potyrachy neutralizing the previous tastes that they can bring yet another dish to over indulge you a decadence and forth these sensory systems interact in the way by putting sugars into foods and hiding the sugary taste of those foods those foods even if they contain artificial sweetness can activate the sorts of anurans that we talked about at the beginning of the episode the uropod cells that will then signal to the brain to release more dope to make you crave more of that food whereas had you been able to perceive the true sweetness of that food you might have consumed lessen indeed that is what happens these hidden sugars are kind of diabolical why am i talking about all of this in the contacts of an episode on salt well as many of you probably notice a lot of foods out there contain a salty sweet combination and it that commination of salty and sweet which can actually lead you to consume more of the salty sweet food than you would have if it had just been sweet or it had just been salty and that is because both sweet taste and salty tastes have a homeostatic balance if you unjust something that is very very salty pretty soon your appetite for salty foods will be reduced but if you mask some of that with sweet well because of the a interactions of these parallel pathways you somewhat shut down your perception of how much salt you are investing or conversely by investing some salt with sweet foods you mask some of the sweetness of the sweet foods that you are tasting and you will continue to i indulge in those foods salty sweet interactions a can be very diabolical and can also be very tasty they can be very diabolical in terms of inspiring you to eat more of a particular food than you would otherwise if you were just following your homeostatic salt or your homeostatic sugar balance systems and the beautiful imaging work that is been done by the our lav an other lavs has actually been able to reveal how some of this might work by showing for instance that a certain a onsombole meaning a certain group of anurans is activated by a sweet taste and a not overlapping distinct set of neurons just nearby sitting cheek to jowl with those other naans would be activated by salty tastes and yet others by bitter taste at camera there a separate map of these different parallel pathways but that when foods or fluids are invested that are both salty and sweet you get a yet entirely different on sombre of turns activated your brain everwhether not its for your visual system or your auditory system or your taste system has a way of representing the pure form of taste salty sweet better et camera and has a way of representing their comminations and food manufacturers have have exploited this to large degree i mention all of this because if you are somebody who is looking too explore either increasing or decreasing your sodium take for health benefits for performance benefits in many ways it is useful to do that in the context of a fairly pure meaning unprocessed food in take background whether or not that kit carnivore omnivore a interment fasting or what have you it does not really matter but the closer that foods are to their basic form and taste meaning not compare comminations of large amounts of ingredients et certainly avoiding highly process foods the more quickly you're going to be able to eonian on your specific salt appetite and salt needs which as of a point out numerous timesthroughout this episode are going very from person to person depending on nutrition depending on activity depending on hormone status or even portion of your menstrual cycle for that matter if you want a home in on the appropriate amount of sodium for you yes blood pressure is going to be an important metric to pay attention to as you go along and the parameters for healthy blood pressure arranges are readily available on lines let you refer to those om in order to determine those for yourself but in determining whether or not increasing your salt an take might be beneficial for a for instance for refusing anxiety a bit or for increasing blood pressure to offset some of these postal centrums where you get dizzy et camera for improving sports performance or cognitive performance i can only recommend that you do this in a in a fairly clean context where you're not trying to do this by investing a bunch of salty foods or salty sweet foods et camera and indeed many people find and it is a reviewed a bit and some of the date are reviewed in the book the salt fix that when people increase their salt an take in they back drop of relatively process foods that sugar cravings can indeed be vastly reduced and that makes sense given the way that these neural pathways for salty and sweet interact now thus far have already covered quite a lot of material but i would be completely remiss if i did not emphasize the crucial role that sodium plays in the way that neurons function in fact sodium is one of the key elements that allows neurons to function at all and that is by way of engaging what we call the action potential the action potential is the firing of electricelectivity by neurons neurons can engage electrical activity in a number of different ways they have grated potentials they have gap junctions the whole landscape of different electrophysiologies of neurons that i do not want to going to just yet least not in this episode but the action potential is the fundamental way in which neurons communicate with one another there sometimes called spikes just come coming cloture the nu a scientists use ism just going to briefly describe the action potential and the roll that sodium plays and this will involve a little bit a chemistry but i promise it will be accessible to any one even if you do not have a chemistry or a physic's background or electrophysiology background neurons have an inside in an outside and inside are things the genetic material they have a bunch of things floating around in there that allow those sells to function and they tend have this wire extending out of them sometimes a very long tiresome was a short one that we call the acts on and at the end of that wire that acts on they release little packets of chemicals that either cause the next neuron to fire action potentials or prevent the nectioneron from firing action potential they can vomit out these little packets of of chemicals that either inspire or suppress action potentials in other neurons the way that that whole process occurs is that a given neuron needs to change its electrical activities normally neurons are hanging out and they have what we call a negative charge and they reason they have a negative charge is that the inside of the cell has things floating around in it potassium a little bit of sodium and some stuff chloride these are literally just just imagine these as little little bolls of stuff and if they have a negative charge on them than the inside of the cellars can attend to be more negative an outside of the cell it turns out you are going to have a bunch of stuff that is positively charge and one of the main factors in creating that plosive charge is sodium sodium carries a positive charge you have neurons that you can just imagine forsake of this a discussion you just imagine as a sphere with wire sticking out of it they a you outta mines on the ins idea for negative you put will plus on the outside for positive and when that neuron is stimulated by another neuron if the stimulation the electrical stimulation is sufficiently high meaning enough little packets of her transmitter have been vomited on to its surface at sufficient concentration what happens is little port little spaces little gaps open up in the membrane of that cell that separates the inside from the outside and because it is positive there is a lot of positive charge outside and there is lot a negative inside it is a bolder running down hill all the stuff tends to rush down hill it tries to create even amounts of charges negative on the inside posit on the outside and what happens is sodium rushes into the cell carrying a lot of charge into the cell and as a consequence the charge of that cell goes from negative actually very negative to quite positive and if it hits a certain threshold of positive charge because of all the sodium's going into the the cell then it fires what is called an action potential and it vomits out its own set of chemicals on to the next neon and it sets off a chain of one neuron goes from negative positive ply vomits out chemicals under the next one the next one the next neuron that binds to receptors or enters the cell and that cell goes from negative to positive charge a vomits it is contents on to the next and on and forth sodium rushing into the cell therefore is the way that the action potential is stimulated another word sodium is the way that neuron's communicate with one another the neurons do not stay in a positive charge otherwise they would just keep vomiting out their contents but they need to maintain some of that in they need to go back to preparing to do it the next time in the next time by resting a bit and turns out that the way they restore their charge is by pushing that sodium back out of the cell the mechanisms in place to do that things the called sodium potassium pump there is a change in the levels of a potassium across the cell membrane and on and forth if you want o look at a demonstration this you can you can put into webbrowser the at youknow the action potential you will find some beautiful descriptions there and you tore and elsewhere maybe some time on a instead it'll do a description with a diagram cause i realize number people are just listening to this i cannot do that here i will not do that here cause i want every one to be able to get the same amount of material regardless with another watching and were listening to this but the point id to make at least as it relates to this episode on salt is that having sufficient levels of salt in your system allows your brain to function allows your nervous system to function at all again this is the moms basic aspect of nervous system function and there a r cases wear this whole system gets disrupted and that brings us to the topic of sodium and water balance s many view have probably herd but hopefully if you have not you will take this message seriously if you drink too much water especially in a short amount of time you can actually kill yourself i and we certainly do not want that to happen if you invest a lot of water in a very short period of time something all hypernatremium you will excrete a lot of sodium very quickly and durability to regulate kidney function will be disrupted but in addition to that your brain can actually stop functioning people have actually consumed water to excess especially after sports events and forth and if that water does not contain sufficient electrolytes you can actually shut down neurons ability to function at all by disrupting this balance of sodium and potassium and the amount of exerciser sodium and neuron's ability to signal to one another through action potentials and i cannot emphasize the importance of action potentials enough they are the way that i can lift my pen right now they the way that i can speak the the way that you breathe they literally control all aspects of your nervous system function now takes quite a lot of water in take before you discreet enough sodium that your nervous system is going to shut down d i certainly do not want to give the impression that simply by ingesting more sodium your neurons will work better but it absolutely is the case that if you do not ingest enough sodium that your anurans will not function as well as they could and that if your sodium levels are made too low by hemorrhage or by investing much water fluid that you excrete excess amounts of sodium or through any other mechanism that is then indeed your neurons will not be able to fire action potentials and your brain an nervous system simply will not work and that is one of the primary reasons why dehydration leads to confusion and dizziness and lack of coordination and i talked about this a bit and the episode on endurance but there are instances which compete athletes have come into the stadium to finish a final lap of a long endurance race and are complete disoriented and action cannot find their way to the finish line it might sound hon of a silly an a crazy example but there are examples of people having severe mental issues and physical issues post exercise when that exercise involved a ton of sweating or hot environments or insufficient ingestion of fluids and electrolytes because included in the electro formula of course is sodium ant as you just learn sodium is absolute crucial for neurons to function to briefly recap some of what have talked about to day we talked about how the brain monitors the amount of salt in your brain and body and how that relates to thirst and the drive to consume more fluid and or salty fluids also stalk to little bit about the hormones that come from the brain and operated the level of the kidney in order to either re tain or alow water to leave your system talk to limit about the function of the kidney itself a beautiful organ we talked about the relationship between salt intake and various health parameters and how a particular range of salt in take might be optimal depending on the context in which that range as been consumed meaning depending on whether not your hypertensive prey protective or normal mention we talked about fluid intake and electronic intakes the in potassium magnesium in the context of athletic or sports performance but also interns of maintaining cognate function tuck by the gallant equation which you could easily adapt to your bodywaigte into your circumstances of course adjusting the amount of fluid and electrolyte intake upwards if your exercising or working in very hot environments downwards may be if your less hot environments for your sweating less and on we also talked about the relationship between the stress system and the salt craving system and why those two systems interact and why for some people who may suffer a bit from anxiety or under conditions of stress increasing salt in take provided s done through healthy means might actually be beneficial we also talked about conditions in which increasing salt in take might be beneficial for offsetting low blood pressure and some of these postural syndrome that can lead people to dizziness and forth these are things that have to be explored on an individual basis and of course have to be explored with the support of your doctor i mention the salt fix which i think is an interesting reed keeping in mind that allot of the information and there runs counter to the typical narrative that you hear around salt but none the less has some very interesting points that you might want to consider and of certainly will around in your view of the history of and the applications of salt as it relates to a great number of health and performance metrics we also talked about the perception of salt meaning the perception of salty tastes and how the perception of salty taste and the perception of other taste sweet can interact with one another to drive things increased sugar in take when you are not even aware of it and indeed how the commination of salting an sweet tastes and bite you towards craving more for instance process foods and why that might be a good thing to avoid and of course we talked about salt and its critical role in the action potential the fundamental way in which the nervous system functions at all mi hope for you in listening to this episode is that you consider a question and that question is what salt in take is best for you and that you place that question in the context of your fluid intake you place that in the context of the diet your following the amount of coffin you might be investing and the diuretic effects of caffeine and crucially that you place that in the context of the electrolytes more generally meaning sodium patagium and magnesium some day there will be an online program or an a i imagine where one could put a punch of different parameters in about their particular health states i their particular diet their particular exercise at camera maybe t would all be run by a i algorithm or something where it would monitor all that for us and then it would spit out for us a precise amount of sodium that we should take in each day unfortunately no such tool or device exists right now and all of us have to figure out the appropriate mountain of soda men take for ourselves and that has to be done in these under these contextual considerations who knows may be one of you will design such an a or such a device i think it would be very useful if nothing else to day's discussion ought to illuminate the fact that some strict recommendation of salt in take cannot be made universally across the board for everybody there is a simply no way that could be that could be done and yet i think most of what we learned about salt in the general discussions around health are that at its this evil substance nothing can be further from the truth it is an incredible substance our physiology its dependent on it our cognition is depend on dependent on it indeed our mental and physical health in our performance in essentially all aspects of life is dependent on it and i hope have been able to illuminate some of the beautiful ways in which the brain and the bodily organs interact in order to help us regulate this thing that we call sodium balance and the fact that we have turns in our brain that are both tuned to the levels of salt in our body and position in a location n in the brain that allows them to detect the levels of salt in our body and to drive the intake of more or less salt and more or less fluid and other electrolytes religious points to the beauty of the system that we have all evolved that allows us to interact with our environment and make adjustments according to the contact of

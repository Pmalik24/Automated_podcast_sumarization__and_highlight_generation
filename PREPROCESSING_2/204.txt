is up around seven in the morning lack of sleep still hung over may be a told drunk from the night before and i went to the bath room and i trip and next thing i know ism on the ground a e all three that are around me they're freaking out he is concuss thoresn't know where he is or what is happening they get up and i was confused i was ora i a trying and i was just face down on the ground lie arms this angels pushing and they were shaking i the re the moment i realized i was paralyzed was they were shaking my leg and i kinin you something was happening in mi ligers are you touching me and there you were shaking you you do not feel that is i now the hospital learns of this drama an eternal weeding in his spinal cord round the seaport vertebra he town we may never walk again he cannot stand i con tool his arms he is his hands is not where y over will he has to feed him is all on no visitors he is basically a noble in front of a television that set the comedy central which a those betogoweks he says was reruns o the office most the day he said he watch from season one all the way up through the finality of season nine and then season one began again and one day early in the i see you he is on a group chat with his buddies which means us since he can pimp is phone a nurse reads to him what they are saying and then he dictates what to writ back and the trying to cervix up hen they come up with a project for him a goal a heroic unusual go a got ta is the reason that i wanted talkchase the goal there really started his joke i want from sultan sad get better dance sad he would let you kick him in the when you get home a ways si in only just stub the spirit the i actually a checked with our lawyers it is not a actually forbidden to say that word on the radio in the united states but it falls into a great area and and and rather than beat it over and over as you tell the story am we thought we might just substitute a word when you and i ware talking and here are the phrases our lawyers proved a to re place that word with manliness man parts nether region loins twins that is o well was the first one manliness man parts nether region loins twins he cannot say cannot say cannot say we specifically asked about than are this is such a funny part of this conversation a well what do you thinks best it'll discourse whatever you prefer i nether regain just cause it sounds the funniest to me one we can do that i it the letters the nether foregone phaseout physical trip with ta planed what kind of electric wheel chair they again use he was a chance his arms and legs would never recover but of course he knew exactly where he was headed a got pure that even a small child could understanding a got said specifically because his friends believed he never could reach it and would let me back him in e nether i kept that in back in my head the entire time the entire time is getting better i was dance can have it dance can i have it the a goal i had to go i had a logical and to a more serious not that was having a having multiple goals was important to the recovery in fact he had threegoals king can in the nether was the m most ambitious and my in the sky but the other two were o kick well either and also pretty imposing critic tike this next goal to flit people off i to give the middle finger and i won i son hard on my hands how old r you he too too pretty i i i my at i could not love my fingers at all until about two and a half weeks and i had to break down with therapist there o was crying it was one of my first big mental break downs and he thought he never use his fingers again seels li let secret and ton him to try to move his thumb he could not do it but he could move his index finger but just a quiver a millimeter just then he set the goal whup you actually chief a on than half later it incredible effort he is finally he would get his mental finger pull stray and i free out i was look i did it all the therapist look at me and i just start slipping all of them off in the like yea yea or was that is go which his actually lot in californium but he gone to philadelphia for the senator's party and injured himself in philadelphia and was not recovering in philadelphia for him as an out of town or one of the things of philadelphia means is those steps sisters alone runs up in the move rocky her on to philadelphia museum fart chase one to to climb them all seventy two steps i told my therapist about it and even though i beginning she thought it wasting to be impossible i we just cappractising steps as much as we could that is that is a thing about the therapies they take your goals and they work out it no matter how ridiculous they are whether it is kicking some one in another or climbing up some steps i they really to to our it towards towards what you want to giveyour sense of whit the therapist thought it would be impossible or ridiculous when chase came up with his goal he could not stand he could not walk waited they would suspend him above a tread mill with ropes and two therapists would have his legs to get the muscles to remember wat walking is then he woad going to walk with a cane and then without a cane but before he did any of that back when he was just just learning to get around a wheel chair they started him going upstairs to make this goal and two and a half months after he enter the hospital he went to the steps were rocky train robin a feel chair up to the first step stood and start ta climbing slowly watching each foot as he planted it one then the other a physical therapists steadying him from behind and balance is difficult after li look down the whole time on looking down at my legs and i can hear much people clapping but ism focus i go up the first little flag up the second little flag i look up hundreds of people i at if he pop anything on on saying he was going to climb the rocky steps and life stream it and he did not expect that lots of peoplewould a you show up in person to see him clime to the top a triumph but there was one goal left the final gall i was difficult goal there were under reasons wild get to one a minute digging down in the others tax toranall abuse was one of chases physical thalamus says most of her patients hat spimacald injuries and they'd all kinds of rolls for when chase first told he about this one ts i wait he wont a work en your kicking why that was definitely first for me ism not try ever had anybody request traps and as a as a physical therapist just with tooters or anybody else you are general math is to no harm i would i and cure to me that that you helping him kick can in the nether could actually be a violation of your hypocratic oath i do ye well i y know just made me hesitates we talk about ethics a lot and yet we never wont a harm anybody else since i was was a little he a little hesitate at first but the more we talked about i and i cannot understood that i was not he was just going to try to go out handsome spit e without the out her comet et not ye and i said o ay will let us let us break it down we we practise kicking we warmed up with some kicking a soccer be cause it was soft it was easy kicking a soccer ball a lot of kicking is not just the leg your kicking with its being able to have your balance standing on one like which for chase was a challenge it was lek it is a lot more difficult for me to stand on my right leg even to day and then it was a little bet higher kicks till us standing up kind of bolster a and we practised each leg and fingered out which leg would you do not prepuce the most forest which when he had the best balance on and all of that my the left side of my body is in better condition we thought is it better to balance on my left leg and kick with the right turned out know it was better just try a balance on my right and kid with the left cause it was a lot strong his canister the pick and bun just a sort of figure out which one would would a get the task done make get it was not just he was he now tapping can large which which leg would really do some damage year me which would a make him feel he really recovered chase did recover much more quickly and completely than most of the patients myself she says he pitigor injures into a working out that it is us just a month after the rocky steps he reached his final call and made a little wide e got the while we pick at ball tevidio dancing the most good natured person who has ever wived he smiles and let me tell you when when the day did come when we were actually doing it the first time i went for the kick i thought i got him but i hit him in the thigh and not the nether and he could have faked it he could have laid on the floor and pretended to be in pain immediately he was chase miss do it again why all right here we go the radio dance stand there legs spread awkwardly one hand covering is eyes but laughing which i think summers is all the feelings you could have in that moment chase quite way sorry do not me felt bed for dim we other fell he come far when the text sent initially they thought it was never can i happen he thought was going to be impossible instead i slammed him in is others i slammed him i he was on the ground he was not scag he was ora after but i and also he said in says in the vino chase slammed me in the others and it and it felt good and cause he at the same time was proud and for being able to get to a point where that was e impossible instill as a way to go its not our recover stop devoting his days to physical therapy it is let us go says a lot about where he as right now i was to walk well enough the people cannot tell he ever had an intern he was tot seem how he used to be it is hive from open a water bottle prepared a boll just down he was a fill temperature at all we can fill the water from the sharer hid hin but cannot o a hotted i and then my fingers ai can feel when their touching things but i cannot always feel the texture when i reaching for something in my pocket i do not always know if ism grabbing my wallet or my keys or just the pants it is it is kind of difficult but i do have sensation everywhere i just fairies the level but is interesting that you are recovers but you are not totally there you have come far but do not tell e there you are in this heard enrol it is heard have not your how much i it i just want all this to be done i just want the recovery yo be dine whether i fully recover or not i just wont to be at the point where i do not have to spend my tot dedicate my entire life to getting betters the point i ex super excited to get to is when i not thinking about it where where is right now every time wove my hand it is just in my head o life i have this injury every time with my leg all i have this injury that's to get to the point where he is used to what his body can do at whatever level that turns out to be it is what this dominating his thoughts an is whole day but this is the thing recovery means something different for everybody each person sets er own golds part of recovering is actually to finding for yourself what your own recovery means to data programmed we have people coming back from some very different things there in the same window chases in where there partly there but not all the way the in the middle which is this moment of enormous hope but also a lot of other stuff to be easy chico since medical life am mi glass still with us s one naked lunch t i they show really came out of a question that one of a long time producers a sudan burton had about something his happening in her own life you may remember a few months ago sudan i told story an i show about her eating disorder and i was something she had kept secret for must of a life from every one in her life and and then she reveal the secret in a bookshiebo this memoir that came to last summer and the boy is abut what it is to have eating disorder not about how to get over one as with shine wrote she was not over it she still isn't and of the too have years that she is been working toward recovery she started to wonder what does recovery from an eating disorder even mean i had up that if hearing stories by eating disorders aggravate your own eating disorder sometimes may affect you a he sun it the beginning of recovery i never thought about recovery what i thought about was telling my secret the secret was the eating disorder it'd have for thirty years what was the seeing disorder it had been many things starving begging it is not you pick in eating disorder as a than age girl and you have that one for the rest of your life the that relationship with food is what you have for the rest of your life what it felt to me i was going to have when it age forty five i stepped into my therapists office for the first time ism preoccupied with food and i do not want to be i told her that was the beginning i am in the middle to an a half years in and what that looks it is not easy to summarize easy would be i now do ex behavior instead of we i do not have that kind of sentence but i do have examples this one one afternoon in this spring my husband made cookies i took one from the cooling rack and i ate it with him and our sixteen year old sun maybe that sounds a smallthing maybe that sounds nothing have to curb that impulse to tell you how small these things are how nothing they are because within eating disorder how you relate to food connects to and discuss how you relate to everyone in your life and eating something sweet at that time of day for me that is not nothing that havens alone in secret because the pleasure is intense it cannot be seen it cannot be share there will be no pleasure if its share but that day i lean against the counter and ate the cookie and it felt good it was one of many things i did not realize about recovery it is not just eating intuitively it is making food something shared instead of something secret another did my other sun age thirteen came into the kitchen he wanted me to come out to the garden he could show me how the vines of his cucumbers were hardening as they twine he wanted to show me now and it could not be now how could any one be asking me to do anything now i could not no in a second and you went back outside but the reason i could not was that i just pitted cherries that i was going to put on ice crane the food was incoming on the way it could not be stopped i could not be intruded on when i finished i went straight to the garden and my sun showed me the vines it stood there hating myself reflecting on how many such moments there have been over the years i cannot write now not wright now have don a lot of that a lot of mothers and a lot of it has had to do with work but work come on really there is no shame in that admission here's all this hand ringing about guilt and work and motherhood but hard work is the most culturally sanctioned thing in america try revealing that you have turned your child away because of food do you detect anger most of us with eating disorders volcanically angry also most of us placid or even fun girl disguised that is part of recovery too expressing anger not hiding my body my body is recovering too it is changing i bodies those sponges my children ais wanted when they were young and we were in line at the grocery store that is sponge is our thin sticks of gum the color of manilla envelopes when you put them in water they expand that what my body has done it is one of those flat sponges that expanded i told us to my therapist that s an interesting word flat she said it istle word i mean i emphasized flat not thin yes she said and you were flat inside too a emotionally and that was true that is what the eating disorder does to you that is part of we you have it you will not feel that is maybe the whole point clothes a blue linen dress with buttons down the front there came a day an may when it was the right weather for it i put on the dress which used to be loose but no longer was but the difference was that i did not want it to be loose and the kitchen my husband reach for me he put his hands on my waist rounded them over my hide and i wanted it i wanted to be touched that was new too but the way have gained the was o case this is mixed some of it it is not the binging i did for years but there's been a lot of reaching for food all day i longed to eat in an orderly way meals on plates at consistent times but i struggle to do there is a specific meal that comes to mine when i think about not only where i am in recovery but what i want from it i wanted be normal about lunch want and the scene i associate with lunch are this america life s staff meeting which happens in person once a week when there is not a pandemic every week food is ordered in and laid out on he table and take out containers have never once taken the food we order in for this meeting for years have watched people pick up plates an just put food on those plates and then sit down at the meeting and eat that food while we are talk every part of this is a marvel to me but actually what happens even before they get to the food that is probably the most important part that they stood from their desks and came to get the food neither heating themselves for army having eaten at the wrong time nor brittle and empty because they been too scared to put anything in i imagine hunger rising in a normal way in their bodies a kind of rising hunger that unfamiliar it is i crave it in the way people may be crave love or touch or something it happened rarely for me this is what ism thinking about when i sit in a circle of to workers with plates on their laps ism looking at these people an imagining what they feel in their bodies it makes me feel very distant from them in a way that kind of far reaching as in it extends out to other ways i relate to my to workers and every one in my life yet in recovery i wanted be normal about lunch normal we all know there is no normal that normal is being based out but normal stays in my head when it comes to food normal about food is that recovery when my book came out and i was first doing interviews about it people would ask me where are you with food now i would say ism working toward recovery but i felt uneasy whenever i said this theft i was throwing around a phrase i did not understand and that my ignorance was clear to everyone who actually knew about eating disorder f recovery i just felt out of my death just new to this to every part of it to the working toward at part to recovery which just to say was that the process or the end was there an end what does recovery from an eating disorder even mean square one i went looking for the official clinical definition of eating disorder f recovery i wanted this is contact as a baseline but it turned out there was no base line there is no consensus about what recovery means most definitions include physical criteria are you at healthy weight and behavior have you stopped begging but there is also how much your thinking about food your ability to express emotions all the stuff that has nothing to do with eating this is where the lack of consensus comes in over what other stuff belongs in the definition intellectually i was interested in all of this but a emotionally what i really wanted was to talk about recovery with people who would been through it people further along in it than me i wanted to talk about what recovery felt to them maybe is a way of imagining myself an to my own version of it and i had two people in mine the first one was someone who would said a single word to me about recovery that captured how i wanted to feel there a word that it'd been returning to for months the word was sturdy i very happy to be talking you again i a got me to if you're i do not know under third and you grew up watching the colonial you probably know who gentle a curious she was a starved than comedies i barley summon cat in her early twenty she quit acting it was actually part of her eating disorder recovery and i she has a podcast called empty inside she interviewed me for it last summer which is when she said that word sturdy that stayed with me eversince first and most of why i felt studied after i recovery that i could share my story when we spoke you use this word to describe your recovery you said you waited to tell your story until you were sturdy as soon as you said that word something about it grabbed me and then when i responded to you i even repeated the word kind of trying it out it just shows a lot of self knowledge to you that you waited till you appoint where you were sturdy cause of course and it stay with me after the interview and i think it had much significance because ism it described to me both an emotional and a physical place i had for long privileged and tried for frailness in fragility and the idea of being sturdy was suddenly appealing to me a sturdy body but also sturdiness in the way that you could be buffeted by that mi the hard experiences come out o get you could withstand it you might get blown about but you would not get broken you would be o say and and i think as far as thinking about my recovery it is been in interesting word to return to because it is not as woo woo and some other stuff phoenix rising or the tiger ye you knew lit you has something really real about it anyway oh my god i get cowmen cure winds thirty weeds to you well i ma i just have to say i any time only starts comparing people the animals to the the lyonmiss prowls and the night sky i you lost me i have there is nothing real that i can grab on to for me it is really important to use language that find of reflects reality otherwise i what sturdy meant to genet was that she felt strong enough in her recovery to speak publicly about her eating disorder without falling back into it and to give you a sense of what she had to recover from her eating disproof started when she was eleven and being a child actor i always played roles that were kind of younger then my actual age and it was very beneficial to be able to play roles or younger than my age because you could work longer hours they were much more inclined to cast you if you were twelve playing eight than if you were eight slangy and but when i was eleven i sort of started developing a little time it'll call it it nipple but i do not know what else to call it just a little the littlest peep of rest and and my mind had actually had cancer when i was two years old i thought the only thing i knew about lumps and breast was without my cancer i thought oh no she had cancer now i have cancer i showed my on this lung she felt it and she said oh netty know you do not have cancer your getting you are just getting breasts and in my eleven year old mine breasts were just about as bad as cancer truly i did not want to be older i did not mi knew that that would be you know really really not good for my acting career and i was largely the financial support for my families i knew them meant bat things for my family i just wanted to stay young and i said well how can i how can i keep the boobs from coming in my mumpsaid where there is this thing called malaria fiction u netted actually wrote a song about this conversation it is from a one woman show she is been performing s lis and from that point on she she not only coach me but really you know shed had eating disorders of her own the quite a long time we were sort of this i call it a mommy in me eating disorder of team and we were just we would help each other out every single my meal planning for the next day carry carry counting for the or for the day that we just experience and and swapping tips and tricks and reading woman's world magazine i to ages together and you were just i tough it was this fabulous thangwhere where yo were just this little doll when i thought while ism lucky my mumps helping me with this thing ism helping her look at us go l the idea of going over the calories for your day with your mother a meant how many times in my life i made little lists of you know two hundred plus one fifty plan but but it was alone i mean my god that you ere being it with your mother ah yet absolutely i may i think i think i mi the experience of eatings for often is something that lonely i and while it became that for me after my orbit and and the eating words which to bleed for almost the entire time that i had enter i set it was very much that teams for was there a moment word a stage where you started using the word recovery to describe your experienced yourself well i would can it i rot a little not about wood or words earlier because there was something actually in recovery that did not i did not it to a when i thought of the word recovery i thought its somebody in head to to linen just you each waves granting ear to ear laughing about how easy i i pigging up a sea shell and tossing it into the sea that was not how i felt about or it was sure i would ever ever feel about life i was very weary of using the word and recovery and fer for quite some time and i would say a kind of i just try to buy past that and and use other words and her to think of what i said you don't would just i would just going to be i would say you knows something something ism working on midway through she got to a point that sounds a lot where i am now she describes the feeling this way have been in recovery for a few years and ism not where i want to be this has been very stopped and go dad's been very good week bad week ism not satisfied with that i my wanted i wanted mean a wake up to morrow and an work toward being fully recovered i think it is time and and and i and i felt ready ye at that point i mean because i among the reasons i wanted to talk to you its because you are as somebody who dislikes the phrase recovery journey my j you but you are further along that become i the page in your linen dress than than i am i and i am i feel really ready to a to be on the other side of this i for somebody me who listening to you tell this story and is i have that thought to i want to put it behind me what how were you able what did you do next that got you to where you are now sjeanette's answer to my question about what she did next was essentially it was not what she did next that mattered it was all the work she would already done and there be she gambled with a lot of the under lying reasons for her eating disorder felt rage toward her mother greeted her mother yes she was still purging and still restricting but waylay less she just knew that she did not need those behaviors as coping strategies any more she developed others she started writing finding her own voice that was a few years ago she describes where she is now as recovered how does the reality of of feeling recovered how does it compare with what you imagine o my god it feels like there is not that went constantly and and while i would say you k o the definitely a afar afar distance from piece whatever it is another one mare words for me but i but i feel good i feel am she feels more present i feel more able to focus more able to feel her feelings and to tolerate the uncomfortable ones these are all things i hope for precisely i asked her about something that might some weird if you have never had an eating disorder but i feel food in my body just intensely meanest said she understood one thousand per cent what i meant by this and she said that is gone now too it is ism more intone with my body yea but less aware of those types of things talking to pianette it made me think of a turn might come across in the research i done about the definition of recovery indistinguishable as in a person can recovery fully from an eating disorder that they become in distinguishable from someone who is never had one it sounded almost sidephi we race your eating disorder but also your old identity not even something i would want but also something i instantly wanted i thought id try out in distinguishable on pianette see if it resinated ut there is no difference from them and somebody who is never had an eating disorder there brain as indistinguishable is love ta i you dear a that but sis that does that a it is it sounds that is a peeling to you as that what you feel you feel indistinguishable from somebody who is never had an eating disorder that is hue that hugely appealing i think i you not belying of i if i if i said there was not always kind of some awareness of that being my pass e am but i would s i definitely notice when somebody does not have any sort of eating disorerten i fee i can i sought them quite easily oh ow they be just er a tonal is wont of mi my thought and i would say ism ism as close to that as i can possibly be i have menus er for rules i hate am whatever i want breakfast lunch dinners backs and am and i do not think at all about it it is i i it is its its almost odd to me when i think about might pass i i have said several times to my partner also we i cannot believe that there was a time my life when that was who i was i i ya it is wild to me it is just it feels a different person it feels oman i get they does feeling my brain was we a differently them i felt hopeful after talking to meanest the freedom she feels that it was possible for me here was some one who thought thoughts mine who felt feelings in her body mine who now had new thoughts and a new experience of her body but have had these thoughts and feelings for a lot longer time ism forty seven pianette just turned twenty nine won of the realities of my recovery is just that have lived with an eating disorder for many years and i really wanted to talk to some one my own age who would started recovery in middle age talk about what it had been for the i had some one in mine than miss gray an miss wrote a novel called the care and feeling of ravenously hungry girls which i read last summer and was really affected by the novels protagonist is a black lassbean in her forties with an eating disorder a description that explodes all kinds of stereotypes about who has eating disorders and who gets to tell stories about them an miss is in her fifties her begging and purging started in college me she hid her eating disorder from everyone in her life for years i i used to be very careful about not doing certain behaviors at home an someone could hear my wife her me ah in bathroom at one point and that was when mas you dropped an miss agreed to get help but only because her wife wanted her too they live outside at manta and is a found in eating disorder center there she shut up for her fruit s group there a possession straight from a three hour work out and a begin urge and ah one of the things i noticed immediately upon walking in was that yea i was the only black person in the room ism not unfamiliar with that sangria it that is essentially been the case for me a most if not all my life ah money that was fine and but i was really struck by how yah the women were in the in the proud mostly college age and twenties one around forty a ness was that they were the oldest ones for those of us who've had this history of eating disorders that is lasted for decades instead of for several years ah it is it is different right the the nerd pathways are was much the grooves are much deeper at this age ye i i think back to homelike adolescent and diary entries i would i would you don't be scrawling after a beige and and this has been a part of my life for two years if lost two years to this and my god that i did not know ha how many more years is is this something you have thought about yet i think there is something for women sort of in our chord perhaps not to have sought treatment ah ye early h and that is why i think it is important for older women to talk about it ah when i was out on tour i met many women fortis and fifties and sixties who had struggled for just years and years and were finally trying to get well ye i i mean the same i bee whenever i get a note from a woman forty fifty sixteens even seventies was always somebody who struggled for years and i i have thought the exact same thing as you that there is something about m are contemporaries were we did not seek treatment early and and then part of me started wondering is it some kind of jane latchkey you know er was it just a different time i did not know anything about in this his own recovery beyond that she had more of it under her belt than i do ten years into it she does not feel totally free it was not what she expected at the beginning i thought that ah that there would be an end that i would reach this place where i did not have these thoughts any more i did not have these urges any more and ah and i was would be quit ant quit normal i would have a very healthy relationship with food i have a better relationship with food for sure ah but i do not know if i will ever be quote in quote the normal ah when it comes to food and exercise ye ti mean there is disappointment an realizing okay this is gone a be with me but there is also a asses a a accomplishment and resilient ah that i have id i know what life used to be for me and i know what it is now h it it is it is easier but you i just have to be vigilant and careful if at the beginning of treatment you're imagining that there will be an end and you will reach a place where you do not have the thoughts any more ah and in this kind of a stage where you disappointed to realize cade this is going to be with me ism curious about this as some one who am they wonders if if this this one we where i wind up two and and at ah ism wondering something that might be hard to answer but ism just wondering kind of how you knew that and when you knew that i think it was somewhat evolutionary ah i ended treatment with still some of the thoughts and am i was much better it managing them but as time went on i did start to wonder of i said is is this is this just how ism going to be at the thought it would sort of work itself out am as i went on ah and far it has not ah on the positive side that i i the thoughts a much fewer ah the compulsion and nothing compared to the way i started out it miss says that one thing that was important to her in this process was watching a friend get sober in sobriety for many people the idea is that you are never recovered always in recovery it is a process us always on going that never ends as ness vassal with her friend i think it was through that and sort of watching her manage and watching her understand that this is going to be this is an on going thing for me her peace with that i think was really helpful for me ti sort of get some piece with myself like did not feel tortured about it do not feel ah well was me this is the cross i have to bear you can live live and you can you be happy you just have your think i soft best make maybe there member there is some point a it'll just be finland but i do not see that but ism also of say with that talking to insist about being okay with an ongoing thing it help me imagine how i might feel in the future what i want its simple if my son were to come into the kitchen and asked me to come to the garden while i was making food i have a reaction oh ism about to eat something but it'll come out when ism through you want to sit with me while i eat andthn we could go out together and when we went outside to the garden i would just be in my body i would not feel my flesh and if my neighbor came over i would wave and chat and not feel fake or terrified here would just be in ease and if something did rise out some spikiness some fear some urged to reach for food or to reject it i be able to handle it and if despite my best efforts i submitted to it i be able to tolerate the disappointment i do not know if that would feel recovery to me i do not think i can know until i get there but i think it would feel sturdiness says burton says editor on a programmed memory about a reading disorder is called empty coming out o bear s ask he question

inside of me that will be fine ism good to hiding it ism good and not addressing it but then when ism alone with someone in this intimate setting it kind of fears up inside of me and it is something kind of flares up inside of them too i used to worry that my things that it'd been through my dramas sadness is a kind of ruined me for other people just people want to have fun or were cool and nice in a way it is kind of lovely debt feel oh i see this and every one now i thought it would be a sign of recovery f people were moving on running loose leaving the past year behind but instead it

welcome to the hubermanlaone s a science science faces to for i may drhubermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing headaches headaches or something that everybody will suffer at some point in their lifetime of course some people suffer from headaches far more often than others and for many people headaches can be incredibly debilitating limiting their ability to work to socialize to sleep to exercise essentially to live life in any kind of normal ache as will soon discuss there are many different kinds of headache we have my grain headaches tension headaches cluster headaches to day will previous all the different types of headaches and what the underline biology of each and every one of those types of headaches is as well as fortunately the many excellent treatments that exist for the different types of headache in fact what will soon discuss is that by understanding which type of headache you have and a little bit about the underlying biology of each different type of headache it becomes quite straightforward to select the best treatment options for you to for instance provide relief from frequent and recurring tension headaches cluster headaches even iciness headaches the sorts of headaches that are associated with science infections in colds where the sciences get clogged up and you experience headache wile to day's episode focusses on all aspects and types of headaches it will have tremendous relevant for everybody for those of you that experience headache every once an a while or only when you are sick or have a scenes headache or for those of you that suffer from debilitating migrant today's conversation actually has a bit of optimism woven into it meaning there are excellent treatments for each an every one of the different types of headaches and i was quite impressed and excited to learn when researching this episode that the treatments for headache range from of course prescription drug treatments and over the counter medications of the sort of type that most of us have heard about i bepropinnassee to manikin and forth led in in ti inflammatory drugs but it turns out there many natural treatments for headache that when compared to those over the counter drugs and even some prescription drugs appear to be easily as effective in a many cases more effective then the typical drug treatments many of which can carry side effects that is the drug treatments carry type effects whereas the natural treatments appear to not carryside effects now course many's and we have a discussion about natural treatments therefore likely to be some roles out there and people thinking owe this is going to be a a bunch of woo science well far from it as you will soon learn to day each and every one of the treatments for each and every one of the different finds of headaches is grounded in solid biological understanding of why that particular treatment ought to work and does work for instance you will learn that some headache arises because a muscular pain other headache arises because of excessive azo dilation the arteries and blood vessels get bigger and wider and there is a pressure and a swelling within the cranium that people experience as a headache and it turns out that many of the more natural treatments out there can address either the muscular pain issue or the vase of dilation issue or other issues and underlying mechanisms for headache again while headaches are very intrusive irritating and in some cases debilitating there is certainly light at the end of this tunnel meaning by the end of to day's episode each in every one of you will have an array of excellent treatment options that you can choose from in order to address and provide relief from any of the different types of headache before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first ponder is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper radios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back electrolyte ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el event doc come slash supermen let us talk about headaches and as we are soon going to learn there different types of headaches and diffentypes of headache arise from changes in different types of tissues in the head area and indeed in the neck area as well now one of the anythings to understand is that if you want relief from a headache you need to understand which tissue is mainly involved in creating that type of headache for instance many people suffer from what are call tension headaches now tension headaches are legit of a misnomer because many people might think out tension ism under a lot of tension and stress in therefore i get tension headaches and indeed stress can cause tension headaches but tension headaches are really the sort of headache that you feel around the top part of the head not the very top but for of where you would put a head band above the eyes and around the head it does not have to be experience all the way around the head but the main underlying reason that is the tissue system that mainly underlies tension headaches is the muscular system there are lo t of muscles on the skull believe it or not of course on the neck and they allow you to move your neck and head their lot of muscles that lie parallel to the skull and oftentimes those muscles will undergo excessive amounts of constriction now there of course muscles in the jaw that can also lead the headache and jaw ache and thinks of that sort and neck aches and headaches what were really pointing out here is that the muscles are a key player in the formation of different types of headache tension headache in particular but of course muscles and muscle tension can be evolved in the other types of headaches as well agent i just want a highlight muscular issues as one particular source of the ache in headaches the other tissue that can be prominently involved in generating the ache of a headache r the called mining's now the mining's in addition to being a fun word to say or a bunch of tissues that line the outside of the brain and reside between the brain and the skull you might think ink a between the brain and the skull here's my just ta limit of fluid and the brain is right up next to the skull but turns out that snot the case the brain is actually encased in a very thick very durable sack or casing that is wrapped around it tight errand rap it actually has a name which is aura d r each and you can remember aura durable and on having done some surgeries many surgeries before on brains of different types ranging from human even thoghi'm not a narrow surgeon as a cognition ranging from human to other types of a species what you find is that the aura is exceedingly durable getting through this thing really requires in a very sharp raiser blade the brain is actually sitting in a very fibrous sack that you simply could not open up with your finger tips under any conditions it is really durable the mining's are in that general area an also in casing the brain and the mining's provide an additional buffer between the brain and the aura and the skull again you don't want to think about the brain is just sitting right next to the skull it is close by but there are bunch of other thin fibrous tissues many of which are very thin and fragile and others of which such as the aura that are very very strong because their very fibrous almost a a if you have ever felt the for instance the sal of a of a sal boat you might think of is just this big flapping sheet in the wind it is anything but a sheet in the wind it is a very very strong and durable material now the proximity of the aura and the makings to the brain and the fact that everything is rapped very tightly together and the fact that there is a lot of musculature thatlbe arteries blood vessels in callers are all in that area on the top of the brain and throughout the brain the fact that all of that is in very close proximity and rapped really tight in this very durable sack is one of the reasons why when blood vesicles or arteries or both become dilated they open there creates a pressure between the brain and those tissues and beau s there is not much distance between the tissues the aura an the meninges and the skull there is also pressure that allows for the brain to literally sneak up where i should say it give the impression the your brain is expanding up against your skull the point here is that while muscular tension can give rise to headache the other thing that can give rise to headache is called azo dilation the expansion or the widening of the arteries blood vessels and calories and one of the reasons why that gives rise to headache is because there's simply not a lot of space for that expansion to go it does not allow anything except for the brain to push up against that very durable tissue and that very durable tissue to push up against the skull and even though the brain itself does not have pain receptors that is right the brain itself does not pain receptors that is why a euro surgeon can take off a piece of skull and can profound in the brain with an electrode and the person is completely unaware and in order to get through the skull that of course hit little skin flap has to remove be removed from the skull that requires a little bit of topical and esthetache but really you do not need any anesthetic to go into the brain itself because there are not pain receptors on the brain itself however the tissue surrounding the brain such is the aura the meninges and the musculature that then reaches up bleed or not into the skull the vasculisur does not actually stop right beneath the sculled actually blood vessels it get into the skull and their ash an portals by which blood can move within the skull itself but what that means is that since all of the tissues of very close by and very compact with respect to one another any increase in the size of the portals that allow movement of blood there and the fact that there are what are called no susceptors and no see nosuceptors these are essentially pain receptors because of the presence of pain receptors in the tissues around the brain when there is an increase in the size of those vascular portals the arteries calories and vessels we experience that as intense pain and pressure and fortunately there are excellent treatments for dealing with that intense pain and pressure but keep in mind that the intense pain and pressure that is the consequence of azo dilation that is the widening of these different vascular portals is very different then the type of pain that arises from muscular tension as is the case with tension headache because now we have two sources of pain that is the ache in headache and there two more that we need to think about in trying to better understand the different types of headaches that will de suss and in terms of trying to understand which are going to be the best treatments for the different types of headaches and those are curl and inflammatory responses lit is talk about the curl type first there is a type of headache that many people unfortunately suffer from will get into this in bunch more detail in a moment those are called cluster headaches cluster headaches are headaches that arise not from the surface people do not experience them was kind of a tightening of the forehead and the back and the jaw but rather it feels as if the headache is coming from deep within the head and in particular from behind the orbit of one or the other eyes and sometimes both eyes for those a view that have ever experience cluster headaches they are extremely painful even the more where i should say the relatively more minor cluster headaches are extremely painful in the severe ones are exceedingly painful cluster headaches arise from deep or this we get the sensation that they arriving from deep within our head as suppose from the surface inward because they are curl in origin and there is a particular nerve pathway called the trigeminal nerve that often is the origin of these cluster headache that people experience behind the eye the trigeminal is the name suggests has three branches try case there is a a branch that essentially extends to the eye there is also a branch that extends to the mandible right to the a to the lip and there is a branch that extends more or less to to the nasal area and this trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed or in other ways is hyper activated in some cases and that causes the deep pain below the eye because it is that first branch of the trigeminal nerve which is the ophthalmic branch which tends to be activated first pupil start feeling as if there is a pain behind their eye in particular on one side often times there is lacrimation which is tearing up there can be some nasal discharge another common symptom of this type of headache that is the cluster headache is that the pupils sometimes will become very small the pupils of the eyes and they will not dilate even in darkness there r bunch of things that are going on on one or both sides of the face that seem to arise from deep within the head or it is almost as if it is coming from the brain outward and that is because its curl and origin o case we have got muscular origins of headaches we have got meningeal origins of headaches that is the the stuff around the brain and as it relates to the musculature and we have curl origins of headache and of course there is inflammation origins of headaches now inflammation is a term tat gets thrown around a lot these days people or tying out yon this reduces inflammation and inflammation is bad and and i i suppose in some cases and when inflammation as really widespread across the brain or body it is bad but i do not think any of us should think about inflammation person as bat what i mean is inflammation is just one form of signaling in the body which of course includes the brain inflammation of a tissue is one way in which a set of cells these could be of for instance a cells of the immune system and we cover this in a detailed episode all about the union system if you to check that out you go to superman labor calm just put into our search function immune system and you can find that episode by the way all of our episodes are reachable by keycard at superman labor come it'll take you to specific episodes and time stamps for the topics your interested in forsake of this discussion about headache inflammation is going to be the case when one particular tissue in and around the head area is releasing molecules city kinds which sometimes are called inflammatory side o kines but there are also non inflammatory or anti inflammatory side of kinds but inflammatory molecules that are signalling to the rest of the body hey there is something going on here there is either some intrusive object and indeed if you where to get a been or a splinter into a particular of skincare there be lot of inflammation can be the introduction of a foreign physical object into an area that will cause inflammation it can be the presence of some sort of local toxin in that area it could be a more systemic inflammation none the less inflammation in the neck and head area or frankly anywhere within the access areas is who include the mouth the nose around the eyes because the sicknesses many of us think a sicknesses is just our nose but actually if i were to show you a skull a human full or any other kind of skull you would be very hopefully intrigued to learn that the skull is just not one big piece of solid bone or a a top with a jaw below it it actually has all these small what are called registrations little holes and canals that run through the skull and through the depth of the skull little tubes you got them down here on your mandible you have got them above your lips you have them a on either sides of your nose those of the sicknesses the stresses allow the passage different fluids through the skull because the skull even though it is bone it is not a dead tissue right in in a live person or animal the skull is a very active living tissue indeed all bone is active living tissue and it needs to be nourished with blood it needs to be nourished with cerebral spinal fluid in the case of the scull an was to be nourish with all sorts of important things those sicknesses often times can become closed as is in the case with iciness headache which will talk about in a little bit but more generally any time there is inflammation of one given area of the body could be a shoulder it could be the neck it could be the mouth that cold be the nose hen the case of headache it could be any portion of the head or neck what happens is inflammation while it is a very efficient signal it is much the siren on an ambulance sora a police car and that it sends out a very broad signal that is very clear something is wrong here and needs to be dealt with it is not very specific it is very robust but it is not very specific for instance if there is a little bacterial infection or a little viral infection the inflammation response to that side of infection tends to be far more wide spread then the actual site of infection it is a obit different when you have a foreign object there a splinter or some other foreign object that tends to be a bit more localized and the nan system is always trying to limit the the extent of inflammation by putting in different scar tissues indeed a lot of the things that we think of is kind of gross pussy in a pustules and boils and things that i know its a gross topic are ways in which or body tries to restrict the amount of inflammation but the face area and the head itself are heavily infused with blood vessels and there is a constant profusion as we say of blood and cerebral spinal fluid and other things through this incredibly metal really active tissue that we call our brain and our eyes those are by far the most metabolically active tissues in our entire body even for running hundreds of miles and ultra marathons your brain is still far more metabolically demanding than all the muscles of your body combine no matter what the conditions because of that there tends to be a generalization are a spreading out of any inflammatory response and that inflammatory response then can trigger the pain mechanisms are what we experience as pain mechanisms in the other three types of tissues the we talked about for instance if you have a a systemic infection or your experiencing inflammation of any kind and it has anything to do with the encroaches on the face or head area that can easily and almost always spills over into activation of nerve cells can give rise to curl based headache or to the mining's and can give rise to mingily headaches and of course to the muscles and to muscular type headaches we have got muscular origins of the ache and headache we have mining origins of the ache and headache we have curl origins of the ache and headache and we have inflammation based origins of the ache in headache and that retains to all the different types of headaches that were in a talk about and it is important to keep in mind that there are these different sources of the ache and headache and that sometimes they exist alone and sometimes exist in commination however a this is an important however all pain or i should say all experience of pain as a perception is going to be curl in origin when we experience pain whether notes a pin brake are a cut stub our tow we trip in fall or a headache it is curl in origin it is the nervous system and nerve cells that are going to carry that signal that we perceive as pain as we talk about the different sources of pain in different types of headache we e also talk about of course think what most people are interested in to day's discussion the different treatments for the different types of headache and why each of those different treatments work but by understanding a little bit about how pain arises in the nervous system and certainly by understanding the different types of headaches now what is a mention headache i gave you some impression that its running around your head a head band in many cases verses cluster headache which starts deep below the eye often if feels as if it is emerging from deep in the brain verses migraine which will get into in a moment by understanding the different types of headaches you should be able to quickly pin point what type of headache you have what types of tissues are likely involved and therefore what types of treatments are going to most quickly and most completely relieve that type of headache o case for the next three to five minutes and i promise no more ism going to explain how pain arises at the level of nerve cells and suppose this is one of those times when if i had a highlighter pen that could go out across the the microphones and speakers leading to your ears i would use it here because what am about to tell you is perhaps one of the most important things to understand about your nervous system that is your brain and you which is that while you have trillions of nuronsan we hear that you have trilling and different types of neurons in your brain and the coming different shapes and sizes and do different things and some make dopamine and some makes our tone and make gludomatan on and on the key distinction among different types of neurons that is the three types of neurons that i believe everybody scientist or no everybody should understand exist are some neurons nerve cells are what we call motor neurons in the sense that they control the contraction of muscles sometimes for walking other neurons control of the movements of your fingers scientists call those digits other ones your toes they also control the beating of your heart although that is a slightly different mechanism and slightly different type of tissue then is involved in generating motor movements of your limbs these are neurons that we call motor neurons because their goal or their purpose i should say they do not really know what their their goal or purpose is but what they do is they make sure that muscles contract that certain things happen in your body your heart beats or you move your limbs you lift your eyelids or your eyebrows rather and on and forth other types of neurons are what we call sensory neurons they communicate the same way that motor neurons do that is they fire what we call action potentials which are just electrical signals they release nor transmitters any other neuron but they respond to certain events in the environment or the environment within the body but they are not responsible for generating muscular contractions we call these sensory neurons some sensory neurons sense light touch other sensory neurons sense firm touch other sensory neuron sense pain other sensory neurons sense light brushing on the skin in fact you have sensory neurons believe it or not that respond specifically to the light brushing of a hand across your skin any region of your body and if that particular region of your body happens to have hair on it and you stroke the skin in the direction that the hairs lay down we experience that as pleasurable whereas if you stroke in the direction opposite to the the way the hairs lay down we experience that as not pleasurable these sensory neurons respond in some cases for instance within the auditory system they respond to sound waves in your eye they respond to photons of lights sometimes photons of light of particular ravelings that we think of as red green blue and on sensory neurons do not move muscles they respond to things in the environment end they exist within us we have sensory neurons that sense for instance pressure within our head or pressure within our got how full or empty our gut is pain within our tissues our liver or or any kind of other internal organ wee got motor neuron censor neurons and then the last kind of neuron is what we call modulatory neurons these are the ones that adjust the relationship between the sensory irons in the motor neurons to determine whether not we do any thing in response to a sensory imp that is whether or not if the sensory nor on fires sends at electrical potential whether not it will generate a motor change let me give you a very simple example this for those of you listening it'll just explain what ism doing and for those of you watching you will be able t see ism holding my hand out in front of me if i were to touch the top of my hand with my finger tip i can deliberately override that is i can modulate that more typical reflect which is that when something touches us if we are not aware of where it is coming from we typically move away from that thing that touches is a very natural response but we can decide where not can a move away we can decide to stay still or we can decide to move toward the thing that touches us but typical if you we to walk up to somebody you're to touch them they either turn toward you on the side that you touch them or they would step away it is rare that they can a step into you but you can decide that you were not kin a move away or you could step into the direction of touch and that is because you have modulatory neurons that can adjust the conversation in a very context dependent way as to whether not the sensory our on will cause motor horns to contract or not we have got motor nor on sensory morons and modulatory neurons and you are probably thinking by now where we talking of this thought were you tog aby headache thought re an tie about treatments for headachebut this turns out to be very important because you could imagine and in a moment it'll explain how let us say you have tension headaches your somebody that has the classic symptoms of tension had each gimme tell you wat those are these are headaches again that occur for less on the in at kind of a headband fashion or they tend to start there an it exist around thread these are very common can arise from a number of different am sources rise from sleep deprivation they can rise from excessive use of affinal take will talk about why that is they can arise from stress they can arise from very low level viral infections or material infections but we xpirincies as just as headaches or you have been thinking too hard or working too hard or life has been stressful they're often also associated with jaw pain and jaw tightness and neck tightens tension headache everything you would imagine muscular tension could cause wet if you want to treat tension headache you can imagine that because all headache is normal that you would want to go after some sort of curl mechanism to treat them but of course we now know that they're three types of neurons there motor nor on sensory neurons and modulatory neurons we have choices we can say o made do we want to turn off the muscles in the head jaw and neck that are viper contract for instance you want t take a muscle relaxer or relaxant or would you want to trying change the sensory and put itself maybe do not change the way the muscles are behaving but shut off the sensory part of it your ability to cense it there are certainly ways you can do that or would you want to adjust the modulatory neurons would you want to make it such that you have the headache but you do not perceive the headache that is you cut off communication between the censor and the motor that the muscles relax trnsoupt the are treatments and approaches for each in every one of those each in every one of those has a different advantages and disadvantages but as you can quickly see we are going to have different types of headaches and different approaches to treating headache but if you keep in the back your mind that you have neurons that contract muscles to create movement or tension of muscles memory you can turn off those neurons and allow those muscles to relax you sensory neurons that sense input and she sense the pain and you modulatory neurons which can allow you to a just the relationship between the censer neurons and the motor none and of course some of your probably screaming at me by now saying wait why would you ever want to deal with the motor neurons or or the modulatory earns which you wanted is go straight to the source and just cut off the pain ah well the problem there is that many pain killers have other issues as well in particular they can be sedative many of them can be habit forming or even addictive and for many people not all but many people they do not want to take drugs whether not there over the count or a prescription drugs or even more natural supplement base type treatments and they would rather use for instance a behavioral approach in which they can modulate they can deliberately turn off the communication between sensory neurons and motor irons and turns out those approaches exist this well o we at this point i promise you that ism not going to give you any more of a biology lesson in terms of appainsensing and headaches as a for a conceptional phenomenon in steed woad it'd to do next is talk about the different types of headaches and i think this is something that is very important and not often discuss except for those people out there that unfortunately suffer repeatedly from certain kinds of headaches my grain or cluster or tension headache but think for most people out there who experience headacheand again that is everybody at some point experience this headache rather than just think of headache as one thing understanding the major types of headache and how they differ from and are similar to one another well really help you identify what the best source of treatments for those are it'd to talk about what the different types of headache are now the first type of headache we are going to discuss is the tension type headache again tension type headaches tend to start off not always but tend to start off as more less a halo or headband around the forehead in the area above the eyes often also include the jaw the neck muscles and can extend even into the upper back again this can be caused by some low level of infection but more often than not tension type headaches are onto come on because of some chronic psychological stress usually combine with lack of sleep usually combined with life style issues and of course without getting into a long discussion about at any time you have lack of sleep your can have excessive stress any time you have excessive stress you are going to have to make sure your offsetting that by getting proper sleep most people do not when there under excessive stress by the way we have excellent tools her grounded in excellent science available to you at zero cost if you are experienced chronic stress r in short seamstress we have a master stress episode to human lapodcas again just go to berm in lam not common all that time stamped for you tension type headaches begin in a for less a head band pattern but can really extend to other tissues as well not often in the face but really the head and and often will start to climb up toward the top o the head they are not always in this halo pattern sometimes they can be localize to one area such as the on the back of the head or the front of the head or one side of the head more than others and that is often the case because of tension within muscles of the neck that ten to bias the ache towards one side of the head it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs i'vebeen taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there easy i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to ben the probiatics that i need for got health our got is very important is populated by got microbioda that communicate wit the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probation unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste gripe if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a years supply of vitamin d three k two again that is athletic green stock come slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitamin three k to the other type of headache that unfortunately as very common is migraine headache migraine headaches are define generally as disorders of recurring attacks of headaches people get migraine often get them in a recurring fashion some people get them very often other people get them less often but migraine are very debilitating the numbers that is the prevalence of migraine is still pretty debated one thing that we know for sure is that females suffer from migraine headaches at a rake at least threefold her then do males and surprisingly this does not seem to have any direct hormonal origin because we are also go and talk about hormonal headaches that is headaches that relate to a dip in estrogen an progesterone an particular phase of the menstrual cycle hates the oblatory cycle there is a bit of a mystery here and the mystery is why is it that migraine headaches occur at such greater frequency in females even independently of the menstrual cycles when you control for changes and hormones that still appears to be the case and over all migraine are very common now the numbers on migraine and just how common migraine is are extremely wide this was a but frustrating for me in researching this episode you will find for instance that seventeen per cent of women suffer from migrates you will also hear that six per cent of males suffer from migrants you will also here that forty three forty three per cent of females suffer from migrant that is recurring headaches that qualifies migrant headaches and that seventeen per cent of men suffer from migraine headaches an a recurring basis which is again the definition of a migraine headache or one of the key definitions all we can say for sure is that many many millions of people maybe even billions of people suffer from migraine headaches this find of a staggering a thing to contemplate but we know it is extremely common and we know that it is more prevalent in females in any of the studies that you will find in terms of that compare the over all prevalence of headache it is going to be higher substantially higher and females and males does not seem to be related to the victory menstrual cycle there are some interesting facts related to that that it'll just you touch on for a moment pregnancy for whatever reason seems to be protective against migrant headaches that is women who suffer from recurring migraine before they get pregnant when they get pregnant and often after they give birth they experience fewer migraine headaches there may be something hormonal it may be something else what a we know for sure we know that headache that is the ache in headache is curl whether or not the origins are hormonal or whether not the origins are inflammation or got microfilm or some other feature of the bodybraine axis at this point all we know is that curl pain or the experience of pain at the curl level is the final common pathway and its more prevalent in females as i mention migrants tend to be recurring some people get them once a week some people get them once a month some people get them far more frequently that they can be extremely debilitating oftentimes people experience migraine because it is a recurring phenomenon will know when a migraine is coming on they will say my migraine is coming on the consenseit coming there is this notion of ora and will talk about ora in a in bit some people thing of origjust as visual ora or the sense of kind of a haloing of light with he sense that there is something outside the body the actual definition of ora is that it is the experience that something is about to happen its this kind of feeling of anticipation it is not degavou de gave is different and very interesting in its own right but different it this feeling that something is about to happen and the fact that ora such a prominent feature of migraine headaches or at least that people feel that the headache is coming on long before they feel the actual ache of the headache and the other debilitating symptoms suggests that migraine has something of deep curl origin that it arises from deep within the nervous system spinal cordial brain and that it is not something a tension headache that is going from outside in you know the constriction of the muscles in the japan heads migrant headaches are very d different than mention headaches even in terms of how they come on or their onset the other feature of migrant headaches that i think is important to note is that dilation of the vessels remember the azo dilation the widening of those pipes that we call arteries vessels and calories is a very prominent feature of migrant and fortunately that allows for very particular types of treatment and ways of dealing with the spain specific to migrant headaches the other feature that is common an migraine headache is called photophobia many of you of probably familiar with photophobia of ever been sleep deprived simply if you are sleep deprived and you go outside in the morning the light is going to seem very very bright much brighter than were you love had a really good night sleep and that is because during sleep therefore all sorts of reset mechanisms in the brain there is the washing out of metabolic debris in things in the brain the sell call c emphatic wash out that is essential there is also an adjustment of the neural tissue of the eyes which s many i you have heard me say before r actually two pieces of brain that it extruded from the crania vaults your eyes yes indeed are two pieces of brain the only to pieces of brain outside the cranial both and within your eyes you have neurons and mechanisms that a just the the sort of sensitivity of your eyes to light and of your brain to light and when you are sleep deprived or when you have a lo level viral infection or a cold or a flue o any kind you tend to experience light is brighter than it actually is when you are rested or you are in the healthy state photophobia something that is very very common in migraine and often thephotophobia is a prominent feature of the experience that a mine is coming on people start saint hint it is just too bright in here and normally they would be able to tolerate that level of sunlight or of endure a lighting with no problem their two aspects of migraine that i think are particularly important to understand for sake of of the treatment and that is the dilation of vessel we if we want to treat migraine were can have to think about things that can constrict blood vessels in the brain aria but we also need to think about photophobia not photophobia just as a symptom of migraine but that maybe by adjusting our sensitivity to light we can actually short circuit some of the onset and subsequent pathology of the migraine that is if we can prevent photophobia partially or completely can actually offset a lot of the ache of the migraine that would otherwise occur that's an exciting avenue of for addressing the migrant headaches well get in to photophobia how to deal with that will also talk about orolobit more in a few minutes but for the time being we have talk about tension headaches we nowt talk about migrant headaches again keep in mind knowing what kind of headache you have is essential it is i would take indispensable for selecting the best treatment many people out there we will simply get a headache and decide oh ism an a pop couple of aspirate at what is asper do ant aspirins an wanting lavatory it also has pronounced effects on the azo dilation ideas of constriction system it actually all is more blood to flow through those arteries vessels in callers lot of people actually use baby aspirin or small amounts of spray as a way to offset cardiovascular disease that's another discussion but what we know we know that in my grain there is a hyperdilaction of the blood vessels a hyperdilation of the very little portals that exist in the brain and around the brain and that are going to cause the pain the can active ate those sensory nor on those nosiceptors that will then give us the experience of extreme headache and grain taking an spring or something it for my grain in some cases the worse possible choice against o knowing what kind of headache you are experiencing is going to be essential here the other thing that you'll sometimes here is that drinking a cup of coffee or getting caffeine through tea is a great way to deal with headache why would that be well it turns out that coffee can cause either vast constriction or vast dilation depending on when you take it and will get into the use of coffin as a treatment for headache because indeed it can be a very potent treatment for headache but you absolutely need to know what kind of headache you are experiencing because in some cases drinking coffin whether it is in tea or coffee can absolutely alleviate the pain of a headache especially if you catch that onset of a my grain or attention type headache early on but in some cases it can make it far far worse again knowing which type of headacheyour experiencing and how the different treatments work is see o case to we have mention type headaches migraine type headaches think you are trying to get the picture they e different underlying apologies the next type of headache is cluster headaches cluster headaches are the ones i mentioned earlier that arise from deep within the head they feel as if they are coming from the inside out and they tend to be on one side or the other what scientists and clinicians call unilateral in tends to originate behind the eye and sometimes the nose region sometimes in the mouth region as well feels kind of patchy but its of it is coming from the inside out and again that is because of that trigeminal nerve for those you am listening and not watching this on you to have got three fingers as if i putting up through fingers in hm have got one pointed toward my eye one pointed towards my nose region and one u towards my upper lip the trigeminal nerve is an easy one to remember and it will completely explain a cluster headaches and what to do about cluster headaches in monk if you remember that the herpes one virus and not herpes do not genital herpes but harpy's one virus is the one that gives cold sores on the mouth harpy's one virus by the way is exceedingly common up to ninety per cent of people many children in fact have these again this is not a sexually transmitted herpes all though it can be of course transmitted through kissing and sexual contact but that is not the only origin of it o each can be passed by skin contact in mucosa contact a mucosa mucosa thill be kissing mucosilying or even skin to mucosa linings that is why it is common and the reason why cold sores develop on the mouth for people that a harpy's one is because the virus actually lives on the trigeminal nerve and yes it is true that sometimes the virus will inflame the nerve and the inflammation will cure at the level of the eyes you will do on forcing on as get herpes of the eyes actually can be quite dangerous if you have an infection of the eye herpes infection the e you should see not phrenologist or the nose region they can experience pain in the mucosa tissue of the nose more often than not the most inflammation is occurring on the the branch that enervates the lip her the region close to the let and that is why a cold sort develops there and immune response there signalling the there is inflammation due to the herpes virus which lives on that car on for a very long time neurons do not turn over in a the life spans we can live on there for the extensive of the person's life however most people hopefully treat there each as to be one but if they do not at the the sort of a frequency and the severity of infections tends to taper off with time will have an entire discussion about viruses and herpes in particular in a future episode but the thing to keep in mine here is that this very nerve is the one that gets inflame in these cluster type headaches now countertype headaches are associate with a bunch of very uncomfortable symptoms again they ten to be unilateral they tend ted begin very deep and they tend to be excruciatingly painful excruciatingly painful they can last anywhere from thirty minutes to three hours some people experience these in sleep in fact this is one of the cases where men experience headache more than females men experiences cluster type headaches that have a sudden onset during sleep at five times the frequency then do females the origins of that are not exactly clear they do seem to have something to do with the biological clock mechanisms that c circadian mechanisms if you are a man or woman for that matter and your waking up in the mill the night with a unilateral headache n it seems its deep within your a within your head ore its starting there and its on one side and localize to the eye and may be these other regions the trigeminal is involved in you may be suffering from cluster type headache and you should talk to your physician the other symptom that is quite common in cluster type headache is a drop eyelid which should make sense because the trigeminal innervates the region and there other nerves the control the eyelid but there in that general region and they can be impacted the other thing is on the call meiosis which is that you cannot dilate the pupil i mention this before of this your pupils might get really really small and they will not dilate and the otherthing is lacrimation tearing and then naval discharge all because of a neural inflammation problem why do i tell you with such detail about cluster headaches well if you are somebody that is experiencing the kind of pain that is consistent with cluster headache taking a standard anti an lavatory or doing something that is going to adjust the vile the excuse me the dilation or constriction of blood vessels may have an indirect impact on cluster headache but is unlikely to relieve cluster headache either acutely meaning right away or in preventing cluster headaches you have to deal wit this as a neural issue and will talk about some of the main causes of inflammation an activation of these cluster type headaches at the level of the trigeminal nerve in a little bit because fortunately there are some excellent treat ens the next type of headache that is quite common are hormonal headaches now the phrase hormonal headache would already cut you to the fact that it is far too general a term because there many different hormones testosterone estrogen thirodhrman growthormon and on and on and on and they all have many different functions in the brain and body every single hormone and in particular that called steroid hormones steroids again not just limited too i things that people take for sports in fact the steroid hormones refers to estrogen testosterone of the sort that we all make that men and women make naturally and those steroid hormones can impacgene expression they can are of course what turns on the growth of the of the breast tissue of the testicular tissue of on hair growth and and on and on and that is all because of gene expression if you are really can a change the identity and function of a cell long term i your can literally change the breast tissue or change the penile tissue or change the ovarian tissue in some sort of consistent way across the lisping you can bet that the re changes in gene expression and those changes an gene expression occur because these steroid hormones have this incredible ability the ex men of hormones to pass through the outer membrane of a cell which you all the exrcellar membrane and into the call nuclear membrane that can go into the area where genes are made and common and off different genes however they molt task in their life that is these steroid hormones estrogen in particular and testosterone in particular can also bind to the surface of cells and impact all sorts of things that the level of the cells that have nothing to a changes in gene expression and that second mechanism binding to the surface of cells is one of the ways in which estrogen can control different aspects of headache now that does not the juryman estrogen gives you headaches in fact it is just the opposite it turns out that low estrogen and another hormone low progesterone combine to give rise to headache because of the ways that low estrogen and low progesterone impact vasodilation and azo constriction and the inflammatory response will talk about how to deal with hormone based headaches in particular hormone's headaches that occur because of estrogen and progesterone in a moment but the anything to know is somethingthat we covered in the fertility episode i did a very long very detailed episode on festivities om join going to going to this in significant detail now and you can refer to that episode of for probably more detail than you ever wanted but also a lot of tools as it relates to fertility in both males and females but right now ism just going to give you a coarse overview of that in about sixty to a hundred and twenty seconds that you will understand when hormonal headaches are most likely to take place keep in mine that hormone headaches are most likely to take place when estrogen and progesterone are lowest if you understand that during the vehicular stage of the ovulatory slashmenstralcycle case mestralcycles about twenty eight days on average not everyone buts about twenty days on average and the first half of that estrogen starts creeping up you u u up and as we learn in and chronology estrogen primes progesterone estrogen will then pick and then start to fall lolelelelelelelo pretty quickly right about the time that the egg ovulates and egg is released and will essentially be ready for fertilization if the egg is fertilize a whole bunch of other things happen as it repeats to pregnancy if not what ends of happening is that during the audio phase which is the second half of the menstrual cycle there is been a build up of the lining of the uterus because of an increase in progesterone estrogen goes up during the follicular phase then it goes down and then progesterone goes up u u which is important for generating that thick lining of the uterus to allow the fertilizes eggs if its fertilizes to implant and if it is not fertilizes all of that gets released from the body in this bleeding process that we call menstruation if menstruation occurs and day one of the menstrual cycles considered the first die which bleeding occurs will then what that means is that estrogen is already low because remember estrogen was lo at the start of the philicular phase and when u u u then it comes down right at the time e population and progesterone goes up u up u up during the audio phase in fact its more than a thousandfold increase in progesterone but if there is no fertilization of the eight progesterone starts coming down down down down down what is that mean that means that on the first to about the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle first being the first day of bleeding till about the fourth or fifttday of the menstrual cycle both estrogen and progesterone are very very low and it is hat that time at the very beginning of the menstrual cycle about the first week of the menstrual cycle the many women are very prone to hormonal headaches hormonal headaches not because estrogen's high that is a common is conception rather because estrogen an progesterone are both low and now the you understand the contour or the under underlying reasons for hormonal headache you can start to ask well what happens when estrogen is low well estrogen has strong impact on the vast dilation vast constriction system as does progesterone will talk about that elicit later but now that what hormonal headache is at least this one particular type of hormonal headachewhich is very very common given the number of women that are menstruating and the fact that lo estrogen lo progesterone is the cause of the hormonal headache and the fact that of course there are women who are no longer menstruating there either in perymenopaus and menstruation is becoming more infrequent or there in menopause and it deceased entirely well now you understand what the origin of the hormonal headache is and all we need to know is what do estrogen an progesterone normally do in order to prevent headache and thereby you will know exactly how to offset that is prevent or treat hormonal headache in that first week of the menstrual period the last type of headache that ad to discuss is headache associated with head hits that is dramatic brain injury although i refill want to underscore the fact t hat even people who do not have dramatic brain injury can experience headaches as the consequent of hitting their head the line between dramatic brain injury and lower level brain injury is one that still seeks definition and fact this is one of the major goals of the clinical field as it relates to concussion and it is also what comes up a lot during the discussion about football in these days you will see players hit really hard and depending on whether not their laying there for five seconds thirty seconds or three minutes of the crowd and the a the people watching on television and everywhere else are all speculating as to whether not the person should be allowed to play and to be quite direct there really is no way to assess the extent of brain damage after the consequence of hitting one's head or having one's head hit because first of all almost all of the best ways to detect dramatic brain injury except the most severe ones ten to require a lot of very large equipment smart and functional smart and c t scans none of which are available on the side of the field or in the locker room but also because many many if not most of the effects of dramatic brain injury are going to recur not in the immediate minutes or even hours after the injury but several hours days or even weeks after that injury this is the discussion that we should hold off for a longer full episode on dramatic brain injury keeping in mind of course that football is this very salient example of dramatic bring injury in concussion as is boxing as is even soccer with heading of the ball believe a not repeated low level impact to the forehead and other parts of the head o can give rise to over time dramatic brain injury without the need for any kind of full blown concussion or being join knocked out but sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of dramatic brain injury and concussion most dramatic brain injury and concussion and low level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become dramatic for sake of daily living that is lowered cognition destruction in mood sleep et camera is i tally the consequence of things other than sport for instance bicycle accidents playground accidents construction accidents and this is often forgotten for some reason all the sports in a particular football tend to grab all the attention as it relates to concussion keep in mind that while at a for certain people is a path to a living for most people dramatic brain injury is going occur in a car accident construction work a other types of work for which people generally do not have many options and terms of the type of work that they are doing they are prone to concussions and head injuries simply by virtue of their work without any millions of dollars contracts or the opportunity to necessarily some cases they do but necessarily to do other things and certainly car accidents or bike bicycle access are not a voluntary events the point being dramatic brain injury and headache related dramatic brain injury extends far beyond the realm of sports and in fact view a look at the numbers what you find is that more than ninety percent of dramatic brain injury people coming into the hospital or clinic or people ism claiming that the have got consistent headaches are there not sleeping well their mood is off there feeling more irritable after having hit their head even once is not the consequence of sports is going tore the consequence of accidents other on a at the work place or i interns to a bicycle or other sorts of transportation based accident a car accident with that in mind any kind of head hit certainly if involves of concussion or dramatic brain injury often leads to headaches either infrequent but severe headaches or chronic low level headaches or feeling that is kind of a stuffiness or a fullness to the head there can be a lot of different origins to that a common origin is going to be actual swelling of the not to our the brain tissue directly but if you recall our discussion about the mining's which include the aura and the other tissues that surround the brain there she three layers that we call the the thingies the drags being one of them and there is a very little space between those the brain the meninges that surround it and the skull at can the subbaracnoid space or equal my eracnoi spite well if there is even a slight bit of swelling in the brain or even distant brain tissues for instance even if the there is whip lash there is swelling of the tissue muscular tissue and curl tissue in the neck area that can con strict the flow of things cerebrospinal fluid blood flow and indeed mucus and other other things that essential we all heel here mucus the we think illness but mucus is a vital vital o a substance within the body for a lot of important reasons in health as well as in sickness well if there is less of that liquid and other fluids and mucus being delivered to that space will then it can claw goes for of the plumbing is clogged up or that it is caught at the level of the sit of hit or injury because there is some local swelling and inflammation there therefore many different mechanisms that can underlie headache associated with head hits or dramatic brain injury now fortunately there is some recent data pointing to some what i oil call non obvious treatments for headache in dramatic brain injury keeping in mind that any time were talking about injury or disease or health for that matter mental health of physical health we have to high light a fact that is going to come up again and again in every single episode of this podcast and i think is not o being overly refunded to do which is that regular sufficient amounts of deep sleep each night are going to be important for all aspects of mental had physical health and performance and have been shown over and over again to reduce the frequency of headache and to reduce the time to repair after dramatic brain injury and can improve cognition and on and on and on sleep is essential for all the normal things that encourage healthy activity of the different tissues that are involved in brain and body to occur sleep deprivation of course is going to limit those but i do want to point out that sleep sunlight endive talked about this almost a hassium on this pod cast but regular circadian cycles getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and in the evening as well and as much as possible throughout the day without burning your skin and limiting your exposure to artificial lights at night and on and on all of which is covered in the light for health episode of the german ladpodcast the master sleep episode the human lapodcasts and in the perfect your sleep episode the superman lad podcast an final that at superman labor come getting light and avoiding light at the proper times of the twenty for our cycle is also going to favor all the pathways ringing from got brain access to the inflammatory anti inflammatory pathways nor pathways et camera that of course if you do that you're going to improve and offset any kind of detriment cause by dramatic brain injury is it treating dramatic brain injury directly no but is not getting sufficient sleep not getting sunlight at the right times of day and getting too much artificial light at night going to make any impact of dramatic brain injury including headache far worse yes there are certainly a too date to support that statement as well and then of course nutrition and exercise are also important we can list out sleep sun proper nutrition exercise and i would put a proper social connection whatever that means to you healthy social connections include romantic friendship familial and relationship to self those five thing sleep exercise sun nutrition and social connection are all critical for maintaining base lines of health and raising your base lines of health and i mention that i can segment this out now because i think that any time we are about to start discussing pointed treatments that is things that you can take or do to reduce headache or things the you can take er do to improve anything within mental heal physical health and performance we have to remember that the foundation of mental health physical health an performance is only set at its highest level by tending to those other thingsthand that nothing really surpasses any of those things or put differently there is no replacement for any of those things in the form of pill a powder even a behavior of practice there things you can do to offset getting less than ideal sleep ti things that you can use bright artificial lights during the day to try in partially offset lack of sunlight but really there is no exercise pill there is no sunlight a device although sum bright lights are very bright there is no no replacement for actual sunlight there is no replacement for actual sleep there is no replacement for actual intuition and i do feel it is an important conversation to have as we head into the next segment which is what in you take or d to reduce headache and in order to address this were in a start first with the headaches associate with head hits and dramatic brain injury because turns out there is a surprising and very useful approach to doing that but this same approach also can help offset and treat headache in other conditions as well meaning not just for headaches caused by dramatic brain injury but also headaches cause by sudden onset tension headache or my grain headache or even perhaps again perhaps cluster type headaches the first substance that to highlight that has ben shown to significantly reduce the intensity and or frequency of headaches is creatine now creatine as many of is something that people supplement an take most often creatine is discussed in the contacts of muscle performance not just for peoplewho weight lift but for people do insurance exercise and it is often been said that five to ten grahams per day of creatine monohydrate depending on how much way five to ten grim pray of cretin mono hydrate can increase creating phosphate stores in muscles can bring more water into muscles can make you stronger increase power output and that is all true as all completely true we discusses than the superman labpodcasts with doctor and gain when he was a guest on the a humeral labor caster standard series and we discuss hits extensively in an upcoming episode from doctor and gain in his special six part guess series where he is a guest on the berm labpodcasts but where really he is the one doing the majority of the teaching that series covers everything from strength haperturfy endurance and there is an episode on supplementation where we go deep into the discussion about creatine now in that discussion and again now we dilate the fact that creatine while most often discuss on line and in the media as a supplement for sports performance for the reasons i just mention actually has far more data behind it that is laboratory studies exploring the roll of creatine in the clinical setting i the highlight of paper from that literature now that will make very clear as to why creatine is interesting and in fact very effective for treating headache and particular headache cause by headsets ortramatic brain injury the title of the paper is prevention of dramatic headache dizziness end fatigue with creatine administration now keep in mind this is a pilot study it was performed in humans when you hear that words preclinical that is if you hear there was a preclinical study on blank that means almost always that the study was performed on animal models mice rats primates et camera a clinical trial is something that is carried out on humans and a pilot study means that the study was carried out on humans but on a fairly small cohoritifair fairly small group a ore limited number of subjects none the less if the date are robust as it is in this case of this paper i think it is worth paying attention to in this study what they looked at was creatine administration what they dis they had people in jest a certain amount of creating it'll tell yo in a moment in fluids who con be taken in water or milk with or without food does not really matter what time of day they had people take creating why would thy have people take creatine after dramatic brain injury and in particular for people there suffering from headache dizziness fatigue et camera the reason is that neurons nerve cells rely very heavily on the regulation of calcium in order to generate those action potentials to communicate with one another does not matter of it is a motor her on a censer noon ormogulatory her on they all generate action potentials or something similar to ate and calcium is important for that process calcium becomes deregulated after dramatic brain injury in a number of different ways in particular in ways that impact the energy production systems of cells at are related to i t p at menacing tryphosphate for those a pycionatos of there the one to look at up you can simply look up calcium e t p and neurons and you can learn about that cycle creatine can be stored in muscles as we take about before but creatine and in particular the phosporilated form of creatine which is the readily available fuel source form of creatine can also be stored in brain tissue and it is actually quite prominently stored in the forebrain the area or the real estate of of your brain just behind the forehead which is involved in planning and action and understanding contact as very important for cognition important for personality too butts important for number different aspects of life have to do with making plans being able toe focus very intensely on your work et camera or on anything for that matter all functions that become heavily destructed in people who have dramatic brain injury and concussion creatines ability to communicate with the calcium in the e t p system was the motivation behind the study that is the authors hypothesize on the basis of preclinical data in animals that by increasing creatine stores within the brain not just in the muscle but in particular within the brain that the availability of creatine would allow for better cone of function in general now they did not look at cognition specifically in this paper but they did look at the other aspects that is that the bad stuff associate with t b e and they had people supplement with creatine at a level that is much higher than the typical level that people supplement with creatine simply for sports performance as i mention before most people if they supplement with creatine for sports performance they take creatine monohydrate typically fivegrams per day sometimes ten grams per day if thereabout a hundred kilograms or or greater in body weight under kilograms is two hundred approximately two hundred twenty pounds the doses that was use for supplementing cretin in this study to address the potential impact of creatine on headache dizziness and fatigue was quite a bit higher then the dosages use simply for muscle performance in the study they had people take a dose of zero point for grams of creatine monohydrate per kilogram of body weight for somebody that weighs a hundred kilograms or two hundred twenty pounds tat would be forty grams of creatine per day have someone weighs half that much they would take twenty grams of creatine per day and they did that over a period of six months and we know that when you take creatine over and over day to day that there is a build up of creatine stores both in the muscles and within the brain tissue now what they found as a consequence of this cretin administration was really striking and i think quite exciting they found a very significant decrease in the frequency of headache in people that were supplementing with creatine as oppose to the controls now keep in mind that this is a pilot study but the effects are very dramatic they found a very statistically significant decrease in the frequency of headache in people that were taking creatine in fact if you look at the controls and you see that their basically getting headache at a frequency of ninety per cent or more after to the reduction and headache frequency is down to about ten or twelve per cent in the people taking creating that is quite quite a dramatic effect and if you look at the other measures they took keep in mind again this is a pilot study limited number of subjects but again the results are very impress of what they found is that the number of people experiencing dizziness was significantly reduced in people supplementing with cretin as was the number of people experiencing fatigue and have acute fatigue and chronic fatigue get not chronic fatigue centrum per say but chronic fatigue which was in the study defend as a general sense of bodily weakness and even mental weakness mental weakness is list bit hard to qualify but a they were very careful to distinguish between cognitive and mental fatigue verses physical and sematic fatigue an they acknowledge that both of those occur in ti b e or post ti b i that headache is quite frequent easily the take away of the study is that for people experiencing headache dizziness and fatigue do tat b i and perhaps and i wont underline perhaps because it has not really been explored yet but perhaps headache dizziness and fatigue do to other conditions symptoms or causes of headache creatine monohydrate supplementation might be again might be an excellent candidate for people to try why do we say that well first of all cretin monohydrate is relatively inexpensive it is considered safe at the dosages used in the study and i certainly for sports performance as well and there are very few other compounds that have been shown to have as significant an impact on headache over the long term as has cretin monohydrate in these studies of people with t b i it is also important to halite the fact that many many people suffer from ti b eyes i mentioned earlier and as now there are very few treatments for t b i you tend to get the basic advice coming back and again i think it is excellent adviciou no get proper amounts of sleep get exercise but do not get another dramatic brain entry thus obvious but you be surprised how many people go right back to work because they have to and we have to be sympathetic to the fact that many people just cannot stop working or go on disability many you hove to go back to work that could be shorter could be other kind of work where they are then subject to perhaps getting more t b i maybe there getting less rest as a consequence and stress have see stresses a confounding issue for t b i but sleep exercise sun nutrition all of those things proper social connection are what people are encourage to do when they have t b i but there eve been very few compounds in particular very few over the counter compounds that are known to be safe that have shown efficacy in dealing with t b i think that while this is a a pilot study and o we can consider it preliminary i think am it is important enough in the effects were dramatic enough that people with headache and particular people with ti b e ought to consider supplementing with creating in order to de l with their headaches and of course i eagerly await other studies exploring the roll of this dosage of creatine a shes a relatively hydosige of creating monohydrate for offsetting headache meanwhile i thinkthere are number people out there suffering from headache am who my consider using creating monohydrate in an exploratory faction in seeing whether to in helps offset their headaches keep a mine of course any time you are going to add or remove anything a supplement are otherwise from your from yourtreatment your nutrition et camera i do suggest that you con salt with your physician in particular i fou had chronic headache i do not say that to protect me i say that of course to protect you what i to discuss next i fine extremely exciting why well what ism about to describe is a compounder i should say a set of compounds that are available over the counter that have been shown to be very effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches and not just one kind of headache but multiple types of headaches what it'll describe has been shown to have significant effects in reducing the intensity or frequency of tension type headaches miring type headaches as well as hormone type headaches that are related to the menstrual cycles that it described earlier now there are a lot of data centered around this general topic but ism an a focus on three man papers what i have not told you yet of course is what is the compound that ism referring to what is this over the counter compound will it turns out this over the counter compound is not just available over the countries also available in food it turns out that nutrition can have a very strong impact on the frequency and intensity of headache although supplementation with this particular compound can accomplish the same thing as well what ism referring to here are mega three fatty acids many of you are probably familiar with omega three fat acids these are faddy acids that come in the form of called e p a and d oh and omegathreefaty acts are commonly distinguished from the called omega six fat acids omega six fat acids come in a bunch of different foods and the of course can be supplement as well omega three fat acids come in a bunch different foods and can be supplement as well common forms of omega three fat acids i should a common forces of omega three fat acids in foods include fat ocean fish including summon summon skins sardines anchovies things of that sort common sources in supplement form are called fish oil capsule or liquid fish oil again omega the fat acids and almost always when or talking about omega three fat acids were talking about a commination of e p a and d h but really it is the quantity of e p a omega three lady acids that seems to be the most impactful for the sorts of healthmetrics that were in a talk about in a few minutes now with respect to omega six fat acids the most typical food sources of omegas fat acids are seed oils i know nowadays seed oils have become quite controversial have given my stands on this in a a prior pod cast all just repeat it for those of you that have not heard it i am not of the belief that all seed oils are bad that they're all in inflammatory that they are killing us ore making a sick t that they are the major cause of metabolic is function et camera however i think it is very clear and i learn this from doctor lay north when he was a last on this podcast and taut us all about nutrition on in great dapthit i highly recommend that episode if you are interested in nutrition that people are consuming a lot more oil generally and a lot of those oils that people are consuming more of nowadays include a lot of the called omegas fatyacids and a lot of those oils are seed oils the particular omegas fatyacid that is going to be relevant for to day's discussion is lanolin acid and that is common in a lot of seed oils again ism not going to tell you that seed oils are bad however it does seem to be the case that many people are consuming far too many seed oils and in doing are consuming far too many calories and perhaps are consuming too much of the omega six fatyacids relative to the omega three fatiacids now with that said i think there is general agreement among nutritionist and health professionals that we could all stand to get more omega three fatiacids perhaps for cardiovascular health of the vesilobit debated but certainly for immune system function for mood and for functioning the brain and for the potent anti an inflammatory effects of omega threes again megatheres can be sourced from food both anima base and plantable you can simply go on line and look up the various food base sources but in thinking about headache and different treatments for headache there are some recent studies exploring how supplementing with omega three fatiacids and in one case how supplementing with omega three fatiacids and deliberately reducing the amount of lanolin acid the omega six fatiacids how that can impact headache the first study i to describe in reference to the roll of omega three fatiacids and headache was publishing two thousand eighteen and the title of the paper is long chain omega three fatiacids and headache in the us population their number of things the i really about the study a few of those include the fact that they looked at an enormous number of people that is they included twelve thousand three under and seventeen men and women elikethe fact that the included men and women in the study age twenty or older and that they broke down the population in to categories that included age they certainly looked at a racinethnicity they looked at educational background they look at body mass total energy in take which is really important if you think about it people are going t be eating and within the things that they eat they are going tore consuming some omega threes hopefully as well some omegasixes and if there eating far more than their going to get far more of likely going to get far more of both of those things than they would ordinarily if they were eating smaller amount they controlled for totacloric intact in a way that i find a particularly useful for looking these kind of data the reason they explored omen threes is worth mentioning omgathree fatyacids are known to have in anti and inflammatory a fact that anti am flammetory effect is mediated through a couple of different pathways we will not go into these in too much detail now but the omen the fadtiacids keep in mine actually make up various parts of cells in the brain in body astride the membrane that member talk before about stored hormones can go through the different membranes of the cells the outer membrane in the inner membrane a lot of those actualmembranes the structural constituents of neurons and other cells actually made up of or include certain fadtiacid longhand fadiacids and the megathere fadiacids are important for the actual construction of those tissues as well as having anting inflammatory effects through things limiting posting landing and other things that can cause inflammation case o their bunch of different ways that megathere fadiacids can be useful they refer in this study to an earlier study that look to the called analgesic effect the pain relieving effectanogesic means pain relieving effect of megathere fadiacids in what had been a randomize control trial and in that previous paper what they found was that idiot's hionomegathrees and low inomegasixis case a his three lo six and as compared to diets that were just reduced omegasixes they found a greater analgesic effect of increasing omgathrees while also reducing omgasix diacid in the contacts of the seed oil discussion although keeping in minded omegasixes can come from other sources as well if omegasixes were just reduced on their own there was not as greaten effect interns of reducing pain and inflammation as there was when megathere fadacids were deliberately increased and omegas fadiacids were reduced again in all of these studies because these are the ones in which they controlled things well as we s as we say they are holding constant the colonic intakes of much just that your removing fat eating less fact there is actually a removal of certain fats and fadacids and a replacement of those with megathere fadiacids in one case in the other cases just a reduction in omegasixes and you are using other food types in micronutrient to offset that reduction in calories use by reducing omegasixes the basic take away that there relying on marching into the study is that increasing megatheres in reducing omgasixes seems to be beneficial for reducing pain and indeed in this study they find something quite similar which is that when you hold colonic an take constant and when you look at omegasixes whether not you decrease omegas fadiacids are not you find is that increasing megathere fadiacids in the diet either consumed through food sources or by supplementation was associated with a lower prevalence of severe headache or migraine severe tensiontype headache or migrant s this is promising and points to the fact that long chanomegathre fadiacids are likely to have either a pain reducing and there is evidence for that and or in inflammation reducing effect that can significantly reduce the severity of headache in both tensiontype headache and in migraine that is the first study the second study is a more recent study is punishing twenty twenty one that used o i would say a morel's similar type of overall design is the one i referred to earlier the title of this paper is dietary alteration of what they call n three but those areomegathree and six omegas sorry for the shifting nomen glacier i did not write the paper dietary alteration of megathere and omegas fadiacids for headache reductions in adults with migraine and this was a randomized control trial randomize control trials involve having people be in one condition where they do one thing and then they get swapped random my into another condition they serve as their own internal control and that controls for all sorts of things differences in sex differences in age differences in health background in any number of other variables as bests one can in this study they had people either in jest a diet that had increased megatheres increased e p and d h or increased e p a and d h a and reduced amounts of lanolin acid o case o that is going to reduce omegasixes or a control diet in which they had people taking was essentially the average in take of megatheres and omegasixis and you probably already get what the general results of the study are going to be the general results were that there were reductions in headaches of the really cool thing sat was a massive reduction in headache of this was a they refer to it as a robust reduction in it headache in particular for the subjects that increased theromegathrees and reduce the amount of lanolin acid that they took the other thing t a i really about this study is that while they do not know the exact underlying mechanism for the effect they did spend some time delineating what it is that the megathere and omegas fadiacids are likely doing to either offset or exacerbate headache now i did not say that omegas fadiacids exacerbate headache but it does seem that people who in jest morelinolic acid in omegas or experiencing more inflammation and that is evident in a bunch of different conditions one for instances are increases in things c g r p c g a p is a molecule that is associate with the calcium signaling pathway its involved in vast dilation the expansion of the blood vessels and calories and that is known as i mention earlier to exacerbate certain forms of headache i there also forms of headache that be caused by vas of constriction will talk about one very dramatic example perhaps as we get toward the and of it is a very uncommon example but am it is a it is called thunder clap headache and trust me you do not want thunder clap headache amerce will talk about thunderclap headache love they are that involves constriction of the blood vessels in any case in this paper they they don't study mechanism directly but there resting on this known anal genic anti pain as well as known anti in inflammatory pathways related to increasing omega three and take and simultaneously resting on the idea i think that we now can say conclusion that omega six fadiacids in particular lanolin acid can increase inflammation by way of increasing things c g r p face of dilation and some other pathways related to the called inflammatory did of kind pathways and there is a whole discussion now days what is called the inflame atom the basic take away is that if you are interested in reducing headache it may be beneficial at least according to these two studies and another one ill talk about in a moment to increase amounts of omega three fadiacids and that can be done again shroud the ingestion of foods although based on the dosages that will talk about in a moment increasing omega three fadiacids by taking liquid form fish oil which is perhaps the most cost effective way to supplement omega threes or capsids which is perhaps the most efficient way to supplement omega threes really to a level of one graham or more of e p a per day again that is the e p a form in particular if your for instance taking supplemental fish oil or your getting your omega threes from food in your getting a what you determine to be two thousand milligrams are two grahams per a of omega threes keep in my that is going to include e p a n d oh and it does seem the getting above one graham per a of e p a omega three fadiacids either through food or supplements or both is going to be the critical threshold for reductions in the frequency and intensity of headache that include attention headaches and my grain headaches now some people will find actually that investing far more megathere fatiacids generally through supplementation would again can be accomplished though foods as well can also be beneficial for other things such as mood and indeed there is a whole literature related to effects of investing one to three grahams again three grahams per day of e p a that is going to require quite a high intake of omega threes on whatever former supplement you decide to take those into your body but that that can improve mood and forth the basic range that i was able to find in the met analysis momenta analysis are were a researcher will a look at the results of a bunch of different studies focussed on the same thing look at a the different strength of those studies they will do all sorts of cool statistical gymnastics remove the most potent study the one that had the greatest effect and see whether not their still an effect of some treatment or for instance they will a swap in and out a different studies in different comminations to see whether not any one study is really leading to the conclusion that a given treatment does something in any case in the met analysis of omega three fadacids for the treatment of headache and that includes all the different kinds of headache but they found in exploring a huge range of omega three supplementation ranging from two hundred milligrams all the way up to two thousand milligrams per day it really was at the one graham or higher dosage per day were the significant impact and reducing headache frequency and intensity was found and just very briefly earlier i mention that not only as omega three diacid supplementation been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of headache in tension type and migraine type headache but it is also been shown to improve outcomes for premenstrual syndrome related headaches these are what we referred to earlier as hormone based headaches again the lo estrogen low progesterone associated with certain phases of the menstrual cycle as well as other phase of the menstrual cycle are often associate with headache a study entitled effect of omega three fadiacids on premenstrual centrum a systematic review and again metaanalysis what they found in here on paraphrasing the conclusion was that omega three fatyacids could yes effectively reduce the severity of p am a symptoms and one of the symptoms in particular that they found that was reduced was the pain related symptoms associated with headache and they ace she had some very nice hypothesis as to why that likely would be am and in fact point out that in earlier studies omega three fatiacids have actually been considered as nonsteroidal antionflamatory drugs in some cases and indeed there are prescription forms of omega three fadyacids and a highline that not because i think people need to run out and get the prescription form of omega three fadyacids thrall quite hard to obtain and quite expensive but because i think often times when we are talking about something omega three fadyacids the fact that they are available over they counter in a supplement or by liquid or available in food for that matter leads many people to conclude that oh you know this is supplementation this is something that am u know its going to have relatively weak or minor impact on things headache or other halthmetrices but a let us to say that the fact that it exists as a prescription drug in its highest potency form least in my opinion points to the potency of omega three fadyacids in dealing with analgesic of facts that is reducing pain and action formation as well as some of the a known cartoon vascular improvements their social withincreasing megathere fadyacid intact put simply omega threes are not just something that comes from food or supplements they are also being market at at prescription drugs i do think they need to be considered as quite potent and at least as far as these papers that again include metanalysies of many other papers in data gets indicate that supplementing with omega three fadyacids to a point where you are reading above one gram prepay of up a is not just going to be beneficial for treating and reducing the threequencede intensity of one particular type of headache but many types of headaches and when you combine hormonal headaches tension headaches and migraine headaches you account for more than seventy per cent of the total types of headaches that are out there a the effects of omega threes on cluster headaches and some of the other types of headaches least to my knowledge have not been evaluated and there is no reason to think that omega threes would not be beneficial for those types of headaches but at least as far as the data sets we talked about here are concern it is clear omega three fadyacids are going to be a very potent way to reduce pain and to reduce inflammation in ways that can reduce the frequency and the intensity of different kinds of headache before we continue our discussion about many not commonly known and yet very potent treatments for different forms of headache i want to touch on ta topic we mention to lobe earlier and also provide a treatment that is in a way to alleviate something and that is photophobia and ora now keep in mind that earlier i referred to ora as this sense that something's about to happen that is true and that meaning that is an accurate description of ora but oftentimes people also come to understand ora as the feeling that something surrounds a given object visually or even that people have a sense that something is around them again this can kilobit vague but this idea that ora is a sense of something about to happen or that visually or in an auditory way and or even in kind of a sense that something is about to happen in a certain environment in the reason i making a kind of arc shapes with my hands for those o either just listening i making art shapes with my hands is that bra's often described as kind of a halo or a u emanating out from from one's body or from something that they are looking at again nothing spiritual about this in the contacts of the discussion about grain and headache but rather many people experience photophobia sometimes with ora sometimes know and i just want to touch on a couple of the mechanisms by which orimphotophobia occur and mention just briefly a pretty well establish way that people can start to off set photophobia and again i mention that because many people experience photophobia in headache but there are also a number of people that experience photophobia even if they do not have intense headache o photophobia a pretty common pretty debilitating it actually when the reasons why people feel not well in tee to leave work or not go to school or a or leave school these kinds of things were lay in bed all day or dim the lights not go outside again sunlight being a congruent with health a you can imagine how photophobia can let to all sorts of a negative downstream consequences case of what is ora and what is photophobia the exact origins of ora are not exactly clear but it is generally thought that what ora represents is what is called spreading depression and this is not depression of one's mood although can be associate with that this is depression of coronal activity again anurans communicate with one another by generating electrical impulses that travel down the length of their of their called axons which are wires and then they dumper o transmitter out at the called snaps and impact the electric selectivity of other anurans depression is a electrical or i should say a cento go electrical chemo electrical is the proper term phenomenon in which the excitability of anurans is reduced again does not have anything to do with depression as a mood state per say rather it is a reduced excitability of anurans and it is been shown in some imaging studies that ora is associate with a back to front from the back of the brain to front spreading depression a wave of lowering levels of electrical excitability and because this originates in the visual quarter which is in the back that the part of your brain that is making sense of visual images coming in through the eyes and relaid through other stations in the brain that people will start to see a cold of halo of light or that they will start to feel that the light around them is literally surrounding their body or some other object or body that they are looking at and then it spreads forward in the brain and that is when it tends to stretch over into other called sensory modalities century modalities being things touch or hearing people will get the sense that kind of seeing something in their periphery of their vision than they will start feeling something around them there is o sense that something's about to happen as the spreading wave of depression goes from back to front people experience a number of these different semi abstract sensory phenomena that we call ora case that is how originates now photophobia is a little but different photophobia we now understand because of some beautiful work that was done at cliff papers lab at hazard medical school and some other laboratories showing that photophobia originates from a specific set of neurons in the eye we call these the intrinsically photosensitive melons and gangling cells which is really just a mouthful of nerve speak for neurons in the eye that connect to the brain these can ganglia cells that respond most robustly to bright blue light or other short wave length light s you got short wavelength light that is blue and greens are short wave lengths and then long javelin light which is red or you it can even be a outpost ray l be inhere we do not detect him for red consciously other species do pithier can she in the impaired they can even heat sense short wave length light is going to be light that is that is bright a blue green it is what is very common in florescent bulbs that are commonly used in on household lighting and workplace lighting and other forms of artificial lighting it is also of course present in sunlight sunlight includes a huge range of wavelength including long wavelength light of course you have been that as the reds and oranges in the sunset and on those intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglia cells in the eye respond best to bright green or blue light and they send connections to a bunch of different places in the brain including the call her central circadian clocks supervise matnucleas that sets your day night sleep wake rhythms this is why i encourage people to view sunlight in the morning to set this system in motion to avoid bright light exposure at night from artificial sources in order to not send wake up signals from the eye to the brain and then on to the rest of the body but these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglia cells are also known to connect with other areas of the brain many other airs of the brain in fact and one of the important areas of the brain they connect as it relates to photophobia is an area of a structure call the thalamus the thalluses an like structure that sits in the center of the brain and it serves as a kind of a switchboard a sensory relay by which information coming from the eyes from the ears from the touch system et camera are funneled into different compartments in the traumas and then sent to different other areas of the brain think of it colic an old fashioned switchboard or am you could think of it a sort of a in an airport you go a to a particular wing of the airport than you go t of particular gait and on you r getting funneled progressively through a narrower career channels until you arrive at your particular plain much in the same way the phallus has the bunch of different entry points its sensory information coming in from a bunch of different sources and those sources get rounded into progressively narrower and narrower funnels to eventually arrive at the accurate place for their function these intrinsically photosensitive gangly sells send connections to a small but important area of the phallus called helped denoted l the letter and p with latteroposterio thalamus for the i should say it is the lateral posterior nucleus of the traumas for you if asinatos out there and then the neurons in that location are going to respond that is there going to be activated by bright blue light green light or any kind of bright light originating from artificial sources or from sunlight and the neurons there that respond to that have a very interesting pattern of connections they send connections up to the called sensory quarter a bunch of different layers throughout the quarter that are not associate with visual perception that is they're not associate with understanding that the are shapes and contours in the environment but rather to neurons that are involved in the detection of pressure pain and other forms of sensory information at the level of what the meninges we talk to the meninges earlier again while the brain itself does not have a sensory a system to detect pain the tissues around it do and the tissues around those tissues that is the stuff around the makings themselves can respond o pain and intracranial pressure is also relaid through the meninges to are conscious awareness that there is pain what is this mean forphotophobia it means that bright blue light and green light and of course light from sunlight will activate the see neurons in the eye these intrinsically photosensitive gangling cells which then activate the latteralposterior neurons elpenerons and those elpinerns communicate with areas of the brain that are specifically tune to different sensory phenomenon and in particular pain at the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure what this means is that when we have headache or if we simply have photophobia on its own that bright light is actually the trigger for pain sensing and even the creation of pain at the level of the n indies and intracranial pressure what is this mean in terms of dealing with or treating photophobia while most people deal with photophobia by deciding to turn off or dim all the lights and simply getting under the covered or working a very a low bribed hat and putting on sunglasses in the they want to lie down a sometimes because a miring can be associate with naught or even vomiting in its sepericate a instances rather but one very simple way to avoid activation of these retina ganglia cells that would trigger photophobia is that if you are starting to feel i you have a migrant coming on or you have photophobia coming on to shift to using patterns of light that are in the longer wave length domain what that means practically is shifting to using very orange ideally dim but very orange an red light now this is not a call for people to go out and invest in expensive red light therapies a admittedly there are some excellent case uses for red light there particular for ache wound healing even for improving vision especially in people be on the age of party for some forgot augmentation we talked all about that in the episode that i did on light an health again you can find that at supermen lapdog calm everything time stamped what ism talking might here would be simply having some red light bulbs on hand for any time that you need to remain awake but you are starting to experience photophobia these red light bulbs can be purchase very inexpensively a as party lights you can buy these on line there is no specific need to get any a i would say a red light that is design specifically for photophobia or anything that some you can find the cheapest of red light available out there and those will simply work the idea being that for many people who are experiencing photophobia they want a reduce that feeling of pain and pressure in their head the experience through photophobia they also might want o stay awake at some worked on in do things operating under red light or i should say living working at camera under red light would allow you to stay awake not have to hide under the covers if your experiencing photophobia in addition and i mention this to the beginning of the episode but many people find photophobia to be a entry point or a trigger to headache what happens is they stare to experience some roof some onset oho photophobia and then the photophobia itself leads to this feeling i always that then converts into headache and while there are not a lot of clinical data on this just yet an emerging idea in the realm of headache treatment the idea that if you can offset some of the early signs you can offset some of that photophobia and ora perhaps to the use of dim red lights or red lights as have described a moment ago then you might be able to reduce the probability that you are going to have a migraine or other type of headache entirely again no need for expense of red lights but you you can find red lights very easily on line and simply have them on hand o replace that the current lights that you have on your night stand or in or whatever room you happen to be in with these red lights these red lights are also i should mention very useful in limiting the amount of aortas all stress hormone that i is very healthy for us to release at high levels early in the day in fact viewing sunlight will increase coatis all levels is another reason why what am about say is relevant to photophobia but if you want to keep parts all levels low in the evening and at night and indeed you do and improve the transition to sleep and indediour sleep over all reducing quarters allow at evening time an a night time is extremely beneficial and red lights will help you will accomplish that i talked about that in the episode on light in health the point here is that if you suffer from photophobia with or without or a using red lights and not simply dimming ordinary artificial lights or feeling the you've to turn off all lights entirely is going to be one relatively inexpensive ore i should say very inexpensive in some cases because these red lights can be found very inexpensively on line way to be able to continue with your daily activities at least in an indoor environment if you are suffering from photophobia shifting back to ways to reduce the intensity and frequency of different kinds of headaches we have not talk much about tension headaches specifically that is what i to do now as you recall tension headaches are going to be muscular in origin can keeping in mind that everything nor when it comes to pain things nor when it comes to everything frankly cause every organ and tissue system in our body is ultimately control by our nervous system but tension headaches are often associated with tension of the muscles that are on the skull of the jaw of the neck and can be quite painful for many people an debilitating and the most common treatment for this that most people rely on that is is to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatorye things a see of benefit i be protein sometimes astern in things of that sort and oftentimes those can be helpful their couple things keep in mine however the endears nonsteridantand inflammatory drugs oftentimes will work very well at first but people quickly develop a tolerance to them meaning there can have to take more and more and order to get the same a fact and oftentimes they cannot take more and more because some of them are very hard on the liver and in addition to that some of them can offset some other things that you really want for instance it is now known that nonsterod into inflammatory drugs can offset some the benefits of exercise than thermic sense because the lot of the adapted benefits of exercise actually come from experiencing a lot of inflammation acutely that means you actually want inflammation during your resistance training work out or even your endurance work out but then that inflammation triggers an adaptation event or series of adaptation events that leads to greater strength greater speed more muscle more endurance whatever it is that you happen to be training for reducing pain can be good of course but not if you have to take more and more of a given drug that it has side effects on the liver and can offset the effects of exercise and forth the other reissue with nonsteroidal intinflamatory drugs is that many of them simply do not work for many people or again they will work the first time in the second time but than they stop working they all subtend to lower body temperature i think o most people are aware of this om because many of these same a drugs are used in order to reduce five er but if you are taking nonsteridanti in inflammatory drugs simply to reduce your headache and your lowing corody temperature that can have all sorts of downstream issues relates to sleep wake cycles to metabolism to a mine system function more generally and on and on for that reason has been a quite a lot of exploration of alternatives to nonsteridanti in inflammatory drugs fore the treatment of headache and indeed pain generally but to day were talking about headache now as it relates to mention headache one of them more advanced a an a modern treatments that you sometimes hereabout is books i both i think most people are familiar with as the thing that people get injected into their face around the eyes or round the lips or elsewhere in order to quote reduce wrinkles it was discovered some years ago when both treatments were being done for cosmetic reasons that it could often be very effective for relieving headache if injected into the muscles and the way that a it works is that of course tension headache involves a tension of the muscles a a can of will call it clinching are pinching up of the muscles but were really locking bout as contraction of the muscles and that is controlled by neurons neurons which are negro muscular hero muscular neurons it do not form synapses with or connections with other neurons they form snaps is with muscle they release a seetilcoling on to the muscle that makes the muscle contract this is the way you move the limbs of your body is also way the muscles of your a head contract and can give you tension type headaches books arises from or is rather bochelinum nerrotoxs and bochelinum serotonin is a toxin that is found in canned goods not all can goods of course and what it does is it it prevents a certain step in the release of called hero transmitter in the little packets that they live in which are called versicles little little spheres of nortransmenter live at the end of neon nerve terminals and are released on to the muscle make the muscle contract bochelinum neurotocxin cleaves of particular proline in there for you i f fasunot as one a l the spits of really cool mechanism it cleaves something all snap twenty five a snap twenty five is involved in the fusion of those little spheres with the membrane of the neon and releasing of the negro transmitter when bochelinum serotonin is present at there muscle interface those nerves cannot communicate with the muscle and as a consequence the muscles undergo kind of flaccid a tone they just kind of relax there underneath the skin sure wrinkles are relieved but if both is injected into the muscles themselves it can provide long lasting relief of certain types of headaches in particular tension type headaches while it seems a bit of an extreme treatment people who suffer very badly from tension type headaches due to hyper contraction of the muscles of the forehead or around the temples or round the jaws ore the certain parts of the the neck in the muss muscles of the neck that encroach on the on the back of the skull or that actually connect to the back of the skull can achieve tremendous s longlasting relief from these books injection sometimes for weeks or monster even longer people go in for periodic a a reps of books it actually is quite safe despite the face that bochelinumnerotocs and is quite dangerous a it is given in very locoism given locally those of the only muscles affected that's how books is used to treat a headaches an is o very effective treatment at that of course many people i imagine are interested in notches drug base treatments and not books type treatments for treating headache but other types of treatments for headache that are of the more let us call them natural or nondrug treatments and here we are trying to get into the realm of the and of herbal and oil base treatments for headache now i confess when i first started researching this area of headache and treatment for headaches that is m i found myself approaching it with a bit of trepidation because when i started to hear about essential oils and about herbal medications and things of that sort i thought oke well though probably be some of facts i mean admittedly we have talk before i on this podcast about things apigenin apigenin is one of the a your components of camomile and camomile is known to make people feel obit sleepy and can enhance sleep well apgenin and high concentration can indeed augment sleep we talk about this in are sleep tool kit by the way we do not just have episodes about sleep master sleep perfect our sleep et camera but if you go to the superman paddock comwebside and you go to the man in you click on news letter can scroll down you will see that we have a tool kit for sleep this completely zerocost to acts assyou do not even have to sign up although if you to sign up for future news letters you can get those one of the keep components of the tool kip for sleep in addition to behavioral tools and things that are not supplement based is apigenin which is this component from a camomiles the idea that certain herbal derivatives or herbs or oils could be very useful for improving symptoms of whatever in this case improving sleep with apigenand is not unheard of it in fact the data continue to be released all the time that many of the things that we think of as herbal at camera cannatthaly have quite potent of facts and while i myself it was approaching the discussion about essential oils and a wishes ay oils right who to say if they're essential or not oils and herbs in the treatment of headache i finished out my research on this literature feeling quite i should say a surprised an and as if i need to really check myself a bit because what i found is that there are certain herbs an oils for instance that far out perform fostered and antiinflamatory drugs for the treatment of headache that is right there are certain oils that are available over the counter that when looked at in many studies metanalysies landfill ell about one particular study and amen analyses in a moment they show that they can reduce the frequency and intensity of headache in a manner that far out paces what you observe it nonsteroidal anytime lavatory drugs with apparently none of the same issues assocey with nonsterod anting flametory drugs am i think it is really worth paying attention to the first of those studies i to describe you is a one that his now become cold of a classic in the literature i should say at least for those that are interested in the a a typical treatments for headache and the title of this paper is effect of peppermint and eucalyptus oil preparations on nerve physiological and experimental adjust metric headache parameters of what does that mean well this is an interesting study because rather than look at the effectiveness of peppermint and eucalyptus oil and other oils on headache what they did is because they want to look at the mechanisms underlying headache which i confess i love the fact that they won to understand the neurophysiology and not just get subjective ratings of headache although they did that too but hey really will not understand how these oils can impact things muscular tension or perception of pain what they did is they recreated headache in human subjects by using tightening cuffs of the of the head they cut off blood supply to certain areas of the head they easily induced headache and then they measured things the e m g the muscle response at the level of electro physiology in the muscle and of course subjective measures of how much people perceived to be in pain or not in pain a it'll give you the broad control of the study because i want to make sure that it is the conclusions that come through most clearly and we will provide a link to the study in are shownote captions what they did is they had people use one of four different preparations said preparation one which include some peppermint oil and some eucalyptus oil and all the details about the amount an the relative percentages are in the paper for you to produce on line through the link i mention before they had four different groups they had one group apply peppermint oil but that pepperminoil also contained eucalyptus soil they'd another group use just peppermint oil head another group use just tiny traces of peppermint oil and smaller doses of eucalyptus oil and then they had a fourth group which was just using placebo and i say using what they were doing is they were sponge applying the oil to the temples and forehead of people and then what they did is they use these different approaches to measure the activation of muscles to measure pain and they then induced head pain they induced headache and they looked at the temporal muscles on the side they look at forehead muscles things to that sort they use three diffentypes of pain stimulus they looked at people's sensitivity to experimentally induced pain by either providing pressure this was kind of a cuff around the forehead or thermal pain they actually had them easily heat heated up at the level of the skin am and actually a they brought the heat up pretty high to the point where people were rating the pain almost to the to the point of a excessive pain and pain limit obviously could not take them to the point of extreme pain end they had a constriction type condition in which they cut off blood circulation to the perycranial muscles using an inflatable collar around the cranium and they inflated that to pretty high pressure can have a brutal em experiment to be involved in but look the thynomimic headache and i think am by using these different approaches there able to mimic the different aspects of headache and make sure and hearts the key point that every person in the study is not just getting the same treatment for headache but is getting the same headache and that something that i think gives this study power it is not the only way to do a study this but it gives it a lot of power in trying understand which types of interventions are going to assist in headache and may be even specific dimensions of the pain and headache and basically what they found in the study is that of all the treatments they used the essential plan oil preparations that contained peppermint and it'll just mention as an aside and in other studies men fall these minty type a essential minty type a what we think of his flavors but are really aromas as well and as all point out the mechanism in a moment they had the effect of significantly reducing the intensity of the pain that is subjects could tolerate the pain far better and experienced less pain subjectively and the magnitude o the effects were really pretty impressive again i went into all this thinking essential oils oke that is them really woo stuff am now i do not know about that but it turns out that these essential oils at least the ones that contain peppermint oil with or without eucalyptus oil perform very well in reducing pain the key take away from the study is and here on paraphrasing from the study that the commination of peppermint oil eucalypti soil and these a basically in a final suspension again people are not drinking these essential oils i one to be very clear they are applying these to the to the skin around the area that is in pain in particular the temple in the foreheads increased connive performance i did not talk about that but this is the ability to maintain connive functioning wall in pain you not here retimuma headache up until now just as ism find of pain but that pain can be very debilitating for durability to work and perform and to other things this commination a peperminoil n eucalyptus oil applied to the skin allow people to increase their connive performance while under pain and had a very muscle relaxing and mentally relaxing effect mental relaxation was of course measured subjectively but remember one of the things that led me to feature this study in this episode in particular is that they did not o say o my muscles feel more relax they actually saw that the muscles of the forehead and temples and some surrounding muscles were more relaxed when people had these oils on applied to their forehead and the temples not perhaps to the same degree that one would observe with books or for the same extent or duration as one would experience with books but much in the same way which then raises the question what is going on here man is a salplocibofect will know because they compared to pluocibo and they controlled for the odor of course of the oil that was applied that every one thought that they were getting essentially the same thing on intended but in this case what they found is that if they applied the essential oil to the forehead and temples that people experience more less a cooling sensation or they could feel as if something was happening in the underlying muscle well what was happening we now know that mental peppermint and other things that smell that way and tastes that way actually have an impact on the sensory neurons at the level of the skin and can actually inhibit certain sensory neurons and can activate other sensory neurons okay in order to understand this we have to go back what i said the beginning of the episode which is that you have motor neon these are neurons that constrict muscles or souse me that cause contraction of muscles i do not constrict them they cause contraction muscles you have sensory neurons which sense different things light sound or touch and you have modulatory neurons mental and eucalyptus are actually known to activate certain channels in the sensory neurons that respond not just to touch but also the sensation of cooling o cases when we think of mental and peppermint we think of an of cool sense and flavors cool meaning cold and when we think of things hot peppers captain we think of not anything that has a hot temperature we tend to think of spicy spicy and hot go together and peppermint and mental and cool go together much in the way that the on gum commercials of the mincomcommercials would lead you believe in in fact there right what is happening here is that the application of these oils is very likely activating channels in the sensory neurons including the trip channels but others as well that are leading to the anal genes effect by shutting down the heat and pain pathways because heat and pain while they are not exactly the same in our nervous system they are funneled through common pathways were has cooling and pain relief are funneled through alternate what we call parallel pathways the study on superman and eucalyptus oil preparations in reducing pain of headache and different aspects of pain do to headache i think are really important because they do not just illustrate the fact that yes indeed ill go on record saying it cause that's what the day to say and on there are other papers to support the statement as well essential oils apply to the skin can reduce the symptoms of tension headache in a significant way and actually can lead to some on offset of some of the cognitive a defects seen with headaches that itself very impressive i must say surprising for me on of put me in my place as somebody thought of essential oils aspen we on'tki but is actually seem to really hold some merit and when you compare the magnitude of the effect even though this was an enormous a number of subjects you compare the magneto the effect in a paper this or similar papers on these essential oils to the impact of nonsterod anti nflametory drugs and they really hold their own and in some cases exceed the abusive in pact of action lavatory drugs for that reason i think we can look at peppermint oils and peppermint eucalyptus containing oils mental containing oils applied to the skin for the treatment of tension type headache as among the more potent treatments available out there now another way to approach treatment of tension headache is something that many of you are probably heard about before and that have talked a little bit about on this podcast and previous episodes and that is acupuncture we will do an entire episode all about acupuncture but much in the same way that essential oils i think for many people not all but for many people are considered kind of a wo biology or people think of it as very alternative medicine keep in mind that as the underlying mechanisms of things these peppermint oils are starting to be discovered or mega threes are trying to be discovered mechanistically they hold up very well there is a logic there there is an underlying understanding of not just why they should work but in many cases how they work in the same way acupuncture which of course has existed for thousands of years has been used very successfully to treat headache and other forms of pain much that many insurance companies will now pay for acupuncture as an insured practice not all but many will and in addition to that the scientific community is starting to understand mechanistically how acupuncture work i do not wan to make this o the major focus for now but very briefly there is a laboratory at hazard medical school run by chufa chuff is well known in the carol science community for doing excellent work in parsing the mechanisms of touch sensation and pain in particular not just touch at the level of skin but pain and pain pathways and in recent years his laboratory has started to do studies on how acupuncture works because indeed acupuncture has been known to work to alleviate pain for a long time but t underlying mechanisms haven't been clear what chef's lab has published now in excellent journals nature science and other journals is that the precise insertion sites of different needles lead to activation of sensory neurons and their downstream pathways in ways that can potently reduce in inflammation and that can be used to potently reduce the activity of certain muscles for instance muscles in the forehead and temples when you her acupuncture can reduce pain i think some people this o while there is needles sticking out of your face for s wall that must hurt n an actually that needles are very fine needles and skilled acupuncture's can insert them without any pain or actually the person receiving it does not even usually recognize hat the needles are in that is how quickly in u efficiently they can put them in and people do not detect any pain but that has been shown to greatly reduce pain in particular headache related pain and back rely to pain some other forms of pain chef's lab has shown that the specific needle insertion sites can activate the sensory pathways and can deactivate the sensory motor pathways and now you are familiar with censurynerons motor now son modulatory runs and can modulate the activity of the pain pathways by way of impacting the activity of all sorts of different organs including organs that give rise to some of the inflammatory side kind easily what i saying here is that thanks to thousands of years of acupuncture and the maps of different insertion sites we now know or i should say people have long known and people in the west are starting to adopt the understanding that acupuncture yes indeed it really does work for relieving pain and laboratories both in united states just thus and elsewhere are starting to find the underlying mechanisms and those mechanisms include deactivation of the pain pathways activation of some of the parallel pathways that assist in shutting down pan or in relaxing the muscles that are causing tension type headache as well as activation of curl pathways that in pine on organs that then cause or reduce the release of molecules into the body they give us the experience of pains o reduced inflammation and in many cases increasing anti an inflammatory pathways i just want to be sure to mention acupuncture and a little bit of mechanistic understanding of acupuncture works because indeed acupuncture is shown to be quite effective for the treatment of tension type headache and to some extent migraine headache as well we talked about omega three fatiacids we talked about essential oils we talk about acupuncture this episode is starting to sound alternative treatments to headache including migraine but i want to be very clear this is not about alternative treatments everything that ism talking about here has a mechanistic basis and what were talking about to day are approaches to dealing with headache that yes are typically over the counter compounds or are grounded in nutrition or in the case of acupuncture behavioral practices but that are not necessarily meant as replacements for things nonsteroidal antainflammatory drugs or prescription drugs of course those things can still be taken many people drive benefit from them but the goal is always i believe i should hope for people to fine ways that they can control their health outcomes and reduce things headache using a minimum number of things that have other side effects and that of course can also include the use of essential oils in conjunction with things nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs or the use of red light to offset photophobia in conjunction with any number of different treatments either prescription or otherwise s i do want to make that clear and i special when to make that clear as i transition to the next segment where i am going to tell you about verbal treatments for migraine and this is based on what i consider a very comprehensive review of many randomized control studies indeed the title of the paper is able treatments for migraine a systematic review of randomized controlled studies and this was publish in twenty twenty and this contains an immense amount of information we will provide a link to it after those who that really want to dive deep on this in the s paper they focus on a number different reviews and analysis of data focused on compounds for the treatment of migraine ranging from and including things mental and peppermint oil we all recovered that i will not cover that again in detail but in this a review the highlight the results i refer to before plus other results that show that mental and peppermint oil can be quite effective in the treatment of mention type headache and in this case migraine headache as well that is interesting that mentally peppermanoils can be used notjust a treat mention type headache but migraine headaches as well and they look at an enormous number of other types of verbal and essential oil type treatments everything from coriander to citron to damask rob kamala lavender a punch of things ism not going to go through each in every one of these in a lot of detail have tended to do to day and ism going to do now is to hate the most potent of these different treatments again mental peppermanoil being among the most potent in addition to that there is a particular pathway that is associated with headache and when i say that i mean the different types of headache which includes the activation of this thing that we call c g r p c g a p again is involved in this calcium regulation pathway and leads to azo dilation of the vessels and arteries and salaries in a way that can create pain and this feeling of pressure inside the head which can be very uncomfortable of course now earlier in the episode i mention that i was going to touch on affine enci'm going to do that now now the reason i mention affine is that there is a a sort of lower out there that if you have a headache drinking a cup of coffee can eliminate that headache a few things about that point first of all if you are somebody who in jests affine every day and you do not in jest affine you will indeed get a headache and drinking affine will relieve that particular headache it is absobly true that affine can relieve the lack of affine induced headache that sort of a day but o that leads actually to a very important question which is why would that be the case well it turns out that affine is both a azo dilator and a azo constrictor how does it do that well one of the main ways in which affine makes us more alert is that it occupies the receptors for something called a decisive a decisive is a molecule that builds up in the brain an body more and more the longer we have been awake it is one of the things that makes us feel sleepy when we drink affine that coffin occupies the adrenaline receptor and the a denizens cannot have its normal effect of making a sleepy when that affine wears off the benzine combine and we feel sleepy a decisive is a azo dilator when we drink affine because it blocks the effects of a decisive there is a azo constriction associate with drinking affine if you have a headache that is associate with excessive azo did nation and pressure in the head indeed drinking some affine and cause some azo constriction by preventing that a decisive pathway that would normally leave to azo constriction and you can get some relief from that headache however affine is also a azo dilator affine has the ability to impinge on the called an o pathway the nitrocoxide pathway which is a nerve to blood pathway that involves a few different enzymes that we will not get into right now but may be in a future episode that causes dilation of the blood vessels and as a consequence drinking affine can also increase vast dilation at sort of a too pronged effect now one of the ways in which you might think about this and perhaps utilize this is that if you are well rested or if it is early in the day and you have had some sleep the previous night a decisive levels are very likely to be low especially if you slept very well the night before under those conditions when you and jess affine you are not going to experience the azo constriction facts of affine that would ordinarily be there by inhibiting a decisive why because a decisive is not present at all and under those conditions drinking coffee ought to lead to some azo dilation not a lot but none the less vast dilation if however you have not slept well or it is late in the day and you have been up for a long time drinking affine is likely to have more of a azo constriction effect and this is important because some of the treatments that you hereabout that involve using affine to treat headache are as extreme as o k if you have a headache at night drink a cup of coffee and then go to sleep a she saw that in the literature which i i canquite believe because yes indeed some people can fall asleep after drinking affine but we now very well thanks to the beautiful work and science communications of people doctor father walker from universe kalfornia berlin who is been a guest on this and any other pod was that even if you can fall asleep after drinking affine in jesting affine within the ten to twelve hours prior to bedtime is simply not a good idea because of the ways it destructs the architecture of sleep what is to take away about affine and headache and azo dilation you need to be very clear on weather not affine tends to remove your headache or exassurbate it now this is going to depend on time o day an the amount of a decision year system as i mention before but also there seems to be a kind of bimodal distribution whereby some people when they drink affine it really improves their headache it is a in some case o very significant facts whereas other people en they drink affine it really exacerbates their headache and as least as far as i could tell from the literature it is not easy to predict who those people are going to be what is reassuring however is it does not seem to be the case that if your somebody who experiences relief from headaches by drinking affine that suddenly one day to the next you are going to experience a worsening of your headache and vice versus also true if your somebody that ism drinks coffin n your headaches get worse i don't thin there is any reason to think that affine one day or from one day to the next rather is going to somehow alleviate your headache you have to determine for yourself wether not headaches are relieved or exassurbated by drinking affine and if your wondering why it is confusing it is because affine hit ts both the vase of dilation and the vas of constriction pathways and there is nothing you or i or any one else can do about it not the last thing i to talk about in terms of relief for headaches is something that i'mguessing about probably twenty five per cento our familiar with in seven fypersint of view are not which is kirkman kircumen is often also referred to as numeric and turmeric is a rout and kircumen is one of the key components of that rout kirkman is known to have very potent antiinflammatory properties i do not think that is debated at all in fact it is potent as an anting inflammatory that some people have cautioned against taking high levels of kircumen prior to for instance resistance training work outs or even cardiovascular work outs because it prevents in inflammation that it also can prevent the adaptation response because remember the inflammation that occurs during exercise both resistance and cardiovascular exercise is at least in part the trigger for the adaptation that going to lead to in hasten durance in hanstrength hypertrophy et camera none the last kirkman has been explored in the contexts of treatment of gran and it is one of the compounds that was analyzed in extensive detail in this wonderful review that i mention obit earlier what i about the study is that they were able to explore the effects of kircumen as explored in previous research studies and commit those across a large range of different dosages and a large range of comminations with other things council cute which we have talked about on this podcast before but thin forsake of this discussion just really focusing on what kirkman does alone or in conjunction with the omega three fadiacis is what turns out to be the most interesting first of all firemen has been shown to be generally safe for most people at dosages as high as eight thousand milligrams per day or eight grams per day now i want be very clear i do not recommend that any one take dosages of rumen a numeric that are that high why well kircumen and numeric not only our antiinflammatory but they also can in pine on other pathways in particular hormonal pathways and in fact kirkman a c numeric can alter this synthesis of something called hydra to stostrone diydrotistostrona is involved an enormous range of different bodily functions it is involved in libido it is involved in men in beard growth and in the regulation of of number of different tissues both in the reproductive axis and outside the reproductive axis and kircumen is a potent inhibiter of d h t i do not a caution that people who take doses of kircumen and some people who are very sensitive to kircumen well even at lordosis experience reductions in d h t that lead to things that they would not such as suffixion of reductions in libido however kirkman has been shown to be effective as an anting inflammatory and has been shown to be very effective in treating differentypes of headache an particular gran headache one of the ways in which kirkman does that t is to inhibit the thing the talked about a few minutes ago which is nitric oxide or and which causes vase of dilation and in doing that can reduce the feeling that one has a lot of intracranial pressure also kirkman dosages common enormous range as i mention before dosages that range anywhere from eighty milligrams taken eighty milligrams per day that is takin for eight weeks time that is been examined it is been explored to eighty milligram dosages take alongside to an a half grahams of omega three fadiacids or images three fadiacids alone and against placebo and the general conclusion of these studies is that kircumen when taken at dosages of a bout eighty milligrams although for those of you very sensitive to kirkman probalyaus low is twenty five or even fifty milligrams per day in conjunction with although not necessarily at the same time but takin daily alongside omega three fadiacids at two and a half grams per day led to significant improvements in grain and other forms of headachemeaning both the frequency and the intensity the headaches that occurred was greatly reduced one important point about kircumen to keep in mind is that kircumen is known to inhibit something called cytochrome p for five zero that is associate with enzymatic pathway and some other things that relate to blood coagulation for people that are taking medications that are anti coagulants to prevent clotting you do need to be very cautious about using kirkman of course with kirkman or any other supplement you should always talk to your doctor a prior to including it or removing it a from your supplement regiment as you can see there are a number of different things that in addition to prescription drugs and over the counter pain medications things non stead anting lavatory drugs can really impact the different aspects of headache and different types of headache in some cases differentially now to day we talked mainly about tension type and migraine typeheadaches because those of the most common forms of headache there of course the cluster type headaches that are of neural origin it hormonal headaches and indeed some treatments such as omega threes which have been shown to be beneficial for offsetting the menstrual related headaches now in the contacts of the discussion about omega threes keep in mind that oman threes can be obtained from supplementation or from nutrition you do not necessarily have to take omega three capsule or liquid formomegathrees if you want to use megatheres to target different symptoms of headache but that probable's going to be the most efficient way to do it given that many foods do contain omega threes but it is hard to get above that one gram dosage in in fact most of the studies that we talked about to day involved getting two or even to and a half ore in some cases on this podcast with previous gusts such as doctoronopatric ice talked about the advantages of getting as high as three grams of omega threes per day which almost with certainty is going to require some external form of supplementation even for those of you that are making a point to eat a fatty ocean fish with the skin on i just one make sure that a like that before we wrap up i cannot help myself but to talk about something that i heard about on the new several years ago and it sounded too outrageous to be true but then was confirmed as accurate by one of my neurologists colleagues that is the fact the eating certain very spicy peppers can induce headache and in some cases can induce brain damage and a bear with me here ism not talking about your traditional holopanio and ism acknowledging the fact that certain people can tolerate far more spicy taste than do others some people are very sensitive to spicy some people can tolerate very spicy food and that one can build up a tolerance to spicy food by ingesting progressively spicy er excuse me spicy er and spicy or foods overtime none thewless there are these pepper eating contests out there that u while not very common do exist and people challenge each other to eat peppers of extreme spiciness there is one in particular that is refer to as the caroling reaper by the we that is not a person as far as i know that is a pepper the caroling reaper which is known to have the most potent spice of any pepper and here is why you would not want to eat the caroling reaper a few years ago at one of these peppereating contests a man eat a caroling reaper spar of the competition and suddenly experience what is called thunder clapheadache thunder clap headache is a unique type of headache very different from all the other types of headache it is not from the surface in it is not tension headache it is not even the cluster type headache of the nerve activation of the trigeminal it is actually a viper constriction of the musculature in the brain caused my the ingestion of the pepper and inflammatory response and remember that heat and spicy go to gather in these neural pathways and a bunch of different heat related and spice related pathways get activated simultaneously when one invest something of extreme spice and the blood vessels and indeed some of the a smaller arteries feeding neural tissue shut down and he experience this thunder clapheadache which is a brutal headache and a sadly in his case am permanent brain damage the loss of neuronal tissue because neuronal tissue is very metabogally active you cut off the blood supply to that tissue not only would you feel miserable u maybe even pass out but lose vision and certain brain air is flashy die off in the absence of a blood flow to those areas am we know this a more commonly as stroke i do not want to strike a fear in anybody about eating a a holopenio or even a very spicy meal from time to time but if you are not somebody who is familiar with eating very spicy foods a you certainly do not want to enter one of these a competitions and just realize that the pathways from mental and cool or spicy and hot those anchors subjective pathways these are actually nerd pathways that again originate in a cuts ends call it the sensory epithelium or skin are are hearing our eyes a and that feed that information into the body to macho a use of that information some cases motor movements of sensory mother in other cases a the information can be fed through nerve pathways that goes to the musculature and causes of arcature to either dilate or constrict these very spicy peppers causing as i just mention extreme serebreau of of the head a vast constriction and brain damage again that is not going to be a a common thing out there but none the less a i encourage people to be very cautious about the caroling reaper to day we talked about headaches and first we highlighted the different types of headachemaking it clear that understanding which headache you might be experiencing can be very beneficial for understanding which sorts of treatments ought to be best and perhaps also best avoided in trying to alleviate those headaches or prevent them from happening at all we talk abouttension headaches grain headaches hormone baseheadaches cluster headaches and dramatic brain injury related headaches we talked about different types of treatments ranging from creatine to a megathere fatiacid supplementation some urban and indeed some essential oil treatments as well as acupuncture all of which have been shown to have significant impact in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches and in many cases reductions in the frequency and intensity of headache that are at least as great as the results they are seen with nonsteroidal anti lavatory drugs again i want a highlight that none of these approaches are necessarily design to be done on their own or in replacement of prescription drugs from your physician there are excellent prescription drugs out there that your physician can prescribe for you for the treatment of headache none the less i think many people who are listeners of this pockets are interested in the things that they can do in order to inoculate themselves or at least reduce the likelihood of experiencing headache especially for people who are experiencing chronic recurring headaches such as my grain or the other forms of headache which can be debilitating thank you for going me for to day's discussion if your learning from end ore enjoying this podcast please subscribe

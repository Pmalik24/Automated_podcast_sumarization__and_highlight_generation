yesterday there is a big announcement from the house intelligence committee the house intelligence committee chair when on acts and treated out a statement suggesting that there is a serious national security threat the america public had to be made aware of this free to everybody out because you make vague national security related threats and you suggest that they are serious s enough the the see to be classified everybody starts to have a little bit of palpitations but as it turns out what exactly was happening here it appears that there is intelligence suggesting that russia is going to attempt to put news in space news she according to sienna dot come thou us has new intelligence on russia military capabilities related to its efforts to employ a nuclear anti satellite system in space according tomultipal sources familiar with the intelligence intelligence was brief to congress and keeps allies some lawmaker a made is serious enough it should be declassified and made public apparently is not immediate threat the assigns have an actually done it yet the says them is under development is not yet in orbit and its not even clear how farther technology has progressed according to one of those official there are few issues the can to governor one is what would t mean if russia actually were to do the second is why we finding out about this now not when its actually about to happen or when it has happen there is something a little bit funny about that politically speaking let us talk about what exactly this you mean first it means that presumably there would be a serious threats to america is satellite communications technology all of our satellite apology period if you were to detonate a new in space it does not exactly have the same ramifications s if you detonate a nuclear weapon at high altitude for example if you detonate a nuclear weapon at high altitude that comes o the possible threat of me reelect to magnetic pulses which could take out trial of your electronics you've seen some the con of horror movies bout that possibility if you detonate a nuclear weapon close to the ground obviously devastate the immediate area around the blast and then there also radiation clouds that travel and callossif people if you detonate in space one of the things bat a nuclear weapon is that a nuclear weapon feeds on the air around it o is the explosion requires oxygen in order for it to continue expanding if you do it in a vacuum if you do it in space it does not have quite the same impact effectively what you do is you blast out radiation and that radiation is going to significantly damage or degrade pretty much all o the satellites within the immediate orbit and is going to crate a for perennial hot spot in that place where satellites that pass through it are going to be significantly damage s good piece the lieutenant colonel tony vincent who an active duty scientist in the us air force as well as the director of advance physics courses at the air force academy and he wrote this piece back in september of twenty twenty two talking about what exactly would happen if you detonated a nuclear weapon in space and what he says is that the threat of nuclear explosions in spaces marginalized beat the potent y of their effects is not widely known and the likelihood of nuclear attack in spaces assumed to be negligible but the assumption is wrong what he says is that effectively speaking what would h happen is necking the economy it would really be more of an economic attack than see a physical attack killing millions o people for example what he rights is he says a nuclear explosion spaces just proportionately hurts the united states as the largest single investeran spates capabilities the united states nets almost two hundred billion dollars pet year of real gross output from its space ass even though military satellites are designed to with stand a harsher charged particle environment radiation hardening is not a magic cloak of invincibility military spaces assets will be degraded over time from the artificially apt radiation belt created from the clear's detonation meanwhile commercial satellites in low earth orbit will be the first to fail from continually passing through these particle hotspots most satellites of the line of sites to the newclear's detonation would be destroyed from the resulting acts rides military spaces capabilities for commanding control along with reconistant assets may function for a period following the detonation but the economic impact of degraded informational space products will be immediate another words the the things there not shielded up there can get fried almost immediately they'll degrade really fast and tall have presignificant economic impact now does that mean that the united states would then be in world for three nuclear war cause we were not talking about here is the ruffians putting presumably nuclear weapons up there in order to fire a newfrum space at the united states for example you talk met them putting a nuclear weapon up there in order to do economic damage that your state under significant pressure russia is economically speaking or ins from of security and your best indirect approach to really escalate things without killing a lot of people because if they kill lot of people than the united states really will have to on leshiuts war machine against the ruffians which we have not done far despite all foolishness to the contrary the united states has yet to one leisure its actual war machine against russia if it had we would not be tongue bout war in neucrane any more would be tongue bout something far larger and what's be real about this the united states military capacity put aside nuclear weapons is why mutuallyasure destruction exists the use military capacity is much larger than that of the ruffians not tongue at any of that right owe we are talking bout is if the ruffians were to actually fire neat the united states that is not the same thing as necking a bunch of satellites and spaces which would do economic damage and would presumably come along with in escalation of america efforts against russia short of nuclear weapons the the real question here is when you look at this capability at is that a risk of course that vista risks is that something that the guess military should game out a hundred per cent should you try to figure out ways of hardening ore satellites or replacing them with new satellites the a significantly were hardened to this risk sure but is this the kind of serious national security threat that requires everybody did go on panic mote for a full day yesterday where everybody is thinking all my got i need my bunker where is my bunker finding to do my nit open and tuck exercises from the nineteen fifties get under my last can wait for the nuclear explosion well no that is not what this threat means kind of at all which raises the other question which is exactly we was this made into a giant threat and there a lot of people who are quite suspicious of why this was made into a giant threat ism among them all get to more on this in just one

on that free brand new damson five to smartphone say saving as folks now i have a sympathy for the idea of giving more aid to you crane i do not think that a man of at has to be sixty billion dollars i do not think that that that bill that has been put for by the senate is medically wonderful bit includes ten billion dollars of aid to the got a strip which is filled with people who presumably would be in positions of administration who are quart derris the there is a lot that is wrong with that bill but as a general proposition i do not believe that the united states has an interest in allowing russia to simply walk into reeve and take over the entirely of you can i think that has significant negative she political ramifications for the united states and america citizens wit that said scaring the america people it is a green lighting an aid package by releasing in formation about a serious national security threat that lives in canada but know you cannot meter that that does not seem a great tactic to get people in your corner in fact it is pulling a alienate more people than it draws according to seamen where members of congress down play the immediacy of the threaten anti satellite weapon place an order round the earth would pose significant dangers to just newly a command in control satellites according to has christianson director of the nuclear in formation profit at the federation of america scientists earlier on wednesday the chairman of the house intelligence committee republican at myth turner of shipway sighted a fire sort on capital hell when he issued at that cryptic statement announcing that the panel had put information concerning a national a serious national security threaten when this when this notice went out by the way i was watching and my immediate mentality went to orcas there an immediate terror threat in the united states that we need to know about is there about to be a major secondary attack by the ruffians on saabaltic garlic what woatare we talking about here and then it turns out that what there talking about is the possibility of a new russia military capability that would do economic damage to the united states but would not actually launch us in to world wore three and begot b that seems a little bit overblown in from just leaking that out there to scare everybody with an hour is the re publican how speaker my johns a tempted to tamp down the situation telling reports quit there is no cause for alarm he said that you known about the in intelligence since it least canary he said we want was sure every one that said he hands a the feel working on it and there is no need for alarm him lines the committees at topdemocratsed to statement the classiest intelligence product the house intelligence committee called to the attention members last night is a significant one but it is not in fact a cause for panic the national security advise or jet sultan he said u know i cannot say that america have nothing to worry about but ism not sure why everybody a sort of panic mode just a quick politics put this to rest obviously the house intelligence a cherispigot both if that err does not say if it serious national security threat the blackener go to say thing has the potential to rase distress for some america in the simplest of terms can you tell america that there is nothing they have to worry about my owlengerms of what he describes a national security great wok i think in a way that question a it is impossible to answer with the straight yes right because america i understand that there arrange i threats and challenges in the world that were dealing with every single day and i this rest the challenges arrange from terrorism to state actors and we have to contend with them we have to contend the with them in a way were we insure the ultimate security of the america people me again when it when i see yon this sort of alarm ism emerging that makes me less likely to support a foreign bill now i again were i in congress ism not our how i vote on this fore in bill i probably vote now base on the size and scope of it and it'd want to see the underlying in formation but even where i inclined to vote for the foreign bill i now be less inclined vote for foreign boys that do not pressure tactics this apparently according to political it is possible that turned was attempting to raise alarmsbell rushes advancements in space as we have under scoring the need for was makers to approve additional a u grand the senate pass the supplemental bill including sixty billion dollars an aide for reeve and is colonelcy under a view by the house now meanwhile the white house is trying to play a bit of a different game with regard to this foreign bill they are not negotiating it not at all in fact jobidon said yesterday that he has no plans to me with speaker of the house which as were if you want to get something don on foreignaiht presumably you would want a meet with the person with whom you are going t haves negotiate to get that done forenoon piers at noon in in know join is not meting with him so johns has to sestet and hen one on one being has it in that has was that he does not yo i on o organ what that one on one meet how i mean look and i appreciate the question job but the president met with i met with obviously congressional leadership less than a month ago just less than a month ago and he made really clear how important it was to get that by partisan a negotiated legislation coming out of the senate how important it was to get that to move that forward cake why will not in you the johns than if h if he thinks that it is really important why not try to convince johns i mean first wall be good politics good good objects an he could come out to to sailisan i spoke with speaker johns and i he doesn't hae a coherent defense of his lie it is very weird that bison will not speak o him the reason the bide don't speak to him is because he thinks for some odd reason that he is winning this thing in the in the quart of public opinion and or he knows that the headline coming out of any meeting between biding and johns is likely to be about his senility not about johnson's positions on this particular issue meanwhile the bi administration is is trying to ramp up the pressure from the outside sogjusting that if you wanted to payback to bill or if you would amendments to the bill or if you ought in to pass a slightly diffrenversion of the bill its strips out certain things and adds other things that this would somehow be a giant failure john curly who is the national security spokes person for the whorehouse he says his time for my johns to show some leadership and simply put up the bill for not but that is not actually johnsons job he does not have to do the obviously he speaker of the house i do not think it is any secret some repocans on the house of acknowledge that if the sit outs of the floor the there is more than two hundred hint boats it just the to be put on the floor have you goes worked through plan be or other ways to try and get around a speaker who said unequivocally this aslant it is not about getting round the speaker to the it is about working it is about working with him and through him and he is goon to have to show some leadership here obvious thy were in to keep a consultations o our conversations the cover congress going were get where i was to get to keep engaging them but the speaker's got a choice to make hare this is is is a moment for leadership this is as the president said an inflection point and it is a it is i we got awaiting safe the speakers can be up to that moment no again i think of this a bad tactic of the action owning at the aid pass what they should do is sit down with johns he is the person they haft negotiate with began i thing a lot of this is grand standing right now our political system is entirely broken because there is more incentive in both sides gran standing than in actually getting things done and that is true across the isle pretty much everywhere because the sides hate each other much that any sign tat you want to work with the other side on anything event get eighty person of what you want is now treated as a sign of treason in some way wit is more on this in just one second first during this new years important slow down and think about how we can lift up and help other people because of t e economic to cline high on employment skyrocketing food prices too many families have little or no access to food for their kids many business is and informal economies day labor and local markets have eliminated jobs are close permanently leaving a lot of people with no fighter and money local ministry partners feeding centers hospitals an schools are experiencing rising numbers of mom nourish kids but there's a way that we can help for for forty years food for the poor has serves communities throughout the carobean and satin america through a network of trusted ministry partners and local churches food for the poor supplies non perishable food items in pooching rich meals to kids and family suffering from hunger with the help of their generoustoners the able t provide food housing health car education fresh water emerging to relief and a lot more how can you help thanks to a meal for mel match donation of eighty box can feed two children for an en tire year a hundred sixty boys would feed four kids three hundred twenty boy would feed eight kids your generous gift to day could change the courseofa life dona now text plates to fifty one five f give five or i visiting food for the word out orgslash offer that is plates to five one five five five or food for the or dot orgslash of per the democrats are simply in a demagogue this thing without sitting down and trying to see what they can get out of the republicans can john pierce she is saying that republicans are siding with gotten and around which again a was an i wish that republicans at our stimulate better there reasons for opposing the bill because you are seeing as have discussed on h show pass you days a wide variety of ration out of tom cotton whose extremely hawks extremely andiron extremely antipouten tom cotton the senator from arkansaw and he is said that he is opposing the bill because of all the pork in it and because it provide to aid to some places we do not want the aid going and i growth his ration ells and then you see some people are making the argument that basically you craned doesn't deserve defense at all and democrats our jumping on to that argument and then they are using that as to standing for the entire republican arguments the lack of unity an a message from republicans about why they oppose the bill is actually giving an opening to demo cats to claim the republicans opposed the all because t a town ladies potent house republicans are still at it right now fighting with donor to vatinipotent enteron against our defense industrial bate against dato against crane against our interest in the in the pacific lack of clarity an messaging is not republicans friend here they have now offered a bunch of different rationally for why they opposed the all the really need to come around one rational originally the rational is we oppose the bill because we want border control provisions in the bill and then when the border control provisions that came out the senate were in sufficient they said we do not want any border control provisions and the bill because hoiden has the authority do it he wants right now they well if that was the argument in the first place then why link it to border provisions in the bill and why not pass a version in the house that already has border provisions in the bills that people are can shooting in the dark it feels the republicans in the house are moving around the bull post lot just to be honest with you from the outside if you are just somebody whose watching this casually what it looks is republicans it said of we want some you grant worckit with some you craned r but with t israel a ti wan aid but we are not going to give all this money away until we secure our southern border and to the senate said onion organ put together this entire cat package including border stuff and then the republicans housel with that is insufficient and the senate was well then wills just strip out the boarder stuff ad well do just the did package alone and the the republicans whale there is not boarder stuff in there look it shall iffrenin do that though you actually ought to do in the house is doe what the house was design to do initiate the legislation initiate the legislation and safe the senate will not pass our version of the legislation not signing anything else our version is better their version is worse do that but it seems republicans cannot really even get on board for that because e internal divisions over things aid for you crane it turns out that republicans do not have unified positions democrats do democrats have unified position on pretty much all of these issues their unified position is as open borers as you can make them lots of aid to you crane the actually are in favor of eight is a they also want aid to commons that is the actual democrat unified position democrats are way better at the came than republicans republicans are by in large a fragmentary group it is a coalitional group democrats or pretty much down the line you will hyena occasional person whose crazy respected to leave who no one can get on board including democrats me the tall praise term pretend that she is diverse part of their coalition while she literally voted yesterday she voted present on a resolution to condemn homos for raping women that is what er sheeted to lead was doing it yesterday here she was yesterday all acts of sexual violence are horrific we should all be fighting to end here at home and are all around the world wall the resolution on the for to day rightfully denounces anysecual violence by heath ism disturbed that it completely ignore an await any sexual violent in abut committed by the frailly forces against palistinians especially children the you an and yous a a violence an of use committed and e chose for years for congress what did nothing never cared we all have her fan she sal the terror ton overset u she she is not an she is ridiculous terror boarding horrific human been even democrats look at recited to lead for the most part and think that she is a crazy person but they are much more unified just in terms of their governing strategy than republicans are what that means is that because republicans are unable to come up withe governing strategy because they cannot fact o unify over virtually any issues other than simply opposing what the left wants ti's a real problem bet's i pop old left dance also but i want a unified republican in agenda on the table on each of these things hat i think there is in eighty per sent can senses among republicans not the mine republicans among republicans generally for the following things enough aids you crane to prevent rush off from taking reive allowing enough time for negotiated solution that freezes the lines in place to actually be reached and enough pressure on the ruffians staid they do not feel that to morrow they area be able to run in to keep if they just hold out long enough the way the tarlatan hold out long enough nafganison than took thewhole country i think most republicans are in favor that i think the vast majority of republicans are in favor of tire i thinkthe vast majority f republicans are in favor of securing the border start with that and then put for to bill that and then force as much of that through as you can in the senate that be the way to do it but instead republicans seem to be saying things o k here is what we want these things now go try and do that and then somebody else tries to do it thy do badly and their penguin note when i can a look at it and then they say we want something different but what is the thing you want that is different what is it it cuts a way it the actual seriousness of the real republican an united speaker of the house me johns for example yesterday he said when i can get jammed into passing this foreign bill that does not secure the boarder but it was many republicans wore claiming that your bid does not need any more legislation or to secure the boarder me among them by the way she does not he can secure the border right now given the laws get r on the books you she do not need further border legislation in order to insure that the boarder is closed every one knows this including republicans that is why it is always been a little be weird to suggest that they are not going to pass a foreign package unless they get again they are bunch of arguments against the foreman package some are actual fiscal arguments that are made by people tombs massy or ran pal who suggests basically we should not to forecasts anyone i take hem a little more seriously than people who i think are fronting on that why perfectly fine with giants an entitlement programs that completely bankrupt the us economy but they are very keen not to give forbade to israel for example but there certain people granpall who is a just a small government guy wants to restructure entitlements and all the rest and says general perspective on this presumably is that we should not spend money in places we should not spend money that tat that is fine and that stand but that is not the actual position of the republican cacao to this point which has itself refused to restructure entitlements in any way shape per form did that a babies heart begins to be to just three weeks at

the best thing you are going to do today or maybe ever to pounds to fifty say we were baby start saving children to day and the confused messages coming out of the republican party it is one reason why despite the in popularity of the democratic party re publicans are cruising for bruising nonmember i thin people are whistling past the graveyard i mean the dona trumpets cruising frorbruising right now he is set to win election over hoiden if the election were hell to day ism out in the house there is a better than average shot that re publicans lose the house in nonmember because of their own in coherence in in competence here is speaker my johns talking about the bill and time at the border and again if you do not put ford your affirmative position people start to think that it is just chaos which a kind of is last night the house voted to a prove articles if impeachment against sector mayor's desperate times call for desperate measures we have to do that he is addicted his responsibility he is preach the public truss in the disregarded the laws cousin pass but but mush more has to be done of course to secure the border and what the senate produced this week is silent on that issue senator ma coal and have spoken about this in frank sessions and let me be clear here again this morning he republican let house we will not be jam to performed in to pass in a foreign age bill that was o pose by most republican senators and dos nothing to secure our own border it is time for washington to start showing some love to america porn tin to day this a good day to point this sounded listen to the america people an their needs and take action that is why house leadership will continue to govern with america interest at heart it'll get pass mist f really passim stuff for example the house did pass a clean foreign aid bill to israel but only through committee that in put it up for a fulsome yet do that forcedemocrats hand wag make democrats say what they are for right now democrats are saying what re publicans are for why republicans make democrats ay what democrats are for at this point because the truth is what democrats our for at this point is basically opening up the boarders if you take a look at what they are now considering apparently ice has drafted plans release thousands of themocrans and slash its capacity to whole detainees after the failure o the senate border bill democrats were not claiming that here is a short age of resource at the word republicans for then when republicans killed the bill democrats are now claiming that they take republicans claim seriously and now that are just going to release on mass people into the united states they are actually threatening america security because the republicans would not pass the boarderbill which by the way should be a petty god republican talking point s anotherwords you will not secure the border and your threatnot to secure the border is that if we do not join you you re going to further on secure the boarder by that that seems a a pretty good place for republicans to come around but again it is all convoluted and discombobulated in terms of to ordination at the top levels there is a lack of congressional leadership and the congressional leadership that there is is in capable of getting its own party into line in democrats are way better at this than republicans period and of story according to the washington post the by partisan borderbill republican lawmakers o pose last week out have provided six billion dollars and supplemental running for ice in foremen operations the bills demise has led ice officials to begin circulating an internal proposal to save money by releasing thousands of detainees and cutting to tension levels from thirty eight thousand beds to twenty two thousand beds the opposite of the enforcement increase is republicans say that they want now again if your telling you that they cannot find any money anywhere and that seven trillion dollar budget to maintain beds bylethr better not even full the releasing people right now into the interior after a very short period of ton that isn't amazing black man attempt by the democrats here trying to basically blackmail republicans in to going along with an open border and threatening them with an even more open boarder if they do not do its e that that is true in amazing thing in republicans would be able to run on that if these issues were disaggregated which they kind of should be ism not in favor of omnibus packages have never been in favor of omnibus packages i want each one of these measures passed on its own merits then we can decide whether the amount of a to crane is appropriate or whether it is not but seamount of high to israel is appropriator whether it is not but seamount of at tigon is appropriator and and what should be done on the boarder but sad we just to aggregate this stuff another we argue rapidly over and then nothing gets done and meanwhile the world goes on the open border goes on the word you crane goes on the war an gaze goes on wet's more on this in just one second first are you struggling with back taxes are unfired

declared the thanksgiving is actually a a day of reminiscence about the evils of european colonization of the continent and that jury forth is actually about the evils of america whites you premise an all the rest of it e superable sundae is really the only national holiday we have left which says not very much about our common culture frankly a hundred and twenty for million people watch the superbly the otherday and then there is the superable victory parade the superable victory parade happening cans city of course cause the chiefspeak to forty miners but a mass shooting broke out at the superable parade according to the sun the victory parade four the capacity chiefs second straight superable championship is now ended in tragedy police reported that chessman fired your union station and ask fans to leave eurocian in covering it yesterday joshing were looking lit of images a earlier to peace that long foremen a was moving folk surround in a certain area but it is really hard to discern exactly what is happening just paced on the images that were seeing what are you hearing from long forcemeat sources about what happened there a for there was this clearing process office that took place after these shots rang out officers trying to get i this large group of people who had been gathered for the celebration out of the area were just hearing from authorities coming in just now that it pears as though i at least two people have been taken into cecity is work pointing outright now though no indication of any any victims police said that they were working to i gather in formation to again we just want a caution had still two early determined whether reports of shots fired here actually a were related to this celebration or with whether this was just happening near by o case police are still trying figure out exactly what the motives are the fact that we do not know the identity of the tutor an the police clearly to him and we have pictures floating found a line of the identities of the shooter and the police will not release that whenever the police are very reticence to release the identity of a person implicated n to murder you can fairly guarantee the politics are coming into play according to s an end police are working to figure out who open fire and why after one person was killed in twenty more wounded at the end of the capacity chief superable victory rally children were in fact among those shot at a million people were gathered wednesday just steps from uni in station in downtown cans city three people were detained and on specified number of guns at were recovered as the officers con verge now it is fair to point out at this point the kana city is one of the more unsafe major cities in the united states they have serious criminates last year the actually had the most homicides ever in in the city of can city it is a deeply ununcsafe city at this point high rates a poverty migrates of crime pirates of single motherhood which related both of those things meanwhile this mediately sent democrats into their gun control call the this always what happens if there is a shooting its never about gangs it is never about single motherhood it is never about migrates of crime it is never bout under staffing of the police department it is always about guns as though you can just get rid of guns across the united states with a magic wand or something here is democratic represent of sent crow o colorado calling for more gun control because the cult it is always more cowbell for the democrats whenever somebody gets shot it is the full to the instrument not to fall to the person then got violence in this country is not being resolved even despite the steps that have ben taken by by long makers that wen the canisters the very small steps what means to be done well my heart is braking for cans city and and father the victims an their family i this is terrible devastating incident no doubt about it we have a crisis in our nation there there is no reason why almost forty thousand america a year should be dying it the hands are got just as the uniquely america coble i nobody else in the world hat the come that we have right now in my heart rates y thoughts an my prayers go out to the families the victims here but this and i a member congress o t legislator id a not a member of the clergy in my do is not that then end thoughts an prayers i mi dopes the legislate and to try to salt problems and that is why have been pushing very heart the try to all that and that is why people should be pushing there avers he congress and others to join with us to do the same gay m it's worth while this pent pointing out the democrats have intrudes zero legislation that would have stopped what happened yesterday in cans city zero the weapons shut we some out am out a can guns democrats have proposed no laws they would get to the confiscation which is what you require of somehow trout a can guns because would violate the second moment as they well know their baseless railing against the wind well we can talk about that or we can talk about some of the heroes wo actually try to stop this thing there is video of the shooters trying to flee and members of the crowd tackling them which is amazing stofpmean again there are real everyday heroes out there heres for that footage can see the shooters trying get away and a and people on sidelines ears tackling them and subduing them can that is that is heroism when you see a mass shooter and your first move is we got a tackle this person into do that person good for the civilians who decided to get involve and ta and and help and then the police came late and arrested again the police are vary understaffed in kana city here is an interview with one of the men who tackled the alleged assuror s hims pall confers on i was bothering saying you o stop him cha our calm you no tackle whatever and he is just s just berlin runner and i know where i hear that gat hollering some cycle call om right heroin i just i do not think about it i just a reaction i did not had to taxi was his just do it si went to go hackman another gentleman i

news from it jobidons it senile challenge which is what is happening for his twenty twenty four reelect apparently your member during his terrible press conference at la it week cordon got very angry a very angry because of the special councils suggestion that he could not remember one hundred and he did a whole stake met how terrible it was that he was even asked the questronmember how day youvenask the question how do deary hoo deary raise that remember that memory said that last wee does last ride i as last thus actually remember that it was it was great well now in emerges that actually he was never asked that question why to bison came up because jobidon will bring him up in any context as his get out of jo free card for literally everything according to enemy sinews quote her never asked that question according to two people familiar with first five hour interview at the president over two days last october it was the president not her or his teen who first introduced bobidon's death they sad don raised his son'sdeath after being asked about his work fly at a virgin rented home from twenty sixteen to twenty eighteen when got rider was helping him write a memory about losing to to brain cancer in twenty fifteen investigators had a twenty seventeen reporting showing that began had told the got radar he found classified stuff in that home bison began trying to recall that period by discussing what else was happening in his life there the that point in theinterview he appeared confused about wen to died don got the date correct but not the year presumably he was trying to use that as an excuse for why he was confused and upset but it was twenty seventeen and actually to had died already a couple of years prior and was bison who raised it and then blamed her for asking the question you things are not going well for job he happens to be by the way just an awful i mean i i say it all the time he really is at garbage president in fact jobidon to day announced that the department of homeland security is going to shield palistinians in the united states illegally from deportation and loosen work requirements to bundle them into america jobs he provided most palistinians in the united states with quote deferred in forcemeat departure for least eighteen months memorandum in sure that most palistinians cannot be to ported from the united states over the next year and a half also d thus is in is advice to h offer employment for non citizens whose removal has been deferred for the duration of such de feel and loosen regulations for palistinians in the united states on efhonstunvees as can hold a medical chops if you overstinorvisa by you palicinian now join wants to keep you her indefinitely now all of his again is a panda to overborne michigan that is what he is doing he thinks he is going to lose michigan and the only way the hes can a maintain michigan is by pandering super duper hard on the israel palistinian issue which presumably is also why he is now attempting to push forward a on e quit peace plan that would effectively amount to endless war in the region b tuna laterally proposing a palistinian states to another word he gets a killed twelve hundred just and o get a state is the new logic from the bid administration there was no palistinian state prior that because there is no actual governing body in the westbankorn the got a strip that is not a gin terror group they're no actual borders the is actual con a me there is novel rule over those arias in any serious sens by any of those governing bodies which is why but kill twelve hundred news in jobidnall give yo state is logic according to the times of israel the united states in several are partners are preparing a details plan for a comprehensive pieacstil between israel and palistinians that includes a firm time line for a palistinian state now ism not sure exactly how you would have a firm time line for a palistinian state given the fact that you would have to hit markers for that time line such as not teaching all your kids to murders many just humanly possible which is exactly what is taught in palistinian schools unfortunately officials told the post that they hope to make the plan public once israel commossegree to a temporary truces aims at allowing humanitarian aid in toga and freeing the hostage is still held by the air group in the strip during that report during the pass steps would be taken toward implementation of the proposal including forming the antrum palistinian government that could also rule over gossip good luck on all the pul pi in the sky nonsense but that is job the stick pinky nonsense he is incredibly incredibly bad at this particular job meanwhile in the funniest story of the day member rather dollar rather dolasall was the lady who pretended that she was black for years and years she ad changed her name to n catchy deal after being publicly smeared and actually exposed not smeared as rather dolls are she is a white lady from lie canvas and shed pretended to be a black lady and then she'd actually become the head of the spit can washington and doubly mayor something and then she is exposed for all that an became a national punch line obviously well then she became a teacher and now elementary school in arizona because that is who you would invite is a crazy person to teach her small children elementary school apparently well it turns out she ben fired again why whet because she had and only fans account it turns out that not only is she a crazy person maskuratings a person another race also she is prostituting herself on of events that is great according to the school district we only learned of miss nekatchy deals only hands at social media post yesterday afternoon she is no longer employed by the catalog o foothills school district apparently i mean talk about a life story here dial i do love that we just you rapidly go with peoples nu names genders a the respect really lost hell teaching african studies at eastern washington university and launch an account on only hands in twenty twenty one after struggling to find work she made six hundred post in the year since and shared hundreds of papally told videos and photos that that is t a life story that is going very poorly that that particular life story best of luck to rather dolasall in all of her newest efforts meanwhile dona trump his legal drama continues the true state prosecutions or apparently reaching a a find of turning point in two separate cities you have got the the court going in new york and all have the court going in tanto georgia according t signed trump is expected to show up in court in new york for procedural hearing ahead of that trial over the hush money payment to stormy angels remember that this is plan brag's idiotic prosecution of dona trump for a for a state charge on the basis of violation of federal campaign finance law all about how he should have declared as a campaign finance expenditure his payment to stormy angels or some such nonsense it is out it is easel garbage see can be in new york at that evidentiary hearing and then meanwhile a judge is holding an evidentiary hearing in futon county georgia because district attorney fanny wills was stopping the prosecutor whoosh hired who had no acturalprosecutorial experience according to the associate o press should district attorney fanny willispire move from the gorge election interference case against dona trump because of her personal relationship it a special prosecutor lawyers were set to battle over the questions bring hearing in aslant on thursday wills the d a for gorge's fusion county had hired nosed lawyer named than washes help investigate whether trump in his allies committed crime twill trying to overturn his twenty twenty election loss in the state weight is led the than prosecuting the case since an indictment was returned in august if she were removed it would seriously diminish the chance is of trump's conviction in that particular case not only and you look a political prosecution not only that would certainly delay the trial to be on the election well done fanny wills for effectively getting trump off in that particular caveman that miss in that cases also a ochery the the the legality behind the case makes no senses we explain many times on the shop but fanny wills is not that that that is letting trump off to hook tare it is that fanny wills was stumping the guy that he hired and with the tartar money that that that is a bigger problem and i thing the democrats hopes that donate trump is going to somehow be defeated by his legal cases i i find that very hard to believe and right now if the election were held to day dona trump wood win that is the reality of the situation right now when you look at the general election dona trump is up by a point and a half in the real cropozixpulling average it is lot closer than should be considering his running against o dead person but the last several poles have trump up four five two widen up one trump up one tie very very close election obviously but if dona trump is within one point of jobidon the likelihood is that he will win the election eitherway remember he lost to killer canton in the popular vote by a significant percentage an he still won the election at this point in time should be worth noting in last two election cycles jobidon was up almost six points in the real copozix pulling average and killer into an twenty sixteen was up almost five points in the real cropolitic pulling average meanwhile dona trump to day is up a point and a half bad news for democrats already is the rest of the so continues right now we will be jumping into the

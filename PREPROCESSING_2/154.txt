a quick warning there are curse words that are in beeped in today episode of the she if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our web sit this america life dot a work soda safari begins each day with a six a m walk around naira it the only thirty minute of his day he gets from half for meals and meetings and the has of his enormously stressor job begins his job be now we in charge of getting tracks filled with humanitarian aid it ta gas during the current war it does is for big america on profit called an era that see aid into gas of decades but since the war every day their bottle necks and wed just to go challenges with all the different governments and agencies and militaries and aid groups above i toot him at the end of a very long day of this and and i made this is a sign of his diplomatic skills he seemed calm who he de could not not ask him about it maybe that just of farad but it is tilt is a farad ti had o tat he i i learned the hard way to hold myself together i think i break down after it things the a now i get in that you get it you get it together i doctors tat on twice just before the recencies fire between israel and has and then during the sees fire as interest in tacking to him because the stakes of any paws in fighting seem high for aid workers him for this hes fire little humanitarian are was actually making it into gas and average if only fifty five trucks to day according to the can remember at that point already one point seven million people in as would displace from their homes afters had been operating without an amnesia that if pain colors and based medicines food an water where in short supply pas in fighting would made a chance to find get stuff through and i wanted to know how he was preparing andwhat he hope you happen an e answer was about his preparations his team an gaze was going round doing with a easily been doing for weeks trying to figure out what the greatest needs for for incense in the schools and other buildings that are now the main shelters for over a million people in gas these are incredible over crowded people keeping on the ground everywhere just to give you a bit of an image come are sleeping inside the rooms inside the school shelter and the men are sleeping in the yard of the school tut also a lot of families are in the streets and its winter it is freezing and that is when our human gaze was we need dents we need mattresses we need blankets and that is what have been doing here and immediately we started procurement offers s in get the first thing i did s that went to the fort job an the nation the the fort job and i told them how many tents do you have because there the for camping there are ready a there we can procure immediately but in by these tens as there was a problem with them and tons end the problem i should remind you that even before this war for years now israel is controlled nearly everything that wen in and out of gas gas surrounded by giant fence is part of that israel restricted specific certain medals and chemicals and fabrics from entering gas because they said they did not one them to fall into mama's hands get turned in weapons against israel or find some military use this an official wist of restricted stay it with a tend is the fabric a there certain time of fabrics that are not allow and then we were ones to with has materials that is tot aloud we meed the denied our own fence and then we reedit to fine an tender who is willing to breaks and on certain specification from crowds immediately i mean this wander i met him on the same day e and then i go back tom after to or hours i ma toad i need two thousand fence wee and then immediately six car robs an cairn the start producing these pens and those woful be done what day were expecting the delivery next week next week maybe in time for the sense fire may be not we were talking two days before the sense fire started ut at ism's organization an near had hoping of other stuff that was ready to go and enter gaze and there is only one place to do that the rough crossing from egypt into gaze it tat ism said the trucks could be delay there for days while egyptian and his rally officials each inspect the trucks to make sure that they are in fact filled with humanitarian ad it is never clear how many of these trucks will make it through or f many of get through is your used to do these inspections at big check point called karma shalom there was fully equipped to handle lots of inspections but that a checkrow has been close since the war started the rough crossing just is not set up for pivot in trucks and satay and other people trying to get humanitarianade into gaze understand all of that but still do not understand the delays they say from day to day seems arbitrary to them a just pesto day seventy nine trucks got in but to give you a comparison on a normal day before the war it would have been five hundred trucks to day it is showing that only seventy nine trucks yesterday got no and some days there were zero trucks going in sat i why i so few trucks getting through this is a question an arab an asking all alarm a we we cannot find than sir we do not know the answer we reached at repeated a to is rally authorities to find out more trucks are not getting through the one check point that they we out into gaze but we never got a reply once ta ism's trucks full of ad get into gaze there is another problem before the sense fire when we first talked other trucks inside gaze wins must take the aid where it needed to go inside gaze and those trucks need fuel i fuel been lacking for over two weeks there is no fuel in side gaze and her have been very creative we ben us controls wo en using ya an li thought an do not es horses to deliver the a a wen i may you using horses and tons to deliver international ad this is wat what is needed imagine there is no fuel imagine the size of gaze the see fire started the day after thanksgiving though ares that is not how the participants view of that picture do the number of trucks crossing in to gaze with humanitarian ad rough we tripled i taught to sit om again on the seventh day of the sense fire he last day he told me his organization anear got more aid delivered in those seven days and it had in the two months of war before that that is that is actually what makes we really sad is sense we can get more and more ad in but these inspections doles om as if nonmember twenty nine at least five hundred and seventy two trucks were waiting on the run connecting the election and mister et crossing am is for the ready in section of each truck this hours sat ism did your tents get across not yet on yet be action ways he said guard issues he told me that we ready next week a day after that conversation the see fire ended now it is some care exactly what it is on to be next week and we there is can be ever get stop through he first night the wore resumed my coworker when ever producers making me and i spoke we dulia tumor direct one communications at unit the you and palestine refuge agency which runs the shelters across gaze that are housing now over a

few months ago ducktail was hit with a couple of big financial set backs one after another there were some federal money that did not come through that they have been counting on also some money the state says it over paid them and now wants to take back those two hits but the hospital over six hundred thousand dollars in the whole add to that all the things that can make it hard to keep any small rural hospital open small patient population and none of the specialties that can bring in a lot of money cardiac care neurology also insurance does not cover cocktails costs most of the hospitals patients are on medicare or medicate the hospital breaks even with medical o patients the decade they lose money but they also lose money on private insurance because small hospitals do not have the leverage to negotiate decent reimbursement rides the way big hospitals do him says buckle needs one point five million dollars to make it through the fiscal year he and the leadership team at

closure at he have that seen h editor on our program coming out o was sure there a e places where people hope that the federal governments an a swoop in millions dollars and fix everything but what have you are the federal government what he hope for the answers from some actual federal and please it is in a minute chico bubagradio when our program continues this magical if more glass each we can to show wench whose ha theme firing you variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day show the cavalry is not coming stories about all the things you do some them clever some them angry when you realize that no one is going to show up to rescue you we have arrived to at two of our program at too give me your tired your poorer your huddled assays or done some one aigret to the united states from another country the her there ware bunch ways to do that but the big one for people wanted to cross from the southern border into reunited states is the asylum program fro most we be that is the only legal pathway every one stay here asylum means not just coming here get a it a job or have a better life in some way they have to show that they are running from some kind of danger or persecution back home this all comes out of a password or two ideals on this law this idea that the united states can and should give refuge to people fleeing oppression an the president tromp as you probably remember it became about harder to get asylum we destroy back then during his administration about the people who do the first screenings of asylum applicants at the united states citizenship and emigration services you see i ask these people are asylum officers and back down they told us that from their point of vie we president trump was keeping out all kinds of people shut been aloud into the country and they said they yearned for some cavalry to ride in some new president to change things save the day now of course they have new president in jobidon and things have not gone the way these officials hope for whet are producers not you amen to to a whole different much of veuaseas officials resow these peoplewho work in the asylum and refuge branches i got this window into the whole emigration system they you do not usually get is not it let me start the story the way we have to start many asylum stories by explaining what the here the people who work in these jobs actually do the once i talk to were all asylum officers at some point and here's what that looks they sit in an office on the phone for hours with asylum seekers in an interpreter on the line they are asking questions hearing brutal stories from people who recently cross the border about what their fleeing teniswell in political actors escaping the government cammerunians fleeing virus saw adorn families escaping gangs the officers have to determine whether the sirens er talking to could get legal protection here under outlaw and whether they could face harm or even death if they got sent back to their home country it is not for the faint of hart ut it is more for the bleeding hard crowd than the enforcement crowd these are not the toughly cops off in fine in the border patrol lots of the word for the peace quarter lots of people within emigration law background or human its the understand that their decisions in these cases can dictate whether some one lives or doings and every one of them have ever talk to feels the weight of that it is a moral duty to them not just a in dixie after for years of president trump dismantling the asylum and refuge programs and calling their work a con they felt desperate for a change and then in the months before the twenty twenty election in a random press event job bide and cut their ear for the first time because of the way he started talking about asylum sewers therefore our moral stand in the world mar our history girls a safehave for refuges asylum seekers no seen silence an pressed persecution my lore we have never we have never made a asylum seekers say seek asylum outside the big steamer making asylum seekers weighed outside the was that is a trump policy that these you espials workers hated to then this was a signal began was nodding at them paying attention to there corner of the sand box when job bide an one their hopes were modest they knew migration was never one of his big issues but hey at least he would set things back on a better course well at we swing back to when we have ne abomument suasion get a return ton normal s in a return to and emigration sister tents that a bad manywens e were not n a go out of our way to her people that is an asylum officer om on a call mark not his real name also not his real voice you will hear voice actors instead of the emigration officials themselves imitating their voices and inflections as closely as possible because these folks are not sidles to talk to the press they could get fired that is also why i cannot tell you a lot about mark or any of the others she will here what i can say is than mark is precise hand over all kind of a carrion one side an one mark says he and his colleagues expected that pretty early on he would end something called till forty to title forty two was a public health order that had basically close the southern border to prevent the spread of con it would allowed yuan border officers to expel migrants back into mexico with no legal formalities no questions asked hours after they were cot the trump administration put it in place on the pendamicet a slum and refuge officers thought this was illegal because it prevented people from even being able to ask for asylum mark and his coworkers were easy trump activated it bid could just the activate the person i talk to who was the most optimistic about the whole thing he say you a s i s official ism going a call gorge he is been at the agency through many administrations he watches the first weeks of the began administration role by nothing but gorge was not bothered i the i ran in to to worker and we're li oh these advocates a all man that we haven't anta title forty two yen but yow we least neat few weeks to plan i that right i i understand they cannot do it immediately but they will do it soon enough it will be fines how did it go not well not rayon not well aye i a i would say i started to get and stricter concern in her us spacious around the first time they have the opportunity to and title forty two and the decidedeexten this was back in twenty twenty one around august back then we had a huge wave of people showing up at the border lots of them thought okay trumps gone widen sounds more friendly may be now i have a chance to get in by keeping title forty two presideinbiting could keep them from crossing into the us and ever you a s s official like talk to heard the same story gorge did about why the administration made that choice political operators at the white house be came cadence that it was bad for the president for the the we to show what would be characterized as a as at the border i ask the white house of this is why the president kept title forty two going and not public health concerns they said it was the ad see call not the precedents the you a s s workers i talk to did not buy this in fact gorge remembers how the began administration doubled down on this argument when the a can u sued the government overtime forty two and then you hade them making these absurd public statements that were meriting the things the trumpetmenistration sand about title for to wit democratic laughed at and this mes when trump was adonis but when that at woo oh we have nothing do is this is a see to this is related upon else not i migration you know keeping title forty two going as long as they did was at what the hell moment for the ounce i s workers a turning point seeing all these people trying to seek asylum stuck outside our borders because of title forty to made these workers feel angry and lonely but they were the only witnesses to abridge collapsing well everyone else the other way this next person it'll call less she works in refuge services she was also the only official who did not swear during our interview i mean i stopped talking bet with my friends and family to be honest you did yet cause all it does his work all it would do is working me up into a frenzy a frustration and they can only listen to it for much especially when they all two were under the illusion that oh but is not it much better oh we understand remember how horrible it was under the trumpedministration but is not it much better and you want to say yes it is better it is we are not under full level destruction attack but also promises were made and there not happening and people are still living an refuge camps on the southernside of the border and no one is doing anything to help them you just you feer you cannot talk to the regular world about it any more in the end it took president by an over a year to try to end title forty to and when he did it texts sued and styptic title forty to remain in place until may of this year it was there through half of present and bi days term in those first two years of the began administration lots of people were being turned away at the border but at the same time in credibly lots of other people were being allowed in mostly vinisuellens and humans the caraguones some nations more than a million migrant were allowed into the us in two years why did this happen take menisuella for example the us did not have good diplomatic relationships wit ten nesuella we could not live minisuellens back to their country when they showed up at the border and mexico did not want them waiting on their side which meant the bide administration was stuck they had to vigor out what to do and the solution they came up with for vinisuella and all these countries is temporary all the emigrants they came in the more than a million most or here in temporary permits of facially allowed to stay for a while till things in their home country school down at first this was can have been at hawk thing the bide administration did a bid under the rat are just to relieve pressure at the border there had been dangerous over crowding at border partial stations later this became a more official program the proudly point to as proof that they stand up for humanitarian ideals but one of the officials i talk to pointed out temporary status can funnel a lot of people away from getting asylum which is permanent whatever their intentions by canary of this year the bide administration had mad two man parallel tracts for immigrants tons of people coming in with temporary statuses tons of others kept out by title forty two and that is one the sexy s announce the public heart crisis was officially over title forty two had to end which is great news for these quassias workers right is what they been waiting for as they sit in their offices they wonder what the plan is how their nipples to handle what may be large numbers of new asylum applicants the last day of title forty two keeps looming closer and closer and these workers are hearing nothing then some rumblings ad then when i heard that there were in a drop on the rule i was of course they are the new rules spelled out for the first time how the bid an administration wanted to run asylum at the southern border for now an original policy of their own to handle the crowds of people they expected would cross the border one's title forty two ended the rule is called c l p which stands for car convention of lawful pathways the rule was not just any rule it is a swims army night many different rules all rolled into on but the part that sued out to these uasiaas workers the most is that under the rule in order to even apply for asylum you have to show that you already applied for asylum and got denied in at least one country you have pass through before getting to the us have you came up from south america you went thou panama then costrel then nicaragua then honduras then ell saw the dor then guatemala then mexico you would have to apply for asylum and be denied in at least one of though if you do not have proof of this you are not eligible for asylum hear does not matter what you are flinging your home country your government could be act give we trying to kill you an your family because you're political actives clear cut asylum clam not relevant any more you basically will not get asylum in the us because these other countries did not reject you first they you as c i s workers i talk to or floored by this they were well that is basically something precedent trump try to up in place but the sort struck it down quickly said it was a legal and now here was preset in bite bringing it back or something that looked a lot it it was mind blowing it is the same yet the other twisted around the corners and the people who had to work on writing that rule i mean yes i can even imagine to be the one who is told he are we did that rule what we know that it is legal but let us try this one now this sis are clearly unlawful at this point gorge sticks out a thick book very official looking it is a bound copy of the emigration an nationality act he just happened to have around the house as one does i mules she's rebel asylum statue any alien who is physically present in the united states or who arrives in the united states wether or basically this says any one who arrives here in any way legally or illegally can apply for asylum and whit circumvention of lawful pathways is yes sure you can you can apply but were an say your not i reached out to one of the administration officials who over sea seal pee assistant secretary for emigration and border policy last unit's lethal i asked him how seal pe is different from president trumps asylum ban which had been ruled a legal the trump administration a porch to this one to into categorical man on asylum at the land border he is saying there band was catagorigon it apply to every ones no exceptions a were not denying asylum categorically to anybody that the landholder and that is just a fact n something that is important for your audience to understand what we have done is a sensually area we we calla reputable presumption and that is important because it is in fact reputable and that means to people a cross between the proof entry and have a compelling reason why they needed to do that can rebut the presumption foresee many people do that in practice i reputable presumption that means zeal p starts off assuming you are ineligible for asylum but do not worry you can prove it wrong you can rebut immediately write there on the spot when you talk to an asylum officer prove it wrong and then put it is gone does not oblige you any more there is a list of ways to rebut the rule first it does not apply to unaccompanied miners or if you are sick and you need medical care that is an exception or if you are being traffic another thing vindicates the rule or if you are in imminent danger if some one is actively trying to kill you there at the border that is an exception for quote extreme and imminent threat to life for safety which all one's reasonable enough but the officers i spoke with and people ti talk to who work with migrants along the border they all say it is really really ridiculously difficult to get one of these exceptions a re bottles an attorney i talk to from the tea civil writes project that she is known of cases where the medical emergency we battle is hard to get it takes long the migrants have gotten sicker and sicker and have died waiting for it mark says that when he is interviewing asylum seekers an trying to apply these seal pe rules he does not where it leads him and who he and up rejecting the consequences a getting things wrong the it makes are extremely hat when you get it wrong people will die and it is not u purely the stopping hysterical that is i fact it is life for death decisions every say one of them you cannot afford to get them wrong and what sea p does is it forces you to make in correct decisions an you have to take that seriously the latest numbers from the government tell us that only sixteen per cent of asylum seekers who were caught crossing the border we are able to prove they qualified for one of the seal p exceptions or rebuttal's which means eighty four per cent we are not able to prove it they could be deport id many you as i as workers complain to leadership about this from the start that is why they hated seal p the response according to gorge y know some of you may disagree with this one it may make you feel uncomfortable boy on this is a map and then the sat he can't quit but they really do not care they really it that the really channeling their in er mar sorts and do not let the donor it you were the dog shown o edition at the end of the day they are not interesting you meal or legal objections shut the fuck up put your head down tho which our told he we i think of the administration were telling the story of seal p they would not start with the new restrictions on asylum at the border they probably emphasis a different part of the rule it is a whole new way there enticing people to cross at the official border stations in an orderly way instead of something more dangerous waiting across a river ore walking through the desert it is an a yes they have an a it is called c b p one and they government has big hope for it when the bide administration rolled out seal p they announce that this a was the way every one in the southern border should apply for asylum this was going to be the new system you can get an appointment to enter the u s and it is signs you a port of entry to show up to at a specific time come to mathamotos on october thirtieth at six p m and as an incentive to encourage you to use the a if you download it and use it and you come in and ask for asylum all the other seal p rules that keep people out they do not apply to you it does not matter whether you ask for asylum in other countries before you got here you do not need to be in a medical emergency you r have someone chasing you threatening your life it is a golden ticket use the a apply for asylum period and i know how bonkers this sounds on the one hand president biding created this we a trumpet policy that makes it practically impossible to even ask for asylum in some ways but on the other hand you can side step all of that and just come into the united states if you have a phone and can dow lodanap this has inscribe of the carrot and stick approach they went to reward people for using the see be p one a and coming in through official ports of entry and they want to penalize everyone else and having snap does seem smart migrants all have phones they saps all the time but ism sure the s next part will not surprise you the a did not work we from the very start of seal p this past may it went off the rails first of all they were not a lot of appointments available about seven hundred and fifty a day for the whole border migrants would wait for the appointments to open up try to get one and the a would crash there ware error messages that people did not understand that prevented people from making appointments one that just said fraud that continues to this day one review of the aptest reads this a is crap though half the review seem to be right wing roles posting things open door policy thanks abandon or come on in farrovia p ads for all the drug smuggling human trafficking criminals that need in you stomping ground when the a did work there were the daytime a women who works at a shelter and rents told me she talk to a family that had been waiting for four months for their appointment same with mathemortos andtihuanum the problem with waiting besides that it sucks to wait is tat the car tells a out the border looking to robin kidnap asylums seeker o er stuck there many people just make a run for it without their golden ticket they cross the border anywhere they can mark laid out for me pretty typical case that he says he gets often for example you are hanging out mexico your planning on getting yours see p one appointment but they go snapped up every day you are waiting round and then in the months that you are waiting in mot more els where or else you get kin that how formansom they may calls to your family members using yourself on asking for power much money otherwise i can kill you you family scrounges up whatever they get to pay them they pay them you get release to et y you dumped of on the side the road somewhere how no money because they have robbed you they taken all your travel documents this they can you know everything that you had with you how are you going to support yourself in this border town while you wait to get a see p one appointment on the fond that you longer have you sat i cannot do this anymore i got across in the united states mark ask me did i think that migrant was an extreme danger enough to get a rebuttal to the seal pea rules and be allowed to apply for asylum it sounds a well no that is not how works that person is not eligible for thaterybuttle because you half to demonstrate the your life or safety was in mining danger at that exact moment when you cross into the united states unless that cartel for whoever kin a to you is nipping on your wheels as you dive in the water you are not eligible for thaterybottle this is that you asiiias worker i will call gonna she is been doing this job for a while it sort this whole completely nonsensical idea that yo you have to be actually running through the desert and you do not try to wage your way across the red grand while bullets are flying over your head rag i mean is is if you these laws and ideas are written by people who have watched way too many world work too movies for somite eposes of narcs or see ye yet too many evidence of narc her i do not know but that is not that is not how works stepping back and looking up the big picture most of the people entering from our southern border are not you seem the seep p one a enoctober it was about a hundred and eighty eight thousand people who got copy to been ports of entry overseas about forty four thousand who use the a which means most people face the restrictive rules that make it hard to ask for asylum they you as seas officials they spoke to said under president bite the way see is written it sounds they are all these was you can still apply for asylum but in practice it is just as bad as it was under president true because seal p deny many people the chance at asylum at all i asked assistant secretary curious netty if president bines policy is just as restrictive as present trumps what we are doing is they completely different an balance to preach to the city that again includes an unprecedented extension unlawful powers n processes for people to con to the country whilst this on put son common sense or o constraints on o the abilityoclimsion at the border for individuals at the landholder between portent wo do not have a compelling reason vanity to cross in low we between heirportsent but in practice what were hearing on the ground is that people who that it is incredibly hard to prove the exceptions and rebuttal's that people that try to prove an exception a rebuttal that has to do with medical emergencies for example have died waiting for such an exception a rebuttal and does not it in effect at the end does not it to qualify a lot of people from even asking for asylum just really reaches try n one reason on the record here at that point assistants secretary curious nets press person interrupted us they agree to answer only one question about seal p on the record i saw this is a normal follow up to clarify they disagreed they said they were limited in what they could say because of on going law suits about the rule the keep phrase in what he said was a balanced t approach theadministration officials have talk say that this mishmash of new rules and exceptions to those rules and everything else have described they say when you put it all together you will see them trying to balance the humanitarian principles they say they hold dear but the fact that they need to head out dubious asylum claims i think what is happening is there is a humanitarian crisis many people arriving at the border and a back rogue of nearly three million emigration cases already that the administration had to figure out something to do with the tens of thousands of people showing up each week and theirs scared of looking soft on immigration tut they also do not want to be any emigrant they do not think of themselves as any emigrant they ended up with this contradictory lodge patch letting in over a million people for humanitarian reasons but that is just temporary relocation or setting up seal p rules the are both deeply restrictive and surprisingly unrestricted of course it is amass steal p is surely being challenged in court in two separate federal cases the seal use going the bid an administration in to saying that shape makes the two hard for people to apply for asylum in violation of the law the asylum officers union has filed two amebas preens one for each of the law suits saying they agree they represent about one thousand asylum officers assistant secretary units netty told me the administration is confident the rule is leave the there is one phrase at one of the officers gonna used that stuck with me she said the overrun window has shifted which means the window of political acceptability has changed the outpost have moved because of trump strategy on asylum where the goal according to gonna was to kill the asylum program allow no one in give no protection and when the widen administration created we l p tjoanna thinks they cosigned on the idea of let us just not any more just with a different tone if you look at it now that you have seen the bided administration in action in asylum what what ringster you yes his is they actually have made some changes heres where it is different and here is where it is the same as how it was note trump er well they do not pull babies away from mothers arms i guess you get a sicker are i cooky ye for you they talk about it different lay ah that is really important democrats do not call country she hall countries they just they treat that shat hall countries but i think what the began administration you have a pretense at protection that the trump people did anatto there is something just like rid do you think it is worse than it asunder true i mean it is very bad and very similar but it is a different kind what you mean a different kind do what is what is worse some one whose direct in doing something bad some one who dresses up a little nicer and puts a better face on it but still does pretty much the something i think we will look back on the first two years of the bid administration in the future n identify this as an inflection point when we kind of point stop the pretense of having an a asylum system that comports is our legal obligations under international and federal law may be that is the real by parties an agreement at this point this system that we built to function of their own idealistic cavalry to protect people who are fleeing for their lives both parties seem to have decided that we do not need to do that anymore is that of looking at why your coming to the us and judging that on its merits now we will block you because of how you came to the us whether y use less to be pe one up whether you ask for asylum from countries along the way if you are the most vulnerable the most then need a rescuing our asylum system as it stands say no longer saving you sacrament is anytime woman to you pressed in helped us out as a consulting editor on this story on nest

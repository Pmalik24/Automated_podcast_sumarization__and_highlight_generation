and you dad there to protect your mind to e seventeen year old girl start swimming into the open ocean nans of summer different from what she would planned on that is in a minute nchicaco have a ratio when he program continues is medical life my re glass to day's programmed of course stories of people and as so here not just people who get thrown off the very cure course tat their lives were on and then have to invent what there going to do next we have arrived at at two of our programmed a too sink hernia swimmers son the social when you get off course there are all kinds of dangers at face it just are not there when you are a dry land we be judge as a story when you see some of that she is tost of this is love podcast we reversion of the story first down when link was a tea nature she was a competitive long distance ocean swimmer six days a week she would wake up early to swim it a beach nearer house in southern californium stoically she would been back and forth in the deep water between a really long pier and a stone jetty she was training for a twenty one mile swim it was march and i was seventeen years old and i was coming for a morning win it was before the sun had risen and the water was pitchblack i started swimming between the kibosh pier and the jetty a of my plan was just to go in and and stretch out and swim for an hour and be done and then go hang out with my high school friends but and i started swimming and as i got close to the pier i felt the water holding out around me meaning i could feel something underneath pulling before felt some thing really big was swimming below and in my mind up thinking all my gosh is it a seal like know it is to big for seal sicko was it a dolphin no it is not a dolphin and then i that on my got could it be a sharp what is this below me in this is most people's biggest nightmare on earth that they would be swimming in the later and that they would feel something large underneath them i think that is normal to be scared a me when you cannot see anything below but you can feel something and you can also not just feel the motion but the presence of something but when you do these long swims you have to keep your mind under control because you free out than you are out of a swim i kept talking to myself and sang o ka you are not sure what it is just move closer to shore i i swam closer a sure but this thing kept swimming round near me the water kept getting hollowed out and i realize that whatever was there was still there and it had not gone away and i was just ready to turn and race out of the water but there was an old man name steeve who worked in the bat shop on the were and he sort of watched over me and watch what was going on with the water and i could see him standing under a light on the peer waving toward me to come to swim out to him and he yelled at me and said let come here there is a baby whale swimming with you yo see you stick your head out of the watering he is waving and he and he says there is a baby whale yes he said a baby wale and i really have never seen a baby wale in the while before he told me that the baby whale had lost ho mother and needed to stay with the baby whale why did you need to stay with a baby whale why could not you get out he was afraid that if i turned to go to sure that the baby whale of fall me and possibly could run aground but he also thought that know make the baby whale will just swim off and be totally lost his i dead was that you just need to stay with the bad whale it can be dangerous for baby whales to be suppurated from their mothers there predators around sharks and also young whales are totally dependent on their mother's milk to survacht a while back there is a story about a baby whale getting lost he tried to suckle on a yacht that sense of being lost wit something i related to with ha baby whale is it is it easy as a swimmer to get off course yes end i think the thing that most people do not know about when you are in the ocean if you get lost and you try to continue going you start swimming ana huge circle and that makes it more difficult for any one to find you and the mother may not find the baby ever at this point instill could not see the baby wale beneath her in the water she only saw bits in pieces of it swimming you could only see part of them me you could not see his whole head or face ye to saw the the on his back and the baby gray wale than surface and he swam over toward me ye is scary it was cry cause he was big and i was not are how to deal with him i mean how do i inter act with a whale serve though was calm and and a sure that it was just find to be in the water with a baby that i thought well he knows he is this old guy that seen out here for ever and he knows everything about the ocean i will do what he told me to do as and it'll just stay out here with his wale until we find his mother step got on the radio to all the fishing boat captains and life guards along the coast and told them to keep their eyes out for a large gray whale traveling north he told line to swim back towards the jetty once she got to the jutty she turned around and swam back to the peer again the baby stayed wither we were sort of side by side or he was right underneath me or i very very close and at one point he just rolled over and looked right at me and it was just the most a masingthing in the world because i felt he sees me and i see him and were together of bag is a baby gray wales eye it was sort of i the sides it'd say o a plum or a orange it it is large and it was dark dark dark brown almost black did you try to talk to him were you talking to him yes yes yes get i as as if he would understand but end i told the baby o say and that things things will work out and well find his mother and ism thinking i my gash he cannot understand my work but maybe understand the feeling or thy intention they swam for an hour then another hour line started to wonder if it was even possible for the mother to find the baby how he find something in the ocean she got scared that the mother might never be coming she got scared that the mother could be dead maybe the mother was dead some people had gathered on the pier with steeve to watch what was going on and the fishermen out in boats were all talking to each other on the radio one of them reported seeing the large gray whale swimming near an file rig about a mile and a half off shore and then as though the baby wale was listening to the radio it abruptly turned and started swimming in the direction of the file rig normally line would not swim out into the open ocean without a boat or somebody near her but she decided to follow he made a point of swimming wait in front of me n in a little bit below i could swim in slip stream and i thought wow i that he learn that from his mother i bed when they were migrating nor he was in her slip stream and enable an enabled him to swim much easier than then against the strong currents and it was i si cold me because i was hardly moving at all my harms and i was just flying through the water and i just thought wow an i we know i at times i tried to think about how does he see me and he must have thought horrible swimmer she is yet just see just beautiful elegant graceful in the water and just move effortlessly and i just on i kid of is if is then his tail tin is flu and he would just move and here i was struggling with my arms it was just he probably thought i needed help by this time lye had been in the water with the whale for almost four hours a strung a swimmer as line was she did not how much longer she could be in that cold water they swam towards the file rig for a while but did not see the other whale and line realized she would have to make a decision soon you know i was used to swimming a very long distances but i at their points along the way where i was getting tired and cold because he know i was not swimming at my normal speed i was treating water i was wondering where whale was going cause he was suddenly diving down deep into the water and i think it was about a for and half hours or five hours into this time out there in the water i was getting rather cold and i realized that i was putting myself in danger now that i could go into hypothermia and if i got hypothermia that i could become really distracted and i could also fast out in the water it was five hours a swimming around and not rally going anywhere ism i decided that i really needed to start getting back toward the peer she turned around and swam back toward the peer the whale stayed wither then long saw a long beach life hard boat coming towards her at full speed and when it reached her the lifeguard told her she was out too far then my told her something else a commercial fishing boat had spotted a slow whale only a half mile from the peer we are let usually swim that the whale was now swimming in their direction kept thinking ow my i please let and somehow hear her i hopefully she is making some kind of noise that he can understand that she is approaching her maybe he is doing something that she is hearing you know the cry of the baby ism to come and find him even though this is what she would been hoping for let did not quite know what to do full sits gray wales can be fifty feet long and we ninety thousand pounds oh i would have gotten i would have been hi would've con to b you of you get never is about this mother coming i was really hers cause i gain it was do i stay an the water do i get out of the water do i stay with the baby you do i do and i thought well my intention all long has been good and and the baby recognizes that and hopefully there communicating and she will understand that you know this has been a good thing and what happened when she actually swam over to us she came over very very slowly and did not come really close to me initially but a few minutes later she came right next to me ism and you know when in when a mother wale comes next you it is a bless puling up beside you and ism i back away am because i was afraid i mean the animals forty feet on forty five feet long ism and to be in the water was something huge it is frightening i mean cause just won push er fin her anything ism i could be heard i tried to tell myself just be calm just just flowed on the water and and if she does not want you around you will know that very quickly i saw them together and ism it was one of the most beautiful things have ever seen in my life to see the mother and baby reunited an mean for five hours we would been out there swimming together and ism she came over she approached me and she was close that i thought am going to touch her ism just going to do it because because i feel a part of this whole thing and am i touched her and i could feel that she felt my hand on her and ism hi was amazing know cause she was i and you know and than ism a few minutes later if swam off well long swam back to the shore the lifeguard mother the the cargo ships around lot senseless harbor knew where the mother and baby were swimming later bots reported seeing the two join group of whales on their way north when she got back to the beach let as to life guard if she could use the phone to call her clarence tho let them know that her work out had gone longer than she expected and she was on her way home and it was weird though to go from that is always sowers to be in this amazing environment the ocean to then leave it and then go back to okay now an i wen doing threat the day ins u strange but i did not tell my clarence what had happened because i knew i would have been in much trouble because i was you're responsible for me to swam off shore without support without people watching the water but i told myself it was really o say because e no steeve out was out their watching in the life guard throughout their watching and they knew what was going on but om it was still stretch i think now that what i did was pretty om due but if i was to do it again it'd still the it because i felt it was something i could do a few weeks later line found herself off course in the ocean she as trying to set a record become the fastest person to som the cattalinga channel that twenty one mile stretch off the coast of californium land set out at midnight with a support boat the door and a coach on a paddleboard beside her on that attempt from captain island the fog came in at midnight i get separated from my support boat the door and i just had a coach on a paddleboard we were lost in the middle of the channel at midnight and there were ship surrounding us and were feeling the you waves breaking to be lost in the fog where you cannot see more than ten meters in front of you in the pitch blackness and to feel and to hear ships moving round you is absolutely terrifying and my coach who had had no experience in the open water had told me u just keep swimming because eventually the crew would find us but then line thought of the baby what the way the whale even though it lived in the water had lost its way an ended up further and further from its mother tendon want this to hap in to her she stopped swimming and gave up her attempt at the record she says she and her coach just ta put bobbing up and down in the water anthill eventually her crew picked them up fey judge a version of this story was won her podcast this is love from criminal and fox media when cox a she interviewed twice one's e record for the fastest crossing of he english channel he is also the very first person to from across the bearing straight from the united states to the semi union just for the reckon by the way it can be illegal to touch a way also i know doll try the n the the i o an s the a a three the year of magical thinking we we not turn to another father and daughter who get abrupt we thrown off the path i thought they were on shoved off course and in this case we see the strange places that takes hem to she she was son is a comedian she tells the story it began when she is twenty four years old tan a mommies suddenly it happened on a family trip or regolith beach delftware my parents got there a day before my brother and me and had a nice married couple's evening not a tom chancy novel for my dad took a walk on the beach holding hands fell asleep watching sects in the city the next morning my dag got up earlier than my mom and so i want to to breakfast and gathered up all the papers for her and than i came back to the one and low an behold tat just the shock of a lifetime yes i realize the she ah was not doing very well at all i ma mean that is that is to say the we she was had turn black and blue in the two hours i had gone i and laugh in she she ad clearly died in that period of time from a heard attack my dad pal can be a little detached when he talks about this and it is not just that it is a tough thing for anyone to talk about he has a really hard time talking about his feelings but he is expressive in many other ways to be clear he is a great tat when i was eight he built the stage for me in the back yard to put on plays and during the final set off fireworks in the garden he was my girl scout leader till i was seventeen he is got a big personality he is hot people lucky generous makes political ads for a living he has friends all over the country people call him the unofficial mayor of our neighborhood and my mam city was an equally big personality she fought for the quill right's amendment was the youngest chair woman of the national woman's political calcar she was an incredibly passion of person the type who could go from angers laughter in the same sentence extremely funny and really just fun the things she would say before anything we did was let us have a big old time and for her to just be gone suddenly she was only fifty four even my dad who has a hard time expressing feelings the word he uses is brutal it was absolutely instantly sterilize in instantly frighten and disorient in is state of shock my dad did something really strange something have never heard of anyone doing well i i remember that i back in the day we had dead fine and i i notice that i had a few image is left on the roll this was two thousand five and i was sad i was alone with your demand that ah and i decided to capture the moment am with that with a few stills a what i did not realize is how gruesome i really did look that when life is gone it is gone i dad why was your instinct in that moment to take photos of mam well i i just felt ut we might want this i turned out we did not want it bat a wen on ad and and the and have it i thou these forces by accident i was home about a year after she died and flipping through rolls and rolls of photos my dad to and intermingled between pictures of the softball team were about a dozen photos of my mam dead and one was a supply i threw the on the ground and just remember screaming and crying and my dad saying oops forgot those were on that role i thought who would do this take a self with a dead body and then how do you forget you have these photos and just leave the out for your kids to find i mean i was equally unmoved by my mastiff i moved a mattress into my closet i set up a shrine to my mam around me and spend hours crying in the darkness of that strange cave but my dad dealt with it very differently he made choices off never understood and we have never spoken about it talking for the story is the first conversation we have ever had about that time what is art with the funeral my dad became obsess with the idea that we were not only get a want filmed but filmed right he hired a true to do it as a three camera shoot a t v sit come to make into a d v d that he would give out as stocking suffers just what everyone once for christian did give you a sense of how hard for my dad was about all this when i give my eulogy the sound cut out during the last five minutes he insistent on bringing me into the sown booth at his office to do eighty a which intevian film as when you re record any dialogue i got mused up i work as an actress and have done this many times but to be directed by my father saying too by to my mom was serial and i had you la re record and i pushed to you a little bit and you were into it and always very low energy and i said come on case you have got at you've you have got a do this with a little more enthusiasm a little more ump little more ump you wanted be to be you wanted me to feel it more yet and a holt really go there and a cry and to cry ah i i had you do it with a little more ump and ta we finally got a good take but why did it feel important t you at him that is that is a good question just felt that was an act of completion and we needed it a we needed it done the final produced drop by christian it was a three and a half hour too partner that ism guessing not one person watched next my dad decided to quit take the funeral on the road meaning he set up six a national funerals in different cities across the country for his friends if the funeral in our home town was the roadway my at embarked on the national tour he book hotel conference rooms brought along a lifesized photo of my mom and redelivered his own eulogy at some of these there were sixty or seventy people at the time i could not understand why he would put himself through this again and again the way i saw it back then based on his daily updates hes felt less funerals and more huge parties for him i mean a lot of these people never even met my mom which left me wondering what was the point i wanted her meaning your mam i wanted heard a feel we had really love her and really cherisher ye did you think it the time you felt more alike ism doing this a sort of something to keep busy or drive towards or dew instead of make feeling ah to me this was feeling and this was how i held weeks after my die got back from the funeral tour just three months after my mam died i got a home call from him i never would have imagined it'd get soon i was driving in alley were i live and he told me he was going to start dating

and never asked why he started dating soon till we had this conversation the way he tells it it is it happened to him this was not what i expected an ant the bar and had my back to the windows and almost sudden my here pounding on the window and i turn grand and it is somebody i do not know and there motioning for me to go outside i go outside and they instantly stare kissing me do not ask me what can may be they had a little too much to drain wait a minute es to croutmen out of the out of the blue and a a can i go we telling me a woman kiss you from seeing you in a window yet through the window yes this woman we s a complete stranger and to my eye a predator but to my dad this felt a meet cutin when harry met sally not long after that the flood gates open he started dating every one i mom's good friends mom's first cousin a see span anchor every hon he literally he asked a woman out he met in a cross walk when i think of my dad at this time it is he was o blurry image he just never stop to moving some people say that the first year after a love one dies as the worse but for him as he entered year too things ramped up even more he was acting manic he call every day with these new grandees ideas and big plans that no one could talk him out of at one point he attempt ted to wall paper our living room with wrapping paper because as he told me why pay all that money for wall paper when wrapping paper at the paper source is just as nice he bought a woman in our church new teeth and then there was his hair si walked in do lad the woman had been cutting my hair and a and she was a senior you to expert and i walk in i said i wont a do something different am i pull out a twenty dollar bill and i held it up tour and i said i wont a look this and it is drew action and he has long waves of hair that go back across a i is hear in an to the back of his had and i go that is how i want a look this senior expert gave him a large barrel pure he tested me a picture of himself in curlers it is a shock i have never gotten over and one i hope no one else has to go for then he had a run in with the law one night at a restaurant he picked to fight with a major de on behalf of an older woman who was not being seated and the cops were called and as they were dragging him out i dad who had not eaten yet managed to rally the whole bar in to throwing nuts and to his mouth shouting nut me as he passed he called me later that night laughing just thinking i would get such a kick out of this story and his great gametic exit line and he was shocked by how concerned i was and just to say my dad was seeing a grief there's at the time and unannounced to me she helped explain what was happening to him the sun loss of his wife had triggered ta manic behavior it was a reaction to grief she would seen before there is actually a term for this bereavement mania manic behavior caused by the stress of losing a loved one and this kind of mania can happen in people with no other history of me disorders and it can happen just once and not recur but at the time i did not know any of that and i was just horrified by the things he was doing in the places he was showing up our neighbors across the street told him paw come by any time whatever you need the way people do when some one dies and he surfed he showed up unannounced in their bottom more than once he told him dad no one once you in their hots of every night these or hard words you are making me a to you but you are giving me no choice or there is the time someone old's car and he tried to set up a sting to get it back i was worried about him i tried to get him to come stay with me i could keep an eye on him and when he tactics failed i through fits i cried d he would actually yell stop trying to control me ism fine he kept trying to explain he was o kat and that in fact he was having fun sometimes it'd felt id lost my mam and my dad and then it all came to ahead a wedding can we talk about a man dos wedding debut ti i do not think if really relevant her view you do not think a man is wetting his relevant to the story of your manic phase after roadside we o me you you started off i understand mys hesitant it is the only thing he did during that period that still embarrasses him my dad love is weddings there his superpose it was for my best friend demand and my dad was the unofficial father of the bride he was also as always filming the wedding those three hammers were back baby we were all on the dance floor outside and he was in his element the life of the party and then suddenly i could not find him to my horror i looked up and found he would made his way into the house where no one was allowed and was standing in this room that overlooked the dance floor he was framed by huge floor to ceiling windows a fish boll and my dad had turned this living room into his own personal stage he was hitting up what looked a dead body but it turned out to be a bride's mad he would rolled up in an area rug that just her head was popping out thankfully she was in on the bet he proceeded to bob her back and forth between his arms the way you see guides on the boardroom tried o juggle a stick between two other sticks and then unfortunately he stuck an empty bear bottle through the zipper of his pants and pretended to pa everyone was laughing but it was not funny it felt scare to we him that my brother and my friend's uncle and i raced into the house than we dragged him out across the giant lawn he started putting on this baby voice saying we no want to stop having fun just begging us to go back to the party we finally got him to agree to go home and as he was getting on the buss he turned to us and asked if we would hold his camera equipment for a second he could tie his shall the moment our hands were fully ti a fake out and he took off running back across the lawn jumping over hedges to get to the party yelling ism are i far turned out the hedges were felled with placenivy which wanted him in the hospital the next say i did not know until we talked that this moment change something for my dad he realized what am i dealing air make ism a little out of control a no an get y and i started to say id better bring it down a couple of notches that nigh really was kind of this turning point for you a that i didn't i think that was certainly i one that slowed me down and yet which i needed at that point yet i really do think that was also a big moment for me because it was just the moment that i really gave up i was just i cannot control this man any more it does not feel good to do that to you and i also simply cannot i do not think any one can u one other reason i wanted to talk to you it because i think when molded we just grieved her very differently i really was hell bent that you were grieving wrong and i was grieving ride an ism kind of long in bed an feeling an your not feeling to my eye how i was well i i think a it it was just ta different process for me and i i felt ta i felt the grief i but i also felt this compulsion almost to be the funny man ta to live a little bit and a i at at the same time that thesis tremendous sadness there is this the beginning of a little in o freedom it just felt different kind of pleasant to be free of shackles i guess i sort of the reason i thought it felt wrong to me was even when you say you wanted to f el free of shackles it sort of implies that mom was your shackles as opposed to grieving mom in away and i i do not mean it to be your mom but it was just you masts the notion a that there were constraints on how all of us live our life and the constraints were off what he means is that when the stable suburban life he built for himself suddenly shattered he thought if i half to start over then ism just going to do m he got this idea i was surprised to learn from someone at my man's was the woman who had lost her husband not that long ago tout fourteen fifteen months earlier she came up to hug me and i remember asking her when dis it git easier an she she just said it dent and that said title he decided why not enjoy life and all those times i thought i was being helpful and protecting him i was actually making things worse i think a what made me a little a angry at times was how you mean to control me and control my emotions and they were not controllable yah did you would you say i traded you kind of a tile o no maybe just a little bit but you were you were trying to kind of keep me on the rails keep me in a you know straighten narrow and i felt you were trying to say no no this is how you have to feel this is you have to be very sad ye and what did you feel about about me and how i kind of handled at an ended it a you you were pretty consist that not likely anything were you worried about me very much ye went you won on sleeping in their closet i i think that is come for confer from your perspective from where you were to did you feel i was grieving wrong ye i guess i did i mean i did not feel it was a the the most noble thing to be sleeping in your closet for over year you were very disturbed by that y i thirds for i thou a was disturbing i dow it is not it funny at the time mi thought there is nothing heard about this hat all as not were at all that i found a twins give mattress and a the garage of my build in and i have it sticking half in the closest half you and before i would go to bed i would just take the swag of this nice every night and then i would go through her dap but she just as e your hand writing in to see kind of all the upcoming events is almost a mister you want to put together and i think you know it is a plutcheur's graduation and doctor's appointments in your just kind of a who to that not that this is such an original that but to have no notion our knowledge just coming sat about some one planting out a fun sure that is just never to be why you can put a abele on my dads wed of mania u can also put a label on mine depression in away there two sides of the same coin for y died to have fun go out on dates i do not know may be it was healthier why did why did it have set you that that you thought somebody was replacing your mom why why did bother you s that how was horrible horrible horrible to think o unfathomable a ye i really headed in my head that to move on was can insult to mow as suppose to you moving forward because you had to it was excruciate well i can approbate what your shame no yo but i do feel i was too hard on we now that i married and i really i up the mind now god however anybody based to get through this is the right way yet a trade and just there is no way if there is no way it wasn't until eight years after my mom's death that our grief lifted a little not all of it it will always be there but i remember the moment that it lifted enough to finally feel it was not crushing us it happened on atrip my brother fletcher my dad night took to the beach it was just the three of us our family now missing a limb on the plain my dad told us that he had met some one a woman name marry speech river and professor and we could tell in his voice that this woman was different he was

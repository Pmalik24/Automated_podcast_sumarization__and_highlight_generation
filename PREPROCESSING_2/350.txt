further ado let us get to answering your questions the first question is about cradle and the question is what are the short and long term effects of taking cradle for those of you that have not heard of crate crate as a substance that comes from a tree that grows naturally in indonesia the the elf is called mitrogina species and it is been known for hundreds of years or more we do not really know how long but at least for a couple of hundred years that when people chew the leaves of this tree they experience a mild stimulant effect and there is also a process of extraction whereby you can take the leaves and get high concentrations of cradle that nowadays as packaged into various supplements most often consumed in causal form although sometimes it sold in raw powder form here is the keythinge to understand about cradle indeed at low dosages cradle has a mild stimulant effect however at her dosages it has what is called an analgesic effect that is a pain killing effect and it acts as a sedative and cream itself acts as an opioid in the body this is what is making cradle a very controversial topic these days in particular because most people have heard of the called opioid crisis the opioid crisis has been a term coin to largely center around issues that have taken place in the united states although these issues definitely extend beyond the borders of the united states but the opioid crisis is essentially the over consumption and widespread addiction to opioid opioid include things morphine ox condone also called ox contain and there are other opioid similar to those compounds all of which have the general effect of being pain killers and sedatives and in some people again some people eliciting a sense of euphoria in particular at low to moderate dosages however people quickly develop a tolerance to those drugs and need to consume more and more of them in order to get the effect that they initially got from a lower dosage and they are not jobs highly habit forming they are highly addictive and we can distinguish between habit forming an addictive by simply saying that addictive means people will continue to take something or do something despite negative consequences there are other relevant definitions o medication as well i define the diction more broadly as the progressive narrowing of the things that give you pleasure and indeed when people get addicted to opioid it is a very bad picture it often hampers many many areas of their lives and seriously the opioid crisis refers to the over prescription of opioid drugs that sort of what it generally taken to mean but it also includes accessing opioid such as morphine ox condone et camera through gray market sources through black market sources and on and on and of course the acquisition of the drugs is just one piece it is also the over consumption of those drugs and of course the addiction to those drugs which has proved to be pernicious what is this apt to do with cream cradtam is also in opioid and we will talk about how it differs in its opioid properties from the drugs i just talked about because it is different from morphine and hydrocodone but it also has some similar properties as well but the deal with cream is that a good number of people out there have managed to wean themselves off opioid such as morphine and hydrocodon through the use of rata and that has been used as justification for keeping crate on the market in keeping it legal however and this is a very important however cream itself has also proved to be not only habit forming but addictive especially when taken at dosages that exceed that lower dose that just generally creates a bit of stimulate to little bit of euphoric effect when people start taking hyrodosages of crate it is very clear that it does become addictive and itself is very hard to come off of much that people experience called crate with drawl now the reason i mention that crate has been used by good number of people to wean themselves off of the more potent forms of prescription opioid is that when i solicited for questions about crate on social media it was a very binary response in fact there was one camp a very rabid camp that said random is terrible i took this stuff i got addicted it was extremely hard to come off of there were additional comments in their such as i know somebody who literally had to go to rehab because of trade who developed a bunch of other addictions because of trade essentially many many responses of people who had only bad experiences with trade meaning they liked it enough at first that they continued to take it and it became addictive for them or somebody that they know however there was another camp that was equally vocal which kept saying no if one really adheres to the lower dosages of cram trade itself can be a useful tool for getting off other opioid and there were even a few modified medical professionals medical doctors that is and i happen to know them in their reputations as quite good who chimed in and sort of reconcile the two camps by saying indeed if one can avoid taking cradle at all you should there is no reason to take this thing thinking that it is could not good for you you would be wise to avoid taking it because there is a high probability if you take it at a given dosage or at dosage that is going to get your brain and body into a state of euphoria and algesia and the sort of classic opioid effect that it is going to become habit forming predicting for you that said these same medical professionals acknowledged that a fair number of people that they knew managed to get off of the more potent forms of opioid such as morphine ox condone and forth using trade and they said well if it is a choice between being addicted to morphine and hydrocodo n verses taking trade and addicted to those substances and trade somehow allowed them to taper off of those substances that they would look more favorably upon trade if and only if they would also commit to progressively lowering their dose of trade and eventually coming off of trade the general take away from all that is if you can avoid taking trade meaning if you have not taken it already do not and that reminds me of a very important point would a guest on the hubormanlab pokkasked doctor robot merlanka who say eddy and paces my college stamford school of medicine is a world expert on the mechanisms underlying addiction and dopamine and drug reinforcement among money other things what he said on the podcast is absolutely true which is that it is impossible to get addicted to a substance that you have never consumed that might seem obvious but think about that one again it is impossible to get addicted to a substance that you have never consumed i think the safest statement to make is if you have not tried crate you would be wise to avoid it because you stand a chance to become addicted to it if however you are somebody that is addicted to other forms of opioid you absolutely should talk your physician about that and how to get off of those opioid but there is evidence that some people have used crate to successfully ween themselves off the more potent forms of opioid that i talked about namely morphine and hydrocodone as well as a few others now if you are somebody who already takes crate you need to be very thoughtful about the dosage that you take and you also need to be thoughtful about the fact that people differed aromatically in their response to opioid this is o important and people do not talk about this enough we hear for instance that oh if people are taking anywhere from one to five grahams may be one to six crams of crate to per day that is keeping it in the dosage range for which people do not generally tend to get addicted you will hear things that and by the way when i say one to five or one to six grams per day ism not talking about the individual compounds that are present in crate there couple different plant alkaloids it'll talk about in a moment that are present in crate and these have different effects on the opioid system nowadays some of the companies that sell crate and by the way that sold over the counter as a supplement it does not require prescription to purchase at least at this point in time in the united states some of these products we will have a higher concentration of one or the other alkaloids within them such that you cannot really compare one graham of one brand of crate to one graham of another brand of crate because they can have wildly different levels of these different alkaloids and these different alkaloids have wildly different impact on different aspects of your brain and body biology in particular how much they tend to impact the called in erogenous opioid system case when we talk about dosages we have to keep this in the back of our mind in we have to keep in the back of our mind the there does seem to be a sub group of people we do not know how big this sub group of people is but we know it is not every one but it is somewhere between ten and forty percent of people seem to respond to opioid in a particularly potent way they really them and perhaps not surprisingly people outside of that category do not tend to opioid i can certainly say that i am somebody who when have been prescribed things vikedin or any other opioid post surgery for pain i hate taking those sprogs i absolutely hate it it'd rather deal with the pain they make me cautious they make me feel terrible that said i know people who love ovoids it is a natural fit for their chemistry in the sense that it tends to evoke more euphoria they just immediately the feeling some of you may remember the episode of the subhuman podcast that it did about alcohol and there too i discuss the fact that about eight to ten per cent of people who consume alcohol yet an increase dopamine response to alcohol that is not observed in other people and that particular sub group of people is very very at risk for developing alcohol used disorder sometimes called alcoholism because they can drink in a way and they experience a high from drinking in a way that other people simply do not experience now everybody else if they consume to much alcohol they get drunk it is not about the drunk effect it is about the dopamine and other sorts of chemicals that are released in those people in response to alcohol that other people just do not seem to experience at the same level of potency again with things trade and the other ovoids there is a category of people and it is a much larger category of people gan ten to forty per cent we do not know exactly how many because the studies are not really completed n there are not enough of those studies yet unfortunately but when those people take an opioid wo o wow do they it and those people in particular are very much at risk for developing an addiction to opioid and those people especially should never ever go near cradle if they have not or if they are already taking trade these are the people that are constantly ratcheting up their dose these are the people that tell you now ism not addicted but if you were to say hey all right well then let us do an experiment where you do not take cradle for a week those who are going to be the people that are suddenly going to get anxious about the mere idea of that have also talked about this in reference to anabas when i did in episode about anabas end ism not putting a blanket statement out there about anabas as being good or bad on that episode i talked about the fact that anabas does indeed have very therapeutic uses but that there are good number people who rely on anabas for anxiety control and other ways of modulating their brain chemistry and bodily chemistry such that if you were to say hey are you addicted to calabash they say no i do not have to smote anabas own have to take my edibles but if you were to push them elicit and say are right will then n wet's do an experiment where you do not consume any anabas in any form for ten days they do not the idea of that experiment at all much that were they to run that experiment they would experience a lot of the withdrawal symptoms associated with addiction i cannot in good faith say that cradle is safe for everybody because it is simply not now is it safer than the other opioid and if why will in order to address that let us take a short glance at the pharmacology of cradle and how it works in terms of its nor chemistry in the body now on to keep this pretty brief because in the future ism going to do an extended episode all about ovoids and i will include trade in that conversation but just to back up a little bit and discuss what opioid are opioid are compounds that can activate the called indigenous opioid system all of us have within our brain and body the capacity to release our own opioid that is right you have opioid within your body they are released from neurons and they bind to called opioid receptors perhaps some of you have heard the called runners high the runners high is a euphoric state it is a fairly mild euphoric state in most cases but it is euphoric state induced by long duration effort a ka e the runners high the runners high is just a phrase used to explain that when we engage in long duration repetitive action effort the body starts releasing these indigenous opioid they bind to receptors and they trigger things analgesia relief from pain they trigger mild euphoria they tend to change our perception of the outside world make things look more beautiful chine they give things a little bit of machine what i just described is a mild version of what people experience when they take something morphine when people take morphine there is a more of a sedative effect there is more of a euphoric effect and there is more of a dream effect and again it will depend on do such cradle and morphine and hydrocodon all have the property of acting the indigenous opioid but at much higher potency when you bring them into your system they cross the bilobate barrier they go into the brain and they bind to a number of different opioid receptors there is the mew opioid receptor by the way these names all follow green alphabet letters the mew opioid receptor the cap opioid receptor their bunch of different ones trade binds preferentially to the mew opioid receptor and somewhat to the cap opioid receptor there is a bigness conception out their lot of people specially people were proponents of cradle will say no morphine and hydrocodum bind the mew opioid receptor where as cradle binds the capopioid receptor it is a different compound very very different not true not true trade morphine and hydrocoton all bind to the mu opioid receptor and that is what is largely responsible for it is opioid effects especially when you get the dosage up to a level where you start getting the mild sedation the analgesia the pain relief and keep in mind a lot of people are taking trade because they want pain relief and when that me opioid receptor system is activated it indirectly activates a lot of the reinforcement circuitry in the brain that relates to dooming and cerotonent this is another area that will go into in more kept than the future but there is been a lot of controversy people say oh trade does not trigger the dooming system therefor it is not addictive but that is simply not true it indirectly activates the reinforcement circuitry that includes both opening and ceratonan but it is primary effect is to hit this me opioid receptor system that exists in a bunch of places in the brain but mainly in the brainstorm and structure call the periaquiductal gray nucleus which then provides pain relief it triggers a number of differ shifts cognition it is what creates that mild euphoria et camera et camera now how can we be confident that crate is acting similarly to hydrocodone and to morphine it'll be it with lower potency and the reason is if you give people a drug that blocks the mu opioid receptor prior to them taking crate they do not experience any of the classic effects of taking trade now aporia analgesia no sedation a even at the dosage is no mild stimulant of fact we really have to look at crate as an opioid that is just the honest truth and if you are somebody who does not this message because you trade ism not telling you that you do not trade on telling you you likely crate because it is an opioid again if you go on line in you start asking questions about trade again you are going to see these two camps you are going to see the crate is terrible it is addict give it is everything bad camp and then you are going to see the other camp out there very vocal is well talking about how crate helped them avoid other things that are worse and youknow this is an argument that frankly i do not think we want to lean on right the idea that substance a is not as bad as substance b and that making substance a unavailable is just going to send everyone running for substance b that is a weak argument frankly right i heard this argument around anabas and by the way i i think pretty balanced about anabas if you listen to the episode i did on anabas i think you will agree that i believe that anabas has its the republic applications i also believe that young people especially young mails with a predisposition to psychosis should not be taking high concentration t h c anabas because the at a tell us they are already at risk of psychosis and they are a much greater risk of psychosis if they do i think ism pretty balanced about the story on anabas but i often hear the argument o anabas is not as bad as alcohol and therefore anabas is good that is simply not rational what we should be saying is whether not its anabas or alcohol or crate or any substance for that matter what are the potential benefits what are the potential risks and again this is far too much than we can go into in this a m a and we will go into in a future full length episode o the human ladpodcast but the other thing to really keep in mind is the lack of regulation over crate supplements now as many of i am a and of many not all but many supplements in certain conditions id always say behaviors first than nutrition then if and only if it is needed rely on supplementation but supplementation is a big category but when we are talking about supplements that are opioid compounds i start to get nervous because of the high abuse potential and the high a diction potential of quoits and crate is included in that category a couple of other key notes about crate we we death directly from crate is fairly rare it has happened now hydrocodone and morphine suppress respiration as she suppress breathing by way of a mechanism that if you are listener the hubrumlapodcast about which is the called physiological she many of you ford me talk about the physiological size something that you do voluntarily the double in hell through the nose and then along exhale in order to rapidly reduce your level of stress far as we know that the fastest way to deliberately lower your level of stress but the physiological size was discovered in the nineteen thirties as a spontaneous pattern of breathing that occurs involuntarily in sleep in order to reinflame the lungs and allfload carbondioxide and bring oxygen back into the system on the subsequent breath when i interview doctor jack headman who is a professor at universe calfornia lot angels and really the pioneer of the modern burr science understanding of respiration he talked about some studies in his laboratory that were exploring why people die when taking spirits this is a major issue associate with the opioid crisis and what he mentioned was that the opioid lined to particular receptors in the brainstorm locations that generate physiological size opioid when taken as drugs suppress physiological singing and do during sleep and lack of adequate respiration meaning people stop breathing during sleep is one of the primary reasons why people die when they take opioid now crate is not known to suppress respiration when taken at low to moderate dosages but when combined with any other opioid and certainly when combined with alcohol it can suppress respiration and while the date on this are fairly scant there is some evidence that crate induced death is caused by suppression of the respiration system again death due to taking crate at the dosages that r recommended on most commercial packaging is fairly rare although it has happened its in clear if it happen because it was taken in combination with other compounds that seems likely but we cannot forget that a lot of people are taking crate at much higher dosages and in fact progressively higher and higher dosages from these over the counter sources and with increased dosage there is yes and increase risk of respiratory failure again all this points to the fact that cradle is simply not a benign substance if we are going to be very honest the addictive potential of crate is real it is exacerbated for some people compare to others but it is real it is very similarities to other more potent forms of opioid are what make it attractive for some people who are trying to come off those more potent form of opioid but the goal of course is to completely come off all opioid and crate itself can be a bit of a trap it can be a trap in the sense that people who have never taken other opioid can become addicted to crate itself that is absolutely clear that can happen it has happen in a great number of people it is also clear that crate can potentially be a trap knosisaid potentially because if people are trying to come off other more potent forms of opioid and then they use crate to do that and then there rationing up they are dosage of crate such that they are now matching the indigenous response to crate in a way that does not really distinguish from the effects that they were getting from morphine and hydrokodon well then they are just using a different form of morphine and hydrokodone and ism sure that some of you are out there saying that is ridiculous you cannot compare the effects of crate to the effects of hydrokodun but the potency is about one sixth of hydrokodon and there are people out there who are just increasing and increasing both the dosage and modifying the type of crate that they're taking that they are getting the crate that has a particular the high concentration of one of the alkaloids that hits that me opioid receptor hardest and in doing sure they are not getting the pure hydrocodon effect but they are getting really close my advice would be if you have not touch crate do not touch it at all ever if you are taking crate you need to take note of what we just discussed thank you or joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode

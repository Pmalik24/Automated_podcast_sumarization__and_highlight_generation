without further ado let us get to answering your questions the first question is about the prose and cons of daily coffin consumption the question reads what is your opinion on the net benefit of daily caffeine consumption and how can somebody determine if daily caffeine consumption is right for them first of all i did not entire episode about affine you can find that by going to superman labor come at that web sit you can put in affine into the search function and you will find links to that episode in all the formats you to apple notify et camera and it is time stamped of course you can navigate to the particular topics most of interest to you however forsake of this discussion i can summarize a few of the key points the most importanthing d understand is that for most adults that is people about age eighteen to twenty or no older daily caffeine consumption is not going to be a problem provided it does not induce anxiety and certainly provided that not induce anxiety or panic attacks and provided that it does not to strut your night time sleep this is why i always recommend that if you are going to consume coffin in any form coffee t soda or otherwise that you try not to invest affine within the eight an ideal within the ten or even twelve hours prior to bedtime that is because the half life of affine as such that even if you are able to for instance have a cup of coffee around three p m or four p m and then fall asleep around midnight the architecture of the sleep that you get is going to be disrupted for instance it is very important that you get sufficient amounts of both slow wave deep sleep as well as rapid eye movement sleep each night and if you consume affine too close to bedtime and here ism defending too close as anywhere from eight to twelve hours before going to sleep chances are you are not going to get as much rapid eye movement sleep or slow wave sleep that you would otherwise and it is the amount of rapid i movement sleep and slow wave sleep that together lead to whether not you feel you had a good night sleep in terms of your next day alertness and cognitive abilities now again some people may find that they can drink affine in the late afternoon make even at night and still fall asleep but i promise you even if you are in that category you will sleep far better meaning the architecture of your sleep will be better and you will feel far more rested the next day if you abstain from affine within the eight to twelve hours prior to bedtime and i should also say that none of us are perfect myself included i will sometimes have a cup of coffee in the late afternoon and sometimes that will cause me a stay up a little but later sometimes it will not i do not think you want to obsess or worry too much about having some affine every once in a while in the late afternoon if you are still able to fall asleep but do not make it a regular habit now as far as we know there is no drawback to consuming affine on a daily basis again provided does not destruct your night time sleep and provided it does not induce anxiety in fact most of the world consumes affine every single day the current estimates are that ninety per cent that is right nine zero ninety per cent of adults throughout the world consume a caffeinated beverage every single day that is a staggeringly high number making affine the most popular drug on the planet in fact because of the way that affine works and just to remind you how it works it effectively blocks a decisive receptors a decision is a molecule that builds up in your brain and body more and more according to how long you have been awake it makes you feel sleepy affine blocks the adenosine receptor and then when it is dislodged from that receptor whatever a denizens has built up and is around can then bind to the adenosine receptor and makes you feel very sleepy that is the affine crash if ninety per cent of the adult population of the planet earth is consuming affine every day that means ninety per cent of the adult population of planed earth is blocking there a decisive receptors for some portion of their daily life and then there a decisive is binding to the vacant receptor once the affine has dislodged and why ore ninety per cent of adult humans consuming affine every day well to feel more energized more focus to have for r both cognitive energy and physical energy now of course most people are not walking around thinking oh affine gives me more energy more focus et camera most people are consuming affine every single day and are consuming fine every single day in order to feel quotenquoe normal to be at their base line level of cognitive ability and physical energy and on in fact if you look at the data on fine consumption what you will find is that affine actually as a cognitive and cancer can improve learning in memory it can increase physical energy it can increase mental and physical stamina but a feature of those studies that is not often discussed but that was however discussed in the full episode on affine is that studies of affine typically are done by taking chronic affine users and then having them abstain from affine for some period of time usually four days to two weeks in which time they undergo affine withdrawal they do not feel well they get foggy headed they have less energy there is a always sometimes even some mild depression and then what they do is they have people take affine and take a cognitive exam or do some physical activity compare their performance to what it was when they were in the withdrawal state and other typical form of study on affine is to take people who are naive to affine or who never take affine and then have them in jest affine and then measure their cognitive and or physical performance and in both cases you see improvements what ism saying here is that daily affine consumption is not going to lead to improvements in cognitive ability or improvements in physical ability above one's base line unless you either abstain from affine for some period of time typically four days to two weeks prior or you are not somebody who typically in jests affine in other words ninety per cent of the world's population is drinking affine on a daily basis to be at their normal level of mental and physical functioning the question was is there a net benefit to daily affine consumption and here i can reliably say provided you do not suffer from anxiety attacks or lack of sleep from the affine consumption provided that your mindful of not insulting affine too late in the day there does not seem to be any big drawback to drinking affine on a daily basis however there does not seem to be any great benefit at least in terms of direct effects on cognitive or physical ability ay i realize this a little bit of a of a convoluted answer but we have to be honest with one another here affine is a performance enhancing drug but only when compared to the non caffeinated state and ninety per cent of the dust copulation on the world is caffeinated adding more affine above what you would normally consume is certainly not going to allow you to think better and perform better physically here is a useful way to think about affine most people can pretty well tolerate doses of affine anywhere from one hundred milligrams to three hundred milligrams depends on body weight and depends on your tolerance tolerance of course based on he familiar you are with the effects of affine and how regularly you consume it a typical cup of coffee which by the way does not exist depending on the vender depending on how much water to coffee ratio one uses depending on weather not french pressor its pore over the type of coffee at camera all that is going to determine the total amount of affine in that coffee but we can set some outer balance on the total amount of affine that likely exists in a cup of coffee and it is probably somewhere between a hundred milligrams the would be on the weaker side for a six or eight ounce cup of coffee out to about three hundred milligrams for the equivalent six to eight ounces of coffee but if you were to brew your coffee very very strong or me occasionally throw a shot of a espresso in there too you could get that number up to four hundred or five hundred milligrams of caffein i personally tolerate affine pretty well have been drinking affine since i was a teen age mostly in the form of broad unflavored year hamate tea to important to stay away from the smoked varieties of your hamate if you are going to get your affine from your hamate smoked varieties can be kcarsonagenic the non smoked varieties i do not seem to have that property but there is a lot of affine in your hamates all drink yore beat and have for many many years or it'll drink black coffee or express or press or americono things of that sort that is my preferred force of fine most people are drinking coffee to get their coffin and i would say that if you are going to drink your affix drink it in the early part of the day as i mention earlier i am a big proponent of delaying your first affine and take until at least ninety minutes after waking in order to avoid the afternoon crash have talked a lot about this on the pod last their lot of clips on the internet explaining the rational behind that and if you do experience in afternoon crashing energy i do recommend to laying your morning coffin and take to ninety to a under end twenty minutes after waking now first people that want to get more of a true cognitive enhancing and performance in hanging effect from affine again you are going to have to abstain from affine for about four days regular affine drinkers that is going to be difficult that is going to lead to headaches that is going to lead to brain fog that is going to lead to feelings of always in fact the last time i took four days off or even a week off from affine consumption was when i was sick i do not get sick very often but when i am sick i generally abstain from affine and sometimes i wonder whether not the always i feel from whatever o viral or bacterial thing i might be dealing with when ism sick is in part the always of affine withdrawal i certainly notice i feel much better when i return to drinking affine but that tens o coincide with feeling relief from whatever sins symptoms an other symptoms of mind have been experiencing from the illness it is not a good experiment i cannot tease a part those variables the short answer is for most adults there does not seem to be any major downside to consuming affine and there have been scattered reports here and there in humans showing that in jesting affine can increase dopamine receptors which will effectively allow you to get more out of the dopamine that you produce a this is why affine has a mood elevating as well as energy elevating effect i should point out that some people just cannot tolerate affine it makes them too misery too anxious they start sweating they get heart palpitations it is very hard for these people to build up a tolerance to affine that allows them to enjoy it these are the people that can even feel a fluttering the hart in a lot of energy lift from d gaff coffee now something that y to me is just a foreign concept but some people are just that sensitive to affine that even the small amounts of affine in chocolate or de gaff coffee make them feel too alert and they should abstain from affine i do not think they are in any way harming their health by abstaining from affine then there is the issue of children and adolescence and teen ages and young adults investing affine and i cover some of this in the episode about affine but there is been a lot of debate as to whether not affine can cause osteoporosis whether i can leach calciumount of the bones whether not can stunt growth frankly there is not a lot of evidence for those sorts of claims and yet developing brain is a very tender and malleable environment and somebody who started office career as a development a norobiol just studding development a brain plasticity and wiring it does sort make me cringe to think about children younger than the age of say fourteen investing large amounts of affine in any form sod a coffee tea et camera despite the fact that there is very little evidence that it can stunt their growth i do not personally the idea of the young brain being bathed in an a menacing receptor antagonist which is effectively what affine is no as much as possible one wants the developing brain to develop in a miles of unencumbered non chemically encumbered interactions between our transmitters and their receptors unless of course there is a clinical need for prescription drug or a supplement or am some modification of a nutritional program specifically to per down regulate the doping system or up or down regulate the creatine and system but those are the sorts of decisions that really should be made in close overbite and recommendations by a psychiatrist the short answer around daily affine consumption in young people meaning fourteen and younger is avoid it if you can have your children avoid affine if they can the occasional bit of affine is probably not going to be a problem the amount of affine in small amounts of chocolate probably not going to be a problem but affine and form of energy drink soda's coffee tea for children younger than fourteen just seems a bad idea from everything we understand about brain wiring and the trajectories of brains that develop with a lot of chemical adjustment from other sources affine now for kid's age fifteen to say eighteen or twenty a lot of brain wiring is still occurring but a lot of it has been completed probably not as risky to consume affine every once in a while or maybe even on a daily basis but there too i think there are great advantages to limiting the amount of affine that one in jess and of course in the adolescent ante years nowadays lot o kids are consuming energy drinks and soda and some of those energy drinks and sodas contain a lot of affine anywhere from two hundred to eight hundred milligrams of affine and nowadays more sodas and energy drinks contain other things a monoacid precursors to naromodulators dopamine for instance a lot of energy drinks now contain a tyrosine which is a precurserted dopamine a lot of them will contain thiamine have talked about threonine as a supplement that can promote more restful sleep have taken thirty to sixty minutes before sleep the reason why a lot of energy drinks and sodas and frankly now coffee brands are including theine in the coffee or energy drink or soda is because it tends to have a mild anxiety reducing effect and it reduces the gutters that affine creates and that is ice a trick that these companies are using in order to get people to ingest more affine because by including the thiamine it is preventing the kid or adult from feeling to misery and therefore the an continue to consume that drink without feeling their over stimulated if i were to take the in parental nor scientist a adult a voice here i would say avoid affine and take as much as you can until your about eighteen years old but ism realistic i realize that adolescence landmines age say in fourteen or fifteen out i eighteen and older are going to be consuming coffin in the form of energy drinks and sodas but reducing the total amount of affine that one is investing in those years just seems really advantageous again for all the same reasons i mention early you do not want the young brain bathing in a bunch of eugenist meaning externally introduce nor chemicals or in things thiamine or eltirisine if you are going to indulge in affine or an energy drink sir thiamine or eltirisine for that matter that is a sort of thing that probably is best left for people eighteen and older and even there if one finds that affine is for them as do i i think always best to try and get your affine from a clean source a clean source meaning something that contains just coffee or just tee am again this is not a knock on energy drink specifically but you really have to make sure that whatever energy drink you are going to consume what is in it a you recognize what the different ingredients do and you recognize the potential of ingesting those ingredients chronically over and over gain and have talked o little bit about this on previous podcast and ill get into this again maybe will do an entire episode about energy drinks because they are commonly consume nowadays now getting back to the original question about daily affine consumption this person goes on to say that for them o ka this is there personal experience after a few weeks of consumption of daily affine the negative start to always the plosive ones they are getting poor quality sleep lack of appetite anxiety et camera and when they do not consume affine they find it lot easier to be mindful and their meditation practices much better but they are lethargic and less motivated o case to what they are describing are all the classic symptoms of affine over you we in wee not abuse in this case although affine can be truly abused people taking fine pills et camera in large quantities we are not talking about that but this person is describing the classic pattern of over use of affine and the classic pattern of withdrawal from affine when they stop taking it what should somebody this do and i think that is important question answer because i thing a lot of people fall in this category they drink affine every day they are no longer getting the performance in hanging effect of affine to there taking it just to be normal or feel they can focus normally and have normal amount of energy but then if they try and come off they feel worse can they are couple ways to do this you can taper your affine and take off over the course of four to seven days but most people do not have the discipline or do not want to spend the time doing that but if you want to the way you would do that is you would cut it by a bout ten or fifteen per cent per day you could do that by volume or you could do that by concentration of coffee that sort of thing a simpler way to go about all this that still will allow you to get some of the performance enhancing effects of affine and yet experience far less withdrawal would be two things first of all just have your amount of affine in take for two or three days again that could be by volume or could be by concentration probably easiest to do by volume and instead of drinking and eight silence coffee in the morning maybe do four ounces of regular coffee four ounce is a d ka or you just have the four ounces of coffee you do that for three or four days and then you take perhaps one full day off from affine may be another full day off you are going to feel a lot less bad on those two days having cut your affine in taken half on the previous four days than you would if you just went cold turkey and then you go back ton jesting affine but you go back tin jesting affine at that fifty per cent dose or what used to re present that fifty per cent dose of affine for you and you just continue that way on a daily basis and then every once in a while when you want the performance in hanging effects of affine you go back to what was your original dose which is now double what you are taking on on a daily basis what we are really talking about here is not going cold turkey we are not talking about quitting affine indefinitely what we are talking about its cutting the amount of affine that you drink in half for about four days a ka pluserminus to day and then taking two days off from affine completely and then going back on that half dose of affine indefinitely that is your new baseline of affine and take and then every one in a while if you need a bit more of a lift you invest twice as much affine or a coffee that is twice as concentrated we should acknowledge that most people are not going to really precise about the amount of balances the amount of affine none the less it is pretty straightforward to know that you are reducing your waffle and take certainly is clear to know if you are trusting no affine for a couple of days and it is pretty clear when you are doubling the amount of affine but but you soft have to worry much that you are exactly doubling the amount of affine you could drink one and a half times as much as you happen to drink on the day before or you could drink three times as much you would definably feel it if you drink three times as much one very important thing to recognize as that on any day where you really spike your affine and take above baseline no matter where that base line is when you start could be zero could be four hundred milligrams could be two hundredmilligrams when you double that intake you will get a big boost of energy and the next day you are going to feel the crash from that you are going to feel more lethargic you are on if noel not good that has to do with opening receptor modulation this has to do with a denying receptor modulation important thing to do is not continued to consume that elevated level of affine which is what most people do and then they set a new higher base line just to feel normal the anything is to just manage to get through that crash day manage you get through that one day where you feel little less good or maybe even down a bit get outside of it get more sunshine we know that spice your quarters all in a good way right it can increase i the katacolamines dopamine et camera get a little bit more sunlight get a a bit more movement get outside do something to offset those feelings of always and then get right back to your original goal level of affine each day there is no use in getting quantitative that you make your life miserable you measuring things out a laboratory chemist if you are that type and you want to do that be my guest but unless your taking affine an piliform it is very very hard to get extremely exact about the amounts of coffin that you are investing it is locate to we ballet but understand the contour of how caffeine works and what the affine performance en hanging effect comes from it comes from a kaffinin take above base line understand that any time you go above baseline with your coffin and take there is the potential of some anxiety understand that there is going to be a slight withdrawal of fat at lasts about twenty four to forty eight hours battle through that short period and you will be right back where you started and where you need to be you can enjoy affine on a daily basis and derive the benefits because there are many benefits to drinking affine and avoiding some of the potential hazards and again if you are a young person i recommend delaying that coffin intake may be i do not now ten years thank you or joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the superman labor cast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to superman labor come slash premium just to remind you why we launch the superman land cast premium channel is truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard superman labpodcast channel which of course we will still be continued to be released every money in full length we are not going to change the foreman or anything about the standard humeral labor cast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which i think we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all cha news not just the premium channel but through all changes suberin labpodcast in other medium channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that whose kinds of answers in the first place now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they are going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the number premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your

welcome to the supermen lap science science ay to e r i may drew supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor case happen doctor happen is the chief of nauru surgery at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine his laboratory focuses on bulletin ingesting disorder and other forms of obsessive compulsive behaviors normally when we hear about eating disorders or obsessive compulsive disorders of other kinds the conversation quickly migrates to pharmacologic interventions and ceratonan or dopamine or talk there interventions many of which can be effective the happen laboratory however takes an entirely different approach while they embrace pharmacologic and behavior an talk theropianterventions their main focus is the development and application of engineer devices to go directly into the brain and stimulate the neurons the nerve cells that generate compulsions that cause people to want to eat more even when their stomach is full in other words they do brain surgery of various kinds sometimes removing small bits of brain sometimes stimulating small bits of brain with electrical current and even stimulating the brain through the intaxscull that is without having a drill down beneath the skull in order to alleviate and indeed sometimes cure these conditions to day's discussion when doctor happen was an absolutely fascinating one for me because it represents the leading edge of what is happening in modification of brain circuits and the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease for instance they just recently published a paper in nature medicine one of the premier journals out there entitled pilot study of responsive nucleus eccummons deep brain stimulation for loss of control eating the uncles summons is an area of our brains that we all have in fact we have two of them one on each side of the brain that is intimately involved in the release of dopamine for particular movie ate behaviors and while most often we thing about dopamine for the release of behaviors that we want to engage in in this context they are using stimulation and control of neuronal activity innucleous eccumbons to control loss of control eating something that when people suffer from it despite knowing they should eat despite not even wanting to eat they find themselves eating again this represents really the leading edge of where serow science is going and certainly is going to be an are of neuroscience that going to expand in the years to come and doctor happen and the members of his laboratory are among a very small group of scientists in the world that are using the types approaches that are described a minute ago and thatyou can hear more about in to day's episode in order to resolve some of the most difficult and debilitating human conditions during to day's discussion you will also learn about the use of deep brain stimulation and other approaches for the treatment of movement disorders such as e mental tremor parkinson's disease and various types of dystopias which are challenges in generating particular types of movements whether not you or somebody that suffers from an eating disorder from obsessive compulsive disorder r from a movement disorder to day's episode is sure to teach you not only about what is happening in those arenas but also in the arenas of nor science generally in fact i would take today's episode is especially important for any one that wants to understand how the brain works and what the future of brain modification really looks for all of us before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your means to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites an cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back tolectrolike ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element e doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element e doctor slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor case happen case i should say doctor halpurn this listening welcome thank you grebe yams ben long time coming we colleagues at stamford and then recently you move course to universe pennsylvania also in incredible institution we sorry to lose yous is before for me to stamford's loss is you pens gain but let us talk about your work past and present give told the listeners already your euro surgeon which i consider the astronauts of her science because you are in somewhat uncharted territory ere very uncharged territory and yet precision is everything i the the margins of error are very very small for those that are not familiar with the differences between her surgery neurology psychiatry you just educate us a bit what does a nor surgeon do and what does the fact that your nurse surgeon do for your view of the brain how d you think about and conventionalized the bring it is a scope of hero surgery is quite broad o whet i was in medical school i i was drawn to her surgery because of a procedure known as depbraind stimulation when i was a pen as a college student i actually watched my first detrain stimulation surgery perform by cordon potluck who to to day does not one of my career mentors deeprainstimulation is a one surgery that nervous surgeons offer but it is actually sort of a very small minority of what nervous surgery does a a we take out brain tumors we clip aneurisms in the brain a we take care patients that have aromatic brain injury a concussion spine surgeries ninety present of what arvo suctions do around the country a your taking care of herniated disks and lumbar fusions ththescope is the entire central nervous system include including the rifle nervous system we take care patients with carpal tunnelsongero and nerve disorders now of the course of the past two decatesors there is been a a mission in the field to to subspecialize and historically neurosurgeons did everything in that domain but now we subspecialize and i am lucky to be at pen medicine were we can focus on one of these areas a ma chief of statant in frontal hero surgery all i do is deep brain stimulation surgery and a compliment to that is focus culture sound or transcranial focus culture sound which is a non invasive way to do in oblation in the brain recently f d approved and it is hefty a prove for tremor at the moment a these two procedures are for me my every day but a still the minority of what nerds urgent have to offer the majority of hero surgery in my mind is is a bit more structural than it is physiology or deeply rooted in in how the brain functions a when we take out a braintumor we have to find a a safe trajectory to get to the brain tumor and then we remove it and we help the patient recover in the ice sou similar to a brain anus often we do not have to go into the brain to clipper brain anus and but we go around the brain or under the brain to get there and in my mind those surgery are bit more structural deepbrain stimulation a the surgery that i do routinely is a procedure where yes there is structure involve of course we have to place a a very thin wire that is insulated deepen to a part of the brain that is involved in parkinson's disease for example a but that is actually not the therapy the therapy is delivering electrical stimulation through the tip of that wire or one of the tips as directly are multiple contacts at the bottom of the wire very small a but that is all done out of the operating our this stimulation wire is connected to a a battery pack or pulse generator that is kind of a pacemaker and we deliver this therapy i know es relations it is a bit more i have to implant a a a tool to to delivery a medication but that medication is convey in the form of electricity and it is can to be delivered into a very small region of the brain and it is that procedure that is it inspired me to not just become a nerossergion but a has really defined the a focus of my research laboratory as well may be by way of antic you could tell us a one of the more outrageous were surprising or who knows a delightful and thrilling things about the brain that you have observed as a consequence of stimulating different brain areas you known text books we always hear about a the cold of dark stuff stimulate one brain area somebody goes into a rage stimulate another brain area first starts laughing uncontrollably first of all am given that some of the information tit is not much but some of the information text books is in correct is are those sorts of statements true can one observe those in the clinic and what are some of the more interesting a and i do not know curly mean entertaining but a surprising things that you have seen when you have a poked around in the brain a deliberately of course and i what have you seen what you heard i have to say i i i am amazed by these effects a everydect ism very privilege to be able to interact with the human brain in this way it is always in them with the goal of trying to provide somebody with the meaning fultherapy but when we deliver electrical stimulation the these electrodes while they might be sitting in a very small region of the brain there are are regions within a few millimeters of where these electrodes are that if stimulated could cause a temporary very brief side effect a moment of laughter you said or a moment of panic and of course we can just shut that electrode off but often these side effects could e be therapeutic and actually that is how we have discovered ways to use deep brain stimulation a not just for movement disorders parkinson dies but for example patients with parkinson disease that have a psychiatric a a morbidity depression or obsessive compulsive disorder lot of these nations are highly compulsive and impulsive a sometimes these problems actually melt away and we are trying to help their tremor but the patients also tell us that their gambling issue has gotten better or their mood has improved and why is that well you know there is probably more than one reason you can help somebody is mood by making their tremor go away of course but we see laughter in the clinic sometimes and and why is that that is because we are stimulating parts of the brain that are not just involved in these motor circuits but they are also involved in what we call a limbic circuit or or part of the brain involved in emotion and if we learn how to modulate those areas therapeutically step by step we can actual develop these therapies for other indications depression i would say the most impressive and consistent effect we have when we have a patient with tremor who has been removing for the past twenty years if we can deliver stimulation thou that electron in the clinic we have immediate relief o tremor and that is the effect that inspired me to be a nervous surgeon when i was in college have never early wanted to do anything else except help develop that type of their pubic for an other another kind of symptom ism very interested in obesity and related eaten disorders compulsive behavior that urge to auto have something that might be delicious but dangerous or unhealthy or a drug for compulsion we see in used or to of compulsive disorder a interestingly we see tremor melt away when we deliver electricity to a certain part of the brain we can see these psychiatric more psychiatric problems are not all psychiatric disorders but let us say a a disorders of the brain we can see symptoms of those disorders also improve and often immediately just we do with tremor a i see it all the time to to to pick out one a would be would be a challenge because a for me this is my i every day the speed of the relief that you described for tremor is really m incredible just thinking about drug therapies and there two there are side effects but there still lot of mysteries as references why asses arise even work when they work and the timing is always challenge timing dosage yes absolutely am it'd love to learn more from you about o see i i have several reasons for asking this a first of all om a somewhat obsessive person i tend to be very very narrowly focus although i confess its not a stop function it takes me some time to turn off the chatter but one time into a thought train or a mode of being an thinking and work it is very hard for me to exit that that mode it is a deep trench adaptive in some circumstances less adapt in others as the others that when i was a kid i had a orbit of a grunting tick i i had a a this intense intense desire to clear my throat am to the point where my my dad said you need to stop that ease to squeeze my hand every time i do it and i used to hide in the back see o the carer in the closet to do it because it provided much relief and then it eventually passed if i was not medicated they never did anything about it every once in a while now if ism very fatigued if have been working a lot i notice it starts to come back it'll do this kind of grunting and it is been a sort of a a pet in or a latch symptom for me that reminds me that these the circuits exist in all of us and that sometimes they go hay wire and sometimes they just have settle am over excitation or something that sort and then the third reason is that i get thousands of questions ago olid could you perhaps just tell us what is olid tram what are some rain areas involved what a the current range of treatments and what is the difference between someone who is obsessive and somebody who has true olid a a brief disclosure as as a narrow surgeon i do take care of patients with severe obsessive compulsive disorder a but my perspective on olid may be a little bit different than a psychiatric to who lives in breathes olid and sees patients every single day with olid ai probably take care of a three to five patients a year with deeper in stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder i do not see these patients as routinely but my laboratory is geared as a researcher a ism very focus on trying to improve outcomes of deepraind stimulation for for olid sway i do feel i have a expats and and a perspective to share but just o a brief disclosure a i i do feel that as a narrow surgeon i am obligated to better understand we the obsessions in the brain come from and how we can interrupt them to stop the compulsion that is associated with the obsession sort of the intrinsic most feature of olid a better than we are actually doing it a for example if we were to offer a patient with tremor deeperain stimulation surgery of course there is some risk to the procedure but the outcome is consistent and positive that many patients are willing to take on that risk a for obsessive compulsive compulsive disorder the surgery risk is about the same however the benefit is not quite as robust and a lot of patients and their referring sychitris are reluctant to refer these patients to us and it is completely understandable a have been a leading an endeavor with a number of claverities around the country to try to better understand the circuits in the brain a study them in humans both invasive and not invasive that would be with an electro based surgery a sort of we do wit that please to understand were seduces come from we would not understand better were obsessions come from but were also working with imaging experts and genetics to understand olid a at a broader level as well a i i consider olid to be a a spectra disorder and a way and i i i apologize to those to who might feel that ism using that terming correctly ism using it in a way to describe patients that have obsessions and even some related compulsions might not meet criteria for sit a it may be something android that that you have and as a narrow surgeon ism really obsessive about safe and compulsive about my surgical procedures i i think that some aspect of olid which we often joke about but we should consider seriously cause people do suffer from this a some aspect of it helps us a there are famous a see es that probably have some level of o side ah surgeons and scientists alike ah perhaps if it can be controlled it is an asset and abut if it goes are and is uncontrollable then it becomes obsessive compulsive disorder and a i tend to see the patients that are the most severe they have failed medication and there are multiple medicpatientstha are worth trying for side some can actually be very helpful ah which nor transmitter systems do they tend to pocket well assess arise or sort of the the first aline for side but also tricyclics can be helpful this is still the serene and system ah but as we know the serene of system in reacts with the you don't know ritenurgic a system and the do not mean system it is hard to a a be specific to one of these things a and i think that also why it is hard for us to predict how these medications are going too work for these kinds of patients but tricyclics and esse sunrise can be very helpful and are definitely first line and there is others a exposure response prevention is a probably the most effective option which is kind of cognac behavioral there debut these are different and offered by psychologists and this is a whole field and there is a a a field i should say a whole clinic at my institution a a focus do started by ednafoa a a a pen who this is what they do for these patients a it is offer these types of cognitive therapies exposure to the stressed and to try to get patient to habituate to whatever it is that stresses them and causes these a compulsions to help these patients live in every day an function the these are all fabulously helpful pay a therapies for variety of patients but there is still about thirty percent of patients that still suffer from side and some of them have severity sometimes its modern to severe and those of the patients that ism really motif it try to help a our therapies for those patients right now i would say are are worth pursuing but not potable a and it is it is one of those thingsthat we have to balance as a researcher because when you see patients this you want t everything cannot help them and i think it is important to educate patients on the risk and benefits of them this is deep brainstimulation surgery but also capsalodomy which is more than ablation approach a little bit deepen stimulation but rather than delivering stimulation though an lecture you can actually heap the tissue and even destroy it some would say this part of the brain is very safe to destroy its kind of an appendix a others would say it safer to modulate i have seen a patients do very well with these oblation's and you ask me earlier what what i find amazing about the brain these affects that we can have sometimes the lack of effect is what am sing you can actually a traverse parts of the brain without having any adverse affects on patients a function at least that you can test a but you can also destroy small parts of the brain or talking three or four milometers in size these little oblation's can be really helpful for patients but have no obvious sideeffects that we can tell perhaps after a short recovery from surgery a but none the less destroy how safe they might be a these herdic recede are still our surgical procedures and patients are hes proceed especially when they know that their chance of a transformation effect is quite low we we can generally a achieve a responder rate of about fifty per cent a and responders still have symptomatic olid ism really a acervate spared to a really find a way to deliver these therapies in a more disease specific or symptom specific way but a were years away probably from from that the since it is all part of a recent study at the moment what brain areas should i think about when i think about olid years ago i remember opening after book thngwas an undergraduate still and work from audit wrap aport at the national institutes of mental health this would be lay eighties really nineties was a had done some our imaging or maybe was pet of a some other imaging technique and had identified portions of the bail gangleafter am body titanium to structures in old and a maybe some differences in boys verses girls what brain areas are their sex differences and terms of side and were one to come into your clinic this for this sort of a work of oblations or stimulation a where would you fir start to probe in the brain it this is a a a disorder of both quarter and the subs quarter a the cortical control areas areas that are involved in inhibitor control we have found to not function properly impatience with olid areas the or front a quarter and the prefrontal quarter if you image these areas or study them even in a a a rode model of olid which quite honestly these models they model aspects of sit but sit is a human condition you cannot really model this whole condition in a in a mouth or rat but perhaps you can model compulsive behavior in a rat short an not you the her o exactly that is that is not necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder but that is compulsive behavior and perhaps if you can ameliorate that in a rat that might be helpful for patient with olid but we have to approach animal modelling of it thoughtfully a and i an i and most scientist do i think amulet we study sit and in models or in inhuman with imaging and and we are trying to do it invasive with with electron we do an epilepsy patients we we find that areas in the quarters the prefrontal and her r front quarters are are not functioning they the way they would in a non out patient they're often hyper functioning a such that while you might say where their hyperofunctionings o are not these patients function better that the hyperfocus the hyperofocust exactly a no i i would say it is is not much an upper or down it is more that they are just dysfunctional and we need to find a way to try to restore normal function to these areas is not much directional really a we we tend to over simplify brain function by thinking about it with directionality too much a unfortunately imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation or hypo activation and that is where i think these kinds of things can be misconstrued but what i would call the quartic tries of kids that they are deregulated a and we need to find a way to trennormalize their function a the fronchallobis is huge but fairies of the frontal lobe their bit more basil the o f so obeafrom a quarter in the prefrontal quarter definitely consistently seem to be a implicated impatient with a o s d and then their projections to the subquartexas is the basil ganglyali you were saying caught a putamen are the dorsal trade i and these are inner connected with the ventral trade am this is an are the brain that i a focus a lot of my energy and a this is the ventral stratum which is not limited to but includes the needles eccumbants a this is an area of the brain that a we know to be involved in gating reward seeking behavior when it is perturbed it seems to gait compulsive behavior meaning a rat will pursue a reward to spite punishment despite a rootstock for example and that can be a similar to i nobody patient they will a check their home for safety until three i m in the morning and not sleep that night in a way that is similar to a rat seeking out a forward a despite a rootstock a doing something because of the urge but despite the risk and perhaps there is some normal judgment there a we all have to take risks to function in everyday society a to be successful we have to take e risk a to take care patients with surgery there is some risk there we make a judgment call and a that is not a condition that that is just normal a but when our judgment is consistently a sort of puts us tat risk that is where we have something o so but kids also it is one of many conditions that suffer from these kinds of proms we tend to label them a because they tend to present in a consistent way s we have patients with o so d that have hyprochecking behavior or a contamination behavior where they if they feel contemned they'll wash their hands for hours repeatedly or if they drop their tooth push on the floor this will lead to a compulsive behavior of cleaning a tooth brash rush in your teeth consistently very very common symptoms that we see a or signs at the patients report to us or or that we observe but you do not patients with eating disorders they tend to if if they have been give disorder thou over eat if they have believe me they might purge despite the risk of these things and a addiction is is similar we we ten to drug seek if were addicted a i will we pal to a dealer a in order to get our fix and despite the risk and and that type of urged despite the risk is something that i have always been really interested and in it is a common denominator to all of these problems and if you think about these problem these are some of the most common conditions in our society to day it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve i delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there's i sorry taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiatics that i need for got health our got is very important is populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probation in athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastesgripe if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic greenstone calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a item and three k to i really appreciate that your building this bridge for to d to lucky s a commons which is of course associate with reward in various forms and will get to that am it'll char a personal anecdote as a as a form of question i was in college a and studying a lot i relied on can as a stimulant have never really been into drugs of in lucky in that sense i do not drink and i to care lass at all this appeared never li recreation drug s never drawn to them however when i was in college m at the time there was es epineferan pills that wore ism common in a lot of sport supplements i the rely rework out time things yes not unlike energy drinks now which i completely avoid i and i had this experience of taking one of these and drinking some coffee and of course it gave me a lift in energy these are very similar them paddy never legal over the counter at the time there now either band e rely i do not recommend them and i had a lot of energy but what i noticed is that my grunting to came back and i had i made one mistake i still think of this as one mistake which was i i engage in a superstitious behavior i knocked on wood and then somehow it felt very warding it gave me some tolly irrational but internally rational sense of of security around i forget what i was knocking on wood about and i found that i could not break that knock on wood compulsion i felt i needed to knock on wood and then i started sneaking knock on woods in midexam and studying and pretty soon i was knocking on wood often i developed a superstition and ism curious about the role of superstition and compulsion in the cross over there make sense logically to me but i was equally shocked to learn that when i stop taking this stimulant which i was quite happy to to stop because hit did make me feel too alert could not sleep well et camera that the superstition went away as well and ism guessing this has something to do with some of the reward circuitry as it is called related to stimulants mum again i am not encouraging anyone to take stimulants although healthy use of cane or safe use of canine might be the one universally accepted stimulant i it was really surprising to me how quickly this came on how quickly it engaged my my thinking and my behavior the obsessions and compulsions and how quickly turned off when i stop taking this sport stimulant or whatever it was i n you remember i think it was some form of pan afford in a federal sh some s not pan sufferance use me idea spoke a federal i is what i described om totally outside the bounds of a a logic or we my imagining it all no it happened ism certain it happened i do not think you are imagining at all i your this the grunting that you you mention to me your fortify i did not the comment but that that sort of not putalabel lot o but it sounds a tick and taxon in young males extremely common and they do tend to go away lion likes is have a good friend who i she famous nor scientists i will not mention who it is who work very hard to suppress his is blinking is and when he gets fatigued it comes back and and am he is very high function yes in his personal life in his professional life but i but when you are talking to i an he starts doing this the a start wonderingly it is gone on in it is unfortont people with these problems especially as they get more severe than you get toretcendrome it is hard to function in our society i have some friends that have beret it'll tell you i ism just inspired because there i they are confident and you no people obviously notice these problems but they they just lived their life in the very successful and that is not typical i i have i have friends that i went to pen with undergrad that had these kinds of problems than i was always just happy and inspired by them but what is more typical as these probes caused people to lose their confidence and and not be no i pursue their profession as they may have done or i thinks of that nature i i think it is all related to the fact that we our brains are very vulnerable and to get back to your question about the stimulant i think i think your brain was very vulnerable to it you you certain maybe had a predisposition to it a you mention that you have our a little obsessive and with the tick there may be have this kind of on the on the mild side of the spectrum c d a and i i probably do as well by the way i also also have avoided a drugs for that reason in my life it'll drink a little bit of wine here an there but that is about it a and abut i i think most real dulnibl it these things and we see these problems in relation to not just taking a stimulant but any kind of environmental exposure our own society causes much stress a and that is why i think we have these human conditions these are human conditions we try to model them in in animals but most animals do not have these kinds of problems give heard that you can animalize a monkey in the wild can have depression monkeys version of depression but i do not think it is really typical or human depression and certainly it is not as prevalent as depression is in our human society i think we have not evolved to manage the stresses that are in this society that we currently have and stimulants is probably one of them and i i i suspect you ware probably little vulnerable a it is possible the stimulant ta let to an overdrive of your prefrontal and oprofontal quarter and even brought out a little o see behavior related to this super the of superstition that you had a i believe that entirely and i also think yow that is why thinks o c d and other kinds of psychiatric disorders tad to present themselves in college when people leave their home and they are in school and their stressed and they are getting exposed to things that they have not been exposed to before outside of the home and youknow their brains are not evolved and a sophisticated enough yet to help them cope wit these kinds of stresses and how it manifest is in these kinds of conditions and it do not have put a label on those conditions but certainly could be a psychiatric disorder but would also gest be lots of anxiety i could also be a the kind props it thatyou had as well m and i think the newly accumbent and the cortical airs the we havebeen discussing that that sort of send projections to these areas are are probably at least one of the main circuits in solve in these kinds of things relieved it is no longer present but i confess it i always feel it close by a a long run helps m yo not being as slightly fatigued not overly fatigue but slightly fatigues son o to out that the count o physical compulsion but try to channel it am never taken any medication for and here i am i am still still going i may call you for a reform some point butter this when ism a i feeling o k am let us talk about newcleas sicummens and rewards circuitry and the relationship between o c d reward addiction and to just give your sense of were headed with this is into the realm of a food related and eating related a be behaviors in disorders yes i know you are doing it ism very important work there what is nucleus incumbent i know we all have one were to a one on aside the brain what is it at what rules does it play am in healthy bring behavior and in pathology the needles recumbent is a part of the brain part of our reward circuits the hub of the reward circuits that have always been most fascinated and a there are scientists around the world some of the leading argue we from the leading scientists in the world the father f a diction or science i call him a although he tells me ism not a ramalanka who has studied the bucks accumbent since the beginning of his career who i worked with when i was at standard a fabulous scientist ament or taught me much a taught the world much incredible yeersand scientist and hand physician yes m m end it and a brilliant in both ways and a very fatherly in a lot a way in terms of teaching people how to how to do science and and be good citizens as well a but a the needles recumbent is an area that is also very complicated because it has a lot of functions a it interconnects with many parts of the brain a but there are some things about the nukes accumbent that are very consistent a when i start getting interested in reward and what a what i could do as a surgeon to tried to improve how we manage rewards and what i mean by that specifically is if you have an urge for a reward that that is a normal phenomena a that is not something we are trying to stop the issue is if you have an urge for reward that either puts you or somebody else at risk it is probably a reward we should not have i suppose you can say well depends on the size of the reward in the size of the risk and how that fits into your societal norms a but for example if you are a jobs and a you have a doctor who is advising that you lose weight and try to control your eating habits perhaps a better few choices is an important way for you to be healthier and and not pursuing those better food choices that is an urge that we probably need to treat if you are a dramatic and you abuse heroine or point consider the opiate crisis right now or cone a a which is untreatable at the moment a that that cocaine might make you feel but you haves some more energy that day to to deal with your work or that point might make you feel better cause life is stressful but the risk of doing those things is really high in fact potentially awful a ut that is an urge that is treatable a you have sit and you cannot sleep at night because you are nervous that yod unlock the door and you check thirty times a that is the reality for some people with severe sit a that is an urge we got a treat eating disorders the same eating eating disorders and obesity are obviously like because of the relationship of a patient with food but there also quite to stink not everybody with obesity has not eating disorder and obviously not everybody with an in disorder has obesity a ism particularly interested impatience that have been getting disorder as well as obesity because they are heavily liked not everybody with binging disorder has obesity but a on average most are overweight a we are doing a deep insulation trial at pen where we are trying to modulate the newly succumbed an understand it better impatience that have failed gastric bypast surgery the most a aggressive form a treatment for obesity and we and we believe they failed gastric pipe surgery because of fighting disorder meaning they just cannot control how much they eat their obesity is either related or even do to overeating not some predisposition to a that body habits obesity is a finance something that we can see not everybody is obit because of the same thing it is very important i was taught this by a close return friend tom warden when he was the director of the ability center at pen or the senterfor weight eating disorders and and he said me you know case a your be careful with obesity you are your interested and addiction and i understand your interested in the vindictive tendencies of certain patience with obit a a and and and their relationship with for but not everybody with obesity has that problem and and in fact it is it is probably present to about twenty percent of patient with obesity but not taking a step back twenty per cent of patient with obesity is still a massive problem a epidemic proportions and perhaps some of these patients have either some form of beengiing disorder or or should say some degree of aging disorder for at least loss of control eating which is common to both a that is a feature that i think eating disorder experts obesity experts near surgeons ability met ability medicine experts would agree is common to eating disorders and obesity and i also believe wit is common to attics a and perhaps patience with otitis serve a loss of control disorder a it is actually not a disorder known by the design five some diagnostic manual but a feature i should say of these conditions that is common and that common denominator i believe can be restored or at least this problem can be ameliorated or improved upon by a better understanding and a tailor treatment to the replies a common specifically a we've learned in mice a that if you expose a mouse not as just a model if you expose a mouse to o high fat food not food that they would normally eat food that a is sixty per set fat high fats butter a we have learned that if you expose them to food that within two weeks there newly succombencs is not functioning a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food there is aspects of it that are hyper active i could say and there is aspects of it that our high proactive or decreased activity but either way it is it is not functioning properly and most likely that function is predisposing continued behavior and then probably eventually leads to things a habit that gets developed and that is the whole other area of these kinds of problems that is very complicated and poorly understood but in any case if we just focus on the behavior a at hand it seems that repeated exposure to something high fat food a drug of abuse or any type of reward that is a really strong reward it in a way it can high jack normal functioning o the nucleus accmbense the goal of our a in vase of trial is to try to restore normal functioning to that uncles accumbent a in mice there seems to be a signal that predicts when they are going to lose control and we can use that signal to delivery sort of a a real time there be in the form of detrain stimulation just a brief amount of stimulation and that actually blocks the behavior and what is interesting is overtime that signal actually decreases in frequency which suggests some level of restoring normal function to that circuit in a mouse we are trying to do that now in a human trial fascinating where is the stimulation provided because i would imagine that if one were to stimulate newly succulents you would see a reinforcement of whatever behavior coincide or proceeded in the stimulation the stimulation it is a a brief delivery of stimulation anywhere between five and ten seconds that is intended to just disrupt the perturbed signaling that is happening in thenucless accumbent there are disorders depression let us say that i i would describe is a bit more of a state disorder and this is obviously oversimplified because we know that there is fluctuations in mood an depression is well do not let me oversimplify it too much am but a but fernawlets forgive the over simplification if we if we accept that depression is a state disorder or may be parkas o disease is a state disorderrecognizing that the do fluctuate a these types of problems most likely not but not definitely most likely need a continuous therapy of some for a their be that is consistent a perhaps if there be that fluctuates with the condition but nevertheless still consistent a been jiving disorder or o c d or addiction a and and bringing disorder in the contacts of obesity a lot of these patients are function quite normally every single day it is just that intermittently throughout the day there is brief interruptions in their normal functions such that they have thoughts about food or the drug of abuse ai the really longing to have and we want a deliver a episodic there be delivered at the right time and only at the right time to try to interrupt the circuit aberration or the the problem at hand that is going to lead to that dangerous behavior and to didn't get the patient back on track to what they are doing a i do not necessarily think that it leads to a reinforcement a it is possible a we have to study that more but rather the goal is to just disrupt perhaps what is kind of habitual a or or at least this kind of recurring problem that is happening people that have been going disorder at least it is severe level they tend a bitch about once a day but they do not been all day long of course they have a moment perhaps when they get home from work and their stress where they might have a bound o bench what constitutes a beige and a also want to know dis beginning disorder come on suddenly meaning as an entire disorder one day people wake out something they begging disorders is know a few too many buffets and ism being entirely serious here it can unlimited food and a circuit gets flipped or account of starts moving into the his p ms to speak am how dos it come on and a actually surprise to hear that it is once a day i would think just hear in begging this order i also it is set which probably fluctuates across the day as well but a don't have thought any time people round food they u simply cannot control the and take a food yes wares this look in terms of the on set of the disorder and then what you think in else this once a day type of fumthat is pretty interesting severe biting disorder a these patients will bench about once a day could be couple times a day but in general's not more than that moderate is about three or four times a week for example the reason i think that that seems surprising to you and if you think about it it is surprising but be but a not agree with you but the reason for that is is actually just in the definitions of the word and as a narrow surgeon in full disclosures i as i mention you know i do not see these patients clinically i see them for research trial purposes and i try to understand the literature around eating disorders and i obviously collaborate with ability in disorders a a in these problems i they highly innovative people a but the word beige is a definition there there is a definition to that word and you cannot necessarily been all day because our stomachs are not big enough a and a there is a limit to how much one can eat and to meet crater for bunch you have to have a sense of loss of control you have to eat enormous amount of food in a brief period of time and yes generally that does not happen more than about once a day in a patient with severe bengaline disorder a however they cannot lose control quite often and in fact perhaps even at every meal they might meet criteria for about o loss of control were they yes they may have lost control but they might not have eaten enough to constitute what we would defend as a fence a and that would be in it a that there is no specific number to that by the way it is it is really just compared to their normal meal perhaps it is a fifty percent of their daily calories in that one brief moment a a that is that is why i think it seems surprising that benders are not happening more often than that a what i would say is if we replaced the term binge with loss of control eating loss of control eat could happen does of times a week a and in fact near the patients that were studying we have we have seem patients that i lose control twenty thirty times a week a and that is probably the the term you happen mind when your say you are surprise that is just one time a day and it is specifically really to the fact that these patients have to eat such a large amount of food in such a brief period of time a is hard to do that more than once in i see you mention that som preexisting anxiety might buy a somebody to have a beige ism also fastininted by something have observed before as when i was in college my my girl friend had a room ate who we were were was bulimic and would beige and then verge and often a when she invested alcohol that would lead to a binge sore which is kind of the opposite of anxiety when i think about alcohol something that slightly reduces prefrontal activity somewhat of a sedative or certainly said of hiredosages this brings to something that due said ism just going a i will not say it as eloquently as you did that it seems it is not neither the case that anxiety leads to begging nor that hobo reduce activation of the for brain an lower anxiety leads to benjingus is it is this deregulation of circuitry that that the season could go either way and it and it can throw things off it is off balance in both cases yes ah it is a and that seems to be a that seems to pose a problem it seems tie git is a particularly tricky problem and kind of explains to me in my non clinical awareness why medication might be really hard to use as a way to treat this but that bendable to poke around in the brain and assay in real time in how do you feel you feel binding now or do you feel am further from the benjimpulse is that what you do with these patients ore they awake while you are stimulating the brain cause it is one thing to say i stimulate a ordinary and the binding goes away or it i partial relief or complete relief but how do are they in there with a donut and you are tempting them how do you had shy know if it is a blading a brain areas going to lead to a relief or exacerbation or no impact on it on this disorder yes a title there is a lot unpack there am it'll try to go once to ut a time and if i if i is something please r now and i tend to ask these three part questions if i the a surgeons because i to challenge you gancause again o are the ask your not of her sines also ism just can take a moment to poke it her her thatch your rends a where her surgeons and i cancer case and out o me considers me a friend but i or to him of rend am teasing there to which is first of all they all have incredible hands right they have ism not such they all guard their hands with the kind of a protection that you would guard that the tools of the most important tools are your trade they are very careful with their hands you are not in the same them doing heavy dealers at you are not because of the way that impact it in the mother onsthey it is all about fine control yes am figure nor surgeon does heavy deadleffs you might want a consider getting into front nerve sir ut bit don't put any one at a work there and then the other the other thing is that you all are tend to be very calm people a least on the exterior we will return to this later abut i do throw three or four questions out at once elevated autonomic arousal on a alertness was well as decrease autonomic arousal a alertness moth seem to be able lead to binging and then there is this question of how do whether not to stimulate were to a blate or whether not to leave a structure alone in other words what is one of these experiments look in the laboratory ye sir clinic excuse me you course yet it these are questions i think abut all the time u and i do not to come back to the dead lifting common u regarding and you and you refer to this earlier is well do not know i addressed it sufficiently either is is sort of what what comes first here or how does this develop i i think first of all i i i i to understand these kinds of problems in in sort of the the construct of but i i consider to be a bit of too hit hypothesis a a set of need to the concussion literature you need the second hides can be devastating if you have a concussion you on a only return to play when you are systems are gone am cleared by a physician a the contacts of eating disorders or lets say binging disorder an first of all i i did not mentionable but this is the most common eating disorder affects anywhere between three and five per cent of the population a and is probably under dike not in obesity by the way if i best effects thirty five per cent of our population most likely been gene disorder effects more than three o five per cent but that is that is the current a literature a estimate on on the prevalence a how do we develop in genie disorder in is related to this anxiety question yo dow i think that there is a predisposition that is the first hit am i should think all humans have this predisposition just some haven't more than others i do not think that we have evolved to live in a society where foods are readily available and enormously delicious and have much sugar and fat in them not that there is any tick you are problem with either of these mat be my cronutriencs it is just the excess of it a and how they are refined ah that i think it is the problem the huh brutal coincervan almost everything we eat went is in bread i avens y been a wise and bread sometimes it's just count crazy i do not i do not think we are revolved to live in a society that that has food that is readily available that and cheap by the way infant the cheaper the foods are theory of the the more refined and palatable and i would argue dangerous meet i think they change our reward circuits for the worst am and put us at risk for wanting more i tend to get a headachewhen i eat food that and and perhaps that is a evolutionary advantage because i do not want to eat those whose cause it they actually do make me sick in a lot always i i can't wish that had on everybody because perhaps we wouldn't have all these problems a early some of them would go away i think that is for the first tissue is a a predisposition to a or vulnerability to these types of foods which we undoubtedly all have to a certain extent but some more than others and then and then and that is that is the first hit is this predisposition in the contact of this sort of food focus society and then the second hit is probable's a stressful event or stressful life am and it probably recurring stressful event ism not sure this is published have never sat down with tike a eating to sort of expert and and had this question of a howls develops and ism mot sure it is actually well well known but in a longways i think that that answer anybody would agree with that we need sort of a predisposition and the exposure the environmental exposure in the genetic predisposition am but also a stressed and that stressed is probably one that is recurring and it is obvious in our society stresses are everywhere and how we can manage them is is often poor and you in i think we can all relate with that and then there is something else in the background that i think it is really important to mention is that patience with these kinds of problems a embarrassed because our society does not think fondly of these kinds of patience begging distort of patience they they do tend to be over weight that is obviously a stigma obis obesity is another stigma then there is the opposite in a way it is an opposite by the way for from a find type standpoint that is anorexia i mean that is another stigma and you knogush not to make this about one sex over r another but when when girls are told their pretty because there thin it just reinforces this problem and of course you want a compliment people and make them feel good about themselves but the problem is that in this vulnerable society that that can lead to problems because people start thinking o i should be thin or thinner am i i think that it is a little bit of a social understanding that our brains are veryblnerable and i think that will really help changing society is hard and most of society's not porting ill meaning a it is all done by accident am but that that is the society that we live in if we can try to improve that stigma a and and be kinder to people in that way i think a lot of these props would get better people that are obit that feel embarrassed by their obesity it does not help it only makes it worse could they give up same thing might be true for ataraxics am i really think it is important to consider all of these things and and that is why it is complicated and it it would be hard to do a well controlled study to understand it better because there many of these variables to control for that you really cannot control for might built a control for them in in a mouse's home cage but not not in the society that we live in that that is kind of my brief sort of summer how i would answer your your first question than i i think your second question i i sort of take that is how do you study such a complicated problem in the operating room and and in the clinic because hi mention the operating because that sort of the first step here a first we one who we have a just to clarify we have a a and i funded a trial approve by the f t a for for research to do this first an human study am we have treated two patients we have four more to come at pen in am and in this study a it something have been working towards my entire career a what we do not know is where in the newly ciccumbence will we identify selves or regions that seem to be a involved in this for of reward seeking behavior i would call it a positive it is cunt appetite but the word a positive is i think a good word to yous wat what part of the newly comments is a positive is the whole thing a petter probably not it is huge in my world it is due as a ho surgeon i i target parts of the brave that are three or four millimeters in size the needless comments is almost a perimeter in size well civilize is that large ye the reminds me of discussions around the man galeveryone things a mage gone fear id miles got a lot different subregion and stimulation of certainars in the man gala makes people feel great that is and other stimulation of other airs makes them feel terribly afraid exactly and and that should not surprise us because w hen we treat patients with parkinsons disease for tremor if we are in one part of the subthilemic nuclear will help their tremor if we are in another part of the subthilmic nucleus the naralljust is looking at me why is not this working and that should not surprise us we already know that you two or three milometers deviation or two or three millimeters away for where we want to be and you might not have the result you want and that is probably also true for these more limbic structures the evicdula in uncles occumbans a you now regarded the newly succumbed we traverse some of the needles combers not all of it in order to place the electrode that we want to use to detect when cravings are happening for example and to tread a block the cravings from leading to the behavior related to the the reward seeking which is the overeating in this case a what we decided to do in the operating room was to actually try a leverage a tool that we use all the time what we take care patients with parkinsons with parkinsons these body's patients not all have tremor and when we place an lectured into this motor structure to try to improve their movement disorder a we often can hear tremor selves and they sound we convert their electrical signal to an audible signals we can should hear it a and in it sounds kind of the tremor looks the frequency of the signal is the same as the hand shaking awesanon and that the patient with parking's is is them trembling yet they are awake and you are spoken around in a in a dedicated careful way of course one poke at a time one poke at a time with a very fine wirer send of wires listening to the electrical activity until you you encounters themselves that are sending out electrical activity ad a similar frequency exactly and then you can stimulate them ore quiet them and see if the tremor goes away we we are very confident that when we stimulate that area of in this case the subthilemic nucleus a we we will make that tremor we will disrupt that tremor circuit and that tremor will dissolve and it does that is why parkinsons is beautiful and inspiring in a your tractable yet exactly what is the make us feel we understand the brain y at least in that limited way what is the a analogue to tremor in terms of appetite and desire to be in trading craving is a term that there is a the other terms we could use by the way but that that is the term were chosen to use for a number of reasons one because people relate with that term people that have been getting disorder or obesity they if you ask them if they crave the answer will often be yes if you ask them if they lose control or beige they might not know what you mean or they might not actually feel out of control even when they are a a but the word craving is relatable and we set out to see if we could identify craving s ells ah in a patient with o c d which is related in fact we trigger a very similar part of the brain ah we tried to identify sells related to obsessions and we believe we did do that it's a single case study a where we try to optimize where our electro would was place we had some proof of concept that we would be able to elicit a sir of disease specific symptom in the operating room assuming the patient could tolerate being awake not everybody needs to be awake for this procedure but at lease for these first and human trials where a were trying to were trying to establish where in the brain we need to be hi think this type of approach is really critical and coupon by the way none of this has been published a but i think it is important for people to know this i i am willing to share some aspects of what we are trying to do a but a but that is that is really the first goal of this trial is too identify where the nearly succombens we can detect these craving cells we have to provoke food craving in the operating from that is the first thing how do you do that ah well a there are some a somewhat validated ways to do that ah for example we asked patients to provide pictures of food that they rate very highly as something at they would typically crave and you are depending on the patient it might be something that is very salty it could be very sweet a donut a answered i love donuts ears or great you should you should try the front when your her near exit fino that sort of thing reasons they want want you can the were we on won by i a to try to stop yourself after that was i were one of these patients given the fact that ah the binges come on pretty seldom once a day do you imagine you have them come to the the operating room fasted we are lemme fasted their fast y o gather fasted which prole their poly surgical yes reasons for wanting that ears e come have to be i and then you if you've done the craniotomy removed a patch of skull yes lower the wire s a neurally recumbent and then they are viewing pictures of food that they crave and thinking about it do they have am a factorycuse smells of crowns ye i on love to do the efactorycause we have not implemented that but that is say a great a thank you rial give you for credit when we do eat grab at idiom glad as work is funded because i now this is when i it'll make this time it is not a joke when i referred to you all a you our borrow surgeons a as the astronauts of the brain out this is our on the extreme age of what we do not know if about how the rain functions and this is far an away different in giving a mouse access to give hi that for not at that ism not being disturbing of the mouse work but the person says well ism the patient this case i might say ism hungry i do not at sounds really good right now but craving to me is i i it'll cross the street cross town be late for my meeting e three of these yes maybe even hide that from somebody that cares about me does not want me doing this this kind of thing hide it for myself yes this these kind of behaviors i'mprojecting unfortunate that i i have cravings for things in life but a do not to s not among the more extreme of them a this is all happening in real time and you are listening to the cells the same way you would listen to in search for them cells exactly same exact tools and you doing that by am recording from a a small population cells in the area yet in fact we do get musty unit activity which is multiple cells a but we really try to find one a single unit to listen to under yet because it is just a much easier to understand what that one neon is doing verses try to list multiple and a we also a measure look of potential recordings but those are analyzed which is more f a population response thousands of cells n a horrible sells exactly am that we measure off line m the device that we use to sort of treat these patients are intervene a that were studying a it cannot do singly in it recordings it is only doing these more population responses we correlate what we see in the operating m a the single unit level to the population response but we do that all off line am i can explain that in a moment a but yes we we try to identify these craving cells and a because this is a a feasibility study and we cannot you be in the operating searching for hours and hours and hours we do have some sort of we have guide lines that we have set for ourselves that we have a developed with the engage or the it a to make sure that what we are doing is feasible and safe as well we we will spend a limited time trying to identify these a craving cells but another a sort of a strategy that we think it is really important a the effect of the stimulation a lot of patients and this gets to set of your question earlier about cut o what comes first a lot of people when they when they beige or they lose control over food am or seek drugs that moment of vulnerability is preceded i what we call it a moment of sort of are meal negative affect which basely means right before they beige here feeling down or they feel stressed or anxious and they compensate for that momentary symptom i begging or losing control o for food not everybody he's crater for a beige i i tread a a specify that we are not we are looking at loss of control eating specifically just because the criteria of a beige is not as critical for us am what we want be able to do is trigger stimulation when this craving is detected by the device ah but we trigger it only when the craving is there and we believe that if we can sort of temporarily elevate their mood ever briefly again this is about five o ten seconds of stimulation only that perhaps that elevation and mood could actually sort of us rust the craving to beige cycle maybe that is a habit may be its not but if you crave and then you beige if we can interrupt that with this moment of feeling good that might be a really good thereby for a patient and in fact when we do deep rain stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder we can fairly reliably induce a positive affect the problem is that it is not sustained and the reason is likely not sustain just because with obsessive compulsive disorder we treat that condition with continuous stimulation and it is not surprising that overtime the effect in it goes away when they are in the clinical we turn the device on our patients feel great and we feel likely solve the problem but that call us the next day and their my my depression came back or moos d has not gotten better and my moods back to where it was can you can you get back to it was yesterday that felt great the brain loves formiostatic regular it does and it does not to shift after regression to the north right a and i think there is sort of a tolerance effect there a that a is is limiting the effect of continuous stimulation and actually in a mouse if you do continuous stimulation am the the sort of blockade of been meeting goes away actually in a mouse were actually demonstrated a we publish this not too long ago a impinges that if you deliver stimulation intermittently and only when sort of a craving signal is detected to speak a that that at that effect will be the most robust and durable a but if you deliver it continuously actually the benefit goes away over time have always encouraged my colleagues to consider more than episodic stimulation approach rather than continuous debris stimulation but of course that that is for these more episodic conditions whereas these more quotoqot state disorders was i oversimplified earlier they might need more of a continuous therapies that is definitely subject for a lot of research in the future a in any case am the goal in the operating room was to identify a craving cell a deliver stimulation safely but also to capture a moment of elevated mood we able a a to do that as we at we are in our used patients as well and also to get an interroperative casual we have a devices now in the operating room that allow us to get imaging in real time that there fabulous tools that we did not have ten years ago a we can confirm accuracy a where you can see where the elector it is exact precisely exactly a with zero point five millimeters of air superprecise a they were as precise as we think we need to be a and we use conictomics there is a tool in a brain imaging called a cartography a where we can actually measure circuit connections it is it is a indirect assay but we believe it is powerful it has its a e sumption but a anything in science but a we can actually a map out where the neuclys accumbent connected to a the prefrontal quarter sort of the cortical control an hypitory control pathway and were that pathway intersects with the neuclis accumbent and we can target that area a structure a those three goals of the surgery we we aim to set out to accomplish a and we believed if we achieve two of those three a that we would have a successful result in our in our early trial mason given that at least to me the inclination the interaxia is the mirror image of been geeing disorder and at least from what i learned one of the more deadly psychiatric conditions a but also quite common yes a is it possible that uncles accumbent this called reward circuit is also involved in interaxia but somehow it is the resistance to eating the craving of the fasted state or something that that is being reinforced and and assist for two reasons one because ism genuinely curious about interaxia have observed interaction a number of people i know an its a the striking thing to see somebody just resist food despite all better knowledge of the fact that they are getting quite ill maybe at risk of death but the other reason is that if in fact nuclear accumbent it is the sit which can harbor sells to promote craving and craving of a fasted states so speak then that i think might tell us something fundamental about how the rain works which is that structures do not control functions per a structures control dynamics s a interactions some a a forecaster conductor has a certain number of operations that they perform but really their main function is to coordinate the actions of a lot of things not to make sure that the violins always play in jest e certain way alongside the hobos he can tell him non a musician here ais have n precision for the ayes the usually get left out what is tat the elbows the i they usually gettignored my pair plays the elbow the i gets a great analogy by the way a you know i i i make the statement is a little controversial but i actually think people would understand where it is where were ism coming from a across all of these sort of somespecialties of medicine a but i i actually think especially with obesity remember its of tintype that is reflective often but not always of a behavior a but if you consider patients that have ability and they they exhibit some sort of compulsion towards foods the they overeat despite the risk of it i think those kinds of patients are more similar to anerecix can the are different a anorexia and obesity are both tintypes that are at least in the specificity of ability and in inertia a result of a compulsion to either over or under eat despite the risk a these types of compulsions are driven by recital pressures a a brainvoll notabilities that are probably more similar a than than they are different they they just happened to manifest differently a why they manifest differently is probably related to each patient's predisposition or perhaps preference a that is hard to know you i i have a personal connection to visiting disorders anereci included in a i i think it is a it is very scare a and it is a condition that a often in still fear in psychiatrists a because i think not not everybody by the way phenomenal a psychiatric that i work with both at standard and a pen a the are also involved in my obesity study that take care of these patients i men these are heroes but there is lot of sychitias are not in this domain that find anereciascare for the recent you said at has the highest mortality of all psychiatric conditions that includes to impression a because not only can these patients i suicide but they die of metabolic complications of being under weight a it is say a it is it is a scared condition i i relate with that i am trying over time to bridge what ism doing in obesity and binging disorder too anreciafer for two reasons one because i think these probe are more similar than they are different and too because of the need a and i think were well positioned a to a sort of tackle anorexia a a using similar approaches not identical but but similar approaches a the uncles recumbent has been studied in patients with anerexiain china actually mi postdoc my first stock who i had the honor to train a when i was at standard is a our surgeon in china when a before he came to me act was involved in in a trial of anorexia that had some benefits a and a their studies in a rope a a and elsewhere that i have examined preliminarily a the effects of deepen stimulation targeting the uncles eccumbencs a afore anorexia colleagues of mine in canada aadreslazadois a wonderful nor surgeon scientist has been studying the effects of going after area twenty five which is directly acted to the bucks accumbent by a you do not it's it is a honest elastic connection in a lot of ways you o perhaps delivering stimulation there could could be very similar to delivering simulationitho the combers all part of one critical in history control circuit he see benefits as well i i deftly think there is some evidence that this is an marry that we need to be study am i think our more episodic approach with response stimulation going after sort of a signal in the neuclis accumbent that seems to be related to the compulsion to with hold for meeting i think it is what we will be trying to accomplish ain our study it is a right now just being conceived though ah yet these studies they move slowly because you have to get a grant that grant gets reviewed by the ad i the six months after you submit it often gets rejected because it is too innovative and two high risk that you have to edit it and decrease the risk it takes my a fastest i took two years to get funded and i worry about that time frame because that is a lot of time for patients that directly to suffer that i might be able to help at least in small sample of patience am but that that is the nature of how these things go you will have to get auto a approval to do these kinds of things we try to do all of this in parallels an enormous undertaking and in a lot of ways for starting for scratch but in some ways we have some preliminary data to to go after this my hope is in about a year will have a similar trial for adirectsia a pen som more to come on that am and i not i were to the only allow it is trying to go after because of the the clear need what is the at is of non invade of brain stimulation oblation and blocking activating the brain i get a lot of questions about transcraninal magnetic stimulation i actually had that done as a restart subject sure now at burly rich ivories lad put a coil on my head i was tapping my finger in concert to a a a drum beat and then all a sudden a because of the stimulation it was impossible for me to keep time yes with the drum beat identical it is a pretty wild experience to not have motor control and a then to have motor control returned at the flip of a switch when some one ease's controlling the swencions exit especially easy my understanding is that transcranual magnetic stimulation being used to treat depression an number of other brain centrums a non invasive no no drilling through the skull the surgeons do not that surgeon's love to cut and drill a with purpose but they u but i my understands that the spacial precision is not that great is ultrasound is something i hear a lot about these days and my understand is t ultrasound can allow researchers inclinations to stimulate specific trainer is perhaps with more precision maybe you just give us a your coverage of what those are being used for what your thoughts on on a these forms of non invasive meaning no no flipping open of a piece of he skull the brained swim elation and blocked of brain activity sure i wanted a clarify also these these surgeries generally do not am by the way require a full craniotomy is usually just a small opening about the size of a dime in the bone so just just to clarify aimless do right a usually without pain yet we lob in a scalp nothing we gave a scalp block and the patients regretting ivy sedation they general do not feel anything and if they do they tell me and we give the more local aesthetic but that is they are usually asleep during that part it is amenably evasive but you no in a lot always terms no such thing as a minimally evasive procedure in the brain it is a find off tho li here you say that oh no i ism not one of those nervous surgeons that you have probably encountered and we have mutual friends that a and these mutual friends are some of my favorite people in nervous surgery an they probably actualything more me than the not but a there are nor surgeons that you are as we right and then the true for all surgeries that they really in a lot of ways they think what they do is sort of the ground truth or is a closer to the ground truth and i i get that am a you do not probing with purpose i i actuarially that would use that if you do not mind a s it is just describing what you do e the y but i i actually have of always said this said publicly give said it to my boy have said this to my team a we need to embrace not evasive approaches a some of them are a little fluffy am fluffy in that we do not understand how they work we do not enjoy understand have deepracon wish works by the way a but because we do not know exactly he they work they are not as precise as we would them to be we have work to do there and i actually think that work is durable a and actually under way am that stand for we have great claberaters that that i think our doing this people no one willies and contelistin a cornel and others am we a i think that t mas transcend magnetic stimulation it is et prof for depression by the ways also empty a prove of o c d and for picketing edition we rather put the coil for those three at or more or less yes if they put it over atlas always on the scalp and a over the front of lop and there is different parts of the frontolobe that have been demonstrated to be a little better or a little bit worse am but what the it has a proved a for depression i believe is a similar a to what is been a prove for a o c d but for addiction i believe it is a different target but hat we would have to ask our our t amuse experts on that can they direct the turns turning my nexstimulation deep below the cart a they try ah and we are awe areactually studying this in o sty patients now am i is a part of our invasive trial a we are we are trying to pool patients from a t amass trial that is in parallel to what we are doing am all funded by the a fandatiofersity research a were a we believe we can use t mast to define a circuit that if modulated it proves o did it'll be it temporarily and in those patients of its temporary they would be appropriate for ant invasive study a something were actively working on have always believe that narrow surgeons need to be part of the discussion with these non evasive approaches we do not need to do them am but a i think we can help make them more precise and to probe nonevasively with purpose am rather then a this more or kind of i do not know a non evasive blast of fact cut of i i just cannot imagine how that is going to be as effective as proving with purpose but you could do that not evasively as well and i think we need do better in that way i duly that is possible and i think people are actively trying to do it am getting deep in the brain wot t am us i think we will always be hard but you can get there indirectly y using inactivity assays and targeting superficial structures that have high connectivity to deep structures am for example am perhaps one day there will be a t mas target for anorexia and obesity ah if we are scratching the surface with invasive approaches to these problems we were even doing less with the brain stimulation am we have much work to do there eating disorders and t amass have been am sort of scarcely studied or or there's been such the research done in that in that space and it is an array that we need to to work on am for the obvious reason for example in a nation with erect they just thinking practically placing a devil in a patient who is significantly under weight might not be the best approach you o wound erosion and issues that could come up developing a non evasive approach i think is critical the problem is where do we target and the only way to answer that i think reliably is to accept that we have to get into the brain be for were out of the brain and with these kinds of conditions were only just starting to get into the brain i i worry that were a long way away from a non evasive approach that really works consistently am sstartian trouble u want to make sure we touch on altar sound yest a o lit his historically it seem that there was a bit more permission for people to probe around in the human brain i i a sometimes refer podcast to somehow the papers that were ism done a allowing patients to self stimulate in the rain is work done in the in the sixties an now his name escapes be robot an when these couple papers publishing science allowing patients to stimulate a couple of a brain areas asking which once they preferred and i was always shocked and slightly am intrigue by the fact that the the brain area that all three of these patients i do not think how any syndrome anything they volunteered for these experiment a only i do not think could do this any more a regulatory i think was not the same as it is now as have changed a fortunately but they am all three of them seems to some midline pelagic structure which for those lissingstusa every kind of in in the dead center of the brain am more or less that a evoked a sense of kind of frustration and anger which surprised me because i would have thought oh it is robot heath yes experience rather than patience preferring to stimulate areas that evoke laughter or joy or a feeling of drunkenness for delight ad it also explains a lot of what i observe an social media this er and a people repeatedly engaging in battles a chatter kind of trivial t seems frustration and anger might have its own reward circuitry a anyway i do not wan to go too far down that rabbit hole but i it a it is a deep one it is a deep one an and cone it gets to our nature ya it you knows humans and what we find interesting or rewarding but the b inability to probe around the brain in a safe way without the need for somebody to be a very sick it would be i think would be enormously powerful an at least to my mind if i were in charge which ism not am would offer the opportunity to really come to an understanding but how the human brain works without all these issues of how to translate from mouse studies and again there is huge value to animal studies as we both agree but a many of the things that we want to know about the human brain involve asking the person had you would you feel when that said of neurons is stimulated and what do not you feel and a mouse we can ask and ask but then i can tell some they do tell us that i can tell us in english am how do we overcome this challenge but first ultrasound or if you prefer after ultra sound what is ultrasound can be really useful towards solving these clinical issues in these basic issues yes i think am let us start with ultrasentim will come back to it a ultra sound right now transcranial magnetic i magnetic residence guided focus ultrasound a a this this is an tie approve method to deliver an oblation to the brain non invasive there are a repeaters myself included that are trying to use transuranic magnetic i did magnetic residents guided focus ultrasound or emir i guided focus ultrasound a to use it in a modulatory way not just as oblation but to drive nominal activity or inhibit it perhaps stop learning how to do that a there are trials a there are trying to understand if you can use ultrasound to open the blood bran barrier you can deliver a medication to that specific a area a perhaps for a bringtumer or something that a it is a very exciting field a and it is empty a prove for tremor right now and i actually do it routinely a for patience with a tremor with parkansons or essential tremor and a i i love down it it is a often just kind of a miracle because there is no incision i do not have to place an electret into the brain to achieve a similar result how really into the a pathology of parkinsons can some one think about approaching this ogres is if somebody has a apparently or sibling an their developing some resting tremor ye i a see they should talk to neurologist but yo nor surgeon but this non evasive reproach could be incredible for them i suppose to jest t only taking drugs to increase opening levels yes depending on the reason you have tremor would dictate the kind of medication you would use it could be parkinsons but if it is not it might be e central tremor by the way such tremors ten times as common as parkinsons really such a tremor as the most common neurologic condition in patients over the age of seventy we often are not aware of that people with the such a tremor feel they have the forgotten disease because there is no michael j fox for a central tremor i i sent a letter is as sorry essential tremor or or said yousential them yet e assess and t i a am have actually sent a letter to to bill canton have observed a tremor in him and i think he is actually disclosed that he has at in them hoped he would become a champion for for patients with the central tremor a sturdy a contract does as well as she is also public about it but i i was not able to get them eager to become the champion for this condition but michael ja fox these patients need a a champion that am but unfortunately it is a bit of a forgotten disease a nevertheless because of the it approval of focasulture sound for tremor a others try to get some attention for shore and a it is fabulously effective these patients that treats patients on one side u usually their dominant hand or their worse hand and it a it really speaks to the fact that what you can deliver not evasively and oblation to the brain in a hypothesized on that we think it is related to the problem at hand and at least i tremor it works really well could this be effective for psychiatric disease obesity eating disorders a well a perhaps a actually that would be the ideal the problem is we do not know where to do the oblation a there is a trial that we would to do for o c d where we would deliver an oblation to the same area of the brain that we been delivering oblations to for years for patients with o c d and it helps a bit that is called a capsilotamy a but really the outcomes probligan to be about the same it is a nice method because its it is not invasive but a we need to find a new target for these for these conditions and because of the common denominator a the urge despite the risk sort of that compulsion a perhaps it could be the same target i do not know a but i would argue we need to do these modulatory experiments either with a device or with a invasive recordings a to better understand where these problems are coming from to define where we should do an ultrasound treatment am you are write a historically a a without much regulation we have we probed the brain a the problem we cannot learn a lot from those experiments now a well in this way at least a we do not know exactly were those electrodes were we did not have memorize scanning or high quality catscanning to to know where those electron were with certainty and and we know two or three milimators matters and we also did not have the tools to place electrodes in a precise way back then unfortunate we cannot learn a lot from those experiments right now were sort of re designing them and there is a way to do it now a patients with epilepsy benefit from this all the time there has been a revolution in america it was in rope a before it was in america where we would do stereo and sephilocraphy which is basic doing an e e g a patience with epilepsy but with invasive electrodes and we would place tiny little wires less than a mitigator in diameter all throughout the brain into parts of the brain that we believe are involved in secures and we would admit the patients to the hospital and figure out where the seizures were starting and propagating and than a yet we could stimulate those electrons to see if there was a symptom that was important and i try to identify a a region tat we thought we could either remove surgically ablate with a later or put a a stimulator in it perhaps a that is commonplace now for epilepsy a and it works extremely well an it is very safe of course it is deli brain procedure a but the a the complication rate is surprisingly low quite honestly for the amount of electors that we place a and is extremely well tolerated most these patients leave the hospital they do not even fillip they have had surgery a there is actually a lot of interest in using that procedure to study onto hull disorders a we are trying to do it for patients with obsessive comcompulsive disorder were awaiting an extra decision on that a but actually i credit a our colleagues at bailer and at you see as f for for studying this a already a we have fabulous colleagues that you see as f a that have studied depression using this type of approach a mutual friend of ours a any a change who woes a a wonderful friend and colleague somebody have emulated for many years as well a and and the the psychiatry treat you see us if have worked together on this sort of bringing together the epilepsy technique and the psychiatry experts to study how we could better target electrodes in depression and it'll tell you if they have a consistent target perhaps there becomes and ultrasound target a but right now the approach is a bit more reversible cause you can always shut that electret off or even remove the electron if perhaps it is not in the optimal location to treat the depression a but actually after a large volume of a cases perhaps they could pool that data to develop a a new ultrasound target for depression i think that would be fabulous and probably is their long terminal a not to speak for them but that would be something that i ism sores on their rate a and a boilers try to do the same thing for depression a their approaches are a little be different but a similar tool to try to understand a depression and were working with all these types of colleague sometimes are our friends to try to to bring this to a sit as well and it make sense to try to do this prediction and obesity and at alexia you might ask we why are you doing this for obesity right now in in our in our study and the reason is that am we have developed a target for obesity ad been getting disorder a developed out of mice that we believe a irrelevant for the human state because you can model this problem in a mouse a bit better theta you can model depression or sit we feel tit we can rely on the preclinical studies more whereas with these perhaps more i do not as they more complicated but more human mental health conditions that are hard to mode in a mouse you really half to study in the human and you can perhaps start in an epileptic patient o patient that has lactose and try to provoke a depress state or study epileptics doctor change has done that have come morbid depression for example ah and that can really validate this approach as well but in the end it is it is getting into the human brain that we need to do in the disease specifically a that well eventually lead to a not in base of approach either a lesion nor modulatory approach monitory would be times or lesion approach would be with a ultreson could not agree more am meanwhile because there are many many millions of people suffering from depression needing disorders parkensons and essential tremor a et camera well first of all i should say base on everything you have told me thus far it is amazing to me that any pharmacologic treatments work because of how systemic they are an impacting keratose certain urging around over here and noblemen urging around over there and not targeting any specific batch of sells it makes perfect senses who all the side effects exist but earlier you said something that really grab my attention i want to come back to which is that if people can be made to feel or make themselves feel just a little bit better little less anxious just prior to a craving episode or a binge episode maybeven if people can become better at detecting their own internal states and when there can veering toward a beige revering toward using a drug or you veering toward suicidal thinking based somewhat you said earlier that those kind of am free behavior of states a cold of drift on the on the steering am thous someway powerful levels of awareness at least for now until we have a specific sites in the brain that we can target non in alive methods that could be deployed to millions an millions of people seems that awareness seems maybe among the best tools that people could develop yes hung per went agree with you ow for the person without ad or a who suffers from in or ectyear binginiisorder to their citations i i i just want a highlight that you said that i mean ism not again omnonicalinition i a says i do not prescribanything i profess thinks a and the but awareness of one thinking seems immensely powerful in this contact a and after all it is the clinical probe that you use because if let us say the patient words a lie to you about their experience o what happens in their mind when you stimulate you could basically the whole thing the whole surgery the whole procedure could go badly wrong it is it is up to the patient to be of course honest with you in their they you advise to do that but to be honest with themselves about ah have gone all day without a beige but that he smell of the donator the thought of the dona is starting to have a particular allure that harness seems an incredibly powerful thing to own into and to build and cultivate yes have always thought that if we can improve awareness we can i prove outcomes i think that is probably true for many of these patients the problem i think comes down to the fact that some of these patients are resistant treatment and the patients that we see as a surgeon for example are the patients that they have tried cognac behavorotherapy certain love tried medications they have tried behavioral management they are aware of they problem and they have shown that to us they can tell us when their craving but despite the craving and despite being involved in this invasive brainsurgical trial highly first an human novel study a which i think we will have a positive effect but it is still experimental a they still cannot stop themselves they are sits made aware as could possibly be that i use grammar their correctly i think a there as aware as it could possibly be and they still lose control we have had the studied in the lab we will bring patients to thelaporatory with this implanted device to to try to provoke this spectrographic electrical signal a that can be detected by the actual device that will stimulate them when they are at home but before we actually initiate stimulation we want o to see candid device detect this craving sell signal which is going different o what we saw the operating becausethat is a single cell but these devices these electorate are about a mitigator in diameter instead of a tenth of a millimeter wisheswhat we use in the operating room a they are they are only hearing or or detecting i should say thousands of cells responses and we actually have away to provoke binges is called a mood provocations very well well very well validated live it provoking seizures in the pleas of monitoring unit but here in these of a psychiatric monitoring unit tor the the food monitoring unit a we we actually have a psychiatric an en sort of specialist common induce a mood that is related to each patient sort of self described bench episode to the psychiatric comes in in provokes yes a feeling that can evoke the negative behaviourthat is exactly right that we can video and synchronize the video to the brain signal recordings a the patients all wear an eyetracker we can see what there eating at all times and what they are looking at specifically and that allows us to have the best temporal resolution possible to understand what is happening right before the bite and even under videos aveilancs through one day one way mirror in a laboratory septic when patients are very well aware that there they're to be studied if they are going to bench they still do and we believe they do because they just cannot control it as aware as they are of it and it is probably because they are the most severe i think if we can improve awareness not just the decide all wariness that of sticking better earlier but the patient awareness a around they problem i think that could be a powerful way to help many of these patients and that sort of the roll of cone behaprial therapy a the problem with cognac behave there sure say the limitation of it i i shouldn't have any problem with think it is a wonderful treatment am is that if you stop it many these patients go back to their old behaviors i do not say old habits but they might be a habit but the old behaviors and am that is the promise it is not nobody lasting and the absence of continued count behavior there be some people can benefit from it long turn but some cant a but i think in in in in the less sever patients improving wariness key but in these really refractory patients this is this is kind of this is the disease despite the awareness they cannot control themselves that is what we are trying to restore is that improved ability to control their behavior do you think there is a roll for machines and artificial intelligence here a er couple laboratories up o the universe a washington that are using particular signal the patterns of within voice to try and help suicide old a people were suicidally depressed no one they are headed towards an episode before they even can consciously know since gets right down you shoes o free will in weather out machines can be smarter than we are but no one could argue that some of the search agarics on bugle and other search engines are actually more aware of our preferences than we are a basely what these are these are de vices that are listening to people talk all say there also paying attention to patterns a breathing and how well people slept it is at a integrating a a huge number of cues and then signaling somebody with a a a yellow light your headed into a depressive episode the prism i say i feel fine where i feel pretty good this is good of baseline state for me in the say a this is where you were proceeding the last episode that took you down a deep dark trench and it took months to get out of yo a i wonder whether not some of these devices could help with the sorts of things what were talking about to day i think am have always said we have to get in the brain before we get out of it and if we get in the brain to understand what these signals look we will know what those not in alive signals are i think it is possible that we are a scientifically sophisticated enough to use machine learning a ans her this kind of not ten technique to anticipate when somebody is going to be highly impulsive in a suicides the most dangerous impulse its something that is immensely a focus of the lab is impulsivity we have talk mostly about compulsion compulsion being you going after a reward or or the urge do spite the risk am impulsivities is similar but different it is it is kind of going after something am a little bit if you give you model impulsivity in in a mouse its related to i no going after a a food reward without the sort of paired tone that you are the mouse disposed to wait for the mouse does not await any more they they just go after the foot a have been that mouse yet we all a we can all relate with us a to a certain extent against the spectrum am in encase i nonsecuiter but i i i certainly think that there is a way to use our own body's physiology to anticipate when these impulses are coming on line how best to do that i think we are just scratching the surface but a these are the kinds of solutions we need these are some of these problems are of epidemic proportions the largest public health problems in this country in this world o obesity open crisis depression as suicidal i mean hat's a third of our country may be more probably more and i think about it and a colleague of ours ait stamperpsychootry told me something that still just we my mind which is that something seventy five per cent of the ant i depressant and ant anxiety medication that exist in the world is consumed in the united states s amazing which is i mean that is an outrageous number yet we do have an obsession this cursory for pharmacy and a the farmer critical industry is very powerful here and probably such some aspect of capitalism am capitalistic and just everybody else but a i do worry about that little bit a ale but you we tend to over prescribe and i think we has patients tender a over not medication a we quick solutions and sometimes medications provided sometimes not or therofteneus bandage depends on the problem of course a am but but i i agree t at we need scalable solutions you o it's a her surgeon ism only o g to be able to treat the most severe of patients with these problems you you now we have only done about two hundred thousand deep brain stimulation surgeries ever i mean the rob work talking about heres fifty million america there is no possibility that surgeons can address that problem but we could help inspire and initiative to go after that kind of problem or help make it more rigorous because the last thing we need is a some sort of wearable fancy tool that waste people's money in time we need real therpiece for these things not that these devices hat were discussing are not i think actually there is lots of promise and we use machine learning in the lab all the time ism not he ha an electrical engineer or the computation a nervine just doing this type of work i i just help deep the hypotheses around it but m and how funds around it but i i definitely think there is a a future for it i just i i suspect we are discretion a surface on how best to do it it is talk about your hands ye all the hero surgeons i know are y o very faithfully protect o their hands ants i not it is cause i assurances too expensive a but ism guessing you all are not the ones to reach into the barber's disposal even if your eyes on the switch to make sure that that is not gain to get turned on they're just too precious they are your livelihood yam and at earlier we talked about dead lifts a other forms of exercise and the things tennis om the theatres drawing and painting a full range of things that one can her the hands use your imagination furor am is it true that her surgeons do not do any i really heavy grip activity because it can refine the motor pat motor circuits in the brain and elsewhere that can throw off the her surgery game i would say had many hero surgeons a avoid activities that put their hands at risk a another one by the way there a an annual a soul torment a that a nu nerve surgeons come to an near city and such a park with the lesson wall now ism just went ye ye is actually a very you do typical hearts coffle i soft know the the callsoffble and a actually of two close collogues of mine have got injured at that torment thebe this is a it is also ye say here o joking fun but for those of you're going in the medical profession it is also one of them ore how she in this i just going to say there is a deep hitch of training in her surgery's a there is a certain harshness that is been conveyed to me about the training a much astray not training to be as wholly fair and maybe this is a tactic to a to weed out either the younger breathe older generation that is evolution right we to revolve and a we an medical a week i guess well i i can say that one of the individuals that got injured is one of the for senior surgeons that i work with now and is one of the best athletes that i know and he is dealing hat week but you can get interplay the sports and a that being said i can tell you you briefly is a i think that you it's funny my my mother came to me recently she is she is step penis and she told me her doctor told her she is not a lowed to do dedliffs and was coquet a that is fine i not telling you should do dedliff such as do not exactly understand the relationship but a i cannot say that i do think i it'll give you a little story here the reason why ism being little hesitant to to confirm that i agree with you on the delis is i a when i was operating this was when i was at standard i university operating and a as i mention aloud i wee get an inoperative batsman i to confirm actress four lectures i do this for all of my surgery when i was reviewing that batsman the extra technician looked at me and said whispered into my ear hes ai your posture really arriving your physical posture was doing your surgery you a and i looked at hm and i kind of wanted to say i will not curse tie idea i have been doing intermittently during our conversation because he made me realize that i i really did have bad possum and a we fund have had a little brief aside and he learn he was a personal trainer and a his name was zap and he a you he said to me you your postures week because or your postures poor because your week you need to strengthen your body an strengthen your core i was ow he is powerlifting i ism a little hesitant to do this and it'll telly i started very slowly and i cannot prescribe power lifting to everybody for the exact reason you said a and ice forgotten hurt doing it by the way but i do think i i wish i started a little younker and i would argue that with close supervision and very well if you are if you have a very experienced trainer which i would argue you an't her he surgeon or an alternant a or or have a highly specialized profession where you need your your limbs to to to function dentist thinks that a if you arguing to take something on this it really needs to be extremely carefully supervised and i can tell you that not my trainer had a profound impact on my life and my posture and my my physical health and a we did delft it'll admit when you rough it up i i kind of truckle to myself but i yes i i have gotten mildly hurt deadlifting but it was when i was doing ut on myself and i was kind of cocky and i was not paying attention but the i was with him and he was all over my technique it actually was the most efficient way for me to feel stronger and it improve my posture a significantly and i i miss him since have left californium i have a new trainer filled help his great but a and and i still deblificationally with i but i a i can say i am opposed to dead lifting callously but if you are extremely well monitor by it experienced a personal traitor a weight lifter i think i could be a greatrait i i love to be wrong in the come because ism a huge proponent and on the parcassionar on i am there there is much data now point in the fact that thundering one hundred eighty to two hundred minutes of his own to cardie conajogging cycling swimming type behavior is very healthy for everybody and we should all be doing that at least that yes in answer is well and that resistance training on the order of six hard sets per muscle group per week or is really import just offset determination of muscles and on learning is of a special function and tenants strength and that is just to maintain we are not going that all outsets to absolute failure but t as you point out with a with proper forms i even the narrow surgeon ore doing this which i think is is wonderful is as a final question a but one that i think really ore may be second to final question a earlier i commented on the a remarkable calm at least perceived calm a borrow surgeons it could because or could be effect of the training but it is obvious to me why one would want that trait in their narrow surgeon am you i would not want a hyperacid give certainly not an impulsive nor surgeon given that the margins of err a tiny spacial scale probably on the temporal scale too yes ay don't one people doing things in time that it were being spontaneous at all do you think that this a branch of medicine that you are in selects for people that at least can know how to control any kind of fluctuations and autonomic raw they can calm themselves in real time and here is a specific question when have never operated on the human brain although i had the privilege of being in the operating room and seen this with some of our experiments with people in were i remarkable thing i wish for everybody that would get this experience at some point not awfully a patient on these they have a need but to observe it but what was just striking to me is a the serious a stereotype behaviors of the surgeon and when i did surgeries as a graduates student as a postdoc in the brains of other types of animals i would find for instance that if i started to tremble a bit if i tapped my left foot that my hand would stable eyes a bit that there is this kind of need to move the body one feels the impulse maybe that is my my terret light compulsions again but but that one can kind of am siphon off some of that energy in to another limb the you could remain precise sort are these sorts of things that ism talking about our maybes timely my imagination but are these the sorts of things that one learns as a narrow surgeon how to still the body and still the mind door have a meditative practice when you go into the operating room if you have a particularly challenging morning or were a poor night's sleep do you have tools that you use to calibrate yourself and get yourself into the zone i think this would be very interesting for people to get some inside into even if they do not want to be her surgeon yet i completely agree and i i appreciate the earlier a reference to narc surgeons as a astronauts was have also heard us compared to cowboys before and little bit less flattering i a some of what we do surgically really does require a substantial mean of confidence a and that confidence hopefully comes far years of training at experience a you always worry that the confidence is sort of misplaced and that that that is problematic a luckily i rarely see that because our training is rigorous we have abortive a america word of neological surgeons that a sort of callous and and assesses surgeons to continue practice a and holds us to a really high bar a i do think it tends to attract a certain personality a in my some specialty i as a a deepbrain stimulation surgeon we called story o tactic and functional serow surgery some people have likened us to the neurologist with a scalpel a we we tend to be a bit more intellectual a a maybe maybe bedside manners a little bit friendlier a and then there is the masculine narrow surgeon who does not sleep and there not as friendly there is the spine surgeons who operate the most and there busy busy busy ah we there are some of these kind of reputations going around but i i agree with you there is a sort of a common feature of a a calmness across serow surgeons and you know there some of my obbousin my favorite people my closest friends a and i i can relate with them probably because of that a sort of a big picture they do not get sort of a flustered a they they tend to are they tend to be really good at figuring out haw o have quality time because we work really hard our ours are a significant and the time with our families are friends is less than we would it to be a that obvosy that is true for people who work hard across any profession but definitely true for now surgeons and i think that we are very good at figuring it how to make that time high quality a even just testing with some of my friends a that are the are serow surgeons a great friend of mine just became chairman it do conduct connecting with him by text which takes seconds you feel we feel connected and i think that is a that that is a trait amongst your urgent we sort of know how to cut to the chase in a way ah and prioritize our time ah it is a skill that we probably have it lately a but is also part of the training when we are in turns now there is a lot of work our regulations that is probably quite appropriate by the way am i i think ore hours before were bordering on on a not nesorily fetch us to say they were not ideal for mental health and sleep which we know or very important components a certainly we had no time for meditation i definitely did not i i wish i did am now knowing what i know about meditation of my my wife's a health coach i i get it i see it i i i practise it myself with her ah i see the value i wish i had that tool when i was in training because it stressful you even with the work our restrictions we still do not sleep very much were still a work a lot about eighty hours a week throughout the entire career ah there are times when it is more because after training there is no work our restrictions sometimes i feel as faculty we can abused and the trainees are a little bit more protected now it it would differently was the reverse at one point that is also a huge problem probably mortal problem am and ism joking a little but i i do not easily think we are abused but certainly re ours ore significant but they come a bit more here and there all my ow our days when a operating those are long days but on the days that ism lucky enough to be a researcher a you those days tend to be a bit gentlearnless ism grand writing those tastes can be long as a i day as you question i door think we are were sort of self selected for it but i also think its part of the training we because of the long hours that were in the hospital were taking care of sick patience and we have sort of a type a meant tor approach where our mentors are hard on us we learned to cope with our stress and be efficient and prioritize things despite the distress of it all and i think we take from that this sort of calm demeanor and perhaps am perhaps it is just amplifies what were probably drawn to because before we come to narrow surgery we might rotated narrow surgery we might spend a month pretending to be a narrow surgeon learning from residence and and and faculty that are practicing the the specialty but prior to actually starting your training you never experience anything being a a resident in narrow surgery a distress and the the volume of patience at have to take care of and the long nights it cannot be quite lonely by the way a you develop friends in the hospital but you sometimes you're on your own when you are own call and you have back up you can call your chief resident or your attending but you really have to learn had a take care patience yourself you oms see form teams with nurses and staff and things that another residence but it cannot be lonely it can be really challenging and i think because of those experiences that all nerve surgeons go through we tend to have this sort of unflappable personality that perhaps we started with a bit compared to the average person but the training definitely amplifies it and do you have tools that you implement if you ever feel that your getting slightly off center i do now i when i was in training i i actually remember in my second year most nursery programs when you are junior resident in some ways that is your toughest year not in every way it is your touches your because your your young and your inexperienced and you do not know what you do not know and and that that is why it such a tough ear because you have to learn a lot very quickly for patient safety reasons for self survival you know you just have to learn a lot and you on call by yourself in the hospital and it is a it is a real challenge and i think that i you personally i i gained a lot of weight during that year the only exercise i did consciously was taking the stairs i refused to take the elevator and i was at a pen at at up where i currently practice now and i remember i would see patience anywhere from sort of the ground floor where the trobabat was to ye are all the way up to founders twelfth twelve for and i would never take an elevator that was my rule for the yearcause i knew i would not have time to exercise but i would just take the stairs and the beginning of the year i i would be a little winded when i got to the twelve locker but by the end of the year actually did not really face me became but a great habit to have the problem with that though as i here that unfortunately with you a lot of sleepless nights or not enough sleepless i and i had this terrible habit u drinking coffee late at night and i would put a lot of sugar in it and it was set of the only way for me to get at quick a quick bow of energy that for some reason i prior i tired at that time obviously knowing tat i would crash which i always did and i always kind of regretted but i still did it anyway and i i i attribute that to poor decision making inexperience and perhaps being a little vulnerable a i think we all are that is why i relate with a lot of e refers that i do and i remember i got married in my third year the year after my second year and my wife and i are my fancy at the time we started going to the him together in the morning and my hours were a little better i would action be what exercise before i operated that day and i operated almost every day as he third year resident i remember it get to the him really early in three months i lost twenty pounds and i was not trying to lose weight i just was sleeping better and taking care of myself and i remember when we got married i i i fetid t a tuxedo that i had in college or it would a fit me in college at active was at you tuxedo admittedly but it was the same size as my took seed from college i i think that i have always related with the problem that a or our patients have to a certain extent and i when have been most vulnerable which is what i was working the hardest with the least about a sleep i i related with it the most and yes exercise for me has always been my tool more recently exercise some some strength straining i think is important compared with cardie ah i do not do enough of either a but i defy you some and that helps meditation helps me a bit i do that every net for i go to sleep a i i use an a for it it is popping ut the best way to do meditation but if it keeps you doing it regularly exists the best way to do it age i could notable with you more it is one of those things where i look forward to it every night and you have sometimes wife falls a sleep and i come to bed a little later and i whisper a you cave i turn the a the o she does the same to because i think we both value it a i think that that that is been very helpful i i did not have that tool probably what i needed it most but i have a a and it it is very helpful i really appreciate you sharing o those tools a a number of people a ism guessing out there might want o become near surgeons i really believe that in hearing to day's conversation that you

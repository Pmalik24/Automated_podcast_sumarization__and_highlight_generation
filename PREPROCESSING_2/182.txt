a quick warning there are a currish words that er beeped interface episode of the show if you prefer a big religion you can find that at our website this america life at or from w b es chico it is this america life i beer made on me sitting in for era glass do what the square for title of your home is oh god be how could you ask me that you monster ism sorry that is my friend mown monk brought a house after saving for ten years and she has a lot of complicated feelings about that house or the majority of her life she thought of herself as a person who does not have money that is what makes her her no matter the actual reality it is been that way since she was a kid i went we schoolyard just the street was another school that was a private school that was called bankcrofts em and we will used to call it wankcrofts because i think there was just this understanding that those at rich kids would not liecaft and they will not us beck's i think even when you are eleven years old that the future ahead of them is just smoother it just has less friction in it and i think we resented them even then for that for fact we went when all girl's school and they called us er the portion make us thou has hop y accurate i w si the virgin was yea i rate cold can i a thy an horrible i no i no monk knows the price of everything in her house she cannot forget the rugs for my keep the lamp she brought on sale but still things was too expensive being able to afford a down payment and now or mortgage it just does not match how monk has always seen herself or how she once other people to see her if you months after she moved in she hosted a casual bachelor at party at the house for her childhood friend he bride party were all school friends she had not seen in ages a monk was feeling a little uncomfortable i ism really obsessed with them cleanliness normally and i kind of deliberately did not tidy or clean for the few days before they came which is did e just cause i did not wan it to look too nice you ere trying to look kind of shabby she not shabby she just shabby she did not clean or dust the mirrors did not bishop the cushions did not even vacuum for a couple of days beforehand but despite that to her horror the first friends to arrive did this funny little sort of dance in my kitchen when she was o my god is just big they asked em if they could have a tore of the house and i kind it was just ye and then did not do anything about it but then the third time they ask i know all of my evasion tactics at this points they were just monk give us the fucking tor em then i did and m i do not know they were just it is mice is thanks and and it should not be it should not be a big deal but it is because i think it som with do not think i deserve i guess these friends all knew how she would grown up the parents had brought their house of an older lady in never updated is t the carpets were old the wall paper was peeling in places there was a bit too much furnisher when friends would come over monk felt super aware of it and embarrass were the identical emotion to what she was feeling in this new house now the whole tor she could feel them looking which is the point of a hostel when they got upstairs in her bedroom the closet door was a jar cot is just embarrassing say these things at loud in my closet was a she bank e containing a glory handbag now i did not purchase said goofy handbag it was given to me which is also incredibly bazaar it was a work it and i just kind of saw an eye track on that and that fell did to me and then always also in any human insurrection there is always this trice right you acknowledged the thing or you not acknowledge a thing and just keep the conversation going and i just know myself if i would have acknowledged it i would have made things even wider by over explaining how i came to have this real goofy handbag when i have an opened it since i got it why have not you opened if because again it does not it does not feel it belongs to me even though i own it who i am is not somebody who owns a goofy hand bag and there fore it stays in the cupboard to her the designer bag is not actually a bag it is a material ascot something she could sell if ever things got rough because monk is a person who knows that the ground can give way under your feet at any time i have to point something out the oh no no ijushav just can o thinking like it is a weird thing to be i do not know what to do i have money lie git is cad lot my daman shoes they are tight i i now it is abs disgusting ism not expecting any one that is listening to have any sympathy for this to be realllydyclear this is not framed as poor me i feel uncomfortable talk basks again especially growing up any time that some one with more resources than me complained yo shall fuck up i do not really want to hear it ism not complaining am really just trying to describe a feeling i thing i mutually is still if it was did the strangest feeling is the feeling of coming back is the feeling of putting a key through the door and opening the door and it is it is kind of was that thing agrofoybia where your scared of open spaces is really flocking did to have that when you walk into your home have a fear the open space but if ism walking upstairs to go to bed or something now it is really weird i i feel a lodger here it is transitory when you are in your house and you are going up to bed thaws it feel an out body sort of legal it is me but it is not really me exactly i can it is i can see a woman going up the stay e and every now and then i remind myself that that person is me the monk there was another big change and it came a few months after she would brought the house that had made her feel unlike herself she was on a long awaited vacation with friend on the second to last night got a fun c from my sister er telling me that my mum i got fan call for my sister telling me that my mummy had a stroke i came back immediately em and then e she had another stroke and yes she just i she needs twenty for our call and she moved in with me and i tried to do that as best i could monk swung into action she worked out the lightly cost of care and for how long they could afford it that money that she would been careful to save was actually being useful at one point she thought she might have to sell the house the did thing was i felt horribly familiar to be in a position where things felt more precarious again when i moved into the house and everything was cave for those six months i did not feel me and now i do fool myself because the the fury's back is just is it is me just living in a nice house for now this house is not mine really rings on some level in my mind the house is not mine and that makes me fool me by detaching lightly when i did get more safe i felt less myself i felt really o disconnected with myself i think actually being afraid his part my againstity that is what i showed to day is all about and something you understand to be such a fundamental part of yourself changes dramatically or goes away and your left wondering is this still me am i still who i think i am that feeling of me mine is me we her three people facing down monumental changes wondering exactly that stay with us t act one voice over sometimes you can plot the life of a singer from their discography think of the shift beyond see made from girl group power pop to soul bearing global superstar i want to play you some recordings of sandy fallen to this first story is about singing from four different points in his life then mi part the story of a person losing a big part of himself and building something to replace it here is the first recording it'll call it the first voice e aradady very happy yogis that was sandy around the age of fourteen singing scales in a voice lessen sandy was born with a voice by the age of fortified he would be hoisted under the nearest table at family weddings to belt out somewhere over the rainbow those impromptu wedding gigs became rolls in musicals at school and performing inquires and choruses both at home and internationally by the age of fifteen sandy had sung in acquire that performed that a san francisco chance game and also at the kidney opera house he was good and he knew it i was the person in the girl's caress who word sing the mega beggar hi know whether it was in o holly night or the end of the national i at the mil your at the then it'll be game or whatever i i was that voice candy's boys with its three octave range was special enough to seriously consider juliart sandy could sound a dismay princess and in this parody of a song from the little mermaid he really does a i chat i a a a a a a me i she i i a ai away a i a a a sandy did not go the dullard pass he became a writer instead that is how i first got to know him working the same newsroom but he still loved singing carryon or just sitting at his piano with no audience just the act of it candy's voice high wasting range and also kind of effortless was programmed in a call part of the swell of been that made sandy sandy another thing about sandy in his own words he would known he was different since he was a little kid but he kept it to himself all through college and into his twenties which was when he made his first trains friend it was at that friend's house that sandy firs sotestoterinceringes it would take another few years before sandy came out as monbinery and trance which felt great to name out loud whenever he thought about actual he starting tester in himself it came with a clutch of worries the severe anxiety around needles he was nervous about his relationships with the people in his life but when he came to articulating older concerns the reason i would give myself was i cannot give up my singing voice may be i thought the universe would punish me i made i thought that hey if i do this monstrous quod o thing and start has to town and ruin this beautiful voice that i spent much of my childhood building then the punishment it'll receive is that i will not ever feel the pleasure of singing again this fear of losing his voice it is one tut many townspeople have experience in spoken about candy's ear was that they would be a total absence of a singing voice he did not know any famous transfer singers and he held one transpire looking on a pottos about how he could not singing more four years went by c ha gate his the second set of recordings an calling this one the count down sessions m a a was m this is from late twenty twenty about twenty on months go at this point sandy had made the choice to start tea but before he start it o compelled to sing some of his favorite songs and recalled himself down what i ended up doing when i look back at it now was i was riding really must all to suffer myself stuff that i had sung and plays songs that id sing in my car as a teenager one of the songs that a recorded on my old voice for somewhere over the rainbow it was almost i reverse all the way beginning i think it was it was it it it almost fell a memorial hey let us give this one last seen you said this thing am when we spindly at that it felt count down to never singing aga a at i was had i was i i felt guilty it was you know if ism going to kill this sweet thing that spend my friend for all this time i will at least enjoy or our last days together what a a i man as o a not i a tats w i was morning and entire self heard that was the one that i created i i never felt a woman but i had to act a woman for a very long time and i was saying good bye all of that did it really feel you would never sing again never ever well i think that if ism being honest my sense was my other my aunt my new voice whatever it was going to be was going to be bad that i just would not want to i and seems to focus and you o seem t nodi a not e adjust me this is one of his new favorites buddy wishes my future yo as good as he sounds i mostly here how thin and kind of am tentative that voice says and how much it does not fit me a you me a not a man o you told me that the last song the at you ever recorded a musing yum voice are the was changes which is e know very on the nose a very a a sack that yet you noticed the li dear of you flipping the castle a aha changes because of the changes ism going through fee but i love that much i love that that was when your your be your brain an your voice landed i can you play a little of that recording ye am to a an a a gegegegegan a a as strain what do you thing had if yourself singing it i hear me singing a male artist a with a kind of yearning i yah it sounds the most excited of any of the ta strait i hear more energy in my voice there it is unions in his gut that this is what he would to sound what he could sound and he is itching to get to a time when it is all really happening i was yow deep down super excited for what was on the other side say a a a ta me a have a a a a a a the and a then he played the third set of according am calling it rough going a a the faker it candy's voice in a new pase and not always successful in making the exact sounds he wanted it to be making i never dream a yo someday a you i never dream a moody a you o a a it took some time for the tea to have a notable effects on candy's voice those recordings or from about two months after had stunted i could not sing sounds that even sounded okay at all i was a screechyteen sound i had flow moments were that queen essential voice break where you go to sing a note and there is nothing there it is reminding me a it is different but after topsurgery for example i was weak in my upper body that i could not lift a glass i could not open a door and over that period of motif of learning how to use my upper body again i mean it was these small victories when i could hold a mug and it in it did not feel heavy that i was going a drop it in this broke newly post tea days sandy found himself attempting to sing the songs of artist that he would not have approach before he tried lend coin he tried john he cash none of it was sounding quite right teaser does a lot of things it changes the way was is distributed on your body as well as the thickness of your skin and head and even how foster heroes it also thickens the voculcords making some voices break and deepen and sand's voice was braking waiting for this fourth decade second cubits of kicking was kind of serial sandy had had top surgery was growing facial head and now he was waiting for his voice to drop and then one day i sat down at the piano i hit a middle see and i could not sing it a you knowhow i mean its gone middle see was gone for conducts middle see use to be where i would have started my scales it would have been kind of just it is the easiest thing to sing is a middle see on my previous voice it what i a s of lo it was not like a leaning off it was not kind of lek always tapering and now it was just o i i don't do that it yet my voice was gone the voice that i had was honestly a few notes big it was up sir i sat there at the piano going oh no there is almost nothing here what song can i even make out of such a small ability it was a very horrible thing to all the sudden have my voice go from being the most familiar part of my body on some level to this completely unknown i did not even know what it could do let alone how to make it do it i remember the song where i sang it in it was oh my got this sounds a song what was the song i red it was your song by melton john which is not a song that i and i remember having this moment of oh my go it is a song i i could feel it it was the first time that i was able to kind of step back and cross my arms and just watch it was i was going wo look at this thing go now i have a much better sense of where the voice starts and where it can get to have a much better sense of how to actually use it and i feel it when ism doing it it is a bigger instrument big a how i think when i say that in my mind ism picturing a violin and a fellow there is some an examples instruments where there is a smaller version that hirer there is a pickalon than there is a flat and it is ism just rock in a new it is a bigger in its lower in order to make a lower sound you have to move more air through that thing i need more in order o power it we're on the lot side of recordings now that is cold he's sands lid voice i and sin to to is you do t nodes i a we a a you sand singing be the eyelash again on his piano at o we were on the foot and i asked him to play me a couple of songs while e were toking in this third voice the post hose tististerin voice it is the just i mead song in front of any one beside his husband an a couple of friends is queens in croaks have e bated but candy's voices still influx the voice rehab is on going an in i not mind o it is easy to her the difference even only a few months ponce the voice is obviously deep the more than that its sound strong but he is been practicing n that sounds more lived in than what you sent me back in much a yet probably of course i had ask sandy to sing changes to i an an i a mana an mas non it o i can me bit canvas i mas i that i a tartan i an tan i how did that feel oh l scar how does your voice feel singing it to day o say yet every day that i wake up and i can just sing its another beautiful glorious gift it is wow here we go i can still do it and some days are better in some days are worse but it is ism no longer in this period of mark and everything feeling off and searching ism on the other she and ism just living my life his effort lest three fact first voice and his second unmaintained voice and the rule post tea voice there full the bones of this new voice that he had to build up himself it is just it is a different sound it is what i enjoy about it in some senses it is a train's voice i do not know if i sound a risky i think that i sound something else and ism a product of a very specific right set of of things that can happen to a body and i i love that too i love that it winds up being a sound that is not others it feels more grown up in a little more fragile perhaps because it is new but also ism ism always pushing it ism always trying stuff that i have not done before something he would never even thoughts to imagine before now was womanizing with himself i had a a moment the other day when we were playing some of my old voice over the story out and then i in my voice now sang along with it and it a self do at and the wishes this moment of ana a an a do you under and i can part of that is just the sheer unmanned of of horse it is the same voice it it is me and you could hear how in a sense faithful a replica this is with a big difference it felt kind of i was breaking time outhit the the kind of fossil i my old voice in the room an than my new one joining it do wedding with my former voice suddenly my former voice become much more interesting to me i this way where it is not just this thing that i walked away from any a a si get in a a a sonny had expected splits in himself with the arrival of a new voice but what was once unfamiliar is somehow now the truest expression of himself he could even say he turned to face the strange a no supposed a on we swami me a happy we a a wit a a coming up a mysterious man in a hospital tacking looks a as to grunts one with that is in a minute from chico public radio when our programmed continues it is this america life ism been idol me in for isogloss to day show

writes a calla conehovio the since made a change that had the potential to lota who she has known himself to be for many years she ready did not know who would huge i heads up this dory briefly mention these his calla in my early twenty is i would sometimes flirt with boys i did not even at parties i didn't want e be i saying things ism on the maximum dos of my aunticycotic because i that it made me sound dangerous and i felt a general disclaimer that nothing i sat should be taken seriously now if i say i went off my aunticycotic with no suggestive in flection with no inflection at all at thirty three years old many to a woman increasingly large to alcohol this also makes me sound dangerous it not in a socially sanction hot way it cannot escaped the stigma it is there if you are on these tells it is there if you go off the tells this is a story of coming off the tells one night last fall i told my partner a tafia that something was of i could not feel sadness or joy i could not distinguished indignation and frustration from excitement i thought it had to do with my current anticycot it watts have never experience mycoses but lacunas proscribed for other things too it'd been taking it for thoughts that go round and round and a general state of suicidal feeling i struggled with sometimes explosive emotions that i had a hard time regulating and in the year since the original prescription thanks to lots and lots of therapy it'd grown stronger and more stable the lambda had saved my life but in the way that a sedating dart saves her life it made me solathargec that it was impossible to act out on all my feelings or even to feel them i asked my psycitrus what he thought about maybe going off tholatuda he said he was proud at the work i done over the pass couple years it felt a bespoke commencement speech i cried and then we made a plan to taper my dos down to era just be car ism not aunt met i love gets id believe my aunt presence floral which i still take or helping me thrive but the latte was different it is a have medication targeting challenges i had a dressed an therapy maybe i was ready to try life without it it'd been on one antipsychotic or another since my early twenties i did not know what i was without this medication it was an odd feeling to realize that i did not know who i was it baseline as an adult i could be anyone and that was ma be the carious thing about going off tholatuta what if f i was unrecognizable regalia or my dog or my editors what if i became unrecognizable to my self i start tapering off the tuna nonmember and in canary i take a conversation with tall ya about how it was going you and i i have been together six years and this entire time i in on an natosicotic most of the time must and i hand i was thinking about going down on the letup r off with letup i was am certainly the person married to me wright now the person that i am on theletuda and i wondered if how you wave been a react to somebody you did not you did not know or mediedin offulato ye ask if i was wore y with to an no what how do you resist to i tat let am prompting ye the talk on yet i see i did don't ask you a yes or no i an formulating i thought as though on an academic an ta you teachers college students and does her best to get me to write with outlines these a statements and evident to support my findings tall can i got together in grad school at see and she often fact checks my memories because those years are a blur i was popping out of an from many altoitens in literature him in ours in you sedating medications had me falling a sleep in cares wandering lost in down tine you haven over time with the rotating door of psychiatrists diagnoses and medications including lambda i got better in the ways we measure getting better for mentor illness i made plans with france i was productive i wore a let stay but a deep sadness not away at me all the time that is cared me it made me feel damaged and broken and radio active in ways i could not even understand i a si span an how many months since i stop taking the lambda canary library marc aril may five months no why an an almost aka years how do you remember that was jaguar i kept a dirty lit ye those were those ere som an long evening tax i just spent in the better unjust i just lying down would do you remember about when you think about that time wit do you remember a certain feeling i remember may be the first the months i wanted to to go back to go back en be glad i discourage was maybe you should say why you discouraged it yes any frequently you would have bad days and you would announce to me that you decided that you needed letup and i would say to ye o pine that is fine an before you make such a big decision wide you make sure that you are not reacting to withdraw ye just find out ye because once you go back on your girl lose the opportunity to have tat at as if you could just wait it was not because i did not want you to be on theta it was honestly because i wanted you to know and think about what now and you would not have ever gotten the chance to know that n what do you remember about wanting to go back on it thinking you could not do it what do you remember i remember thinking that it was a lot of work ye i remember just a having a a sense what i always wanted to know was the base line who what i who i was what i was at the base line and awful tuna i a did not recalled no right in what i was experiencing at that time wit why really was y but what i did now is that a i was experiencing bodily things the nights wets and the clamming ass and you not these other things that made me feel soda that i constant dada headaches that made me feel an old computer that is just running all the time that just feels really really hot i felt the thin this happen when you a old a there as eruption of a soda and agitation and firsthand and go really are i think od maybe your base line was too much you dint water ballot you ray and end you get can in a in there i did contain there for many months i did not know what was me and what was the withdrawal but slowly the bodily agitation my grains and shivers lifted and i was left with me h the difference between you on and all silatuda is huge it is absorb we but it is not like your future i fear like different personality coming ow ally that at all no i do not seem to have are i it is true ism not a different person offtiatuta but everything is harder now moving through my day is trying to beat whites into a marine without a mixer just a butter knife all effort and ism bone tired at the end of each a i feel much more sensitive than i have ever felt tender sore and scared a prey animal a baby dear or a yorker with a bob cat for a neighbor it takes almost nothing to make me fall apart not being able to open ajar dropping a mug of coffee taking the weather personally i fell apart multiple times a day but it also takes almost no time to gather myself now if i feel overwhelmed i excuse myself to another room said a fifteen minute timer the last that are and cry i watch a video about chipping facts narrated by a young man who seems as delighted by chipmunks as i am and then ism fine ism back downstairs making coffee scheduling doctor's appointments an you meetings sometimes even before the alarm goes off the tuna which was supposed to protect me from emotional intensity which was supposed to prevent me from breaking down just kept me stuck in bad sad about being sad have also noticed that i can concentrate better now for longer stretches of time for a while on the tuna i could not read not at all i could only reared and that felt lonely ism reading again one morning i took my dog and demons on a walk in the nearby woods i was midway through the first chapter of edit carton's house of mirth on audiobook i was kind of star struck starry a about the rhythm of per sentence says the wickedness and speed of her we and the sensuous appreciation of melodrama i felt a bit a teeny sober i felt about carton the way i felt about john may and seventh grate and room for squares came ow and on it the song your body is a wonderland ism confronting strangers again that is back maybe it is because i grew up in new york under julioni or because my dad had an explosive temper and once my brother was born i learned that if i was scared someone with more power was going to be a fucking asshole to some one with less power i could put my body and between them and dared the bully to blink first the thing about me is i never blank first a couple of months ago i ran a guy out of a liquor store down town because he did a little bow and said no musty to an india kat who was working behind the counter he also kept interrogating him about the village where he was born and checked clearly did not want a talk about it he looked pained an annoy when i was being wrung up i aggressively scroll through instergraam trying to distract myself thecashier said something to me i did not here at and asked him to re peat himself then i heard myself say ism sorry can you say that again i was distracted by how much that i knows about india the guy in his wife heard me say that too and announced this store did not have the wine they were looking for after all that is when the guy did a little bow and said no musty to the cashier sir that is fucking rude i told him they left the store i would not have done that on the latte maybe i would not do it again but it certainly sounds me ai remember the expat moment a few months ago in the middle of the night on the twilight when i realized i felt happy nothing had happened i was still have asleep but the rest was unmistakable i grabbed my phone and made note of the time to a m and wrote a short description of what that felt in case i would not remember it in case i dated photographic proof of the luckiest monster in the morning earlier this summer i sat in the kitty pool we picked up from wilmark with my book and my music and my dog it'd been doing this every day for weeks and it made me feel safe let from within with love for the whole world i again wrote down the time and place i twelve of seven p m from the hammock my flies and stomach covered by old wet hand howls we kept in the freezer to help regulate my body temperature ay man tally only this i

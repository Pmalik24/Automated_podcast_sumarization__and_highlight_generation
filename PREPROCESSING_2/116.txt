as america prepares for yet another brutally fought close for an election the potential censors increase their volume jill beans has positive for coven and we examine whether donate trumps old colleagues are about to flip on him ism bencher miss is the venshvarro show to day showsponterbackexpress vision do you your rub history being seen and sold to advertisers now me neither gat expressly plan right out express be piano come flash men well in the last election cycle there is an awful lot of talk about disinformation and misinformation remember there is a conflation that occurred between twenty sixteen and twenty twenty first in twenty twenty the story was disinformation this was the ruffians were main lining a bunch of foreign propaganda into america election and thus twisting the election against the wonderful and innocent killer clinic and for the evil russia stage donate trump that was the narrative in twenty sixteen twenty seventeen and then a kind of bled away bus it turns out the data was not there to suggest that it look the ruffians had a bunch of crappy casebook pages the not all that many people saw and instead the media turn to their new variant of disinformation which was misinformation misinformation is just stuffed the media does not because sometimes it is true and some times it is false but ye cannot tell the difference in the way that the media treatment information and thus when it came to twenty twenty the argument was for example that the hunter began laptop story well get was not quite disinformation could could not tell if it camefrom the ruffians but it might be misinformation and by is information they just meant something we do not really want you to see and eversince twenty seventeen there is been all is talking social media fears about the stuff that you should see in the stuff that you should not see all this talk about the vast panoply of misinformation that is going to be cram down upon you that you will not know right from left you will not be able to know right from wrong you will not be able to know what is true and what is false and this invariably ramps up just before a presidential election because what the media really want you believe is that they are the abetters of truth they are the once we will tell you what is misinformation and what is not misinformation f it does not come courtesy of the washington post or the york times if it comes courtesy instead of shows it this one it must be misinformation and to prove the point the media and it is various allied interest groups they will lobby social media to shut down other outlets to reduce their reach they will use the slogan it but know it is not freedom of speech it is freedom of reach and the there is no such thing as freedom of reach stuff we just down grade the daily wire while up grating new york times while we have fought back against misinformation and once again misinformation or hate speech remains an undefined term there is certain sty tat we can all agree would be misinformation if you say for example that the world is flat theta be misinformation but also that is fairly easily reputed to here is the beautiful thing about is information it is possible to rebut virtually all is information with actual good information the problem for the left very often members themainstremeta it they do not want their bad information or butted they do not the community notes feature on twitter because it might smack them once in a while we the starting to ramp up anticipation of twenty twenty four because again if you look outside the boundaries of traditional media you might notice for example that jobidon is not an empathetic older character with a sterling history of wonderful honor in his office instead he might look a career corrupt politician who is glamorized everybody in sight and used his position of power in order to enrich himself in his family he might look that if he look at the quotoquot misinformation sources and now the media are camping up the calls the human cry for censorship in advance of the twenty twenty for election and nothing new under the sons o the same this twenty twenty their just replaying it the latest indicator of this is a long piece from christian lama from the washington post riddled why a perfect storm of misinformation may loom in twenty twenty fort this also by the way a built an excuse for whyjobidon loses bid looses the answer's going to be not that he was a bad candidate not that you ran a jerry attic doddering fool who cannot spew sentences from his face hole a person has a terrible economic record a person who has all the empathy of a come clot that is on gong to be your fault did closing be the faults of all the is information it is the the corrupt situation would not allow jobidon to win the already setting up for that narrative as well here is what the he says a majority of researchers expect globalist information to worsen an twenty twenty four but politicians and social media posing memo serious threats according to a new survey released guess first of all the me just point out are you are you saying the politicians lie sometimes that they are not wholly truthful no no speak not of such evils honestly stupid the pole which surveyed almost three hundred researchers across fifty country's found that only a small fraction twelve per cent think the information environment in their countries willimprove next year fifty four per cent said it would deteriorate the international analog information environment said the swims if the swissbase none governmental organization behind the survey said the results demonstrates significant pessimism among the experts a of the experts their pessimistic hes would be the same expertswho declared that hunderbion's laptop was actually just a russia plant or something the finding's arrive is platforms including betta and melon musk's acts back policies and callback teams dedicated to combating this information a head of major elections in the united states rope in india now is worth noting at this point that authoritarian states for example veins chela or borderline authoritarian states say mexico tat a rule by members of the left the the rule of hula silva in brazil these people are very from the toward shutting down quoting quotes information is the information environment in brazil getting stronger or weaker over the course of last couple o years everyone's louis election by the way at the story of course was that bosinaro is the real authoritarian while hula has not in shout shutting down his political opposition in brazil is just the mediate unit care about that as they hula chili toward says he is the professor university of oxford and share of the i pile said quote this has the potential to great a perfect storm next year he says that staffing cuts to test company's moderation forces posed a huge risk according to the survey two thirds of researchers said the inability to hold solciomedias compact's accountable over both content moderation efforts posed a significant hurtle fifty five per cent reported poorly done automated modern action was another another words they want to be able so governments want to be able to sue social media companies in order to get them to do the thing that they themselves are not allowed to do the government of the united states is not allowed to shut you down on free speech terms butyl what they can do they can pressure you tube to do then pressure casebook to do they pressure es to do while a third of researchers global flag social media companies as one of most serious threats to healthy discourse those that specialize in regions with democratic governments set politicians themselves posed a bigger risks and of course here they just mean right wing politicians i there these are the things that they care about this is that that there we it about right wing politicians hint hint they meet they mean trump there worry about people organ a save false things in the meantime they will maintain their position is the arbors of the ultimate truth of course they li to and they cover things up and they do from particular perspective it'll give you an amazing example in just at one second first is your cellphone in desperate need overeplacemen the signs ready at the short battery

fphilip bum is a fact checker for the washington post i say fact checker with u with a ferret of scorn because i he is not exactly in unbiased sores is is chili bum of the washington post and due his a national columnist for for their newspaper he a pure on a pod casts the personated know om doorman the comedy seller podcast and known townsman asked him a pretty simple question about jobidons apparent corruption his suggestion was that jobiton has been involved in hunters eruption petty obviously for the past twenty years again hard to imagine that that is noetic case given what we now know up to an including the information from hunter batons lout tot talking about ten per cent to the big guy all the money that was obviously flowing two hunter because hunter was using daddy's name jobidon phoning into meetings even if only to talk about the weather just to demonstrate hunters connection two jobidon apparently members of the upper staff at bregma openly talking about the kind of corruption that they were able to effectuate with jobidnan office eh but nuts woman that is the biggest question of all right this he one have asked as well which is there is an actual text from hunter to his own daughter biome literally saying that he paid half of his dad's bills what is the deal and chili bum again chili bump is a is a columnist for the washington post he doesn't alibis and om he literally just refuses iliac he knows what the question is but he refuses to even alow it to compute it is an amazing spectacle here we go what do you take from the text message to his adult daughter hunters was that i have to get fifthroug sent ofay income to pop ice no idea what that means i do not have know any what they means what is it is it is it is i know it is circumstantial evidence you prefer that what what what could i give no idea but does not do not know we i appreciate our is anybody has anybody asked her i do not know i do not know do not you think somebody should ask her o i ism n i just said i do not know and i do not knowhow to make f its have nothing epic say got it ye a other of its i ye you say the is no ether do evidence but then as a ten message where he says i give pop fifty sent of my money that is that is evidence o cannot well what of i i i sell evidence i precise have o g and then he tries to walk off to show then he tries to walk off the show now was it have walked off if shows before where somebody was being personally offensive to me ti's a bad division to done it but have never walked off a show because i was to ask about a piece of evidence the contravened by argue went that that that is a we old thing right there chili bump just prefers not to see the corruption involving job and hunter and thus it does not exist i do not what to make of that we l you do not know what to make of that we all know what to make of that the honest an sir there would be we you are right that is suspicious it is weird that hunter would text his daughter that he is paying half of his dad's bills there could be serious explanations ranging from he was pain literally half his dad's bills to his exaggerating to his daughter for a fact to use high as a kite we would have to await more evidence from actual bankreckers to prove whether it is true not but yet that is a weird thing for hunter to say but got be an honest take that still leaves the door open to job not being guilty but he is i am willing to humor that i do not know i literally do not know e in you have ever seen the each pig so west world for season is really good second season toast in that show it is a basically i it is easily about these very sophisticated robots in a in a made up world that is a a western land write this wife's west world the robot's are programs s that they cannot actually compute data that is not with in their dates tat if they see something that is completely out of place it just does not compute for them they do not see it and the catchphrase of the robots is it does notebook anything to me i every time thy see a piece of data that does not match the world around them if they are in west world and suddenly they see a card driving through and some he says did not you see that car they'll say it doesn't look anything to me that is ship bump he is the he is the robot he is left wing robot that text message does not look anything to him he cannot see it it is right here and he cannot see it it looks nothing to him thanks for have me on and these are the people for policing is information these are the people we have task with policing ye flow of in formation in our society which says to me that they are not that worried all about misinformation what instead there we deeply about it is information that they do not getting out their in public fear by we fill uprights routinely about when it misinformation he wrote a column just last week titled wide to republicans just proportionately believe helpless information a month and half for that your another one a deeply ironic reinforcement of righting misinformation he is constantly writing about misinformation it is i is his favoritething to write about and yet there he is not even bothering to make any sort of legitimate argument about why the thing that is right front of him is far he just pretends does not exist it is in this world that is information truly does flourish they a used to be that it the very least we could to have arguments over what was turn what was false an the we bring evidence whom you martial that evidence and the we would agree once you know the overnencs hin been marshalled that something was strewn something was false but in the world were he just ignore the opposing argument utterly where just it does not even commit it just reseeds to the wall paper how the how is most to believe anything you say and this brings us to covet will get to that in just at one second according to a recent study of hundreds of postabort of women sixty per cent of women reported they would have preferred to give birth if they'd received more support from others or had more financial security this is where reborn steps in reborn is there for women in their darkest hour deciding between the life and deft of their precious child the reality is women are being lie to there being told to make this fatal decision because of

dill pound to fifty say for baby that bouncy fifty baby or gout a reborn dot calm glassman that is reborn dot cold lash man to help start saving lives right now with reborn all was meanwhile we are heading into an election cycle where jobidon is not veil jobiton barely makes it out of his bad each morning or out of his crept he he spends most of his days wandering around alone on republic beach with his shirt off horrifying the natives come and an they are already setting up the predict for what his campaign is get a look likenisscan to be he is too old and he is too scared of covet to good o the basement again were setting up for that again in order to maintain that narrative however we must make everybody feel very scare of bovid because if as it turns out covet is not killing massive massive numbers of people in the united states if it urns out the risk factors that first attended to covet at the her beginning are not even the risk factors that attends to the latest bout of coma the people are experiencing if it turns out that a huge for sentence of the population either has natural immunity or van community or that our standards of care are we better and to the death rates are significantly lower the the original variant then people can a look at jobidon wearing a mask around relic what is he doing is not this just an excuse for him not to be in the public eye can well yesterday jibidan tested positive for covin according to axis she's experiencing only mild symptoms she is n remain at home innerhublith beach delftware president bid invested negative for the virus he is going to test at a regular cadence this week and monitor for symptoms he is supposed to leave thursday for a g twenty summit in india the first ladies positive test results is axis come a it a surging covet infections across the united states after the emergency of new variance over the summer now i mean we are also getting back into fall terry try gets going back to school e gan i he see as surgeon a lot of virus an awful lot of iris over the course of the summer and also the fall fort for example mi kid recent my be give kids and ma kids are constantly sick basically is the juggling acts to which one of them is can be sick in any given time when mi kid came down with strep last week when into the doctors li data huge per change this years is that because of the evils of covet or is i just because kid the sitting with one another freely again the immunity is low down cause they spent he last couple of years bubbled it depending on where you live in all he in any case there already setting up the predict for join to hide the basement o her's corner john par world's worst press secretary explaining that tat cordon is now going to mask up indoors because you should mask up indoors an it dangerous kris president bison teth that negative last night for coma nineteen and teth negative again to day he is not experiencing anytentems bar it the fetch his taking the president with with the birth lady yesterday he will be masking while indoors and around people in alinement with retype dim and as as has been the practice in the path the president will remove his mask wen sufficiently distant from others indoors and while outside as well much silencing happening right here insane levels of silencing happening jobidon is going to he will be socially distant saying and he will be wearing his mask on accasioand a surgical mask is whom non nan ninety five which would be the thing to actually protect him a man his age or any of the rest all this is parton parcel of a broader covet alarmism that is about to spring on to the scenes e can have this culture this stupid culture war all over again thanks to o left that that continues to maintain that they did all the right things during the cove pandemic according to n pair thees is seeing a late summer spike in cove cases prompting some schools hospitals and businesses to encourage or even required people to start masking up again the most recent c d c data from earlier this month shows nation bide covet hospitalizations increase by nearly nineteen per cent in a single week and deaths by more than twenty one per cent now this what we call fun with base rates this is where you have a pretty low rate increases slightly and that looks a twenty one per cent increase if i make a lackaday and then suddenly i make a buck twenty one a day does not mean i got rid that is twenty one percentingrace it is a twenty one per cent that that is the ending what your castrate is that might mean a lottery might not mean very much at all according to sudsy direct or many con she sad up to ten thousand people we c ben hospitalized tot cover but that its far fewer than the forty thousands such hospitalizations a week the united states had the digest point last august she said word a much different better place at this august of twenty twenty three but she says coveremains risky for people who are vaccinated now the can it are pushing the taxes again apparently the latest version which is nicknamed iris right it was o me crowd but macaronis now been dispanswits announce iris it is become dominant in the united states apparently it is more trains missile but it does not cause more severe disease for the vastmjorty people it looks a cold for the vistas vistas vastmajority people looks could done matter we the to talk about however ben uses to mask up again speaking of helpless information this is pretty amazing stuffs anchovy douche was finally asked about masking and he was asked by some one on no see amen believe it or not is michael s mercanishwas to in you notice that those giant mask mandates did not do anything to lower the rates of transmission and touchy just tries to puts is wet this is not miss information when douche says it because he is of course the science it is also not is in formation when he overtly size to his colleagues at the beginning of the satanic that this might have been produced in a chines lab and the immediately reverses field an tries to get them to a task to the idea that it was natural made in any case here was that anchovy touchy distributing misinformation if in fact we get through the point with a volume of cases is such and organizations the sexy we recommend we he does not mandate anything i mean recommends that people when ask i would hope that they abide by the recommendation taken to a count the is to themselves and to their families and again when to to can gessforcing anybody to do anything may they always say they are not big out forcing anybody do anything than the next thin that happens is an a tempt ad force i also love that he is he was asked actually by machaels me coins the mask mandates to actually do anythings hit what but for individuals they might ah this is tiresome that is not the only piece of bad sins going out the dor you have doctor even upon a missal be he doing the same routine he is now claiming that if you are above the age of six months he should get a covedacs these things are untested on infants they are not to all of u tiger her sand so a station at began havostus by the and this most o ally an got we porbece we get strongly a these ne persons of the virus oh tiresome times him again remember trust the experts trust ace if we have learned one thing over the past few years were the experts have screwed the pooch in every available way from economics to health policy to electoral policy it is trust the experts obviously and do not believe any of the misinformation and just one second will gets the latest in the twenty twenty for campaign first we have a dog enemies happy happy is a really really uni soggy he is a he he had himself a wonderful wee can a got a associate with with the other dogs and a really had him self a god time will her is the thing we want happy to live a long and healthy life this is why we give him a rough greens every morning the dog food you are giving your dog that food is dead food it has very little nutritional value i mean look at it it is dried pieces of gunk green food hazurtrictional value rough greens loose happier food back to life it can

rough green stock comslashpen let rough greens bring your dogs food back to life that is or you f f green stock calm lashpensiday or call eight they three my dog thirty three once again that is eight they three my dog thirty three it'll a meanwhile gingham is information i cannot believe that we are still being subjected to the idiotic idea that secretaries of state across the lander can be able to simply duelist donate trump from the ballet baste on the fourteenth amendment o the constitution baste on what busy beast on what the ideate violated the insurrection act you have got to be kitting me there is a crime in america layer called insurrection there not charging dona trump with insurrection blacksmith is not doing it nanny wills is not dong it nobody is doing it it does not matter the left his decided again because they are our moral arbiters in the arbiters of our truth the can simply band dona trump from the ballet and magically he will just go away and what is really driving that of is of course how much the hat trump i mean the idea here is that if we band from from but we neverhave to think about him aga was not matter what the actual law says that at least is the prospective of sunny host f of the view again one of our resident geniuses over there here is what she had to say i think the larger question is he is on to be con vice ted of something ma i see it all the time federal or dependence get convict the oman e having pe time the time ta the tan and that tor to case he is on tin for one of the charges a he is con to i convicted the larger question as why as he en aloud to run and c bout it earlier there are conserve an regal o mine from tan experts theater a that an of the fourteen leman men he is not even aloud to run even though e has even conviction yet because the fourteen ten the was that he her was the paned an public offs at ten taking en to to this country an a in an insurrection you are ineligible to rah i od do not ragis that is not is information she is just shes just being a legal analyst the tony host was the senior legal correspondent in analyst for absences which sh shows you the quality of of legal analysis these days doll from brightly was dancing about this yesterday on truth socially has almost all legal scholars have voiced opinions that the fourteen themendmen has no legal basis or standing relative to the upcoming twenty twenty four presidential election election interference is just another trick being used by the radical left communist marks an factious to again steal an election that their candid it the worst most incompetent and most corrupt president in you a history is incapable of winning in a free in fair election make america grate again now he is not wrong about any of that he is not it doesn't matter wergana see articles for now up to electionday about why he should be removed from thebout by thewy that is also going hough the pry to get for why tobidan is not going to debate him join will not s mate dona trump just wide for it it is going to happen bank on it put the put honestly take that bat put in the bank right now lock it in meanwhile on the legal front donate trump is facing some pretty did legal peril apparently some of his to defendants are starting to turn on him according to politico as a four colonel cases march toward at trial some of his aids allies in wen to feints are pointing at the former president in court documents in hearings lawyers for people in trumps orbit are starting to reveal glimmers ova tried in trough strategy in cases with many defendants per tray yourself is a hapless on while piling blame on the apparent kingpin then they go hin quote michael can which again not a is information when you quit michael con but nickel con is a convicted liar i iced point out at this at this point but it does happen o be the case that there are a bunch people surrounding donate trump who have started making motions they might turn on trump last week trumps former whorehouse chief of staff mark meadows signals his defense is likely to include blaming the former president as the primary driver of the effort by the way would not be surprising to me if while not did the same thing while not is the aid in the in the classified documents case who was moving around trine boxes of classified documents a donate trumps baas apparently trump actually put it out on truth social the want newton never would a done that he neverwoud have moved if he had known there were classified documents in the boxes he never would have moved them which of course suggests that if the re classified documents in the boxes well not is to blame again ism not sure what trump strategy there is with regard to the people who actually have to stand up for him in order for him to escape criminal liability here during a hearing the lance defense o turning for meadows called attention to trump's prominent roll and what as certain to be a crucial elements of the prosecutor's case there that infamous canary second twenty twenty one one call an which trump demanded that gorge secretary of state brad rains burger a re publican finds enough boats to to claim trump the winner it is a strategy the could sharpen is the gorge case moves a closer to a jury and again would not be a giant shock that it is one of the risks of donate true not paying the legal bills for all his are if you are donate trumped if your some who worked with donate trumpet he is not pang your legal bills and you now face jail timewhile trump is out their defending himself i know yoornspen the next ten years in jail well donate trump lames you for all of your problems john tarot trumps a turning in the federal lection case signals recently he intends to file a sweeping immunity claim to attempt to do rail charges many of the dependence and gorge have already on maneuvering for individual advantage trosecuers are also raise in question about funding that true political committed are providing for defendant as well now again things are on t get messy for trump before their not on o get messy for trump but with all that said if trumpet negligible for the ballet of course not meanwhile join continues torn an unbelievably wee race easily this entire twenty twenty for race is the mean from predator you know the thebicep flexing g can gripping me where the two arms gripping where both sides are water that what democrats an republicans ground there is no wavorgon to loose to back for democrat's that eyes from noway we lose him for republicans is no way beregng to lose to jobidon robin's pall numbers continue to be absolute crap see ends arena keeper she says he keeps trying to say the the economies could nobody as she believes him yet not everybody is sold on bins plan in fact he is struggling to convince voters that his administration has been good for the economy a new pole from the wallstree journal fines fifty eight per cent of voter say the economy has gotten worse over the past two years just twenty eight per cent say it is gotten better which is why to day president bid in pried to hammer home the point that he is better for jobs than is predecessor and potential twenty twenty four competitor it will tell you is not a whining strategy politics if everybody feels really bad about a thing stop telling them that they are wrong to feel bad about the thing now tat mad be the truth i men there many cases in life for somebody feels bad about a thing n they really should not feel bad about the thing but as a political strategy when sixty five pectin theamerican people are the economy stinks for me and do ms i as because you do not understand they on to mono room real class soon it turns out that people do not buy that line very much and yet that is the line there using there is the white houses cured bursting of the council of the economic drive people are wrong the counties amazing it is your fault if your mad now my point is that you can early get martian a person one ran to are n anything and here they are in after line a are about then port to the con pollack a o by vomits i thin get since cure a a no and inaccurate sari tan to the clear the somehow by vomits is a working or that its not i i tax wen else by come wen you real tow to what it actually is well no actually the stuff they are polling is would you if the government spent money on acts it turns out that everybody when the government spend money on acts because people think the government makes its own money but people do not would you the government to take money from you and spend it on at then all the numbers go the something happens to be true when it comes to the the people are living right now where they have experienced wage two in elation actual declines over the course of the last o couple of years in very significant ways every day things are costing much much more money the washington post in fact has a piece to day topmost auto insurance cost the bored across the united states these are real world probes people are having and a lot of it has to do with in elation premiums according to the washington post have kept climbing even as other typesbeen elation of cool according to the bureau laborstatistics coinsurance for yous drivers in jury with sixteen per cent more expensive than in jury twenty twenty two seventy per cent more expensive than in twenty thirteen frank palmer the chief insurance officer at rood in turns us care pair cost bookshop wages use car prices have all had significant increases the entire industry has had to raise rates to keep up with these friends motor vesical manage costs a up thirteen per cents from jury of last her on f your cambric standright now it cost you an absolute sicken fortune to fix the thing their woods a mechanic at metro motor says it is more expensive to dagos her vehicles the parts are not to hold out more expensive but the frequency of repair on them is more than it used to be if an air bag goes off at thousands of dollars a new car might have eight air bags in it this is also in attempt by in sure to make up for big pay outs driven by floods and natural disasters which insures categorize as catastrophe losses as well and there is no escape from the higher premiums because again when comes to carnturns your man dated to get your coinsurance or you cannot drive on the public roads all of this people are attributing to bins a economy which makes ens because even as all this is going on jobidon is spilling billions of dollars hundreds of billings f dollars into green bundaggles as the wallstree journal points out according to our aport late last month by the york state energy research and development authority large offs or wind developers are asking for an average forty eight per cent price adjustment in their contracts to covering costs the alines for clean energy new york is requesting an average sixty four per cent price in crease on eighty six solar and win projects the i are which is the inflation reduction action has nothing to do with with in flash production include federal tax credits that can offset fifty per cents of a project's costs but a duple developers say their costs a increasing faster than in elation and the projects will not be economically viable and would be unable to proceed to construction to operation under their existing pricing again the way that icon o be solved you would imagine is by the federal government coming in and spending an awful lot of money or bi energy production coming to is screeching halts jobidon again really a wee can't butt there are couple things the baton has going in his favor thing number won the bid has going in his favor he is absolutely stone dead boring he is absolutely boring even i get i can tell i can look at our numbers every time i mention jobidon everybody who is watching or listening to the show immediately goes in coma is a woman is if you say needle juice three times than he appears and if you say began three times cars fly off free ways all over the united states as the drivers go tomatoes their foot gets the the steer that their foot hits the gas and steering feel cares to the rights mass carnage every time you have mention jobidon just be cause people go narcoleptic the minute you mention the guy he is old his boring and that old an boring is a real asset for him have been saying the since twenty fifteen by the way then the jobidon if you would run in twenty sixteen world ben formidable candidate be pussy's boring the same thing is true n twenty twenty he literally did not run a campaign his campaign involves him being dead now his campaign involves him being double dead how can you tell because it again all the metric say for example no one wants to buy a book about mobile according to politico enzyme uses jonathan allay when on a mufti stop national tour when he core to book on how killer canton lost todonnal trump during the twenty sixteen campaign shattered inside killer canton's due campaign more than a hundred and twenty five thousand copies but for the pandemic era book that he one on job an allenson you van get the satisfaction of seeing a copy an stores he did not go on a tour lucky how job en barely on the presidency never made the new york times besotolist it is sold your than ten thousand copies that is not a lot of copies folks the biding has bee the biding your worn to political has been a bust for the book market that is not just the case remainstroug journalists a

not doing any of those things they simply do not cover all that much when full skill disasters happen on his watch canal full skill disastrous happening on his watch his own party is now attacking him on immigration according to across tensions between the biding administration an local democrats are coming to a head as shelters around the country overflow and thousands of emigrants arrive in major cities fresh abiding stuff between growing calls to help the democratic control cities the politics of the vulnerable issue and what the administration views as legal handcuffs prohibiting much action in cities new york boson and chico the humanitarian crisis for people hoping for new lives in the united states has become desperate the is chess leaders and law makers at various levels government are demanding the administration do more to help a comminate migrants they are frustrate by what they say is bidet's lack of responses enter did urban who is a very strong allied to tubidan despot i wrote him in may it is been four months hive to find out what is going on again this pretty amazing stuff ye you have seen mayor arc arms of york city an your governor catchy local publicly outing with dams demanding the rest o the state receive migrants and local being not it is bidansfault governor milt fillmurphy of new jersey shot down the bide administrations reported idea of relocating migrants to aplanatic city international air port ask for politico general officials view many of the mans as political pestering not realistic solutions because they millrace legal a practical challenges now here is the thing nobody ever considers the possibility may you should work on closing the border because that would you run up a gas all of the favored left wing nostrums about give me your tired your poor yearning masses desiring freedom and all of this then the reality whetstone o i god what he do with all these people it'll tell you what massachusetts is doing masters officials overwhelmed by a riving migrant if now activated the national guard is they scramble for more housing governor maverick help mobilize two hundred fifty members of the massachusetts at natural guard on thursday national guard to help transport the latest wave of asylum at seekers which is again astonishing masschus was nowhere near enough housing or resources currently available to accommodate the influx ism bad policy running directly up against reality remember that time when a the democrats were shouting about why whose techs wining much they've hundreds of thousands of people arriving every month why they wining much when a tiny town browns viltaxas just gets overwhelmed how dare they why they races nat'skiing ship to masschuceli cold the national guard we need to do something about this protesters claim the state has prioritize the need of migrants over the need of its own homeless residents including veterans many at rally were flashing sines the red gets and cape homeless first apparently they are about six thousand families more than twenty thousand people currently residing in massachusetts states shelters according to officials amazing amazing stuff all of this flying well under the remember alexandra cosocortes the greatest and n most wondrous a fresh face fresh faced my face fresh alexandero cosocortes congress person from twitch she she she does stuff with the instant pot and than she also does social media you remember she went down to the border while dona trump was president and fate cried inn empty parking lot directly to camera remember that now she is a sh not doing any of those things i noticed which is weird because i thought that choose truly committed to this to this bit meets a real bit by the way but apparently the commitment ended when the trusts began i love this this is really funny she was she did not interviewed the your times where ism the yer time to asked her speaking of our closest neighbors i want o talk about emigration under hoiden more asylum seekers are being held than private detention cents than under trump families are stilling separated the body administration kept trump your policies that is but up deportations a made her harderfor could make claimants to come to the us what grades you give the ad ministration on emigration and she answered immigration is arguably this administrations weakest issue it is one area where our policy is dictated by politics arguably mars than any other this is where she starting arguabliolot because showed mushes talking about there very clear recommendations and suggestions we made to the administration spread relieve on this issue it is my believe some of the hesitation around this has to do with the fear of just being seen as a proving are providing permission structures a religious the republican narratives that if surrounded immigration o cay that is a lot of verbiage that means a thing no thing what i just thrown a fhraslike permission structure is man we elsen't you to examine the rule costs an migration and address this prom does not start our border it sets that farm policy and the her times reporter see why have not you use your considerable cloud as lateen leader to visit the border and pilot the on going issues there and does it well this is something where actively planning on have done toes by new york aria facilities like ism i noticed where you want the border i noticed it is it is of an s is funny the the her times reporter to they credits quart under the trump administration you did make the southern border in issue shut yes and again i will be visiting the harder when jobidans can be visiting east palestine oho cause it i notice such a thing that you are not doing is is just something that i notice ow can meanwhile china continues to be on the on the edge of a of an economic catechism according to the your times china's biggest home builder is now reeling as the economy slows when country garden the biggest developer in china's increasingly troubled real estate sector published its annual report an aril the cover is inn outed hope a phonic spreading its wings alas wishful thinking shortly after their ports release china masons economic recovery lawsteam and already sluggish real estate market started to collapse a country garden prevails of unfinished apartments a crucial indicator of future of new plunge more than fifty per cent in tune an jury twice the rate of decline in the preceding five months for the past three years as dozens of major property developers defaulted after years of excessive borrowing country garden was an outlier last month in mist the interestpayments signaling that it too was at risk of financial collapse with one hundred and eighty seven billion dollars in debt that is a lot of debt folks that is a lot of tat country garden has staved off in immediate craft it told creditors hat made the interest payment of twenty to one five million dollars within the grace period before default on fridge the company won listen a approval from creditorsopostpone repayment of five hundred thirty seven million dollars it is been a dramatic fall for country garden the company's i probable rise from regional home builder to a nation by behemoth track china's own senior of meteoric ascent now it is claps reflects the speed and severity of the country's real estate meltdown which threatens to do rail the broader economy by the way why this happened the reason that this happen in china is because they eve one metric for success and that is it p it p istle measurer of final and use sales it can be jogged by borrowing and spending if the government borrows and spends on empty apartment buildings to developers country garden well that is counted as it p grot it does not matter the nobody's action buying those apartments in just continue to jack up the guy pietistic by borrowing in spending in borrowing is there sonly one proven at certain point to parasol stops the same thing is true in the united states which is wide is puzzling an stupid that the united states continues to follow china down the primrose path on this one it rally's kind fan amazing thing look a time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i to day bill mar was on with jo organ and again ism friendly with bill friendly with jo bill used to be a main stream left winger he is a main stream liberal mainstream democrat and now as people on the twitters are saying he sounds me and that's not because i have moved and rallying as am ours moved it is because everybody else who used to consider themselves on left as move radically left that maggot left behind here for example is bill mar speaking about wo culture got ripped up for this but of course he is exactly right here he was you can be woke with or e on since the that no emprise but do not say but somehow it an extension of liberalism e because it is most often actually an undoing of liberalism i have always believed as liberals do for example and a color blind society that the goal is to not see race at all anywhere for any reason yes that is what liberals always believed all the way through agama going back candy everybody mayn't loose the king that is son what the woke believe they believed race is first and foremost the thing you should always see everywhere which i find interesting begin that used to be the position of the mukluk's clan that we see race first and foremost everywhere no so again you can have that position but do not say that is a liberal position you are doing something very different the fact he got ripped up for this how dare my now of course he was not saying the alone is doing same sort of stuff as the mukluk's can ho samey ideology the race is the great to french eater and that is the first thing he show notice about a person he saying that is bad whit gan i thought you when i grow up that was just what everybody got thought and ism confuse the a up in the nineties then now long e no and i remember i when public school and this was what you were thought it was considered a good thing and all the sudden it is the reverse mar also slammed black lie's matter pointing out it on it is always tern black lives the matter to be alone in minisota for example i think was many aphis after the gorge flowed murder and the riots i think there was a movement to just paned a lot of the police and they did i think a lot of the police were let go or somehow the police force was was a lesser force than it was and what happened was course crime went up in certain areas and a lot of the officers who had been fired or let go were quite for whatever reason they won't on the force any ore they were hired as private security by who the rich people who could afford to do it their neighborhood state sir that was not exactly i thought a victory for liberalism murders have been happening way out of control in chico among the african america community for far too long and not really reported in this same in the way that they should be it is rat amazing how black lives do not seem to matter when they are taken by black lives but but id they mean now chico my friends o live their safes not safe anywhere gets very sketching very sketch and that chico a om see he saying reasonable things the left is not this white thin a the first party that shows that it can be sain rationals can win broadswas of the electric i mar speaking for pretty much every one at this point on this left right that long if you are unreasonable categories you will greed i the moon soul the left is ignoring it and the right is too busy playing with itself over here on other wishes that that it is it is bells are right there for the picking just they the thinks by them but apparently that thou's be too good for the united states right now oo a time for a quick thing that i hate gay om apparently busting police are now urging robbery victims not to call in when one that seems bad according to fox news busting police and text are asking residence to call three one one if they get rob near in eight t m as the department struggles amid increase in urban crime three one one is a number usually use for non emergency request and in when one is ism being robes three one is yes somebody rob me three hours ago what can i do about that ism apparently they now do not want you to call mine when one even if you are being rob rite the second because they are just overwhelmed busting police department wrote quote even if you're cautious and follow

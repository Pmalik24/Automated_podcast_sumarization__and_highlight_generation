a quick warning there are curse words titter on beeped into days up a shot of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our website this america life door it is this america life am conajoffy wealth sitting in for iron glass last fall i saw this video from my high school in michigan and made it would not have stayed with me in the way that it has if it were not for all the many things that have happened since then that keep reminding me of this video it is turned into a sort of reference point in my head for a dynamic i keep seeing repeated the video is from september twenty twenty one lass fall in michigan bout twenty miles outside in our it is early morning right before the school day a group of parents and their high schooners are kin out loosely crowded around the door to a school a mostly white crowd there is a police officer with top gun sun glasses e a going to goon e i a a i edit i i we anal i gan gan hand do the officer is calmly one might say patronizingly repeating if you are going to go into the building you have to have a mask on nobody in the vino is wearing a mask about twenty than ages are standing between the officer and the door to their school looking actin ages do when they are waiting for anything a little board the little blank lots of cross arms as this goes on i no to not get afore anybody i not wat ma on anybody the not my jot shall they can going without the ma so u a now all e a order wit their can all self the school on the a be en as con non we no of a ma there is no ballon tat what be don you the can go an i ta of on go an i the officer has just said no you cannot go in and the parents are leaving the kids toward the door yelling you can go in some of the than ages look reasonably a little confuse did not the cop just say the exact opposite but they all turn and slowly moved toward the door where the principal and superintending are standing with masks on and the kids are just trapped there in a big clump i give the cannot cot you just n over i remember watching this and thinking what is it to be those high schooners stuck in between your principal and your parent between two authorities who are each certain they have the moral highground when it comes to your life then a passage opens the administrator step to the side and the suits mission o be g e so be c a shoerslok god the kids are inside soon after i saw the masks video i saw another from texts a mom at a schoolyard meeting opposing critical race theory in masks was destructing the meeting an officer goes over to ask er to leave and then he starts going back and forth with her over reseeded teenage son he was just looking at his lap the whole time again what is it to be in the middle that i have since seen many schoolyard meetings where kids in the audience as parents yell about school closures or do not say gay laws or admissions policies when school districts tarted banding books from their libraries i kept wondering do soon care about that does not make the books much more appealing or is there a kid out there whose i read that book by that one s money en not interesting this dynamic a adults arguing about the kids right in front of them it a play that is quietly boring the country right now being reenacted in different places in different forms a play in which you never here from the mean characters people the kids of the school in the mass aria a i was steady for a fish sari i we ready that school i thought that was ne really god this is a student am gonacalled john john everyget i talked to involved in this particular day at this particular school asked that he changed his name and i have the video became very decisive john says what you miss what you do not get from just hearing from the adults in that video he that the biggest thing happening for ham writ at that moment and many students was not masks it was that this was the beginning of school finally a normal year after such a long pandemic i had been around lost people since my freshmen your high school the are live things the changed i know t sounds of your bott lickopes voices got deeper investing that and people people people can drive now people have jobs people did not have them a treating your high school and people have angry parents now coming with them to school and there is an officer outside the front door thatasor was john was wearing a mask that day he was allowed in the school building his mast he walked in about ten minutes before the confrontation outside headed to p english sat down of john's class started and then those kids from outside were allowed into the building a couple the once that were in my class a nock on the door my teacher hadn't open the door end they were recording her be very hostile a computational shavings stuff you are destroying my educational riots a ball wale wale a and then mi teacher basely told them dies ism just i just following the rules in the close the door on them well ye what is you make of that i was pretty descried that so turn around looks ass goes i i i cannot you this thesis this ridiculous i was pretty destroy because i i had never seen people treat teachers that be score and a changed the way john saw his teacher she had such little authority in that moment in many of the other moments that followed in the coming months she would asked kids to where their mask properly they would not she struggled visibly saying things and each to find a job somewhere else john tow kept trying to restore the original order of things the way he remembered school to be the teacher in charge i just made a point to talk with her not trying if you at teachers hat all trying i make it a point to engage in her classis to that i i i tried to so she still had the we authority that she'd the ore everything too place even though she actually did not even tho shank we did not at i was inmesh you i was not these are two students an gonacalled dance and matt who only wanted to speak with me together who were ischia seniors who did not won a use the real names and who tag team every time they speak matte was wearing a mask just as she were one case man one or two she was let into the school building dance was not wearing a mask e and his parents did not agree with the mask mandate he was crowded in with everyone at the front door the spent haunt that principle were getting any at the whole day was just kind of were byway was that polite a ball a just come of distracting o got everyone did wanted just her i asked dance what happened once they were let into the building he says they put all the kids without masks in the library and they were there for hours just as a sort of holding area i guess until they figured out what to do with them there was price taxteeur son catechus angel the lingers teach ears lost e we are get kidskin nasty know was fires was what they call hem ye gaudy no maskers e the teachers is o ye i i talk that about it it was childish all of a sudden everybody in the building including the adults a on one team or the other that am ow o not an very like agrgetat goes very divide and not ever been my get fool and i affect you the rest e schooling everyone i spoke with agreed on this the school year was ruined by what happened that day everything after that was tents people last trust in each other everyone felt less safe less comfortable this thing that had not been rental center for most of them became the main event the students dis agreed on which adults were to blame some of them blame the parents some blame the teachers but they all agreed that the adults were to blames many of the big contentious political issues right now center round kids should teachers be allowed to teach about racism history sexuality well stricter gulas keep our kin safe in school with more a guess if climate policies keep them safer in the fucker which ones all these policy debates that we've been having for months that are e mental to america politics right now a felt kids more than any one else a to day so from do be easy chico we talk to kids living their kid lives in the middle of these divides say with us i one this is not a drill even though kids are somewhat obviously that the center of this next one i was initially drawn in by the parents i suppose because this is a particular parental experience that i spend a fair amount of time trying to imagine an trying not to imagine thermal cops was in the middle of his work day and he got a text from his fourteen year old daughter harper rot there is a talk down right now but people do not know if it is a drill haver one confused can was half a mile from the school lichen he ran to his bike and immediately peddled in

martin to demon to school a shot nineteen students and all nineteen bit every morning after youvaldy and after every school shooting that happened before you've lady and the forty school shootings that have happened far just this year a political debate emerged and re emerges we have too many guns we have too few permits too much mental illness the teacher should have guns the issue is really assault weapons no it is background checks it is a second amen went and meanwhile kids keep going o school and guns keep coming o school and parents keep standing round outside grimly trying to imagine what is going on in those buildings during lock downs that is what can did standing outside his kid school i was dutifully trying to imagine myself into that space i did not ask you the re them if they were scared as such tin a due question but i wanted to know what they were thinking about and how they were spending their time i wanted to know that too what is it for the kids who were actually at recenter of this thing we seem to have decided is a permanent part of our lives now i was split between denial and pantshooting fear and i was not in the roll of pantshitting yet man's oldest kid leaf miss the loud speaker announcement about a school lock down she was very breezy about what she assumed was a drill and tell her sister harppertexted her no this is not a drill are you ka the teacher shut off the lights in myna's english class room blocked the door everyone crouched on the far wall under some shelves and just short of one that little pains of fire star to hit because i have botchy story going one of which am could be the case but i hope is not and one of which i need to believes the case because otherwise my brain would exploded lira's little sister harper was one floor down in hoarse class ninth grate carper's classmates were clustering along the far all but harper sat in her desk twisted her body round toward the classroom door and started filming the door the camera just watches the closed classroom door sometimes her hand shifts or shakes down her shoes black converse pass the health and wellness text boys and then back to the door just waiting well it is almost your staging it for there to be a shooter to come in right there in i thought if it was an actual school school shooting i see all these things of students filming shakily i thought maybe if it was happening i should probably do that a rumor started going around about a kid with a gun somewhere in the school harper and lye a kept waiting for a long time no shooter no announcement no information after a milk and a great enough a period of time had passed an the mention sort of liked out of the room and i just one to my desk in non farcically touch us on your ones man lay just one er play touched mi can peter i did not think i could get fordone am i felt to nervous i mean people were really just talking some people were even real talking about the locked in there just talking about regular high school drama they action to c with in something we who was it was i do not know some girl was no ism being to die of virgin and and then people heard in they sate laughing and and then her friend as know when not gan to i toward i remember enough is is important there is a couple and it was a junior boy and a software girl and the whole time they were just in the corner being cutely an stuff and am they were telling up to each other to the girl was om scare to guitasunin the i was a to t what did you think of that a i thought it was funny a because ecus i we lie tested her world result she got the world and three can there dad was still outside with all the other parents waiting ah and that harder sexton that she got the world and four and i told them i asked about the world and three i shared with the parents outside the school that mi kids got the whole and three or four and they said good work and i share that with i than lira sent us ah some treats from kids who were inside the school ah someone cancel school or else ism a piss all over the cafeteria floors that i sent them some photos of what the outside of the school look thiykiget a sense of how many police cars were there and lira wrote and my bike was in the food and she made fun of me for biking to the school dances the weirdest part of this portion of the day was running the two stories in his head same as lira one story this is nothing we are just waiting the kids will be out soon and the other story ere than a look back on this moment when we thought it was nothing the one rite before all the tragedy but the longer this went on the first story this is nothing had a stronger pull the parents are now some of them have gone home some of them are still there attacking their kids is one guy who legally part in font the driveway with his windows open just doing the longest loudest work call is iron on speaker finds showers all listening yes work call about brokerage fees or something we hes tearing the work called to be close to the school to be you acted to be close to the school we've just sat there waiting for something to happen but ill doing this work call and speaker for i cannot think of a more perfect illustration of what it is to pretend things are normal and america right now a more twenty twenty two image then a work from home finance guy taking plume call from his car outside what may or may not be a school shooting in his kids high school the incredible peaks of disassociation the alienation required to proceed with our daily routines while still allowing for the possibility of story number two of tragedy at any moment and then something happened over the loud speaker it was a man who no one knew was on our principle it was not his voice it was just a random i in it said to days thursday funerary ten twenty twenty two that is it it was a deep man voice being serious and then every one was why why why would they announce that and then my teacher said well that camp he did upstairs clary heard the announcement to and for her this is when she snapped into storied number two she could feel the other kids in the room do the same thing ten sing up getting ready for something to do something us i fee every kid tat some point every high school or thinks about well what would i do if i was in it a mascot in i feel its everyone inside to be a we'd be brave a i would be kind i would know what to say to keep able came would know how to escape i would fight off the shooter well i the short of rest in myself if the shooter comes i probably run away or die had you had that thou before oh yet i think all high scholars think about it especially me dong this true all hi schooners have ha that thought who who am i going to be in a schoolshooting a is the schoolsion yes i would featly say every single america hi share i sought about that really i do not have contact with every single america high schooled nor does lira but once she said this i was curious i started asking around an every kid i talk to kids in texts new mexico misery minnesoda michigan the i what a pop a not into it nice is an east wanting he is a senior this year which means he is had more than a decade to watch of it was from school shootings including videos from last year in oxford michigan which is just a little over an hour away from him and where he heard a student ran at the shooter nix says he is imagined being that my in his school shooting for he would help other kids escape and ad a lot a my for a no we knoll the different way we did it about of the dildo the past yer i had the remit win to outside a had a door nickel was the first of many kids i talk to with an alarming command of the various means of e guess in their schoolbildings it was that way with michael too outside to trout we have rest cordon in new to the band is a end shit door ti can tat inters tout michael told me above the exit door is a drop down ceiling with a missing til you could get up there he heard a couple years ago the senior stuck a christian tree up there he is pretty sure there is space you could stack the cubbies get up to the ceiling what sort of a tiles off and then yell tops tear jots on she end a scape that what if yo reedit to and you had thought about this i i thought about it as a possibility ah ha lot it in the back in my body an might er if we have to the so we do and then last winter a student threatened to kill his class made during six period nobody knew if he really meant it michael school went into lack down and he ended up in the drum line room exactly where he planned to be the ban teacher told them to close the door and stay in there michael and about ten other kids sat on the floor it was completely dark sound proof every one was whispering michael had thought about this moment much and now here it was i told everybody the for with first tot that dislike if we need to here's a drop down shelling here is a til open in the escape i call a riskier now because the who thin o the was bat me stor room title cows boring you con drunken her what was the reaction what a people say i the first a this son be shad was the a due idea that is not how michael imagined this moment goings michaell turns out was not the only one with ta plan he was in a room full of kids who had all prepared for this moment a room full of band kids who knew each other very well michael says every one was exactly themselves ale made jokes honor reminded everyone to be calm and reasonable lucky agreed with honor and said we should hear every side and the nay say who i will not name who thought everyone is idea was down but offered none of his own ideas nobody was surprise they kept going was constant we should make a wall of cubbies no know not we should hide inside the drums this went on for a round an hour in is things tat slow and hour and fifteen menses how much is ire to say i the analog what part of i you had what thoreverybos at each person got a chance to talk yet it is a you ha for this to talk and then you have to i torsion drunk to extortion somebody was actually running time ye who was running the clock comer of course when things got a little tents in this impromptu lord of the flies school shootings planning committee ale started playing pumped up kicks tut the lowest volume possible a do stop it it it gets really bee all the other kids is to that chicks butter one getter wot that is my to these to pa point to kick you his the con of the classic es on frinclis the fact in kid that con shut me did you find at funny i fond e how marks i mi that do theses can sher frow michael told me ale had played pumped up kicks at other lock downs too kind of his lock down thing but usually he waits till the end he says that is how it is over you hear that sonclaing as the police escort you at the billion most kids will not experience actual school shootings but every year millions of kids will experience something this school lock downs that are not a drill that are a sudden urgent response to a real or received threat lock downs that can go on for hours were teachers lock the doors police are swarming and helacoppders bringing blood just in case kids react some kids cry some kids make out a forth greater name judge told me he filled his back pack with books and held it to his chest many of the things i heard about kids doing were somehow generic and deeply individual at twelve year old and burning ham wrote a will that said quit mom i want to give my friend have on everything i own and that includes the a box and games and controllers i heard about a kid and up state new york who called his parents from the bath room during a locked down and came out to them he did not wont them to learn he was gay later an the news if he died but the unifying foundation across all these experiences was the feeling of flitflopping between two different stories maybe is nothing but maybe it is not and how quickly the certainty that you are in the ut probably nothing story can crumble with one noise with a text for harper and lira an virgin it was that announcement an hour in to their lock down the deep man voice on the loud speaker saying to day is february tent two thousand twenty two and i really allege but craze we that what dis that mean who what the hell was that who who the hell was that did anyone recognize that voice o know i didn't recognize that which i thought that it was is that a they noting that cause that is the day we are got to die because i thought oi when they said the date it was could be to days thursday for are tent and one student has died i thought here get a finish it that make a whole big thing but they just ad the date is what the they regain announce deaths on the last finger an announce some something has actually happened because at that point nothing had happened maybe oh the would announce something we we had a school shooter we had a ball we fixed it now you can go we little she what is the rest of that sentence rest what happened to day with story are we in and how does the story and harper and lira stayed and locked down for round three hours the normal end of school three p m came and went lira's rehearsal for any never started eventually police came into the class with guns comments in tactical gear told everyone to put their hands up and they worked in e line out of the building leader parents suspected that the loudspeaker announcement was actually the police a collar had said he was in the school bathroom with two hostages and a gun the police that the shooter was out of state and parents heard that that announcement was a tests to see if he was in the building we'd police here the par system announcement if they got the shooter on the one they did not there were no hostages there was no shooter not for lira and harper school not for the locked down in san anionic were surrey the mom had her sons picture ready to show to the police there was just the much more common place experience of a school locked down that had a supposedly happy ending there are the established respected rituals of an america high school experience prom graduation home coming all those times are people come together and share so sort of collective experience a school locked down is that another kind of school ritual prom et comes with its own traditions and expectations you have imagined what it will be ahead of time who you might be and leader you'll look back and say remember when that thing happened you will look back and say of course that person did that a high schooled named data in new jersey told me that years ago back an first grate they all hid in the closet for a lock down and one kid fell asleep people laughed about that for years another time her freshman year she round a hiding in the closet again that was her long's lock down and a student kept asking to go to the bathroom the teacher kept saying now i remember him ping in a water bottle actuallyaers yes he was being in a hoer wow in front of all the she made him go behind a bookshelf and we had to lake to the furor of the caller and would not she him embarrassing for that kit i think it was a banishing for all i was because he as just us oh the cut all greedy he just there ping and we could catcher him it was just nor tot a good golden it was a not good moment that leader after the lock down not a single person mentioned again he never became the kid who peed in h lock down she do says with that one every one just had a sort of what happens in the lock down stays in he lock down attitude about the whole thing she just thinks they all new it could have ben them coming up a middle schooled and a new law throw up side by side what happens when they finally meat that is in a minute from chico public radio when our program continues it is his america life ism conajoffee wall sitting in for era glass to day kids are at the center of many political debates these days the debate that follows every school shooting about guns and kind of hovers above the lives of actual kids circling but never touching down never really making much of an impact in our next story another adult debate that is superheated rate now man's directly in the life of one kid our pretucearly speak has been spend time with a kid named find an albata albata recently pass two laws that focus on the lives of trains kids it is one of many states to do there is been a massive increase in these kinds of bills across the country republican state legislators have proposed sixty nine new bills to restrict gender affirming treatment fourteen new bathroom bills fifty school restrictions called do not say gay bills and a hundred and thirty sports bands meanwhile find has been growing up and what special about this next try is that you can see how these bills develop alongside his life as he goes from eighth grad to high school and what happens when it enter the picture act to find raises his hand here is please a year before the laws found their way into inn's life he was in eighth red and most eighth greater he was not carefully tracking bills in the alabamestate legislature his attention was on other things there were funny you two videos to watch and unfortunate amounts of mathwen work to do and the problem of which color to die his hair green or purple or blue fins one of those kids who likes to learn without liking school he is taught himself all kinds of things to draw and paint to play guitar he even fish his father's abandoned a electric piano out of the corner of the music room and somehow taught himself to play oaywayway one find lives in grove hill albata a small town roughly two hours south west of montgomery in his small house there are many heart meats there is his mother body and his father josh his two sisters malison and lay and a nosh's ark of animals we have simony can their brothers and ready that three cats we have lobe whishes or dog the bony son has two lizards speed there is a duck in the back yard that gives of in tens anger lives and a whole bunch of chickens fin decided to raise cause find loves animals this is just a chickincie that the but who only gosh an then you have a one lid cat if that is ready hired when find was little he says he liked grot hill la the felt green and free but as he got older things got more complicated grove hill is conservative christian community a church three times a wee cant of place as his monies to say find felt extremely anxious when he first decided to come out as trains and with grad this was in the spring of twenty twenty one after he and his class made re turned from cooked in person learning i do not want it have to tell it and i know people cannot read minds but i do not want explain it i just wanted them to be yea school that is a year this your name go with it gas it it was still very awkward back them awkward for a million reasons because the people an with great had known him as a girl for as long as they had known him because it is always hard to tell people that you see everyday something that you are not sure they want a year and then of course find was fourteen and pretty much every conversation you have when your fourteen is awkward but find this naturally shy kid whose main social good as to stay under the rate are forced himself on the very first day of in person learning he was he lingered by his teachers desk after class hung back and i was just hey own i thing i said my name find now and i see him france and rhesus oh it did not seem she was dis gusted her thin seem she wan to do that she she just seems to more shocked i do not think she is ever encounterday at this point again this is the spring of fins with great year prince kids were not yet constantly in the headlines and fun says most of his teachers were open and sweet with him very excepting and understanding and i jerk before teachers good about using the it pronounce everything for the most part i i mean it takes any one a couple minutes protons are not a small thing for fin when people refer to him with the wrong protean he says it distressing he often feels physically ill it is a response that is not uncommon sometime it slake e pain and mint get i sometimes i actually feel ism going to you sometimes a just after walkaway naturally make sure i do not but queasiness was not much of a problem in middle school fen remembers telling his friends for the first time that he wanted to go by he thing they threats if anyone must up they would function i do not physically remember but i think that was one in their actions heir made me laugh and that is the way it went for the rest of the year the teachers were open the kids were on board and it may fin graduated from middle school feeling good comfortable inn's parents joshing body were incredibly relieve they have lived in grove hill for most of their lives and have a new ants to view of the community all the contradictions that grovhille albata contains body told me that though many of their friends seemed completely indifferent to whether find was trains or not and loved him no matter what maybe even more people in the community find the experience of her child difficult to understand and even his existence unsettling which brings me to high school this is finds mam body two days before school actually started he said what am i suppose to you if i have to go to the bath m at school and i i guess say a s i eve because it stilled click i was what you mean i ye have to go the bath room ghetto the bath e ye it wit i soy stupid now and he said no which want om i supposed to use it do not want to go to the girls room now there were no laws dictating wherein could go to the bathroom not yet anyway when body talked with the school principle about what find should do the principal quickly came up with a solution find could use the single stall bathroom in the teachers lounge this suited him fine and find says at the beginning of school he was feeling relatively onto mystic and was not as worried with my names er pronounce more than i was finding my locker in finding the glasses but almost immediately find encountered push back it started in geometry class teacher was calling roll and i try going up to them while they are doing it they will not call out my did name i but she told me to sit down and she is called on my name and when she walked up to me i corrected her i tell her that that is not my name and i use a different name and pronounce and she was no ism not going to do that ism going go off what is on the paper and what did you say nothing and it was not just the geometry teacher there was suspect from fins english teacher his science teacher even his history and hobby's teacher she pull me aside and she told me that on she respects kids and she loves kids and all that is why she became a teacher in whatever i she will do the name by she will not do the pronoun because that is not what i believe in ism not going to do that it'll just not call on you unit is impossible to know the exact we behind this re sisters i reached toxin's teachers the school principle the superintendent's office all either declined to talk to me were didn't respond but it is clear that the national conversation was changing and growing there were more and more bills direct to to train's kids regulating how they play sports where they went to the bathroom what kind of medical care they could get access to sometimes forbidding any discussion of transissues in school at all did that influence this response was it simply teacher luck of the draw often knew was that very very unfortunately the feelings of the teachers seemed to be spreading talking to me saying the wrong pronounce it affected how other people saw saw me but slowly anyway what you mean slowly intawoy it was more gradually obvious tat people thought i was a girl it was a round remember of his freshmanyere that find began to think more seriously about medical transmission finding a doctor who could profited hormone blockers an eventually testossed her own find thought it might help people to see him the right way very insecure boon's how hi my voice can go oh was if i was able to accesses a and probably heathen find talked to body about getting treatment hormone blockers in testosse her own she told him she was open to the idea but needed to make sure it was safe first she said she would research it find ploughed forward played him beyond suffered through geometry and also became increasingly distress worried that his teachers would continue to misgender him that the kids at school would continue to question whether he was truly boy that it would all just keep on getting worse and then one day in geometry find had a breaking point she either and name to me miss gendered me one of the other in front of the glass and and she messed out a testpaper and o my papers i usually write fin he him just a little reminder no and i did that after writing that i wrote it it was either please stop danimime or misgendering me or i wo kill mi i remember writing it and thin gradient an then writing exec i was scared what was can it happen saying that i they would tell my maker i would i was scared my mam would be i i raced it but then i is like i do not care this teacher needs to sop i rotobec i did my just and i turned at him find says he was not reallygon a commit so side of the team her did not use the right pronounce he just could not think of another way to communicate his distress the problem of suicide is incredibly serious among trains kids a recent study show that in twenty twenty roughly one in two trains u seriously considers suicide that when parents and schools are accepting the rate of actual seaside attempts falls dramatically inn's bomjody did talk to the teacher about this not and she says that she walked away from the conversation feeling at least a little bit better she told me she could see the teacher cared for fin but felt using his right name in pronounce was against her religion she was not at all a brace of with me she did not tense when i brought anything up om she actually she cried when i started explaining om things a parole this is what you did that this is how it is made him feel and she was just a mycosis i sorry i never that was not my intention that was fun before the bills pass fragile struggling to settle into high school and get through

had been grandfather inn but the door was closed behind him de said find was deeply discouraged by the arrangement and that after he would found out he would taken a nosedive in terms of mood he was sure the bathroom would be taken away and that bauble would be even worse about using the react pronouns die said he started talking utmost relentlessly about dropping out it was not just the laws she said but after the difficulty of the previous year this extra piece of weight felt to him it quote sealed his fate it is true that the thin i found when i returned to grovhill felt a different kid he seemed much smaller than before emotionally even physically and you could tell him the way that he was talking that he was in that kind of pain that bubbles out into the open even when you do not want it to for example towards the start of our conversation i asked what i thought would be a fun warm up question it'd been privately wondering how would i begin this story what was the right way to introduce this kid to people you i asked fin to decide for himself oke if you could choose how would the story of you start u just ta kilter and be happy do you why do you look like here about to cry

to some of the lawyers and caregivers in alameda who monitor francs kids to find out what they were seeing and the reports i got backward pretty grim one lawyer told me that she was getting reports that even the kids who always loved school were suddenly resistant to going and there were serious concerns that there would be increased incidents of self harm in a way despite how difficult this has been for him fines kind of the best case in trio he has parents who unconditionally support him ho then aware you doing it is been long how are you it a a few days ago i spoke with hin for the first time since i visited in auras and found out that he was doing surprisingly well ism how are the teachers treating you far this year each since had all his teachers were being respectful about pronouns

in the liras even goes about his day from his perspective they do not protect him they just great obstacles they have made the job of being thin more difficult the least began is one of the producers of our shell one more thing before we clothes hero bar down is an article recently as as working on this episode from enbysynews and a weirdly connects the two stories into day show in a way i did not see coming it is an investigation into a popular conspiracy theory maybe you have heard it it is that schools all across the country are offering litter boxes tho kids who identify as cats if you had not hard this one sorry this is all over social media the story is kids are telling their schools their cats and schools are accommodating them why providing litter boxes at least twenty republican politicians have repeated that this is happening that thesis cut a growing crisis that schools are just allowing kids to identify as whatever they want this gender identity stuff has gone too far and there are kids who are only communicating in duo barks and hisses and it is gotten extreme that school children are now using litter boxes that is the rumor enbysynews looked into this they investigated each one of these claims and tried to find schools where this is actually happening they reached out to every school rumored to have a litter box over twenty places and they found one a whole school district in colorado they had kitty litter but they were not keeping it because kids were identifying as animals no kids were identifying as animals the district jefferson county school district is home to columbine high school schools in the jefferson district have cat litter in case they have to go into lowdown during a school shooting the litter is part of their over all plan if there is an active shooter situation they have litter and buckets kids have somewhere to pe somewhat that is not in a bottle in a closet they have kept cat litter on hand for years along with candy for diabetic students a map of the school flashlights wet wits and first eight items the litter boxes are about school shootings i don't on know i just keep thinking about the hours we have spent talking about kitty litter and the money that when into making this non issue a series of talking points on top of other non issues that also became talking points about where kids p in school when in america we do not have a problem of kidding their cats and being provided with litter boxes what we have are adults who have accepted that school shootings will continue to happen and they are preparing what we have which kids will tell you is an actual problem actual threats actual fear actual drama actual debts our program was prettyshape by daddy rayon and edited by auras a cast valley

welcome to the hubermansciencescience pace i may drew supermen and on or professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamped school of medicine to day we are going to discuss the use of deliberate cold exposure for health and performance temperature is a powerful stimulus on our nervous system and indeed on every organ and system of our body and cold in particular can be leverage to improve mental health physical health and performance meaning for endurance exercise for recovering from various forms of exercise for actually improving strength and power and for enhancing mental capacity in order to properly leverage deliberate cold exposure for sake of mental health physical health and performance y eft understand how cold impacts the brain and body today we are going to discuss that we can talk about some of the neral circuits and pathways some of the hormones involve i promise to make it all clear and accessible regardless of whether not you have a scientific background or not we are also going to discuss a very specific protocols that you can apply which leverage variables temperature how cold how to deliver the cold for instance whether not use a cold shower cold immersion ice bath circulating water or still water whether not your going for walks outside in a teacher when its cold or whether or not your purposely using things crib if you have access to that or not one thing i can promise you is that by the end of to day's episode you will know a lot about the biology of thermal regulation that is how your brain in body regulates its temperature you will also have a lot of tools in your arsenal that you can use and leverage toward improving mental health physical health reducing inflammation in the body improving athletic performance improving mental performance i promise to spell out all those protocols in detail as i go along and to summarize them again at the end id to make a point now that i am going to make several additional times during to day's episode and that is that temperature is a very potent stimulus for the brain and body that also means that it carries certain hazards if it is not done correctly now every one shows up to the table meaning to protocols with a different background of health status and there simply no way that i can know what your health status is any time you are going to take on a new protocol that means a behavioral protocol or nutritional protocol or supplementation protocol you should absolutely consult aboard certified physician before initiating that protocol i do not you say this to protect us i also say this to protect you if you would to see our medical disclaimer you can go to our show notes its describe there in fact i encourage you to please do that and in general when embarking on new protocols in particular if they involve strong stimuli changing temperature placing yourself into unusual temperatures i would encourage you to progress gradually i would also encourage you to not look at gradual pro egression as the kind of weak version of o protocol in fact today ism going to discuss a really beautiful previewed study that involved having people do deliberate cold exposure they were immersing themselves into water up to about their neck and the water was actually not that cold it was only about sixty degrees fareneiht which for most people is pretty tolerable nowhere near the kinds of extreme temperatures that one could use in other protocols and the interesting thing is despite that fairly modest cold temperature by simply extending the duration of time that people were in that water they experience enormous increases in petrochemicals that ought to translate to improvements in focus and mood and indeed that is what is been observed in subsequent studies again plea see our medical disclaimer in our show notes please proceed with caution always please also understand that the most potent stimulus is not always the one that you experience as the most intense in the moment in fact i would encourage you to find the minimum threshold of stimulus that will allow you to derive the maximum benefit from each protocol and indeed i will point out what those thresholds ought to be today it'll i you some simple formulas a gauges or guides that you can use in order to navigate this extremely interesting and potent tool that we call deliberate cold exposure before we talk about deliberate cold exposure and its many powerful applications it'd to highlight a study that i find particularly interesting that i think you will find particularly interesting an useful the title of this study is brief erotic exercise immediately enhances visual attentional control and perceptual speed testing the mediating roll of feelings of energy now the reason i this study is first of all it is a fairly large sized sample group they look at a hundred in one students these were colligated students and they had two groups one group did fifteen minutes of jogging at moderate intensity and they did measure percent tartrates et camera but this would be analogous to zone to cardie which have discussed on this podcast before zone to cardie is cardiovascular exercise that places you at a level where you can hold the conversation with a little bit of strain meaning that you can get the words out but every one's while you have to cat your breath whereas if you were to push any harder by any mechanism going faster or on a steeper incline et camera that you would have a hard time carrying out a conversation zone to cardie is i common form of describing that level of intensity that they call moderate intensity one group did fifteen minutes of jogging at moderate intensity which ism translating to roughly zone to cardie the other group did fifteen minutes of relaxation concentration that is somewhat akin to mindfulness meditation and then they were analyzed for perceptional speed visual attentional control of something called working memory which is your ability to keep certain a batches of information on line i just imagine a some one telling you their pone number and you have to remember that sequence of numbers in your in your head ow for some period of time that is working memory and it depends very heavily on the called prefrontal cortical networks a which involved in planning in action and they also looked at people's feelings of energy and they measure that subjectively how energetic people felt now the major take always from the study that i to emphasize are that the fifteen minutes of jogging group experience elevated levels of energy for some period of time after they cease the exercise whereas the group that did mindfulness meditation actually reported feeling more calm and having less over all energy now that is very subjective in indeed they use subject measures to a analyzed energy but what gets interesting is when they looked at performance on these various cognitive tasks and the two tasks that they use were called the trail making tests they have differentversion to this version version b i do not want to go in to too much detail but virgin a essentially involves having a page of numbers that are distributed somewhat randomly one to theforfives i event and and on but distributed randomly across the page and people have to use visual search to circle those numbers in sequence this involves as y'all attention in involve some motor skills wives the number of things that certainly require energy and focus the second test was the trail making test part be as a mention earlier and this involved also circling numbers and sequence but intersperse between those numbers were letters rather than just having to circle off numbers and sequence they actually had to connect one then the letter a than two than the letter be et camera an remember these a randomly distributed across ta page the major take away from the study is that the group that did the fifteen minutes of moderate exercise prior to these two tests showed significant decreases in the amount of time required to complete these tests accurately that is interesting en ended surprising at lease to me because there have been many studies looking at the effects of mindfulness meditation on the ability to focus the key variable in the study turned out to be energy this feeling subjectively measured feeling i should say of having more energy and thereby the ability to focus especially in these high cognitive demand task now the take away from the study for all of us i think is pretty straightforward if you are going to sit down to do some work that requires focus and working memory and cognivattention and especially some visual spacial control meaning you have to search for things on a page you have to organize things on a page this wo be writing arithmetic basically cognitive work of any kind fifteen minutes of moderate exercise done prior to that workout could be very beneficial for you this does not mean that mindfulness meditation would not be of benefit to you i would not want you to conclude that but if you had to choose between doing fifteen minutes of mindful ness meditation and doing fifteen minutes a moderate exercise prior to a cognitive workout i would say the fifteen minutes of moderate exercise would be more valuable at least based on the data in this paper in many previous podcast have talked about the powerful effects of doing things mindfulness meditation and other forms of an stir non sleep deep rest to these can be twenty minute naps or just lying there quietly with your eyes closed or yogonedra or n star scripts are available on you two in various other places free of cost of any kind you just go to you to put in and s tear non sleep see breast those protocols have been shown to be very beneficial for enhancing neural plasticity the changes in the brain and body that in code or shift the neral circuits that allow for memory to change that allow for learning to a cur after a learning bout what am referring to to day and this particular study is the use of moderate exercise in order to increase one focus and attention in order to trigger that nerd plasticity the simple sequence here is yet energetic and alert do that prior to the learning bout engage in the cognitive work or learning bout and then mindfulness meditation and s tear and forth should follow and if you would to access this paper and to look more at the details in the paper i will be sure to put a line in the shoots the first author is grand and again the title of this paper is brief erotic exercise immediately enhance as visual accentual control and perceptual speed testing the mediating roll of feelings of energy and i also just one to emphasis immediately i think most people out there are interested in tools and protocols that work the first time in that work every time and indeed i think this protocol fit that bill before we begin it'd to emphasis that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls stamford it is however part of my desire n effort to bring zerocost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an treason i still take athleticgreens once or twice a day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your in system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need an the phobics to support my microfilm if you to truth lentic greens you can go to athletic green

today's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar of talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues in organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise your mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element do cam slash supermen and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element elements do cam slash supermen o a let us talk about the use of cold for health and performance i confess i love this topic because it takes me back to my undergraduate years when i worked in laboratory studying cold physiology its effects on the brain and its effects on the body and over the years have always kept track of the literature in this area and indeed there we been some tremendous discoveries both in animal models when robins mice and rats but also in humans and to day were going to talk about both categories of studies and i will be careful to point out when discoveries were made in animal models and when they were made in humans a key point when thinking about the use of cold as a tool and the key point is that you have a baseline level of temperature that is varying changing across the twenty for our cycle any use of deliberate cold exposure is going to be superimposed on that rhythm that circadian rhythm meaning that twenty for our rhythm the basic contour of your circadian rhythm in temperature is that approximately two hours before the time you wake up is your called temperature minimum you temperature minimum is a time within the twenty for hour cycle when your body temperature is at its lowest if you normally wake up around and sucks a m your temperature minimum is probably about for a m if you normally wake up and about seven a m your temperature minimum is probably about five a m it is not exactly two hours before your wake up time it is approximately to ours before your wake up time now as you go from your temperature minimum to the time in which you are going to awake your temperature is rising slightly and then at the point where you wake up your temperature starts to go up more sharply and will continue to go up into the early and sometimes even into the late afternoon and then sometime in the late afternoon and evening your temperature will start to decline and indeed as you approach sleep your body temperature will drop by anywhere from one to three degrees and in fact that decrease in for body temperature is important if not essential for getting into and staying in deep sleep temperature rises with waking that is easy to remember it tends to continue rise throughout the day and in the late afternoon an evening your temperature will start to go down and the drop an temperature actually helps you access sleep that background or what we call base line circadian rhythm in for body temperature is important to remember because it helps us frame both the effects of deliberate cold exposure and t helps us frame when you might want to use deliberate cold exposure in order to as specific states it also points to times within the twenty four hour cycle when you might want to avoid using deliberate cold exposure if your primary goal is to get to sleep of o that is the circadian rhythm in temperature now i just briefly want a touch on thermal regulation at the level of the body and the brain and this will be very surprising to many of you let us do what is call the godonkan experiment which is a thought experiment let us say i send you out into the desert heat for a jog or a run and it is very hot outside a hundred and two degrees or a hundred and three degrees and you start to move you start to sweat and of course your corody temperature goes up now then i offer you a cold towel may be a really really cold towel and this towel saturated with waters you could actually squeeze the water out of that en cool your body off and our godonkan experiment is for me to say o ka where are you going to place the towel how are you going to cool yourself off and ism guessing that most of you would think that the best way to cool yourself off would be to drape that towel over your head may be your neck over your tor that it if yodel really really good and they would cool you off well that is exactly the wrong approach if you want a cool off and in fact if you were to use that approach your body temperature would continue to increase even more yes even more than had you not placed that cold towel on your head or your t torso and here is why thermal regulation meaning your brain and body's ability to regulate your internal for temperature is somewhat a thermostat and that thermostat resides in your brain if you thing by the thermostat in your home or apartment if it is too warm in your home or apartment and you were to take a bag of ice and to put it on that thermostat what with the thermostat do it would register the environment as artificially cool right it would think that the environment was actually much colder than it is and as a consequence it would trigger a mechanism to further increase the temperature in the room and you have such a thermostat as well it is called the medial peptic area of the hypothalamus the hypothalamus is a small region of brain tissue about over the roof of your mouth and little bit in front of that it is a basically right behind your nose and over the roof for your mouth and it is a collection of neurons those neurons have a lot of different functions that include things on the control of a egression the control of sex behavior of the control of temperature regulation and on the medial peptic aria has connections with the rest of the brain or areas within the brain i should say and with many areas within the body it receives input from receptors in our skin and inside our body that register temperature and it acts as a thermostat if the surface of your body is made cool your medial peptic area will send signals by way of hormones and by way of chemicals that will serve to heat your body up what this means is that if you want a cool down the last thing you want to do is to bring a cold surface of any kind towel or splashing water to the majority of your body surface i might be very very surprising you and you might say weight if i want t cool down i should jump into a cold lake or something of that sort that is a different thing altogether what it'll tell you and we will get into this in more depth later is that if you really want to cool down quickly in efficiently you should leverage particular portals meaning particular sites on your body where heat can leave your body more readily and where cooling can have a dramatic and fast impact on your corody temperature can even save your life if you are going hypothermic morganatic more about the specific protocols to reduce corody temperature for sake of performance and avoiding hypothermia later in the episode hyprothermy of course is a very very dangerous situation because while your body can drop in for temperature somewhat and still be safe you cannot really increase your body temperature that much before your brain starts to cook another organ start to cook an by cook i mean the sells actually start to die you have to be very very careful with the use of heat heat stroke is no joke people die from heat stroke all theme you really want to avoid that one way to avoid that is to cool the appropriate surfaces of your body and the appropriate surfaces in this came are the upper cheeks or the i would say the upper half of the face the palms of your hands in the bottoms of your feet have talked about this on the podcast before and in the guessed episode with doctor crag heller my colleague in the biology department at stampford which just very briefly these surfaces the upper half of the face the palms of the hands in the boys of the feet are what we call glamorous skin surfaces g l a b r you s labyrinths and those surfaces are unique and that just below them the musculature is different than elsewhere in the body normally the passage of blood goes from arteries capillaries to veins but just beneath the glabrous skin on the boys o the feet the hands in the upper half of the face you have what are called are trio venous stenoses these are portals of blood that go directly from arteries to veins and in doing allow the body to dump heat more readily more quickly as it turns out that if you are to cool the palms of the hands the boys the feet and upper half of the face you can more efficiently reduce corody temperature forsake of offsetting hypothermia and for improving athletic performance and may be even cognitive performance at we will return to the specific protocols for doing that later in the episode it'll give you love details about how to do that how to do that without the use of any fancy or expensive technology there are some technologies that are now commercially available for instance the called cool it that will allow you to do that with maximum efficiency but also give you some at home methods a to do this either in the him or on runs or for sake of connive work o so the two key themes again are understand that base line circadian rhythm in temperature and understand that the best way to cool the body is going to be by making sure that something cold contacts the bolts of your feet the palms your hands and the upper half of the face ideally all three if your goes to lower corody temperature quickly and again just cooling off the back your neck or the top of your head or your torso with a towel is going to be the least efficient way to lower corody temperature and might even increase body temperature under certain conditions of with those two points in mine we can start to think about directed deliberate cold exposure protocols and there are number of different reasons to use deliberate cold exposure and i want to separate those out for you there are cold protocols that have been tested in pure reviewed studies the are designed to improve mental performance they are designed to improve things resilient or your giddiness or your ability to move through challenge or to regulate your mind and your internal state under conditions of stress and we can define stress very specifically as times when a adrenaline also called epineferan and or norepineferan also called nor adrenaline are elevated in your body forgive me for the nor adrenaline norapinefran a adrenaline epinefro nomen cloture i did not make that up turns out that everyone inside scientists disagree imagine that and you will get multiple scientists naming the same molecule different things ones epinefran and a adrenaline are the same thing i will use them interchangeably norepinefran and nor adrenalin are the same thing i will use those terms interchangeably nor adrenaline and adrenaline are often to released in the brain and body they work as kind of a pair to increase our level of agitation are level of hocus and are desire and our ability to move they are often to released from different sides in the brain and body with dopamine a molecule that is commonly misunderstood as the molecule of pleasure but is actually the molecule of motivation reward and pursuit dopamine norepanfran an nor adrenaline tend to be released together under certain conditions and today you will learn how deliberate cold exposure can be used to cause increases in the release of several if not all of these in ways that can improve your levels of attention and your mood but the key point is that your mental state is shifted when you are exposed to certain forms of cold and many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically to shift their body state as a way to train their mental state that they can better cope with stress in real life and by real life i mean when life present stressible events and i will give you specific protocols as to how you can do that in other words how you can become more resilient through the use of deliberate cold exposure now because of the ways in which deliberate cold exposure can increase this category of chemicals called the catecolomines that includes dreamy nor pin fern an epinefron it can also be used to elevate mood for long periods of time and i am going to discuss a specific protocol that has been shown to increase these chemicals anywhere from two point five acts a two hundred fifty per cent to as high as five hundred percent five times over baseline now you might be asking whether not is a good thing to raise chemicals norepinferan and dopamine to such a great degree whether not that is healthy for us whether not they can harm us but it turns out that these elevations in norapinefran and dopamine are very long lasting in ways that people report feeling vast improvements in mood and vast improvements in levels of cognitive attention and energy by my read of the literature these seem to be healthy increases in our base line levels of these chemicals in ways that can really support us will give you a protocol for that now those are some of the mental effect s of deliberate cold exposure but deliberate cold exposure has also been study animal models and in humans in the contact of increasing metabolism even in converting certain fat cells that we call white fat cells which are the ones where energy is stored the one that we typically think of is kind of blubbery fat to age or brown fat which is thermogenic fat meaning that it can increase corody temperature and serves as and of the furnace by which we increase ore cormatabolism with a very broad stroke i can say that white fat is generally the kind of fat that people want less of and bay fat and brown fat is generally the kind of fat that if you are going to have fat sells and you certainly need fat cells that you want more of they athermogenic they help you stay lean theasshaly serve as a reservoir for heating your body up if you r ever confronted with t a cold challenge sorn talk about how to use cold for metabolism as well and of course people are using deliberate cold exposure to reduce inflammation post exercise to reduce inflammation generally and people are also using cold to enhance performance in the contact of strength training in the contact of endurance training and will talk about those data well but where i to start is with mental performance and i to detail what happens when we deliberately expose ourselves to cold it is key to point out the word deliberate if i do not say otherwise then throughout this episode if i say cold exposure i mean deliberate cold exposure and the reason i point that out is that as my collogue avid spinal in the department of psychitryate stamford says it is not tour about the state that we are in it is about the state that we are in and whether not we had anything to do with placing ourselves into that state and whether r not we did that on purpose or not and what he really means by that statement is that there are important effects of what we call mind set mind set was a topic discuss in the guest episode with ally drum some weeks ago if you have not seen that episode i highly recommend it and the science of mind set tells us that if we are doing something deliberately and we believe that it is going to be good for us it actually can lead to a different set of physiological effects then if something is happening to us against our will or without our control now this is different than placebo effects placebo effects are distinct from in seteffects do ant to learn more about the distinction pile see the episode with ally drum but again when i talk about cold exposure in this episode i talking about deliberate cold exposure meaning that you are placing yourself into a cold environment on purpose in order to extract a particular set of benefits when we talk about deliberate cold exposure almost always that means getting uncomfortable and one of the most common questions i get when discussing the use of cold forsake of mental or physical performance metabolism et camera is how cold should it be how cold should the water be how cold should the environment be and i just will tell you now and i am going to say this again and again throughout the episode because it will continue to be true throughout the episode and long after the episode is over how cold depends on your cold tolerance your for metabolism and a number of other features that there is simply no way i could know or have access to i would likely to use this rule of thumb if you are using deliberate cold exposure the environment that you place yourself in to should place your mind into a state of wo i would really to get out of this environment but i can stay in safely and now that might seem a litigate arbitrary but let say you were to get into a warm shower and it would feel really really nice and you ere to start turning down the warm and turning up the cold there would be some threshold at which it would feel uncomfortable to you and if you were to continue to make a little bit colder than that you would really want to get out of the shower but you were confident that you can stay in without risking your health right without risking a heart attack now that is very different then jumping into a very very cold lake or have seen these images of people that will cut holds into frozen over lakes and they will get into that cold water if you are trained to do that and you have the right conditions et camera that can be done reasonably safely but that is certainly not what i would start with and for many people that will be too cold and indeed some people can go into cold shock and can die as a consequence of getting to that extremely cold water very quickly now that is not to scare you away from deliberate cold exposure it is just to say that there is no simple prescriptive of how cold to make the environment in order to extract maximum benefit for mental or physical performance the simple rule of thumb is going to be place yourself into an environment that is uncomfortably cold but that you can stay in safely and you will have to experiment a bit and that number meaning that temperature will vary from day to day it will vary across the twenty for our cycle because of that in erogenous meaning that internal rhythm in temperature that i talked about earlier low early in the day rises into the afternoon drops at night you can actually do this experiment if you try getting into a cold shower at eleven o'clock at night if you want verses try doing it in the middle of the afternoon it is quite a different experience and by quite a different experience i mean it is it requires quite a different degree of resilient and leaning into the practice your will power will have to be higher i suspect late in the day as it compare to early in the day but that will vary of course between individuals that well the most common question i get about deliberate cold exposure is how cold should the water be and we have answer that with uncomfortably cold to the point where you want to get out whet you can safely stay in the second most common question i get about deliberate cold exposure is wether not cold showers are as good better or worse than to old water immersion up to the neck for instance i also get a lot of questions about whether or not crow chambers are better than all the others et camera et camera am going to make of of that very simple for you by saying cold water immersion up to the neck with your feet and hands submerged also is going to be the most effective second best would be cold shower third best would be to go outside with a minimum amount of clothing but of course clothing that is culturally appropriate and that would allow you to experience cold to the point where you would almost want a shiver or start shivering now there are a number of different important constraints that are going to dictate whether not you use one form of cold exposure or the other for instance some people do not have access to cold water immersion that do not of access to ice baths or cold water tanks a cold ocean or cold lakes et camera in that case showers would be the next best solution i do one to emphasize that therehave been very few if any studies of cold showers and you can imagine why this would be the case in a laboratory you want a control for as many that variables as possible placing people into a cold water immersion or an ice bath up to the neck and insisting that they keep their hands and feet under is very easy to control it means that every one can do essentially the same thing whereas with cold showers people are different size bodies some people are con put their head under some people are on are going to lean forward measuring the amount of cold of water exposure on the body is very hard to do and there are not a lot of studies of cold showers but of course lot of people do not have access to cold water immersion they have to use cold showers and if you do not have access to both of course than going outside on a cold day can be of benefit but i will point out that the heat trance fer from your body into water is much higher for times greater if not even greater depending on the temperature of the water in water as supposed to in air it is going to be much more efficient to do cold water immersion than anything else cold showers after that and put yourself into a cold environment would be the third best thing ism not going to get into crowd chambers because they carry quite a high degree of cost and again there are not many studies of them if you have access to crowd chambers ism sure that the crowd chamber facility is told you about all these incredible benefits and i do not doubt that some of those benefits truly exist but most people just do not have the resources or the access to those who are totally crowd chambers out of today's discussion and of course i realize as a fourth category of cold exposure out there people are wearing ice vests believe are not those exist ice underwear yes those exist you can look for them when i mason if you they are putting cold pass in their arm pits ore in their growing or elsewhere in order to stimulate some of the effects of cold on mental and physical performance ism not can address those in too much detail to day they can be efficient in certain ways but as you will learn about later in the episode cooling the palms the upper face and the bottoms of the feet is going to be far more efficient and unfortunately i think most of the people that are using ice packs increased or cormatabolism are not a ware of the glazer skin cooling and how it can be a very very potenstimulus will return to that a later unless i say otherwise i mainly going to be focussing on cold water immersion and cold showers let us talk about protocols for enhancing mental health and performance using deliberate cold exposure what happens when we get in to cold is that we experience and increase in nor epineferon in noradrenalin release and in a adrenalin release the fact that cold exposure deliberate or no increases nor epineferan an epinefron in our brain and body means that it is a very reliable stimulus for increasing nor upinefer nepinefron that sort of an obvious statement but that obvious statement can be leveraged to systematically build up what we call resilience now when we experience a stressor in life whether not its something bad happens in our relationship or something bad happens in the world and we feel stress that stress is the consequence of increases in nor epineferon and epinfron in our brain and body very similar if not identical to the kinds of increases that come from deliberate cold exposure deliberate cold exposure is an opportunity to deliberately stress our body and yet because it is deliberate and because we can take certain steps which all describe in a moment we can learn to maintain mental clarity we can learn to maintain calm while our body is in a state of stress and that can be immensely useful when encountering stresses in other parts of life and that is what we call razilients or grit our ability or mental toughness our ability to lean into challenge or to tolerate challenge while keeping our head straight to speak one simple protocol for increasing resilience is to pick a temperature that is uncomfortable of shower or cold immersion and then to get in for a certain duration of time and then to get out now it is important understand that people experience different levels of norepinefrn an adrenalin release when getting into cold water some people because they dread the cold much we will actually experience nor epinefran an epineferant increases even before they get into the cold water or under the cold shower now you may have experiences have certainly experiences it's dreading it i do not want to do it and i have to force myself to do it and indeed epineferan in nor epineferan and its surges can be thought of a sort of walls that we have to confront and go over and third you to conceptualize them that way because it allows us to build protocols that can be very objective and can allow us to monster our progress in terms of building resilience one option is to simply say oke i am going to force myself to get into the cold shower for one minute how cold again in comfortably cold but you can stay in safely or am going to get into the ice bath for one minute ice was are very cold a inevitably and what is also inevitable is that when you get into the cold you will experience a surge in epinephrin and norepinefron that is none negotiable because it is mediated by cold receptors on the surface of your body in your skin and the way that they trigger the release of nor epinefern and epinephrin not just from the adrenals from the admen a lands above your kidneys but also from regions of your brain the locus sedulous which cause increases in the mention and alertness and from other locations in your body where epinephrin and norpineron a released in other words cold is a non negotiable stimulus for increasing epinephrin and norepinepron even if you are the toughest person in the world and you love the cold that increase in epinephrin an norepineron is going to happen the way to think about nor upon opera an operon from in this context of building went raziliens is that you have two options you can either try to extend the duration of time that you are in the deliberate cold exposure going from one minute to seventy five seconds to two minutes and on over a period of days or one way to approach this and the way that i particularly favor is to take the context of the day and the moment into account meaning we have different levels of grit and railings on different days and depending on the landscape of our life at the time even the time of day that were doing these protocols and start to be able to sense the release of pin apron epineprancscuse me and norapineprn an our brain and body and see those as walls that we want to climb over in order to build razilients and to start counting the number of walls that we traverse and the distance between those walls as we do deliberate cold exposure let me give you an example of the time protocol because that one is very straightforward although i do not think it is as powerful for building mental railing the time protocol would be money i do one minute of deliberate cold exposure at a given temperature wednesday i extend that by fifty per cent and fridge i do deliberate cold exposure for twice as long as i did on money and if i were to continue that every week money when see fridayi would continue to either increase the duration or i would lower the temperature and reduce the duration this kind of thing very much sets in rests in the go now that option is very objective right you could even log it in a book and as you developed the ability to stay in cold temperatures even progressively colder and colder temperatures for longer and longer periods of time you will be come more resilient what do i mean by that while my operational definition of razilients is that you are able to resist escape from the stressed the cold by virtu u of your will power which is really your prefrontal quarter causing top down control on your reflects and your limbic system in your hypothalamus which are basically telling you to get out of that cold water get out of that cold environment and in doing you are easily getting better at controlling your behavior when your brain anybody are flooded with nor upon efferent an upon felon that is a very reductionist way to explain razilients or great or mental toughness but it is a reductionist way of explaining it that is very closely tied to the biology end to the psychology and it is a fact that nor up an efferent an epineferan release in the brain embody are the generic universal cod for stressed there is no unique chemical signature for different forms of stresses that is the only one although of course their other chemicals in all dos well you could go for time and you could try and reduce the temperature and increase the time over period of days or weeks now that is an attractive way to approach things but the problem is that you do not have an infinite a moon of room with which to lower temperature because eventually you will get into temperatures that are either cold that they are dangerous or you have to stay in cold temperatures for such long periods that it becomes impractical because presume w u also have to take care of other aspects of your life you cant just sit all day in the ice bath now for that reason i favor a protocol in which you build mental razilients and mental toughness through two different types of protocols the first one involve counting walls now what do not mean by walls i mean the sensation of no i do not want to do this and the idea or the sensation in your brain an body that you actually want to leave that environment and go warm of now again for some people that will be even before getting into the ice bath or cold shower if you are feeling very resistant to getting into the ice bath or cold shower and you manage to do that that going over what i wild call one wall oke then for some period of time you might actually feel comfortable in the ice bath cold water or cold shower and you feel you could stay there for some period of time that you could say there for a minute or two minutes but inevitably the next wall will arrive and i would encourage you to pay attention to when that next wall drives and actually having an awareness that called interceptive awareness as we call it of when that next surge in a adrenalin pan efferent comes or whether not it reaches us certain threshold in your brain body tat you feel you want to get out and you are able to stay in for even just ten seconds longer that means you have traversed yet another wall and if you continue to stay in that cold environment you will find that the next wall will come an the next wall will come now eventually of course you will get very very mum depending how cold it is and you could also place yourself into danger you have to maintain cone of control counting these walls traversing these walls but getting out at some point of course my favorite protocol for build long mental toughness a c grit a c razilients is to take into account that some days just getting into the ice bathricol shower represents a wall some days it does not some days you get in and you feel you go go ten minutes other days you get in and you feel you could only go a minute and setting a designated number of walls before you start the protocol is going to be very beneficial here you say as long as i canto it safely ism going to do three walls to day the first wall is getting in the second wall will arrive when it arrives and the third wall will arrives when it arrives and it'll get over that wall than it'll get out the next day you might do five walls the next day you might do three walls again but you might lower the temperature this gives you tremendous flexibility and indeed it gives you much more latitude to be able to use the same temperatures in different ways or to reduce the temperature only a little bit and still get a lot of stimulus meaning a lot of results out of a given protocol whereas people who are just going for temperature an time eventually become cold adapted they get very very good at doing three minutes or six minutes or even ten minutes at a given temperature and then they feel they have to lower the temperature even more and even more and eventually they just bottom out there is nowhere else to go there is nowhere to get improvements out of the protocol at least not in terms of mental razilients of course there still the pop of effects on inflammation and metabolism et camera that will talk about in a little bit but the key thing here is to design protocols that are going to work for you over time and for you very very party very very tough guiding galls out there that can get right into an ice bath or very very cold immersion and you can just grind it out for six or ten minutes or you can even do that by remaining peaceful well more points to you but guess what that is the equivalent of already having loaded up the bar bell with six hundred pounds and done your ten rats there is not a whole lot more variable space with which to get benefits from that stimulus and in the weight room people understand that you can adjust for instance the speed of the movement or you can start combining that movement with are exhaustion et camera with cold exposure you do not have as much variable space to play with if you are goal is to build resilient either go for time as a function of temperature or what i suggest is to start recognizing these walls as an experience of resistance in you and going over those walls set a certain number of walls that you are going to go over on a given day and do that at a given temperature and then to mix it up and ideally you might even throw in one more wall at the end if you are really feeling bold and brave because that is can to build out further razilients but if you want cold exposure to work for you for sake of building up brazilein to mental toughness over time you are going to want to vary this perimeter space in some sort of way and you do not have to be supersystematic about it that is the beauty of this kind of approach because your relying on the fact that those walls real my represent times in which you are forcing your top down control your prefrontal quarter to clamp down on your reflex and your learning behavioral control in the context of your body having elevated levels of these catacomb mines nor pinferan an epineferon and that translates to real life in a much more realistic way i believe because in real life you are not really engaging in stresses for a given amount of time that how long its can a last and the context no most stresses arrive in the form of surprises we do not ten messages that deliver bad news information about the outside world or real world and on line inter actions that send our system into a state of increase nor epineferan an epineferon and if you start to think of those as walls that you con tolerating climb over while staying calm and clear of mind then you can really imagine how the ice bath and other forms of cold exposure are really serving to train you up for real life stresses o a the next question that i always get is what should my mental state be while i am exposing myself to this uncomfortable yet safe condition of cold well you have two options an their probably other options as well one is to try and calm yourself to remain as mentally still as possible the other is to lean into that challenge and to grind it out and here i have to say that this is a lot teaching some one to drive on a gravel road for any of you that have driven on a gravel road that there is no optimal speed for all gravel roads tot depends on the density the gravel et camera and the vehicle et camera for instance on some gravel roads when you start to drive in the dust starts to kick up your best option is to drive fast and put that dust cloud behind you on other gravel roads if you try and do that the dust action kicks up around the vehicle ad makes it hard to see sometimes you have to slow down the same thing is true for getting through deliberate cold exposure some times it is easier to calm yourself one way to do that is through double inhales through the nose and extended exiles through the mouth or simply by thing to control your breathing and reduce the pace of your breathing and increase the volume of your breathing i have to say that every one experiences a shortening o breath when they get into uncomfortably cold water that is a universal physiological response everyone also experiences a thirty to eighty percent decrease in cognitive function in particular of the frontal quarter the metabolism your front of quarter goes down the metabolism meaning the activity of brainairies associated with stress and panic goes way up and anchoring your mind in cognitive activities as you get into the cold can be very very helpful for maintaining clarity of mind fact one thing that i sometimes recommend is that people try and engage in some sort of cognitive exercise while in the cold not as a form of distraction but as a way to maintain clarity of thinking it to learn how to do that when the body is flooded with all these chemicals that make us it rest for inch as you could do math problems and not too less to equals for not young three times tor equals nine but things that require a little bit more focus and attention working memory and forth you could also start to have thoughts that you deliberately impose a full sentient structure on that is actually quite tough you could try and recall specific bouts of information that are challenging this is teaching your mind how to stay on line or rather i should say this is you teaching your forefront a quarter how to stay engaged while you have high levels of stress in your body years ago i had a friend who who works in the cool science world researchinral scientists who is obsessed with a this very bazar sport that i do not necessarily recommend at all which is the commination of boxing and chess you may have seen this on you too where people will box around legitimate boxing around their sparring all out often and then at the end of the round instead of resting in the corner they actually sit down and play chests and then they go back to boxing and back to chest again not a support that i recommend but the reason he was obsessed with this is because he studies the impact of stress on connive performance and what that particular very bazaar sport was doing was toggling back and forth between different states of mind now it is used both to increase cognitive clarity for the fighter when they box because staying calm and clear thinking is very important to winning boxing matches it believer not it is not in all outrage it is a very calculated game of mental chess and physical chest that is quite high stakes as you can imagine it is also used in some circles as a way to teach people how to engage in cognitive performance when their body is simply filled with stress in the boxing chests example the replacement for the cold water is actually the boxing write its the thing that spoke to induce the stress is getting hit stressful and the risk of getting hit distressful for most people again if you think about deliberate cold exposure as a way of just systematically and reliably inducing apinefrnan or apinefran release and delivering stress will then this idea of maintaining cognitive clarity in actually engaging in cognitive tasks while in the ice bath or cold shower can actually be very beneficial even though might sound a literate silly you are really training up your ability to keep your brain working when the reflect is to shut down the parts of your brain than involved in deliberate planning and thinking now another important aspect of deliberate cold exposure that i rarely if ever here discuss but is vitally important is whether not you move around or not here is the reason when you get into cold water and you remain there for some period of time your body is generating heat and that heat generates what is called a thermal layer that surrounds your entire body if you stay still you are actually warmer than if you move around you can try this the next time your doing your deliberate called exposure if you are submerge up to the neck sit there f breakout ten thirty seconds and be very very still of body in fact this is the way that most people start to do deliberate cold exposure they give this very stoic look they do not blank they look very peaceful some of them even look tough it or they make a very a even a emotional face and it looks the the really tough but they are still that believe it are not they are not providing the most potent stimulus if they or you were to move around in that water whet would happen as you break up the thorn malar and that you actually experience that is much colder if you really want a push the razilient's aspect or for instance if you want to use a given temperature that your comfortable and but that you want to increase the stimulus and you want to get more benefit for mental razilients training well then get into the cold water move your body around continuously but try and keep your mind still or even do some sort of connive task as your trying to realize there are bunch of different variables that you can play with will maintaining the same temperature of water and in doing really keep you in the zone of what should and absolutely has to be safe for you without having to just continually drop the temperature from say sixty degrees to fifty five to forty to thirty thirty because as i mention before eventually your on a bottom out if you are one of those people they likes to look tough or really relaxed while you are in the ice bath or cold water immersion just realize that you are actually cheating yourself out of part of the stimulus keep those limbs moving and of course limbs under the water feet and hands is going to be a more potent stimulus than hands and feet out for reasons that should be obvious basin what we talked about in terms of labor skin cooling to keep those submerge move your body petal maybe move your knees up and down petal your feet and trust me its going to feel a lot colder than were you to remain stone still another very common question is how often to do deliberate cold exposure it is tough to make a recommendation on that based on any previewed study although there are a fou in humans that point to a threshold of eleven minutes total per week that total throughout the week divided into two or for sessions of two or three minutes are now that eleven minute cut off is not a strict threshold and is actually geared more towards increases in metabolism will get into this love it later in the episode but i think the eleven minute threshold meaning eleven minutes total of deliberate cold exposure per week is a pretty good number to use if you need a number in order to keep you consistent but as we talked about early er some of you are going to be in the ice bath or cold immersion or cold shower for one minute others of you will be in there for ten minutes depending on how frequent and how high if you will those walls of a adrenalin are coming for some of you getting into a cold shower for three minutes total for the whole week will represent a tremendous achievement in terms of will power and overcoming the resistance to doing that overdo mind those walls for others of you three minutes is nothing what do i recommend i recommend that you get at least eleven minutes total per week but at the point where eleven minutes total per week is very easy for you as no longer representing a significant mental challenge meaning your not experiencing many of these walls your excited to get into the cold shower immersion you're going through it easily your cruising basically then i would say either lower the temperature safely of course extend the duration safely of course or increase the frequency that you are doing this perhaps every day or may be five days a week or three days a week i personally get tremendous benefit from doing deliberate cold exposure three times a week and using the walls method that i described earlier as my gauge for how long to stay in and typically that means that ism staying in for anywhere from two minutes to six minutes permission and that averages out to a out a even to fifteen minutes total per weak again i do not think that you need to be superscript about these guidelines it is most important when embracing a protocol a that you do it safely but secondarily that you do it consistently find what you can do consistently and then vary the parameters that will allow you to continue to do deliberate cold exposure consistently regardless of whether not you have access to a shower or cold immersion et camera o case hat we been talking about mental effects and the use of deliberate cold exposure forsake of building resilient which i do believe can be tremendously powerful but it is no coincidence that the screening and the training for navy seals involves a lot of exposure to cold water one could argue that it is deliberate because they elect to go to buds but when they get into the cold water at buds is dictated by the instructors and the reason they use cold water exposure as the stressed is that it does offer considerable leeway in terms of duration and temperature in terms of how you can use it as a stressor writings heat do not offer much variable space as we say there is not a lot of room beyond which you start injuring or even killing people by using heat there lot of forms of stressor out there but cold is one that we can titrate that we can adjusting ways that can allow us to continually build up and or maintain mental toughness now deliberate cold exposure also has many effects on chemicals other than norepinefron an epinefron most notably the neuromodulator dopamine which is involved in elevating our mood making us feel energized and enhancing our ability to focus and that has a lot to do withhold dopamine engages us in motivated states tends to narrower thinking in our behavior into a particular trench of got directed behavior you want to learn more about dopamine you can learn a lot about dopamine in our episode about dopominuts that hurt labdoutcom you confined it is a two and a half hour plus a can a dead dive into all things dopamine focus motivation et camera deliberate cold exposure has a very powerful effect on the release of dopamine in our brain embody and this is one of the main reasons why people continue to do deliberate cold exposure basically it makes us feel good and it continues to make us feel good even after we get out of the cold environment ins fact some people would say they do not feel good in the cold environment it is all stress for them but afterwards they feel great one of our previous guests doctor on alempki whose a medical doctor at stamped university school medicine she's a close colligomine described the use of dopamine in her book dopamine nation an incredible book about a diction in dopamine should mention and the use of dopamine elicited by cold water it exposure by one of her patients what ism referring to is the fact that one of her patients helped themselves get and stay sober off drugs by using deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine a healthier form of dopamine release than they were engaged in prior to getting sober now the basis for dopamine release in response to cold exposure is that the catacolamines nor upon epronepan ran and dopamine ten to be to released by the same sorts of stimuli but most stresses and in particular things that evoked stress were our feelings of stress internally that we do not do not increase dopamine they only increase in tarpan earn anepineferon but deliberate cold exposure seems to cause a dramatic increase in dopamine and this has actually been substantiated in a really beautiful study entitled human physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures the first author is tragic a m almost certainly pronouncing that poorly if and if not incorrectly s a a an e k this was published in the european journal of applied physiology in the year two thousand really a beautiful study i love this study they took people and they had them sit in chairs under water but their head was out and they were they were messed up to the neck in either three different either of three different temperature use me thirty two degree sepsis which is eighty nine degrees fareneite twenty degree sepsis which is sixty eight degrees farenheite or fourteen degree census which is fifty seven point two degrees farenheite not super cold but then what they did is they measured people's corody temperature throughout they measured their metabolism and they looked at serum levels of things nor up an veteran epinefron dopamine incordizul cyramening within the blood really nice and quite thorough study there were not a huge number of subjects in the study but none the less it was a very thorough study in terms of the number of variables that they explored i just one of briefly highlight some of what they saw or what they observed in this study first of all all the groups were in the water of a given temperature for one hour which is much longer than most of the deliberate cold exposure protocols that anyone is using at home you maybe you are taking one hour long cold showers maybe you are getting into the ice bath for an hour although i do not recommend that i think you would probably get badly hypothermic or maybe you are getting in to a cold water immersion for some period of time but i have a hard time imagining that it would be an hour and i do not suggest that if it is very cold this study focus on she somewhat moderate my cool temperatures not what i think most people would consider very very cold temperatures but extended the duration for quite a while again thirty two degrees sepsis twenty degrees census are fourteen degrees census here is what they observed the group that was immersed up to the neck in thirty two degrees census that is eighty nine degrees barren height water did not experience a shift in metabolism nor a significant increase in doom group an effed or these other catacolomines the group that was in twenty degrees census meaning sixty eight degree farenheit water for an hour experience a ninety they per cent increase in metabolic rate which is remarkable given that the water is in that cold and yet an hour is a pretty long time to be in there and again it speaks to the dramatic effect of heat transfer that water has which i mention earlier as suppose to being out in the air at sixty eight degrees it would in certainly not cause that increase in metabolic rate the group that was at fourteen degrees sepsis meaning fifty seven point two degrees farenheit water for an hour experience a three hundred and fifty per cent increase in metabolism huge increases in metabolism now the most interesting data to me at lease in terms of mental effects of deliberate cold exbeisere were that the plasma or serum levels of group in efferent in the blood increased five hundred and thirty per cent these are huge increases in group in efferent it suggests that this is a stressful stimulus at least nor chemically speaking stressful despite the fact that it is not super super cold although fifty seven point two degrees farenheit fourteen degrees silesias is not a know it is not a warm environment but it is not a ultra ultra cold environment but an hour is a very long time to be in there the subjects also experience a two hundred and fifty per cent increase in dopamine concentrations which while not five hundred and thirty per cent as it was with nor an efferent is still a very large increase in base line levels of dopamine and what was interesting is that those increases in dopamine persisted for a very long period of time afterwards even out to two hours ocean they they stop the study after a hundred and twenty minutes of getting out of the a cold but none the less these increases in nor afferent are huge and long lasting and these increases in dopamine are very large and long lasting and i do believe that these documented effects in humans explain much of the enhancement of attention and of feelings a well being in mood that people typically experience after doing deliberate cold exposure and the reason i say that is that if you were to go back to the episode that i did on dopamine or you were to go back to the episode that i did with doctor onalempki on a diction in dopamine what you would find is that increases in dopamine of the sort evoked by deliberate cold exposure are actually very similar to the kinds of increases in dooming that are elicited by things nicotine or from other behaviors that are known to be addictive and bad for us because they lead to other effects on the brain and body that we simply do not want and yet deliberate cold exposure provided done safely can create similar if not greater increases in dopamine that are not just fleeting that do not joust occur during say the consumption of some deleterious drug or or activity but that are very long lasting and that can be leverage toward activities other than deliberate cold exposure i not emphasize this am not suggesting that people do deliberate cold exposure for an hour a day and unfortunately there are not many studies yet exploring how shorter colder and temperature environment exposure say one minute or three minutes or six minutes at fifty five degrees or it om fifty degrees whether not that leads to similar greater or reduce levels of dopamine in the brain and body and yet almost everybody who does deliberate cold exposure will say yet it was stressful i did not enjoy it or i eventually grew to it but that i always feel better afterwards and then that feeling lasts a very long period of time and i think it is almost certain that those experiences that people report relate to these increases in dopamine and in concert with the increases in nourepanefferan also explain the other effect that is commonly reported which is an enhancement in mental acuity and the ability to focus now here we can extrapolate to the study that i discussed at the early part of the episode where stocking at the use of short fifteen minute exercise can a moderate intense exercise and how that was shown to increased levels of energy and mentalacuity in these working memory of visual attention task and there again we have to assume somewhat because they were not doing their chemical measurements but we can reasonably assume that those improvements in connive performance were due at least in part to the increasing catacolamines known to accompany moderate intensities own to cardie what your strong to see here is a theme the theme is that virtually any stimulus that delivers more nor upon feral epaneffran and dopamine to our system will sharpen our mental acuity and elevate our mood and will do for some period of time deliberate cold exposure it turns out is a very potent way to increase these catacolamenes this category of chemicals and thereby to improve mood mentilacuity and levels of alertness and as will next see it not only has that effect which can be very beneficial for many people and a bunch of different circumstances but it also has the abusive effects that many people seek in terms of metabolism in lowering inflammation in the body and other physiological effects as well and forgive me i was almost ready to move on to effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism and inflammation and forth but i neglected to point out one of the other very interesting aspects of the study showing deliberate cold exposure can increase in our pan efferent and dopamine which is that they observed no significant increases in the stress hormone cortical and that is both surprising interesting and important because what it means is that the quality of stress that deliberate cold exposure is creating in the body is likely to be one of what we call use stress lonelier the great physiologist one an about prize for distinguishing between distress which is stress in the brain and body that cause is the release of things cortical along with the other catacomb means and that we experience as negative happening to us and can lead to negative health outcomes and he distinguish that from use stress which was stress that we now understand is associate with increases in things norupan ran and dopamine but no increases or minimal increases in cortical and that can lead to positive health outcomes it appears that deliberate cold exposure can create what we call or what honcelie called use stress in other words it can create a condition in the brain and body in which we are stressing ourselves we are training up resilient and yet we are creating a petrochemical mil e that actually has many health benefits now i to shift our attention to the effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism and id to start by detailing a study that was performed on humans and published just at the end of last year the title of the study is altered brown fat thermos regulation and enhanced cold induced thermogenesis in young healthy winter swimming men and i should point out that while the study was only performed on male subjects there is no reason to think that the effects that they discovered would only pertain to men i would hope that they would also do a study on women at some point in the future but the effects that they describe are very basic core physiological processes what they did is they looked at deliberate cold exposure in this group of young men and they used that eleven minute threshold per weak in other words they had them get into cold water for approximately eleven minutes per weak and again that is eleven minutes total per weak they divided that into two sessions although in speaking with the first author of the study doctor susannisoberg i learned that it probably is not important that it be two sessions it could be three or even four sessions as long as it reaches that eleven minute threshold what they discovered was that by going into these cold environments in this case cold water immersion up to the neck for eleven minutes total per week that these men experienced increases in called brown fat thermogenesis it'll talk more about what that is in a moment and increases in corody temperature that translate to increases in cores body metabolism now the overall increases in corody metabolism that they experienced were not extremely large they were statistically significant but they were not extremely large however the changes in brown fat stores are perhaps what is most interesting about this study and i tell you why the metabolic increases of deliberate cold exposure are both acute meaning happening in the short term when you get into the cold and immediately after one does experience in increase in cores metabolism you burn some calories and other words and while those might not be very significant increases or i should say they can be statistically significant but they are not enormous we large numbers of calories burned the longer lasting effects of deliberate cold exposure or metabolism seem to take place by changes that occur in the types of fat that we store in our body and the way that that fat impacts are metabolism at other times throughout the twenty four hour cycle this actually has a somewhat anecdotal basis in particular in scaninavia i do not speak swedishion when i speak danish nor do i speak nor begin but i do have danish relatives and they were able to help me decipher a a common swish saying which essentially translates to the fact that in preparation for the summer they say one should expose themselves to warm environments that one is comfortable in warm environments in the summer that is one half of this traditional swish and also danish saying the other half of this traditional danish swish saying is that in preparation for winter in order to not feel to cold in cold environments one should prepare for those in the fall by not wearing a jacket and exposing oneself to cold environments now of course this is just anecdotal cultural lore but it actually has a physiological basis which is by exposing oneself to cold environments on a repeated basis in anticipation of exposure to more extreme cold environments one can feel more comfortable in those extreme cold environments and that is exactly what they observed in this study by sobergadal the men felt more comfortable extreme cold if they had trained through deliberate cold exposure which might not seem surprising at all but based on what we talked about earlier whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes this discomfort and this experience of nor up in veteran release at least in the short term then you would say well should that deliberate cold exposure also make them feel uncomfortable they really want to get out well that is true at the beginning of a deliberate cold exposure protocol meaning in the first week or in the second week of the third week but what one finds in what you will find if you do deliberate cold exposure consistently is that you will then become more comfortable at cold temperatures away from the deliberate cold exposure whereas you might have previously been the person who as always cold in the room with air conditioning are always seeking a sweater always wanting to bundle up you will be more comfortable in those cold environments and the reason for that is well substantiated from this study end from animal studies whereby deliberate cold exposure converts one particular kind of fat cell the white fat cell which is a very low metabolic output cell its basically a storage site for energy in the body fat cells to a different type of fat cell which is the age fat cell cold age because its actually age or slightly brown under the microscope or even to brown fat cells which are very dark under the microscope and dark because they contain met mite conduit and are very metabolically and thermogenically active in other words white fat does not burn many calories its basically a storage site its a bank account for energy its filled with lipids and those lipids can be used if the body needs energy and if it goes into a colonic deposit base fat and brown fat acts a sort of a fulness or the sort of fat that we would find in a candle a fuel that can increase corody temperature base fat and brown fat is very good at raising our metabolism and helps burn white fat now of course it does that only in the context of a colonic deposit but it can actually help create that colonic deposit having more base fat and brown fat can increase your over all cormetabolism in other words the number of calories that you burn per day and therefore the number of carries that you need to either maintain or to lose weight the simple translation of this is that getting in to cold water for a total of eleven minutes perhaps more but at least eleven minutes per weak divided into two or for sessions can increase your cormotabolism in part by increasing your age and brown fat stores and we know how that works at least in animal models and there is now reason to suspect that the exactsame mechanisms are occurring in wants the primary way in which deliberate cold exposure converts white fat cells into these more metabolically thermogentically active metabolism increasing age and brown fat cells is because norapaneferon released when we get into the cold binds to receptors on the surface of white fat cells and activates downstream pathways such as you s p one this is an uncoupling proline one that acts on the mite construal metabolism of cells and increases the mitochondrial output of those cells and the mitochondrial density of those cells in other words it takes a cell that has a kind of a weak engine or no engine for generating energy although every cell has some mitochondria it takes cells that have very fuwmitochondria and increases the engine size and of stokes the furnace of those particular cells and actually can change gene expression in those cells that is what is really interesting deliberate cold exposure causes increases in group interferon which bind to receptors on the surfaces of white fat cells which triggers the release of things you c p one it also causes the release of things p par game and factor p g c one ism going refer you to a review if you want to learn more about these for those of either do not want to learn more all you need to know is that the downstream of all that are increases in mitochondria and metabolism and actual genetic changes in the white fat cells that convert them into age and brown fat cells this is a specially important for adults because babies and young children actually do not have the ability to shiver or they have a less robust capacity to shiver very small babies really cannot shiver they have a lot of brown fat in order to keep them warm young children eventually develop the ability to shiver and maintain these brown fat stores mainly around the claphicals the hart the upper spine and in the upper back and it is no coincidence that kids can often run around with a minimal of clothing and be comfortable in environments that adults would be cold in as life goes on we tend to lose basion brown fat but this mechanism that ism referring to points to the plasticity of white fat meaning the ability for white fat tactual convert its identity into this metabolically thermogentically enhancing form of basin brown fat deliberate cold exposure is a terrific way to increase your cormetabolism and often times critics will say well the increase in metabolism is not that significant although i do want to point out again the ninety three per cent and three hundred fifty per cent increases i metabolism from that previous study but critics then will say well that does not really translate to that big of a colonic burn during the deliberate cold exposure but to that you show o say ah but that is only limiting your optics to just a portion of the effects of deliberate cold exposure because deliberate cold exposure can also convert white fat to base fat and brown fat and lead to these more lasting increases in metabolism for any of you interested in increasing your metabolism and or being comfortable in cold environments and or being comfortable in terms of being able to combat straits mentally deliberate cold exposure i do believe as a powerful tool and there is simply no reason why you couldn't and should not use the same protocols that i described early or for building resilient to increase metabolism provided you are hitting that eleven minute per weak threshold you ought to be stimulating both mechanism increases in resilient and increases in cormetabolism as i mentioned earlier most of the detailed studies on the conversion of white fat to base fat and brown fat through the use of cold have been done in animal models but the human date are starting to emerge and if you to do the deep dive into these mechanisms things up p wan pep a game at camera here is a beautiful review that was published recently in the journal cell which is one of the three externals nature science and the title of that paper is topmost tissue plasticity in health and disease i love this review it has beautiful diagrams detailing all of the pathways from cold the nor up infra through u c pan downstream of things cyclical p if none of those names mean anything to you do not worry about it you certainly do not need to know these mechanisms to benefit from deliberate cold exposure protocols if those names do mean something to you or you are interested in exploring the downstream effects of deliberate cold exposure and something else that is really nice tits covered in this paper is how deliberate cold exposure interacts with fasted states and fed states i think you'll also find this review very interesting i do not want to go to deeply into fasted states in fed states right now suffice to say that when we are fasted meaning when we have an even for some period of time are base line levels of nor up ineferan and epinefran are already elevated and cold exposure at those times ought to have an even greater effect on metabolism and resilient and on for you faster or your intimitten faster out there if you really want to get fancy you can do your deliberate cold exposure when you are fasted i certainly would not recommend doing it with a veryful stomach in any case and as i mention before on this podcast intermittent fasting is but one way and certainly there are other ways to limit total colonic in take forsake of maintaining or or losing weight if that is your goal i know many people are using an benefit from intermittent fasting however and it certainly can be combined with deliberate cold exposure in order to get even greater increases in nor pin effort an pin efferent for those of you that are primarily interested in using deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine levels in your brain and body you can also do a combined protocol whereby you invest caffeine sixty to a hundred and twenty minutes before the deliberate cold exposure this is based on a study that have talked about before entitled caffeine increases trial dopamine deputy three receptor availability in the human brain and as the titles justice study was done on humans looking at the density end or efficacy of these dopamine receptors in an area of the brain called the stratum which is involved in planning an action and also suppressing planning an action involved a a very closely with whether not we can engage in behavior and with hold behavior the called go and no go pathways in the brain dopamine plays a critical role in that and many other things as well as a you now know why would you want to ingest caffeine sixty to a hundred twenty minutes before deliberate cold exposure well talks about earlier dopamine can increase quite substantially in response to deliberate cold exposure but dopamine on its own does not do anything t has to bind to receptors and this paper shows quite definitively that investing affine in this case it was three hundred telegram dose of caffeine which is a bow the dose of caffeine in two or three cups of coffee depends on the strength of the coffee of course but it is not an outrageous amount of affine that increases the density and our efficacy of these receptors which youould allow that dopamine to have its greatest effect and for those who you that when i get really really fancy i suppose you could do this fasted you get the further increase in orapanefran then you get the dopamine increase from the cold exposure the bind the dopamine although i do on a point out that at some point you start layering together enough protocols that you would be spending your entire day trying to get this dopamine pulse and i would hope that you had would have other activities tat you would engage in but if you are getting up in the morning and your fasted because you have an eaten all night and you have a cup of coffee and then sixty minutes later you take your cold shower or to hours later you do your cold immersion a you call shower you would be learn together these different mechanisms of dopamine receptors epanefperan and forth in a way that at least to me does not seem of incompatible with having some other life going o school in having relationships et camera and this increase in dopamine particularly in the stratum is not a trivial one i do on a point out as the authors do that preclinical studies have shown that increases in trial dopamine induced by things modafphinom which is used to treat eighty eighty and a treat narcolepsy is necessary for their wake promoting actions what this really says is that just heaving elevated levels of dopamine from a drop or from an ice bath or what have you is not sufficient to get the effects of dopamine you really need the receptors to be available and you need those receptors to be available in the appropriate density and you need those receptors be available in the appropriate deny in the stratum in particular i think there are number of reasons why if it is compatible with the other aspects of your health cause of course always you have to consider this on a background of cart vascular health and blood pressure et camera that in jesting a upper the of coffee an hour before your ice bath may be fasted as well could be quite beneficial for increasing dopamine over quite extended periods of time a couple of key points that you will want to pay attention to in thinking about deliberate cold exposure and metabolism in the sober study they also explored the use of sand and how to use sand meaning deliberate heat in conjunction with cold we are going to do an entire episode about the use of heat for health and performance that is not the focus now however it does raise an important point that we do my to address at this moment which is if you are using sand or if you are taking warm showers or if you are simply using deliberate cold exposure of any kind should you get into the heat afterward or before or not at all and this is where we can point to the called sober principle least i call it the sober principle the sober principle named after a first author of this study i refer to earlier doctor hosanna sober in science it is appropriate to take a eyepiece of data and call it a principle if in fact it translates to something larger which i believe it does it is generally not appropriate for people to name of principle after themselves though there are fou scientists that have done that i have named at the sobered principle but i did that to give it appropriate credit to doctor hosanna sober who discovered that and point it out quite appropriately that to achieve the greatest increases in metabolism through deliberate cold exposure you want to force yourself to reheat on your own after the deliberate cold exposure meaning you would not want to go from the cold shower to a hot shower or from the cold shower to a sand rather if you are going to start with a hot shower or you going to start with a sand that you would end with the cold and then you would reheat naturally now i personally take a cold shower if you times a weak or do cold immersion and because i am not specifically focused on increasing metabolism although i probably should be that is not what amusing it for now i will take a hot shower afterwards and in doing i am short circuiting some of the further metabolic increases that i would achieve were i to just end with the cold the sobered principle is if you want to increase your metabolism end with cold and we can take this a step further and say that if you want to use deliberate cold exposure to increase metabolism that you should make sure that you get to the point where you shiver and the reason for this is that there are a series of studies but in particular one study publish in the journal nature excellent journal in the your two thousand eighteen showing that deliberate cold exposure that evokes shivering from the muscles causes the release of a molecule called succinate from the muscles and that suck ante plays a key roll in activating brown fat thermogenesis which you now have heard about and understand as critical to the increases in metabolism caused by deliberate cold exposure what this means is if you not increase your metabolism end on cold that is the sober principle and as best you can try and get to the point where you are shivering either when you are in the cold exposure or immediately afterwards now one efficient way to do this is to for instance you could get into the cold shower for a minute or two minutes or three minutes uncomfortably cold but safe to stay in remember that is our general rule of them then turn off the water and stand there make sure that your not holding yourself close to your body you are not hugging yourself to try and keep yourself warm but rather your limbs are extended at your sides and then if that fails to induce shiver than to turn on the cold water again and then turn it off again alternating perhaps a minute to three minutes of cold exposure followed by a minute to three minutes of drawing out in air and going back into the cold exposure et camera i can tell you this from experience this is a pretty brutal protocol if you have never tried getting into an ice bath or cold water immersion or cold shower for one minute and then getting out and try to stand there with your arms extended in cool or cold air for one minute and then getting back into the cold shower or water immersion you are in for an experience because even for those of you that are pretty shiver resistant you will find that it is much much harder to get out of that cold water and stand their arms extended and drawing off by evaporation which further draws heat from the body then it is to wrap yourself in a towel get in a warm shower or arson there certainly no requirement to end on cold there certainly no requirement to induce shiver but if your primary goal is to induce increases in metabolism both in the short term and in the long term following the cold exposure will then you will want end on cold and you will oughtwant to find away to shiver provided that the level of cold that your posing yourself to is still safe for you over all up until now have been talking about deliberate cold exposure as a potent stimulus for the release of group in effort in the brain and body and indeed it is but the way of been describing it has been in the context of circulating plasma levels of nor up an offer meaning circulating within the blood what i have not mention but is absolutely true is that the fat sells themselves actually receive in put from neurons there are neurons that release nor apineferan in response to cold directly into the fat i want to give you this picture of how the architecture of all this works because i think it can help you navigate and indeed build better deliberate cold exposure protocols your renal glans release nor upineferan an epineferon your brain has sights within it the locust sedulous that release nor upineferan an epineferon but there are also neurons within your skin that sense cold and other neurons that can directly release nor upon feral into the fat stores and cause those white fat cells to convert to basin brown fat and i think this particular aspect of our physiology is often overlooked in studies and when people say oh while the increases in metabolism are not that great the circulating levels of nor upinefferand those are very large but there very transient and on that fails to understand that neurons that actually sense cold are in a position to communicate vile other neurons directly to the fat cells and release nor upon efferent into those catcalls which as i pointed out earlier set off a huge set of immediate and long tern cascades of even gene expression changes the picture that it'd you to have in your mind is that when you get into the cold yes of course you experience that as a experience of i do not want to do this ism going to overcome this ism goal to climb over these mental walls that represent a adrenaline release in my brain and body but also that your fat sells are receiving signals nor up an efferent signals that are changing those fat ells an the way that they metabolize energy now id to shift our attention to the use of deliberate cold exposure forsake of physical performance and there are lot of opinions out there about the use of deliberate cold whether not it should be done for instance before or after exercise whether r not if done immediately after strength training or hypertrophy training meaning training design to grow muscles or make them stronger whether not it can inhibit that process and on and forth i think to day in looking over the literature and trying to bring forward the simplest and most straight forward and yet scientifically grounded protocols we can set up some general guide lines that will allow most if not all of you to still extract the benefits of deliberate cold exposure on physical performance without getting two neurotic about the exact timing but forsake of discussion and because it is a prominent theme in many online communities let us just start with the big one out there meaning the question of whether or not doing an ice bath or doing deliberate cold exposure or taking a cold shower after strength slash hypertrophy training meaning training design to increase strength or and or i should say the size of muscles will somehow short circuit or diminish that process whether not it will reduce or eliminate those strength gains and hypertrophy gains and the short answer that i was able to arrive at on the basis of a review article that will talk about in a moment and some other studies as well is that if your main goal is hypertrophy and strength it is probably bast to avoid cold water immersion and ice bath and m version in the four hours immediately following that strength and or hypertrophy training again if your main goal is to achieve hypertrophy or strength or some commination of those probably best to avoid cold water immersion up to the neck or ice bath immersion up to the neck immediately after strength an hypertrophy training and extending out to about four hours after that training if your really neurotic about this than perhaps you would want o move the cold water exposure to a different day entirely but it all depends on how nauradically attached you are to getting every last bit of strength an hypertrophy and if that is your goal terrific well then probably moving the cold exposure four hours or more away from that training is going to be necessary for you now you will notice i did not talk about cold showers and the reason i did not talk about cold showers is that there simply are not very many studies of deliberate cold exposure through cold showers for the reasons i talked about at the beginning of the episode it is hard for me to imagine that taking a brief cold shower after a strength or hypertrophy training session would completely reverse or short circuit the effects of that strength and hypertrophy training but again if your nauradically attached to getting every last bit of strength in hypertrophy out of your training sessions then by all means ere on the side of caution and wait four hours or more to do your cold shower just as you would weight four hours or more to do your cold water immersion now there are nice data point into the faced that doing cold water immersion after a hard run endurance training or even spent an interval training or after a weight work out where your main focus is on performance of those movements or after a skill training work out where your main focus on performance of those movements that there is no reason to think that that cold water immersion or ice bath or cold shower would inhibit the progress or the stimulus that would lead to progress that occur during that training session in other words i do not see any reason based on the literature to avoid deliberate cold exposure immediately after training again unless your goal is hypertrophy and strength and in fact there is a very nice review that was recently published on deliberate cold exposure and how it can impact physical performance whether not it is done be four or after differentypes of training and forth the paper is entitled impact of cold water immersion compared with passive recovery following a single bout of strenuous exercise on athletic performance in physically active participants a systematic review with met analysis and met regression this is a met analysis of fifty two studies that looked at a tremendous number of variables and contact as you would expect in ametanalysis of fifty two studies ism going to read you the conclusions of the study and i will provide a link we certainly do not have the time to go through all the details of the study i will highlight a few specific outcomes that i found particularly interesting but here i am paraphrasing their conclusions that cold water immersion i want it emphasize immersion not coldchowers but cold water immersion they say was an effective recovery to after high intensity exercise they observed positive outcomes meaning improvements in certain variables for muscular power muscular soreness meaning reduce muscular soreness increase muscular power perceived recovery after twenty four hours of exercise however there were certain forms of exercise that were not benefited by cold water immersion such as eccentric exercise exercise focussing only on the lowering component or the called eccentric component of resistance exercise they saw some very interesting dose response relationships for things in durance training meaning the longer the cold exposure post endurance training the more improvement in endurance performance reductions in circulating creating cases and things that relate to muscle damage under certain conditions some point in the future by the way will do an entire episode on creating in creating kinase which are important excuse for muscular function but also for brain function but the basic take away was that cold water immersion performed after high intensity exercise was beneficial from a number of different standpoints and indicated that shorter duration cold exposure and lower temperatures can improve the efficacy of cold water exposure if used after high intensity exercise there are directly pulling from their conclusions what the says is that its not just those longer duration thirty forty five minute and sixty minute protocols of cold water immersion that we discussed earlier but also shorter duration one minute three minute five minute exposures to lower temperatures temperatures that would make you psychologically want to get out as soon as you possibly can but again that you can safely stay in done after training really have been shown to improve outcomes in terms of reducing soreness and improving training efficacy meaning your ability to get back into training more quickly and thereby deliver more training stimulate to a given muscle or in your endurance training protocol translate english what this means is that taking a cold shower or getting into an ice bath or some other form of cold water immersion within the immediate minutes or even the mediate hours falling your training has been shown to be beneficial i am sure in a number of you have questions for instance how long should you be in that cold exposure is it the same as the eleven minute threshold described earlier to be oust with you there are not enough studies to really point to the critical threshold for eliminating or reducing to laid on set musclesorne s or forgetting maximal results from power and endurance training but this study does make a couple of key points and here i will just paraphrase for instance that cold water immersion is more likely to positively influence muscular power performance to reduce muscle soreness to reduce serum creedseen lines and to improve perceived recovery after high intensity exercise as compared with passive recovery this can be translated to cold water exposure after training is beneficial and probably better than passive recovery from a number of standpoints in addition they say that dose response relationships meaning the amount and the degree of cold that people are exposed to and how often they did that in particular in lower temperature cold immersion these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols that are one minute or two minutes three minutes may be five minutes but that one could not stay in their longer because it feels stressful and one wants to get out may be more effective after high intensity exercise for removal of serum creatine kinase as well that these shorter duration cold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity insurance performance as well all this can be translated to say that unless your main goal is hypertrophy and straight that cold exposure ideally cold immersion in cold water ice path but if you do not have access to that than cold showers is likely going to be beneficial if done immediately after or in the minutes or hours after your training especially high intensity training one particularly nice thing about this reanalysis is that in included some studies that involve the use of cooling packs again vest that can hold essentially ice packs on and indeed even crib therapy chambers and on there is a nice table in the study if you want to get really detail than go and look specifically at those studies i invite you to do that will put a link to this study in the caption for this episode but all in all what this study shows is that deliberate cold exposure can be very useful for recovery likely through reductions in inflammation in muscle and connective tissue and while this study did not look specifically at the mechanisms have reduced inflammation caused by deliberate cold exposure those mechanisms are somewhat known there are number of studies that have pointed the fact that deliberate cold in cold generally can reduce in inflammatory sidelines such as lie six inter lucansix it can increase anti inflammatory sideokind such as interlucanten and on without getting into a those details i think its sufficient to say that if you are somebody who experiences a lot of delayed on set muscle soreness taking a cold shower after your training or getting into a cold immersion after your training even if its a few hours later ought to help and if you ere doing particularly intense training than you probably want o ratchet up the number of cold exposure sessions that your doing even if those have to be done on separate days from your training because a lot of the inflammatory effects of training endurance and straingtraning actually occurring some hours away from the training stimulus it is not jobs that inflammation goes up radically during training which it often can but that it can occur even in the days and even weeks afterwards depending on how intense and how long duration that trainings delivercolled exposure is very powerful as an anti inflammatory too now i to emphasis the topic that we touched on at the beginning of the episode which are those glabyras skin surfaces the hands the upper face in the booms of the feet through which heat is especially good at leaving the body and another way of putting that is that one can cool the body much more efficiently through the glabyra skin surfaces now if you want to understand all of the science behind this and all of the various applications i invite you to please listen to the episode that i did with doctor crag heller again in the biology department at stamford for sake of this episode i am just going a detail a couple of findings from his laboratory the first one dealing with exercise in duce hyperthermia because i think this is very interesting and it can even save lives if you understand the way this works there is a particular paper that focus is on this and that we will put a link to this as well the title this paper is novel application of chemical cold packs for treatment of exercise in duce hypothermia a randomized control trial this is a pretty brutal study a brutal for the subjects that is what the study involved us having subjects walk on a tread mill at a pretty significant incline anywhere from nine to seventeen per cent wearing a substantial amount of clothing that was not well ventilated and the room was kept to forty degrees sepsis which is a hundred and four degrees farenhite this is definitely not something to do at home the study was design to induce hyperthermia which as i mention earlier can be quite dangerous and they compared two types of cooling in the first form of cooling that they call traditional cooling they had ice packs on there neck in their arm pits and in their growing and in the other group there was the called glabyras skin cooling the palms the souls of the feet which ratty that they were cooling inside the boots a or inside of gloves and on the upper portion of the face and the basic take away of the study is that by cooling the glabyras skin the subjects were able to sustain this walking on these inclined tread mills for much longer then were the people who receive traditional cooling and also the return to baseline temperature was much faster in the glabyras skin cooling group how this translates to the real world is that if ever you are hypothermic or some one ease's hypothermic one way to cool them down quickly is to cool these palmer glabrous sols of the feet glabrous and upper portion of the face glabrous portions of the body using cool rags using ice packs or using any number of different o cold objects are temperatures one key thing if you re going to use glabrous skin cooling is that whatever you use to cool those surfaces cannot be cold that it causes vest constriction because as i mention earlier the arterial venous astemosies these portals of arteries directly veins that exist only in these glabyru skin surfaces the way that they are able to cool the body and essentially pass cool into the body although that is not really what they're doing their actually extracting heat from the body to be technical the extracting heat from the body the only way they can do that is if those veins do not collapse and veins will collapse if they are made very very cold if you want to use glabrous skin cooling to offset hypothermia or for the other forms of performance which we talk about in a moment you need to use a cool object or surface that is not cold that causes azo constriction and this can be a little bit tough to dining meaning it can be tough to identify such an object and for that reason doctor heller and some of his colleagues have developed a commercial product called the cool it you can actually go to their website cool it dockcalm i do not have any financial or other relationship to them i know they have been developing this technology for some period of time it involves a glove the you put your hand into it circulates water of a given temperature and it does and does ad a temperature that is sure to not causeways of constriction of the palm an you may be asking how can you just put your hand into one glove and have this work well that is how powerful these glazer skin surfaces are even just by cooling one palm the door body temperature drops radically now that is their commercial technology i know that some people out there have started to experiment with a home version of this which would be taking a package for instance of frozen blueberries or some other cold drink or cold metal object an actually bringing it into the him or out on a run there even people who are now developing could sky a bicycle hands for long rides a this might seem a little cook or crazy to you but as you will soon here in the study am about to describe the increases in endurance and in the volume of strength training that people can conduct if they appropriately cool their body through this these glabyru skin portals is actually quite significant again as it relates to hyperthermia some one is over heating by all means trying get them out of that heat get them to stop exercising you can die from hyperthermia trying cool the bottoms of the feet the palms of their hands and the e upper portion of their face that does not mean that it would be a bad idea to put cold water on the top of their head that probably would also help in perhaps on their neck what is probably not going to be a good idea is to do the more standard thing of draping some one in cold towels on the surface of their body because as i mentioned the beginning of the episode that thermostat in the hypothalamus the medial preopticarea will typically react to that by increasing corody temperature further the effects of glazer skin cooling on physical performance are truly remarkable provided the glazer skin cooling is done correctly and i want a point out that the main degree of effect is on volume or the ability to do more work and i want a point this out because i think that many people certainly in the exercise science community but even in the general public when they hereabout some of these effects that are measured in the laboratory they for f look a at those effects of bit of stance anything wile that is not possible right a effects for instance that have been documented showing doubling or tripling of the number of dips that one can do in a relatively short amount of time or doubling of the number of pullups one can do or fourteen percent increases in strength or even comparable degrees in increase in weight training output to people who are on performance enhancing drugs et center et camera part of the confusion is that the effects of proper palmer cooling because it almost always is done by palmer cooling and less often in of these experiments by cooling of the booms of the feet in the upper portion of the face but those effects tend to be the ability to do more work over time and just to illustrate some of the major facts that the heller lap is seen and there are documented in this manuscript that all share with you in a moment the typical protocol is to have people come in and do some endurance trainings or running on a tread mill and to have a condition where one group is actually doing palmer cooling while they are on a biker on a tread mill and inevitably the outcome is that they can do more work they can peddle further at a given speed or they can run longer at a given speed than people who are not doing palmer cooling or who are receiving cooling by way of in cold compress to the back of the neck or ice back o to the arm pits et camera the effects of palmer cooling are very clear and very robust and in the contacts of endurance exercise almost always allow people to do more work to go longer with less perceived effort and to quit later to speak in terms of straight training they have looked at the capacity to perform sets of dips one of the more famous examples of this that doctor heller shares in the episode ah that we did earlier and that you can find at superman labor calm involves some one coming in and doing sets of dips may be forty dips this person actually could do forty dips on their first set than resting for a period of two to three minutes and then doing thirty five and then resting for a period of two or three minutes and then doing progressively fewer and we are in fuel to the point where over a period of time they ad up the total number of dips that they can do and then they have them come back after a period of recovery not immediately after but take a couple of days come back and do effectively the same protocol but during their rest periods they are doing two minutes of palmer cooling which exsect essentially allows heat to move out of the body lowering corody temperature in other words and what they find is that they see enormous increases in the total number of dips that people can do but that does not mean that the person goes from being able to do forty dips to being able to do fifty dips are sixty dips on that first set what it means that they are able to do forty on the first set than forty on the second than thirty eight on the third and on and forth that the total duration of the work out as extended and yet they are doing much more work even though it takes more time that is an important point and i thing a a point that perhaps was not as clear a where is clearly made by me in the previous episodes that discuss this topic for those of you that are interested an exploring palmer cooling first of all i recommend taking a brief glance or even dive into this study which is entitled work volume and strained training responses to resist exercise improve with periodic heat extraction from the palm in this study they describe big increases in anaerobic meaning strain training output things improvement in dips improvement in bench press improvement in pullups et camera in human subjects and it is a really nice study and points to some of the protocols that you might be able to adapt in your own set up for instance over six weeks of pull up training palm pooling in between sets improved volume by a hundred forty for per cent and this was an experience subjects that is interesting because a lot of studies of strain training in improvement in hypertrophean strength are done in inexperience a untrained athletes which can yo changes the picture somewhat compared to a experience athletes they found that strength meaning the one repetition maximum increase twenty two per cent over ten weeks in bench press training and they point to the particularly strong effects of using palmer cooling when people reach plateaus in endurance and straight training and there i think it is an important point i think that if you are going to explore palmer cooling it is probably not the sort of thing that you are going to do in every run or in every bout of cycling or in every straight training session but that it might be used to vastly increase your volume candor vastly increase your endurance in a given session or a set of sessions in order to push through plateaus a particularly interesting point in light of that is doctor heller has observed again and again that palmer cooling reduces delayed on set muscle soreness or can eliminate it entirely and that is very interesting because it also points to he fact that reducing corody temperature may somehow be involved in short circuiting the normal mechanisms of delight delayed on set muscle sounds and you might say how would temperature be involved into lady on set muscle soreness well i want to refer you back to the medaanal says to we talked about earlier where the short duration very cold temperature exposure after training did indeed reduced to laid on set muscle soreness in part through reproductions caves me in creating kinas it is not om inconceivable that temperature and delayed on set musclesoreness are related and that raises perhaps the most important point which is the way that palmer cooling can improve performance by way of reducing corody temperature is known and that is because when one engages in exercise we muscular output of any kind strength or endurance exercise the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform is actually very narrow there is an ends in called private kinase which is critical to muscle contractions and private kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures if that temperature gets to hot meaning if the muscle heats up locally whether not by running or cycling or swimming or weight lifting the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short circuited completely and i think this is a much under exploratory at least a much underdiscussed aspect of called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running ferine as when you run as compared to a bench press or something you do not stop running because you cannot actually contract the muscles further but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain there is a cross talk there its probably by directional and people stop they quit right this is the quitting reflect in strength training one can no longer perform a repetition or set of repetitions in part because of heating up of the muscle locally there other mechanisms as well of course and i realize that but what is very clear from the palmer cooling work is that by simply holding on to a cool object remember not an object cold that it constricts the vessels of the palms or constricts the vessels on the bottoms of the feet but by holding on to a relatively cool object in one or both hands in between sets for two minutes or you can very efficiently reduce your corody temperature and in doing reduce the temperature of the muscles that are doing the work increase the capacity for piraña kinase to continue to allow your muscles to contract and thereby allow you to do more volume of endurance and strengthtraining a simple protocol that doctor heller pass to me is find a relatively cool objects o you could for instance fill too bottles with cold water may be put a few ice cubes in there right this is not exact because were not hung about the commercial commit product here were talking about an at home version or use a pack of frozen blueberries or richly a for of pack of those as what he described and then in between sets to put your hands and ideal you would put the boys your feet but that is not always feasible an most gems where they will not let you take off your shoes and forth but to put your the palms your hands on that cool surface for a minute or two minutes between sets and then returning to your sets of work now if you are heating up through other mechanisms your wearing a stocking cap in your i a very warm environment this might not have as potent effect as if you were to do this cooling in a more moderate environment wearing lighter clothing et camera by all means warm up to do your exercise lubricate your joints and get into a place where you're not in injure yourself doing whatever form of exercise you do but then if you to explore palmer cooling i know a number of people who have written to me saying they heard about palmer cooling on the episode with doctor heller they have tried this and they see quite excellent results it does take some discipline right it is one thing to just con to hang out in the him and plan your phone in between sets its another to do deliberate cooling with your palms you the bottom as your feet of the upper portion of your face might get some heard looks but of course you will be the one doing significantly more volume not experiencing to lady on set muscle soreness and achieving better endurance and strength gains were you to do this properly now as a final topic related to the use of deliberate cold exposure for improving health and performance i let to touch on this theme that exists on line on social media on tube and in various fitness communities of using deliberate cold exposure to the growing in particular to the testicles in order to try and increase testosterone and while this might sound really coke indeed this practice exists indeed if you were to go on the amazon there are actually a ice pack underwear that have a that are being marketed forsake of increasing testosterone now i am not aware of any specific well controlled studies that show that this indeed works i can imagine based on what i know about the nervous system testosterone and cold et camera that there are couple of mechanisms by which one might experience increases in testosterone as a consequence of deliberate cold exposure first off let me say there is no reason why you would have to apply these ice backs in the way that i just described one could of course take a cold shower one could of course use a cold immersion of various kinds and your still gin to get that exposure a of the going and the testicles to cold now i should point out that people do report at least anecdotally increases in testosterone as a consequence of this practice and i have to imagine that they are measuring their seem testosterone that there not just guessing that their testosterone went up if of a study exploring this directly please let me know ill put in the common section on you to or even just meal me a we have a a male that you can find it human labor come please meal me the reference i was not able to find a reference but i can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms by which deliberate cold exposure to the growing in proud that the testacals would increase testosterone the first is somewhat direct which is that any time you cool a body surface that if it is cold enough you're going to get vast constriction and then subsequently you are going to get a rebound increase in azo dilation meaning you're going to constrict the blood vessels in that area and then after the cold is removed there is going to be more blood flow to that area of course blood flow relates to organ health and tissue health generally profusion of that region and those a and the goats to be specific with additional blood you could imagine in some ways increasing testastron that is reasonably plausible the other probably more likely mechanism relates to the dopamine increases cause by cold exposure the we talked about earlier again any time you have a somewhat stressful stimulus but in particular with cold exposure it seems that the catacolameans nor up in efferent epineferan dopamine all increase and dopamine is known to be in the pathway that can stimulate testosterone and while there is not a direct relationship between dopamine stimulate mesotron there is an interesting pathways whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases in things utilizing hormone which can trigger increases in testastron as well as estrogen for that matter i know that there lot of people out there that are interested in the use of cold exposure for increasing testastron and some of those people and commutes are indeed using cold exposure directly on the gonads on the testes in order to do this ism not certain that that direct contact is necessary and in some cases it might actually be quite dangerous or you least should be careful in terms of e tissues there and avoiding damage but none the less i think that a dopamine impact on testosterone is very likely given the two under n fifty percent increases in dopamine that have been observed with cold water immersion and all of that points o the fact that cold water immersion very likely increases testosterone but as a downstream consequence of the cold water immersion effects on dopamine and utilizing hormone and again there is no reason to think that the increases in lionizing hormone would also increase estrogen probably not to a dangerous or a levels that one a would want to avoid but i do not think that there's anything particularly specific about cold for inducing testastron and not other hormones i thing its very likely to increases a number of different hormones i do hope that there will be a systematic study on this in the not to distant future i also hope to not be a subject in the cooling of the goat's experiment now i promise you the last topic was the last topic but there is one other really important point that i think everyone should be aware of if you are going to use deliberate cold exposure and that brings us back to the very first thing that we discussed to day along the lines of deliberate cold exposure which is that your baseline temperature is going to be lowest about two hours before you wake up it is going to increase in the morning and as you wake up and increase throughout the day and afternoon and then start to drop in the evening and come down at night as you had to sleep i also want you to remember that if you are to cool the external portion of your body in particular your torso the net effect of that is going to be an increase in body temperature for many people not all but for many people if you are going to do deliberate cold exposure you are going to increase your for body temperature and that make sense if you think about how deliberate cold exposure can increase abolish by increasing thermogenesis what that all means is that if you are doing your deliberate cold exposure early in the day you are going to get yet a further increase in for body temperature that would be associated with wakefulness your ability to be alert that morning or throughout the day and on it also means that if you do your deliberate cold exposure very late in the evening or at night six p m seven p m nine p m and on you are going to increase your corody temperature in it f you recall a decrease in corody temperature of one to three degrees is not just than official but is necessary in order to get into deep sleep and remain in deep sleep the take away from this is deliberate cold exposure done properly will increase your somebody temperature and make you feel more alert if your doing it early in the day that is probably terrific given that most of us want to be alert during the dight however if you do it too late in the day evening or night it can disrupt sleep by way of disrupting your somebody temperature now the coat to that is i myself ten to do my deliberate cold exposure early in the day may be not first thing in the morning but midmorning may be as late as three or four in the afternoon in some cases in the longer days of summer i might do it even later five or six p m and have no trouble sleeping i have done deliberate cold exposure very late at night ten p m eleven p m and on as part of a thirty day challenge of doing deliberate cold exposure every day for thirty days and i got sloppy with my timing and then in order to not miss a day i would do it at eleven o'clock at night and i must say i found that i could still fall asleep very easily even doing deliberate cold exposure very late at night however on those particular days i was particularly busy and sits particularly exhausted when i arrived at the deliberate cold exposure and i had no trouble falling asleep after doing deliberate cold exposure and then taking a nice warm shower and then going to sleep but i could imagine that because of the increases in somebody temperature caused by deliberate cold exposure that were one to do that too late in the day evening or night that it could indeed disrupt your sleep my recommendation would be for most people only do deliberate cold exposure if you are prepared to be fairly alert for the next one to four or may be even six hours following that deliberate cold exposure for to day's episode as is the case with most episodes of the superman labpocast i covered a lot of material we talk about mechanisms of catacolomeanes and streets and pulsatile release of epinephrin metabolism mental effects performance glazer skincolly and on and on and on and while the goal of chorus is to make sure that every one arrives at specific very clear mechanistic and actionable protocols i do realize that it is an immense amount of information and for that reason i have created a list of deliberate cold exposure protocols aimed at improving mentaltoughness and resilient mood performance metabolism reducing inflammation and on and forth all of those have been condensed into precinct form and can be found at the superman lab neural network news letter this is a monthly or seine monthly news letter that we release that includes take always from the podcast and protocols you can access those protocols zerocost by simply going to superman labor come signing up for the neural network news letter its very easy to do you just supply your male and you will receive the news letter we do not share your male with anybody else in fact we have our privacy policy laid out on the superman lab dot come website s you can find that there and the protocols that have designed should make it very straightforward for you to create a set of protocols that you could use with cold showers with cold immersion with or without ice in commination with exercise specifically for one goal or another or to accomplish multiple coal simultaneously if you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe tare you to channel that a terrific

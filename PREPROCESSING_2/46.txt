the menshparashosponsiby express v p n make sure to protect ourself against big test protect or data at expressypiandicom freshmen it seems that the chances of civil warn americagust rose somewhat dramatically on tuesday evening the supreme sort of colorado ruled the president donate j trump had to be removed from the state ballot for both the primaries and the general election they satin amendment fourteen section three of the constitution of the united states that section reads quote no person shall be a senator or representative in congress or elector of president and vice president or hold any office civil or military under the united states r under any state who having previously taken an oath as a member of congress or as an officer of the united states or as a member of any state legislature or as an executive or additional officer of any state to support the constitution of the united states shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given eight or comfort to the enemies thereof but congress may by a vote of two thirds of each house remove such disability that is what the section says the cagey s made by the four three colorado majority in favor of barring president trump from the ballot is simple they say trump tried to conduct in insurrection in their judgment and thus can be barred from the ballot by their say the court hays quote congress does not need to pass implementing legislation for section threes disqualification provision to attach they say that section three is in that sent self executing in other words long as section three says in insurrectionists are disqualified from office this means the congress does not actually need to define what it means to be an insurrection's any state court can do that what is more the state court says the constitution authorized the states to determine quote the constitutional qualifications of presidential candidates because otherwise states would be unable to exclude at twenty eight year old anon resident of the united states or even i for a national from the presidential primary ballot in colorado the court says it is qualified to determine whose guilt give insurrection under the fourteenth amendment without any criminal case or any impeachment case or any piece of congressional legislation the court says that quit the events of canary six constituted in insurrection and president trump engaged in that insurrection the curt also claims what president drums direct and express efforts over several months extorting his supporters to march to the capital to prevent what he falsely characterized as an alleged fraud on the people of this country or indisputably overt and voluntary moreover the evidence amply showed that president trump undertook all these actions to aid and further a common unlawful purpose that he himself conceived inset in motion preventing congress from certifying the twenty twenty presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power this reading is to put it mildly incredibly strain section three of the fourteenth amendment was designed to prohibit those who had served in the confederacy from holding public office in the united states the confederacy as we know was an armed rebelling against the united states which ended in t deaths of over six hundred down an america on both sides it was unclear when the fourteenth amendment was passed whether it was designed to apply to any future rebellion or insurrection or hadst would be define or whether was even supposed to apply to presidential candidates or those seeking to qualify as such the amendment says nothing about presidential can initial notice or exactly how would be effectuated by states by congress by some other party cart lash author of the fourteen amendment and professor of law at richmonds school of playwrights quote the mission of express language on these issues is significant because prior publicly announced to drafts did expressly apply to present and future billions did expressly name the office of the president of the united states and did expressly bar certain persons from either holding or qualifying for office well what is all that mean it means the very least the amendment did not mean to clearly bar presidential candidates in future elections who took part in future duo n quit insurrections most importantly the amendment is totally unclear on exactly how it supposed to be effectuate representative fhadious sevens one the most radical republicans one the great founders of the actual fourteenth amendment said the taxes would quote not execute itself the congress would have to pass laws making clear who exactly was barred from office and historical as what congress did they generally in forget mechanism for this provision in eighteen seventy two for example congress pass what was called the amnesty act which stood away with penalties on former confederates due to the fourteenth amendment and congress did passalaw in nineteen ninety four that made it a crime to quote assist or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states presumably a conviction for such a crime would automatically disqualify a candidate from office under section three now even if the amendment were self effectuating which it likely is not given that this would then precede a huge invented for states to randomly disqualify candidates they do not under its species it would still require the state to prove that from actually engaged in in insurrection the canst randomly to clear he engaged in an insurrection as the chief justice of the colorado supreme court bran not right said in descent and remember all sevenjuctues here all seven justices of the colorado sbencort repainted by democrats and this was decided worthy the chief justice of the course ad quote age time previously served as president place of birth all parallel for qualification issues under colorant's election cote conversely all these questions paling comparison to the complexity of an action to disqualify a candidate for engaging in insurrection another words if you barred trump from the ballot because he was twenty eight years old that is a brightline question is he thirty five or not if you barred trump from the ballot on the basis is not a citizen that is a brightline question either he is or he is not but engaging an insurrection without a definition of insurrection without a criminal trial without any sort of evidentiary proceeding which trump could actually be a party barring trump from the ballot without an actual trial for guilt or innocent or even in enactment from congress seems to violate basic do process principles as another justice cargo savor again a point by democrat points out in de cent more its quote based on its interpretation of section three are court sanctions these makeshift proceedings employed by the district sort below which lacked basic discovery the ability dicappenand documents and compel witnesses workable time frames to equally investigate and developed defenses and the opportunity for fair trial touch indicate a federal constitutional claim a complicated one tat mascaraing as a run of the mill state election cote claim the case is obviously wrongly decided now the good news is that the effect is stayed until canary forth that is the day before ballet eligibility has to be see if trump appeals which he is going to do obviously the state remains in a fact indefinitely until the supreme court decides matter or turns away the rid of surcurary but that is not the point the point is that the use of law affair against donate j trump is absolutely unprecedented will get to that point in just one second

o court decision is massively dangerous radically undermines petrol integrity it crates in ad hock was for political opponents within each state to bar candidates they do not law through reinterpretation of the constitution and of course this colorado state supreme qorruling is just the latest interaction of wild and radical law affair against president trump now certainly true the trump open himself up to this legal hailstorm with his activities leading up to an on canary sex his handling of classified material after his presidency of all human beings on planed earth trump had to know there is an enormous target on his back and is always you and one ignored that us did whatever he wanted but that does not mean the he is not being targeted by a variety of perverse methods the lawafare that is now being to rented at trump is extraordinary it is unprecedented truly on unprecedented these are legal methodologies that threaten the future piece of the republic i really mean that in very serious ways there re currently four outstanding criminal cases against trump three of which are rooted in basic misinterpretation of statue and the fourth of which concerns mishandling of classified documents a matter for which trumps from arrival tileryclinton was like completely off to hook furthermore the prosecute in trumps canary sixth criminal prosecution happening in washington de that would be special council blacksmith he is openly attempting to cram through that criminal trial but fore the election specifically in order to damage trumps chances in the election that is legitimately the only reason why you accelerate the time line invitation of the desires of the defense remember it is the defends that is guaranteed a speedy trial it is the defend did not who has the right to a speedy trial if that defendant seeks to delay the process the only reason to qrunqut rush the process before the election as jacsmith has openly ask the supreme court to do is in order to effectuate som change before the election as from a prosecuted anima earthy rights quote the prosecutors proposed schedule is driven by the political calender not lawn forcemeat it concerns the biding justice department took nearly three years to charge trump even houghthe facts by then were well establish the indictment was strategically time to trial could take place during the presidential sampan not only to smith push to force trump to trial and just a few months after smith's on investigators to taken years the prosecutor indited not washington t c only after locking trump into another complex criminal trial in another district a thousand miles away in south florid what does all of this mean the sprimcourt is likely to strike down this decision but what is lathis mean it means that twenty twenty four is going to be the most insane an ugly presidential election in america history i truly mean that buckle your see belt it is going to be in extraordinarily bumpy ride that is saying thought since the years both nineteen sixty get and twenty twenty are years that existed in time already parson use of the judicial process to stoptrump has created an narrative for trump that even if he loses he will have been cheated and he is not going to be entirely wrong in fact till be more right and twenty twenty four than he was not twenty twenty in fact if he is barred from ballast if his trial is expedited to effect the election he will be right that he that the election has essentially been corn quit stolen from him even if he loses meanwhile because the supposedly a political judicial branch has now signed t into this fight on behalf of jordan democrats are likely to think that trump is just not morally but also legally barred from office and if the supreme court strikes down this covered o supreme sort ruling that is going to completely undermine the legitimacy of the course unless somehow justice robots is able to convince a bunch of democratic appointees to join a judgement in which they overthrow the covered o supreme court of this thing is decided six three in which all three of the democratic appoint see to the supreme sort both in favor of barring trump from a state ballet than every democrat in the world is going to thing that trump is legally barred from running which means that even if he wins there is no way they are possibly going to accept his election both sides are now set to not accept the results of the election under all circumstances if you are republican and you just watched democrats the biding administration the colerdof supreme sort caponized the law against tonal trump personally to bar him from ballast to criminally prosecute him before the election and then he loses you are going to clam correctly that trump was cheated andyou are not going to accept joins re election if you are a democrat and you believe that the covered o supreme court is doing the legal thing and the a bunch of trump appoint see on the supreme court over through that tan trump is legally barred from running because he is an insurrectionist and then he wins there will be massive riots the weaponization of the legal system creates in all consuming first burns everything in its fact because it is supposed to be the only part of the government that we all trust if you cannot trust the a political part of the government the judicial branch that is not supposed to have will only judgment it began trust that an then he out come from the judicial branch is simply a re in foremen of there prevailing view of one side verses the other that is going to end in violence there is simply no twenty twenty four result likely to result in anything but complete and maybe violent chaos that this point that is truly frightening man's being exacerbated as always by our mediofll get to that in one second first have ben talking about my hits mattress for years i know its can be hard to sleep after that but here is the reality you's still need or sleeve he butts way to get that sleep is with huliksleep have had my helicsleep mattress i know for ten years at this point it was personalize just for me firm a breath

trumpereacted to the news of this but pointing out that jo bison and in fact the use of aware in general is a threat to thedemocracy here was present in trump last night it is no wonder crooked jo bidding the for left lentigo despot to stop bus by any meansnessessir there willing to violate thetas constitutions hat levels never seen before in order to win this selection cordon is a threat to democracy to threat the weponising lo forspent for high love election interference because wore beading them badly in the pose gay he is not wrong about this and here in lies the issue if trump is correctly pointing out that jo bison and his minions our threats to democracy and meanwhile donalcrads our suggesting that trump himself thanks to canary sect and all if his quote quit authorituring autitudesis a threat to democracy that means that both sides are now justified in doing whatever the hell they can and want to do in order to stop the other side from taking office that is that means if you believe that your political opponents in the united states are a true threats to democracy in the united states in the sense the you believe there will be no moralliginimit elections if this is the last election if your guy gets defeated that is very likely then in violence actually and that is being exacerbated by all the eggheads on the left side of the lie what is in of amazing about the deferential between the right and the left in from this sort of rhetoric is that on the right the sorts of people our talking about this will be the last electionthere will be no for elections if jobidon wins the election those sorts of people ten not to be the point y heads on the left side the asleep is the point yo heads on left side o the wallet us legal furs loments tribe t hazard playschool it is the colorado supreme sort it is all the sufisticates or making the claim that is only trump it is some sort of threats to the very heart of re publicans small are in the united states all the norms are a it is the loud mouth in may not i but he tenia loud mouth tits henna epic o i really think that he is going to destroy the country wholesale he was president for four years and things ware kind pretty good it is all the grads on the left side of the isle are creating legal furies to caponize the actual tools of governments again stoned trump on the right side of the isle it tends to be the norms who think that jobidon is the threats to the republic in the end of the republic an is all the grads where i gotten youknow man he is really bad president but i really not can have another chiming trump is running right now that is why the media on the left are really fanning the flames right here beaus again it is the high ecu people on the left war fanning the flames the most here ' rather motto over on emit am me see sh does not a crazy thing for democracy o simply band people like true from the ballet in theprotrotepartemocaty there areryuma on a ereryuer anmaoaaan

ateraoratdirmarotecay loco after our ownofa war tickly to prlueo anybody from holding zaire gates the first of all its very ugly persisting the brailing in court that just bandy bullsonaro from office for election fronclimes that is really bad its can make things in brazil significantly worse and the other situations that she is sighting wright there post not germany when was america noisy germany ism us wondering when like while trump was president at couple of years agios out she is talking about there what she is talking about is basically treating her political opponents as a debathification effort as a notification effort sevens you lightning was doing some the same sort of stuff again deep democrats are celebrating the sort of stuff you should not be caught if you are hoping for conciliation in the republic at all you should not be celebrating a rogue supreme courting colorado simply banning the leading candidate for one of the lead political parties in the person currently leading for pulling for presidents of the united states from the ballet thee matter that trumsoncan in colorado now that matters it is the president here that is truly shocking and it is creating again the predicates for the argument by trump and many of his supporters that if he loses it will not be legitimate under any circumstances because if the idea behind every crime is that evidence of crime is mode of means opportunity hit certainly have the motive the think trumps favus it is certainly of the means barring trump from ballets or criminally prosecuting him and they certainly have the opportunity meaning the upcoming auction there me a lot of people where pointing that out as we move forward particularly true closes but here is you honing again under scoring me the idea that i supreme court decision back by colorado states supreme sort is somehow legitimate and indefensible which it is not will this is a historic decision it is a momentous decision as the supreme court itself says they are in uncharted territory here but it is really important to keeping mind this is not the last worrier this is almost certainly going up to the u supreme court which can review the decisions of a state supreme court in tactic colorado supreme sort anticipates that possibility and for that reason they put their own ruling on hold on till granary four anticipating that it will go up to the supreme court the practical consequence as it stands at this moment though is the doll trump will not be on the colorado ballet in the race for president in twenty twenty four the supreme court almost certainly will take this up it is also important to keep mid for the broader contacts there have been dozens of these challenges filed across the country and eighteen or of them have either failed been rejected or been withdrawn by the plaint if this is really an outlier the supreme court is going to have the final say the consequences here are of course enormous and meanwhile get saki for i press secretary four the cure presidents of the united states she saying that of course petty much everything is lock et because absolutely trumpetintler if trump wins and twenty twenty four if the tractors will have to reconcile what it means to sher country with many citizens who cannot watchman front spire deeper in to its moral hold and fill conclude yes that is our guy and this is not a panic total it is all registering in the poles according to a new survey of likely re public and cocoa score and i fording to per cent say they are more likely to support turn proclaiming emigrants a poisoning the blood of america gates o again the idea here from saki an company is that trump is o standing for america fascism therefore has to be stop now the pridictapale result of this entire republican primary is again a boost for trump any time the last ta take trump illegitimately a causes everybody on the right including people me to say well maybe you just want it you are on to get a good and hard you are asking for the fight you aren't to get the fight that is the natural tendency of human beings get to that momentarily first balance of nature fruits in

sign check him out right now o case all of this is going to lead true elevation in the primaries as we approach primary t eight trump is still ahead by leaps and bounds in these poles in i his currently up in the average by thirty three points fifty one over to mantises nineteen and nick hale clocking in at sixteen points meanwhile in you samphire you have trump clocking in an the late palling at forty four nick fly at twenty nine crispy at ten and to mantis at eleven even if you combine crispy and to mantis that would take you to slightly more than trumps total vote but they are both in the race this means the trump wright now is the odds on favorite and the more you attack trump the more people defend trump that is the way that dis works when nickel hale makes the case against trump the correct case by the way the chaos follows trump which just to say trump causes chazan the cops follows him she is not wrong but also when you cause the chaos but the chaos is much greater than the thing that you cause the narrative turns from you victimized yourself to you are a victim of the system yes trump as have said clearly and openly many many times was wrong he was lying between the election and canary six when he said that sort i find election results could be overturned by the vice president of the united states it was not true who was not true and he was fibbing about it and he was exacerbating things he is making things worse also ye result of that is not that you get barred by supreme quarts on the state level from the ballet that is not it is not that you get criminally prosecuted meltable times a cross the nation and nick hale is right but it does not matter because again people are resonating to trump in re action two the thing at is being done against him i in present trump with the right present at the right time i gree with the lot of hi follow i had a goo working real i thingtim wither but right r a wrong par follows that we all mara or fine can part of ta but we cannot be or country an diss the ray i not a world on fire i will not get through four years that car t re can n me even if she is right about that it does not matter because if the democrats are seeking the chaos the answer from any republicans is going to be cat thin you are going to reap the whirlwind that is going to be the response printable response from republicans meanwhile democrats re hinting use that as o ka we we're ready to elect warrant hitter fine we will what ever we can to stop him this gin o get ugly quickly by the way as i say most normal people look at trump and when he says wilding crazy things they thinks themselves that is just because he is brash and a loud mouth it's not because he is wrong that is particularly true whole it comes to his rhetoric around immigration you saw gensocky just a moment ago suggesting that because people support true more forty to per sent of republicans have support from more after his poisoning the blood of our system legal migration that that that that is evidence that they support fascism the reason that many people are supporting trump because of his immigration rhetoric is bias they believe that he is saying thing that even democrats or saying but he is being penalized when democrats are not case in point to day according to the washington post authorities are not investigating the death of a five year old boy in chico he been staying at one of the city's largest madman shelters from new arrivals from us southern border the boy was of the shelter on south halstood street when the child was reported to not be feeling well according both chico p d an ambulance took him to the hospital where he died on sundae the cook county medical examiners offs identified at the ago as john carrots martinis at revert and said the office as not get determined the cause of death it is not clear while country his from or how he arrived in chico he and his family were among thirteen thousand madman staying in city shelters according to city records by the way folks on knowhow it is really down at the border we h that a sundae special with him kenned former green betray sniper who is been down at the border participating in humanitarian mission and a it is it is wild check out sundae special fore on that meanwhile the bine administration which has facilitated this massive crisis of the border and refuses even now to sin into law border provisions that solidify the borer even to get there new crane funding they will not do it meanwhile the white house is blaming wait for republicans on all of this grew abbot here is corner john pierce world's worst press secretary for the white house suggesting that the gest of this five year old migrant in chico was not the fault of head ministration for letting in a bunch of unveiled people who may my not be healthy he was the fault of grew abbot for sending this kid to chico the chicane for a heder er e a chip e e over tree er er war her slice me wee always been very clear i ye her me at the come firs question i i that we believe that governor abbot politics in is poison are not f they are not the for techs communities and or or the p a can horsemen on the ground were tying to do their work we tea in harms way and be be d humanize de humanize an demonize immigrant yet t it is bout the humanization maybe it he is whats humanizing is shipping people across the border by leaving the border completely open then bussing them to the interior of the united states no plan for how to deal with them meanwhile the mayor of chico bran and johns who is as left as left can be he is suggesting that great abbot is attacking the country by sending people on busses to chico first of all tit says a health lot about chico when you've the mayor of a senior man if you send people heres a escape house tacking the country by sending people to mi city first all it saying lot but second of all and that the language the democrats used about immigration is the same as the language the republicans use as soon as the emigrants arrive in their areas here's abandon johns the issue is not just how we respond in the city of chico is the fact that we have a governor o governor and alerted o fissure when the state of texts that is placing family on basis with our shoes cold wed tired hungry afraid aromatize and then the coming the city of chico where we have homelessness we have mental health inti tat be set down clothed you have people who are seeking employment the the governor of texts the the take a looking the mirror of the chaos that he is causing for this country this is not on of the chi ago din mic he is the tacking our country i gay hes legal emigration what he saying a here is that you legal emigration is an attack on our country is just the great abbot shipping illegal emigrants up to chico is the attack on our country that sounds very much the stuff that trumpsites about immigration what democrat say it it is them being tolerant diverse and republican say it it is them being famous here is normal from yesterday saying emigrants are coming in and they could bring in disease away well i mean that is ism sorry but that is true that that is that happens to can this has been truce and s the early twentieth century there is a reason why one of the first scenes in godfather too is a kid being screened for disease as he enters elves island in encase here heres here is down f i if this were not true title forty two would not be america law title fort you literally blows the federal government you turn people away the border if they are suspected of having disease here is normal from saying the thawing that ever be going crazing comparing him t hitter it is crazy what is going on they ruining our country and it is true that destroying the blood of our country that is what they o they destroying our country they do not it when i said that an i never read mind comfrey said old hitter said that in a much different way then the coming from all over the world people all over the world we have no idea they could be healthy they could be very unhealthy they could bring in disease hits cancatch on in our country but they do bring in crime say again most people o this an the style can brain johns on saying the same thing we he's blaming grab abbot down from saying that he is blaming chorion and suddenly trump is the fastest about all of this which apparently justifies banning him from particular ballast people in the let circles of media and in letting legal circles our playing with absolute fire with i mean i mean almost literal fire with this sort of stuff something is going to explode ad's going to explode because when you abuse the

that is on charge do come hurry wall it is linstock cape meanwhile the middle east continues to be a tinder books particular the gardershipping in order to understand what is happening in the waters surrounding the the middle east own these south peninsula in order to understand that you are to look at this map what this map shows you is how much longer it takes to ship things from ta single for to rotter dam if you cannot use the sue canal as opposed to if you can use the seas canals o the red line here is the direct line of shipping crossing approach is a hub for manufacture and also from the far east just generally through the sues can't its much much shorter a lot shorter and then the all turn if rout is the cape of good hope rout which you can tike you a lot longer the red sea rout roundtrip voyage takes thirty four days the cape of good of of god hope rout takes you forty three days at a distance of three thousand four hundred more nodical miles things in other words get much more expensive when shipping lanes get shut down and right now the soothes are attempting to shut down those shipping lanes according to atom tailor at the washington post there is a crisis hitting shipping not far from where the ever given you remember there is a cargoship that chou got stuck in the she's canal in a block ten billion dollars of cargo every day the back in twenty twenty one fagot another problem on money oil champ peanawns an it pass t all shipman through the red sea after a tacks by the toothy militant group targeting vessels along the rout which leads to and from the sues canal what has not yet done the destruction being caused by the hooththe attacks has the worrying potential to cause the type of damage the sues canal blockade threaten in in editorial publish sundae the walstrgernal suggested it is worth calling the most significanthrats to global shipping in decades by the wants worse than that if again if the soothes can shut down a significant percentage of global trade by again being a rag tag group of pirates with very lo love weaponry what do you think china is looking at chinaslik oka w ell here is one thing we cut do we cut blockade titan and people a that we can blockade a lot of the south china sea and we can shot down global shipping until people just comply with our requests another words if you alow a bunch of pathetic horrific small time terrorists and thugs to stop shipping through one of the world chief choke points a thing a major army the people's liberation army is going to do they believe the day can used that sort that that is i me that that is a better example of the west caving than even a gangsta a garrison you can a least make the cases at the west was there for twenty years here you are talking abatis guys and eatables the are going up to ships with drones and taking over thin tire ship and the west apparently doing very little about it of course china on to look at thatintaile a whole i guess that we can exert som pretty significant leverage in the waters around are on coast according tote walstrejournal ours after the united states announced a mufti national task for s to protect commercial traffic through the red sea shipping giants eight people or marish said it would send its vessels around the cape of good hope and southern africa instead the message was clear shipping firms oil companies ensures remain jittery about a possible snarl sone theworld's most crucial traderoots again totally unclear as to weather the western attempt will stop what the whothese are doing soothes have been bulge that pure to have bulging stockpile of missiles an drones annals had drones the less dangerous than missiles if they slip through thedefences could prove especially difficult for some ships in the coalition to shoot down unlike the iron rock ware in the nineteen eighties when naval vessels escorted oil tankers through the region the turn volume of shipping traffic through the straits is way too high to make relying on protective convoys feasible according to we mara retired you estimate the captain who commands end both the destroyer and a cruiser he predict to the united state would have to strike toothy targets on land which is correct obviously and by the way we exactly should the united states bandits western allies be shy about striking the soothes i mean we are not talking here about taking down the entire randan government or something with a massive military or tom taking down coastal pirates a men tongue about take out the hobbies entirely your tongue about destroying their ability to harass shipping one of the reasons for this by the ways because the the west is has overreact itself in many ways what i mean by that is that for every due boy

politics remain a staple of america politics these days yesterday cafyhokel the governor of new york she says that the state should actually consider slavery reparations in new york which was as you may recall not a slave state i she says that slavery reparations should actually be consider i now because new york obviously has tons of money to spend on this sort of issue amidst there serious crime problem economic turmoil people leaving the stapeicaus the high taxes i ship between her and avanueson my goodness the democrats have a bench we are proud to be home of courageous leaders lie carried woman conduct or the underground railroad buried up in outer new york to corner truth frenetic doubles an abolitionist lake john brown who farm is way in the north country we are proud to embrace the deliverance from slavery from the underground railway itself which ran from new york all way the canada crosstie over nigerfalls where i was yesterday and the had the strong support of many good and much good will from residence of this state we it is easy for just to pat ourselves on the back i we did all this lot of the statistics that but we had the leaders here we took this sin we can say were the heros where the ones who fought against slavery and indeed many did what is hard to embrace is the fact that our state also flourished from that slavery in a few minutes it'll sign of bill authorized the creation of a community commission to study the history of slavery in new york state o got varia oms the reparations and how we can help right the wrongs of the pass is obviously pandering it is obviously pandering that they can study any commission they want but the reality is that slavery reparations as completely unworkable as a matter of law how exactly to criminate on the basis of race a how do you trace back the ancestor mane all these practical questions have been merit who pays do people who arrived nineteen eighty pay descendants of america slaves about black america who arrived and ninety how at nation america do they pay eat who pays exactly where the beneficiary and all this is not meant to actually create any sort of solutions it is meant to exacerbate the problems and exacerbate thedivisions the same thing holds true by the way for this attempt to remove a confederate memorial at arlington cemetery a judge has now loud the removal to go ahead according to the centimes a federal judge on tuesday cleared the way for the removal of a confederate memorial from arlingto national cemetery just one day after a temporary restraining order had halted the plan to move one of most prominent monuments to the confederacy from the nations most famous burial ground the memorial has been criticized for its sanitizes to fiction of slavery and its removal is part of the military while efforts to take down confederates symbols from basis ships and other facilities now why exactly is that happening is not happening because you wish to actually solve the problems of the civil war that is not why because again the reason that these memorials were erected was to effect some sort of reconciliation in the united states post civil war a delicate balancing act that was in part the result of things the fourteenth amendment which wave bends cussing earlier in the show a turns out that when you want to keep a country a country your going to have to require some sort of reconciliation and monuments this weren't attempt to do that it was not meant to won w obscure slavery as not the idea here the idea hers the en have one half the country fighting the other had the country the only way or gan and up as one country after all of that is to create some sort of mercy for the loosing sod that is what this monument was about that is why i was in controversial for a very long times to wat the question is wiser controversial in twenty twenty three when it was in controversial in say eighteen seventy when people are watching monuments this be erected and the family marc a ben killed by members the confederacy and ye your brothers got shot by a member the con federal five years ago and other erecting monument an arlington national why were youoko because people understood that the only way to actually make the country one again was to effectuate this sort of reconciliation and now if people who are not involved ins who have open slaves that parentswere not slaves or grandparent were not slaves love people who not have no relatives whats to weaver where involved in the civil war and have all of these people who aren't not coming forth hinting that this memorial offends them now which is about creating conflict in the now obviously that is the goal is not about teaching in fact these monuments as have said many many times they provide an opportunity for teaching yet the they provide you n opportune actually have the is cushion bout what was the confederacy why was confederacy wrong why was slavery evil and then why was this monument bit in the firstly a geese are good complex nuns interesting conversations you not is not an interesting conversation whining away history in orders that you can claim that the problems of eighteen sixty are the same as the problems of two thousand twenty three which is really the claim the people who ant a rip down monuments this that is really the gold here malison parked historians university of delftware said these types of monuments which wee put up in the early twentieth century again there people were still living who had relatives killed i is oil war whereabout a certain kind of red if reification of an i stalag based own the notion slavery was not really that bat there is a is conception about the notion these monuments need be preserved as a representation in some case i thin innocent to take down these contamonuments cause they still carry hurtful meanings to day such absolute tripe this does not make things better in any way shaper form there is no evidence that it does at all an you meanwhile yesterday we discussed at length the catholic church is letter that focussed in on blesses for same sex couples and what exactly that meant and i said that you will for all the talk by out changed nothing obviously the r people inside thechurch we are going to take it is changing everything evidence that i am right comes to day courtesy of d and i us is out come a peace tattled making history on a tuesday morning with the churches blessing and i features a picture of reverend names martin a suit priest standing and giving a blessing to a same sex couple two men who are holding hands as i said yesterday when it comes to what the church has historically said what they have said is that you can of course be blesses an individual enter everybody gets blessed as an individual enter there is no problem to that and that is true by the way for every mainstream religion everyone is a sinter that is not prehebyou from being blessed what you cannot be blessed for is participating in the sin when you have two game holding hands and receiving the blessing obviously be visual on that is design specifically to green the behavior clearly and obviously there would be no difference to this and a man divorced and his wife and the very married standing and holding hands in formal priest was blessing them it would look a blessing of the divorced couple itself that would be the idea as a couple and this was the distinction one's magnestory and reverend names martin is going full ahead with that all be fascinating to see what the catholic church does anything about this because if hassle stand by the idea that there should be no legitimization of same sex marriage or same sex activity don me very hard to look at that picture and ay that is not a legitimization of same sex marriage or same sex activity if the radical does nothing that will be a very solid answer as to what exactly the batman was doing in that letter according t the priest never before was martin permitted to bless the same sex couple not until money when the pope said he would allow such blessings and announcement that reverberated through the church on tuesday morning daman steel jack forty for and his husband mason steed old jack thirty stood before father martin in living room on man nation's west side the couple running a bit late because of he subway to lays trust casually simian a floral design or compliment od father martin on the pine smell of the christian tree in keeping with the vatican's admonition that such a blessing should not be performed with any clothing creatures or words proper to a wedding father martin warn ropes and read from no text there is no blessing for say sex couples in the thick book of blessings published by the best conference of bishops well right mean jaw instead he selected a favor of his own from the old testmean he use priestly blessing from the old testament and not let me just tell you as a devotee of the old testament in the original here i can promise you at this a blessing that is not typically bestowed on same sex couples as they hold hands father martin has frequently met with pope fans about making the roman catholichrirch more inclusive on tuesday morning he was far from the hall's power he was at home making history he said was really nice to be able to do that publicly again this is going to be what wether church blows this this picture is the story is picture is the story and again if if your pretending along with the idea that the vatic has changed nothing it can be very hard to maintained that in the face of this particular picture meanwhile i do on provide some good news i have to say that the sort of stunning development of last three formonths has been the magic of john fetderman what by living thallium i it is very rare gits to in a bright spot news on the show john fetderman wow in sir john fedderman campaign as an avert socialistic a burned standard scalage who is the furthest left member of the democratic mental battle ground state candidate group by far and then get naturism and he the was not fully functional clearly and we as a question is to whether he could even serve in the senate and now john fetderman he is turning into christen cinema he is turnings the moderate voice of democrats here yesterday for example john fetderman's criticizing the open emigration policy at the southern border oh here is john fedderman yesterday i all can very her that unbenithin on the rights tat of what hat believe tit is an an been very up from notes well to an an i really a been able to and anybody that can say there is not any kind of an sou writ now on the border than as around two hundred send tours an people being encountered on the border just in one onto and e up that in respected is that tat before that is the side of castor and i roughly the sines of castor is showing up in the border the thus what you you need say that is find i that is not really an issue is a progressive that i just that that is i would be a egress but i a remain an an always be very very a o immigration barons which as ben e by the in there okay but he sang his promise the boarder because again john federal voice of reason non sotistcomig meanwhile john fetderman was also ripping on young people inside thedemocratic party who are getting their history from ticktock by the was statistic recently the showed that two thirds of democrats believe there was a historic state of p listing run by grabs no the answers no that is not a thing in any case here was that john federal sang ya they do not now any history by the way in an office with two his city fleets behind em i john fettermanman i know what happened but a ism ism all for it you have been very clearly arguing that colors rarest responsibility for the tragedy of what is going on in got o why do you think many younger people especially in your parties see it differently i i really i really do not really do not know i i do know that a lot of people are getting there perspective from stock and i think if your kind of getting your perspective on the world on tiktockets on it then be kind of worker not reflective of the history n an actually the way things apply are and what is very clear sis that homos started this and they actually broke the the cease fire and they attack and murdered i babies children women iat'tacka a music a concert in everything it its it is outrageous good for john fetterman again it is nice when you have some good news here on venturperisha already is coming of when we speaking with the colorado state g o p chairman talking about this insane decision from the colorado state suprimequaurtes ore not a member become member

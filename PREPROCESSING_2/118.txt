questions mounds about the physical and mental capacity of our leadership glass newly tells him urge about yorbidans vice residentially male with hunter biding and the legal revolution against tonal true well be televised i venturnare the sis the venshgero so bencher a show sponsivby express if vein privacy is a right not a privilege defend your rights express the plans cam slashed on we now live in a jerantocrasy our entire leadership class is really really old and not only are they really old they are not even good at their jobs it is one thing to say that the old man on the mountain while you know least he is good it is job but if he is cadet his job and he is borderline see nice or he is already erotic and he just going more erotic with age the question becomes why as a population do we keep nominating these people why do we keep doing this a mean that there are few reasons why it might be a reality that we keep putting up in positions of power really old people one could just be that that the power of anersha that the person is in power we just kep we letting them because it is more comfortable to go at the devil we know than the devil that we do not and that would be true for somebody jobidon who of course is a devil that we know since he was thirty one years old where he burst on to the america public scene whence ran for senate at the age of thirty and he has now eighty he's been in the public my for half a century and maybe the idea is while you more comfortable it them we know and we know everything there is to know abouthim an sure yes a little see nice but that is better than that new guy down the block what that really betrays is a lack of trust in the future of the united states if the people that you keep nominating to high office our people have been the public i for fifty years and the ideas that these are the people who are best poise to lead the country forward why you really saying is we do not know what direction the country is goings we may as well just give it to this old guy who is basically dad and this is true a cross a i thing that really is that the fashion out for why many people seem comfortable with voting for people who are no longer with us jobidon is clearly no longer with us bitch man call is apparently no longer with us dial fine skin is no longer with us is not just by way elderly people it is also people ore just stands ins for general political parties on fetderman is clearly not with us and he is wedding in in the senate of the united states right now if that makes three senators out of one hundred who literally do not have full brain function as shut a matter of course and two of those people are in significant positions of leadership a dial fine sense is on some the most important committees in the senate pitchman call is the senate minority leader and that is leaving aside chucksumer who is welling to his seventies at this point meanwhile you of the current president of the united states who is wandering around wobbling into trees and everybody is where i guess that is totally find and the leader of the opposition party is seventy eight years old who's a ratio when he was young and has grown more erotic the older that he got again i come back to the question why is it that we the america people keep putting these people in a position that is question for us nonquistion for them i understand why old people want power o oh people want power for the seeress an everybody else one's power power's great power laugh to pursue the things that we wish to pursue or to maintain are are importance throughout through our life span i'ventunderstand the idea that there are certain old er people who are still fully functional the people who are well into their aides who are doing just fine in my jag are right now looks a lot better in the urn president of the united states which shows that a life of see sprogs and rock and roll actually apparently is very good for you it sort of a for maltohide that preserves you forever but when you look at the gerontocracy that now rules the country what that really speaks to is the beginning of the end of the republic because again if you cannot trust the people who are forty five fifty to lead the country if there is no vitality to the leadership class what exactly are we doing it just a holding pattern everybody knows it jobidon holding pattern is much more attractive apparently to a majority of the america people then anybody who is fifty that he is going to run for reelection not being there yesterday again he was am he excited the script in delftware for just a moment the door popped open and then he walked into public view instead om girth and then is going back to delawares the answer for the week end his going back to delftware again can sit on the beach shirtless apparently he has a weird habit of bathing in the need which man secret service those people have a job in any case according round extra suitor the present in cases he m in case he poop's one and then now making sure the the naked old man is protected from the various assassins in the trades hat's a job an ma here it was that jobidon yesterday it for him a headquarters gin ism going to ism going to lo surety for o hey know many different idiots to we have of the presidents of the united states not knowing where he is going you have those whom one of to things either of the advanced steam work is unbelievably crappy around the president of the united states or the president of the united states literally does not always going at leas seven you present of the time that seems to be the case unless you think that ism just ripping on bi nog get s its my call in just one second north media have as taken just covering for the sky because again in a fully reactionary hero which is what we live it it is totally reactionary the normal america is not reactionary the normal america just wants to be left alone the normal america wants a predictable sat of laws that they know the rules of the road and then they want be able to raise their family go to their job go to church pay their taxes and be left alone it is really want most america one they just want to predictable way that that life is run and meanwhile you have the people at the highest special ants politics who are either utopian or destructive and their bouncing off of one another in a variety of combinations and to this means that you must protect the pressies i mean if cotton is clearly not with us o got the entire left saying the precious must be protected for example glen nestler who suppose to be a fact he is literally called the facchecker over at the washington post has an entire piece called bison loves to retell certain stories some are not credible now normally what glenkestle dos he takes a simple a simple claim and then he rates it on a scale of once yo for penochios is it true or s it true he does not do that which maiden instead he just puts all of his due false stories together in one story and the he is a well he he is really a genial old man but it turns out that a lot of his stories to start trues i guess i es were done here no finochio ratings on any of the things this is what the media do with jobidon meanwhile on the other side of the isle he sent a minority leader bitch my call he is overly suffering from something he is had too massive freeze ups in from the media inside the last month and let us be clear bitch mac call is hes single most effective republican leader in the country for last twenty years men here is not there is just note real competition for that mean in terms of if you doll trumps supreme for picture can thankmint's mac call is bitch macconal ho made that happen that is the reality of the situation the lo promos in much macconall yuan say that has not stood up for principle as much as he should have when they should push harder when he had re publican congress but in terms just pure machiavellian politics bitch mac call was great at it also he is to old now ism sorry he is he is not mentally f he is not mentally capable of holding down the sent minority leader position and h should hand off the position to somebody else as soon as possible sancta group does doctor overland and he says well he is can a freezing up an that he is not freezing up his freezing is we should not be analyzing the people who lead the republic as though they are all timer nations we should not be doing that it is bad for america this should be a by partisan colishan saying this by the way but no one's can to say it and the reason owns can to say it is because for a publicans must offend trump who seventy eight and my coal who is eighty one and for democrats must offend jobidon who is eighty he used to be thither is brought spectrum agreement on things hey maybe we ought to you note transition the leadership to a generation that is not in depends but no we are all going to just go back to a go back to our serious corners heres sancta up to analyzing the health of the see my north leader what did you see what did you make of what happens first fall li me to say that what scold is describing is really important to know because whatever this is it it comes and goes and it seems to come and go quickly and in the world of a a and when you lookhim at the brain that is an important sort of clue what i saw and and this as i think an appropriate term here is the there is the term freezing a that that does that does sort o describe this freezing of his body freezing of his each freezing of his face his hands were very clenched to the side of the lecture i can i mean where no problem mean after all we have many nonfunctional members of our top level of government in just one second we will get to the people who theoretically could take over for people matter mac coal will get to that in just once second awe will get to more corruption in the bison administration because jobidon it is not that the armed pester by belly is not that he senile the problem jobidins the he is been corruptor fifty years willets that momentarily first ladder patent called the stroller's drop an dominants objective new reversible brazil russia india china south africa formerly agreed to use local currencies in trade instead of the was dollar that is not a shock as the world becomes less global as country's move away from the influence of the united states they are going to break away from the stellar how do you protect your own asset base well it is one

becomes reality you'll be very nice to have some gold two depend upon again teen to ninetyeight ninety eight ninetyeight to day that is ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight o case there are people whore waiting in the wings from much my could step down and contrary to popular opinion even if my coal steps down and be sure the governor of kentucky cannot actually just appoint democrat beshrews a democrat but they change the law in the take of kentucky s the basher has to choose from the same party as the person who step down probably in anticipation of all of this and has to choose one of three people nominated by the state republican party that means that even if my conalward o step down completely from the senate you would your place by republican the same thing by the way's true dial finest and this is the part when it get to the he irritation that i have for the allege is the allegiance the people are having to these these old buddy duties what it really comes down two's no one wants to stablish a president that yo should get rid of an elderly person in a position of power just because they are senile because they are too many seen people in their own party they wan to maintain and that is particularly true the top tho tick it if you get rid of dial intestine for hoping fully functional what is the argument for keeping bine he is got a democrat backing m up in call arris i understand the you would rather hae the dead old white man running for president than you would have the very very in popular black woman running for president but is that really an excuse giving the mobile is not functional and everyone can see it if they get rid of dial instil who legitimately cannot write her own name at this point what happens if they get rid of john fetterman what hat now almost people got a place by democrats by the way but this help perverse and and venal are politics as become ore don t keep those people in place aren't kep those people on the the very idea that the leadership class even matters has kind of exploded all that matters right now is the binary the party binary you are the republican error democrat and does not matter who you are apparently because wen just plug somebody else in or just leave you there being a dead person we can manipulate your hands you are some sort of feared marine and apparently we will achieve the same exact result the some the people by the way who theoretically could just replace my call to day are john thorn a south to today he is sixty two he is also the number two center republican he is the whip got john corban of taxes who is seventy one gan at the at this point the me town spring chicken among our leadership class you john borosso also seventy ones wo the younger generation it is seventy and ten you have people joy earnston was who is fifty three who is the number four as a char of the republican policy committee the fact that our leadership classic general has become old is is totally insane to me totally insane road's pagan when he ran for office in nineteen eighty was considered by many people too old of and road's pagan in nineteen eighty he he was som he was seventy two in nineteen eighty it is see prettymazing when he is in allocated the second time he was a he seventy seven which makes him currently younger than both of our presidential candidates thing things are going great it is it is all good meanwhile jobiton continues to be as venal incorrupt as a he ever was apparently we now have news that under bison's rosemontson copartners investment form treated more than one thousand males with jobidon's office while he is vice president hundreds of those remind hidden because of executive privilege as sorted by the white house documents released by the national archives show that is going to the work post the eight hundred sixty one males that reference rosemonsennica were sent or s by the office of the vice present between canary twenty eleven and

jobiton sudden of mysteries going to the daily wired how a prof sent republicans wanted now if nine boys of materials re reeve from the boson office of a personal attorney to jobidon contain any

the ages of sixty five by the way is the is the single it is right now the second largest voting block in in twenty twenty two sit thirty seven million people voted wo are above the age of sixty five between the ages of forty five and sixty four about forty three point six million people voted which means that if your above the age of sixty or fifty five you are now in sort of the plurality of the voting block now as people age out the population that may change however the upside down pyramid of of our demographics is going have a continued impact and how exactly people vote in terms of our

present in jobidon and twenty twenty to a man josh of had was it charge with aggravated the hickilor homicide yesterday and clarccountyg municipal court for the incident which happening the children being buss to their first days school josh was rested well who legally crossing the southern border and august twenty two according reports who is not return to mexico where he came from for to had and said has given a notice to a were and then he was released into the general public and then he showed up again he gave everybody has on medical drivers license which is at which is great he is living comfortably in mexico apparently at night e and and then decided to just pop over the boarder and apparently kill a told and in injure twenty six other children our board policies a sister of course but according to the bidamenstration all as well here is corner john pare world's worst press secretary pretending the cordon has done a greatchop securing the border the present has done more to secure the boarder to deal with is is en mi ration than anybody else he really has tune thought the spinal largest onto control in lawful unlawful border crossing because of the points this present putting place o ka as bomilugan the fox reporter points out they're more than seven thousand migrants apprehend by board patrol on tuesday alone afterthey crosse to legally there is a brief lull in the week's after the end of title forty town may but legal crossings our surging once again they are just laying about it obviously meanwhile cormencjohn pierce says the join will not even met with caff hell who is the governor of new york she is been talk about the disaster of mass migration into new york ye legal immigrants descending on the state on mass and shake not join osnthav time for that you son vacation or humor beech be when the gore new york n by to discuss the er mantelet new yore hated not why not as you just thin there is a lot going on and a ischiefeststaff met unmet was part of that meeting at believe refectory marcels is part of that meeting a some of his very high level senior stay participated in the meet in with the governor which is as you that a very important meeting to have he has a has a very good relationship with the governor we have been every time where in new york a the president i in practically every time a the present engages with the governors they have a very good relationship look i at the present has e lottery on his plate i yet he is much on his play who has is born vacation for nearly the passed weeks with a with minorbrace to visit mall and tell stories about a kitchen fire that he once at ere everything is going great meanwhile on the other side of the i we are preparing for the donate trump trial in gorge ja apparently according to a fallen county judge on thursday the judge shot pacify he says that all court proceedings in the election interference cases against donate trump and his eighteen to dependance will be live streamed an mollified which is going to be amazing for the country nelson it'll be real about this ism not against this i think the fact that that we should have more transparent if we do not trust our institutions watching the institutions work would be the only we to restore trust in our institutions ism all for more som light and more transparency mi guess only is that teem trump ism not sure how against the television they are because the the prospect of watching these people go after trump in the dock may not be bad for dona trump inlay primaries in an order issued on thirsty lackeys and members the media would be allowed use computers and cellphones in the c inside the courtroom for nonrecurring purposes during corproceedings there will be pool covered for tellvigen radio and still photography as well brogan gets a watch the a trial on t v is this something that they would contemplated are democrat in the dock i have serious doubts about that but for those who are hoping that dona trump is welling a running a well celebrated campaign that staking ad vantage of all of this o some bad news apparently his superpack is almost broke they have raised about a hundredand fifty seven million dollars than spent nearly all mean on legal cost according to your say to day dona trump is running out of other people's money to spend on his legal bills his keep fun ha spent nearly all of the more than a hundredand fifty million dollars it raised and is sting on let than four million dollars hes already dung in to his fun for twenty twenty four ads and borrowed money to potbelly in georgia some of his allies are begging for donation saying that he is not paying their legal bills there saying that due his legal bills will total millions of dollars if not tens of millions of dollars but that is blowing through an awful lot of on a mean a hundred and fifty million dollars that he is blown through at this point and what he spend anon if you see many dona trump adds dona trump has been running this campaign on the basis of these most famous person on earth an has been for for half a century but ism it is amazing man they have spent almost a hundredand fifty five million dollars since the twenty twenty election and they spent sixty million dollars making transfers to trumps twenty twenty four campaign super pack make america great again but that is superpack see funded twelve going three million dollars to save america in in may and tune otherwise save a medical would a been in debt apparently during the same time period may and tune save a america pent twenty one point six million dollars on legal expenses this is t this a lot of money this a lot of money which by the way is not in amazing way to run a campaign once again dona trump is a billionaire if you are given money to trumps campaign you should really want him to spend that on nor tharganing jobidon but that is not where the money is being pent me well dona trump is trying to go after governor bran camp in georgia he suggesting the bring camp should start impeachment proceedings again for want fanny wills who the d a in georgia there is no ground there is no legal ground for impeaching fanny wills now you can say oh get we there is no legal ground for her going after dona trump either butt is not up to is not up to trying camp the take legislature is not going to do it which means that can to get done and it is just going t be bunch of political pestering and theatre and trying camp honestly to his credit is what ism ism busy running a state here the somebody has to be in adult the room i mean at some at some point here here is brancamp the bottom line is hat in the state of gorge is long as ism governor we are going to fall of the law in the constitution regardless of whit helps or harms politically over the last few years some inside an outside of this building may have forgotten that but i can assure i have not in georgia we will not be engaging in political their the only inflames the moons of the moment we'll do what is right we will up hold our out his public servants in is belief that our state will be better off for he says we have a law in the state of georgia that clearly outlines t e legal steps that can be taken if constituents believe that local prosecutors are violating their oath by engaging in on ethical or legal behavior up to this point of ossein evidence that the a wills is actions are lack their of wasn't action by the prosecuting attorney over she commission get late again a bad prosecution does not necessarily mean that brancamp has the power or the ability or should use that ability tho do this nowt again i totally get the reactionary sentiment which has if angels is doing something wrong violate whatever laws ye have to in or to get rid of her since she's violation whoever law she has to an i go after dona trump the problem is that in the state of georgia the reason of brancamp though the printable result this and no one has any second order thinking it at ever ever o case let us as som the branch did what you ain't do let us in the brancamp and the state legislature in georgia which is a very purple state now thanks to the ministrations of people dona trump let us say that they went ahead and they move for the impeachment if annuellis let say that they got it what say they achieve theimpeachment if anyillis having re publicans ruin do in the election after that we bingo great for them or do you think that they might run into sommissues bryancamp stood up to the attempts to overturn the results of the twenty twenty election in georgia and they when an overwhelming victory against stay arms who is suppose it stay arums lest we forget with such in amazing goddess according to left that they made her the empress of of all the universe on barrack that you stay arms was and shows defeated solidly by brancamp meanwhile in that same exact was marshal walker done from chosen vice for sextet lost lie work instead of fighting pubic victories that end up actually undermining the ability to wen e sections in the future maybe we ought to use a little bit of political smarts here but i guess up i that is the question are ween the business of pubic victories or pubic losses of the case man many may not even get what you want or are you into business of tuna long turn building in order to stop the lefts at agenda and it seems everybody is a short from thinker this one of the other reasons why as to get back to the the first topical discussed that the one o the reasons why you you have eight year old the had a government is because you can only is buying a short husband right that that they the expiration ate on the thing is very very soon and we are uneasy about the longs from future we do not build movements any more we make short term plays in the hope that the otherwise will are a bad short crumply which means effectively you are waiting for the other side to do something truly agree just order waiting for some sort of ground shift to happen some false mascara now the reality is the dayasec dacoit and politics rarely arrives what you should be doing is building long our movements dow be the thing that we should be doing is that something that either side isn't wile the left it it for fifty years now seems their stuck in a run the right did it with regard to rover's waded and they achieve victory in getting supreme sort to overturn rover's weed but it seems movement building is a lot of hard works lot in cromental work it is not rewarding and a yunisalot easier is to shout at the moon that is that is the thing that is a lot easier and meanwhile on the twenty twenty four re publican at side of the isle the poles continue show dona trump with a massive and durable lead he continues to be leading in the real clerpozix poll average by about forty points the latest economist yougov pole has been fifty two per cent nationally and rondisantis at sixteen per cent again the line up is the same it is been the same for months at this point it goes trump do mantis and then way behind the rest of the pack you will have a variety of romaswamy half pens and crispy and those of the only candidates or even on the stage and all of them or running way the hell behind dona true at this point in time now in i it is possible the summon could score and upset victory if you are looking to polling an i right now trump is up but he's up by about twenty points about half his national lead in i and is henry also points out dona trump haze has made a risky moan wile by pissing lawful lot of the main leaders in i henry also n the washington poses would be easy to conclude from the poles that trump cruel to victory and i was causes in canary spend a week in the state it becomes fearless certain the former present will star off primary season within early victory because i was evangelical christian community is not yet sold on him is that talk to i eventhelical masters an brasserie is leaders fllunderstand the wants is of their community better than any poster their mes sage was surprisingly uniform i was he ventolicals have not made up their minds as of yet now could trump lose once when the when the primarshore i mean he absolutely could the the the real question is whether field is going to consolidate and whether it is going to consolidate behind one alternative candidate even then trump still has the upper handicorne to current polling unless something dramatic changes bet to more on that just one second first they're

benshipiro shoes on his special in this episode we die us how to creed a free society through duty an responsibility and how left i ideology has evolved and planted itself into our social institutions plus we all them to how chrism transition from young lefts to a force for good in the conservative movement it is a great conversation everybody should hear it here is a little bit of the trailer is started looking at the people around in these a kind of letting radical student groups and and political movements and what i found is that these were people who were the sons and daughters of the most elevate people from around the globe these are people who are using this vocabulary cynically to establish their own status to establish their own power and then after a couple years of wearing the mafia are going to go on and take over their father's company and that was really the the question well if these people are utterly a moral frauds maybe there is something wrong with these ideas make sure you check out the latest episode the bench pearl so sundae special this sundae on daily our plus you to and anybody yo listen to pots meanwhile we ne to look at the other republican candidates nobody seems to be gaining a ton of momentum ronisantis handled the latest hurricane in florid quite well everybody's sort of understands that enemy for of course present and trump who is ripping on him consistently throughout the handling of the hurricane because this is the way we do our politics now o demands handled tat pretty well according to politico it showed why he is a darling of conserterce in the done class hat also exposes his vulnerability why exactly well because no reason i mean they carnally explain why he id a bad job but they are saying that exposed is venerability mainly because in our stupid politics if you are good at a job that does not help you at all apparently and the the biggest thing is that other people can attack you with regard too your performance better not to be an office you can attack everybody than to be an office trying to do the thing there is that o meanwhile never back down which is to which his ronicants is superpack i they are shifting their re sources to the early states recognizing that here on need to win the early states early if they wish to carry on the campaign beyond that righter is the simple math in therepublican prime reis got iota new hampshir south caroling the mantis basically has to want allthree if he wins i and he loses new vampire trump trumps on walk away with it if he wins i in new samphire and trump win south caroling handily because the field splits trumps proliganasweep an the this is this is the math for to mantis of shifting all his resources into the early states he shouldhave done that earlier is the truth he they've ended their dornocking in evade and the super say say some me blessing this is sign of to mantis campaign's weakness maybe it may also be a sign of just trump strength in a lot of these states the cannot diversified force s you've to concentrate them where you think trump is most vulnerably got a knock him out of the box right out o the gate that that basicalley's the only way to win these primaries nickel hale is tarting gain some creditability it looks right now as tho the rest of the fight the rest of the field may consolidate down to do mantis verses hailed to which would not be particularly shocking romasuwamy is running a self funded campaign he also is i would say the darling of a sort of he let in the in the twitter verse but he does not have tremendous grasses support he is not really building a grassy organization is getting a lot of earn media an that earn media has it eesarely translating into heighten poll members especially because he is catering to a particular sub set of people what on twitter by saying sort of things that i think he knows are not true and then he is and then he sort of new nosing them afterward do it do think that romaswuammy is that the vague is a a sort of durable candidate going forward in the re publican party may it maybe next time around i do not think this time around he is going to be one of the top three candidates it seems right now the field seems to be consolidating a round trump to mantis hailed that is trump block a huge margin and then the mantis and hale after that mi pence does not seem to be gaining any sort of momentum he is still speaking to small crowds in iota again the question is to why pence his running remains at the tip of everybody's tongue the truth is to probably is just a way to to button up his legacy i because teethe reality is the trump is silvery popular inside their publican party pence defending his own actions in canary of twenty twenty one i thing is well worth while whether that has to happen in t a presidential campaign i i am not am not certain meanwhile in other political news the white house is begging congress to pass short from spending y'all and loose footage according to the washington post there urging congress to adopt ta short tor measure to fun the federal government a movement to buy time for all makerscraft a brought or spending deal and avert another shut down at the end of september here is the math an for everybody how do the shut town routine every six months in this country here is the math if republicans control the house but not the senate or the presidency the'renot can to get everything they want end of story that is that is all and if there is a massive government shut down and which things just do not move forward the people who are likely to bear the burden of that over time is just the way the political mouth works a the people what not signing the checks jobidon wrongfooted himself last time in the showdown he said ism not an negotiate at all he is said no negotiations there is a huge mistake by him he is a lad my earthy to come forward and say okay well we are on negotiate i where is our opening position let us new opiate and bones lay ism not negotiating you are by look the baggy well these their stupid political mount a not the wait listen in ideally in an at idealistically pure world the way that work is republican to say here are the here are the various departments funded as departments i the be what we call regular order it has not obtained in washington to see for at least a couple of decades i will fund the defense department that we will fund the education department that well fund the commerce department that that has not happened we have ben doing omnibuses for last several decades in the united states he the normal way that would work is that they have then negotiate over each one o this bills and that has not happened because there's to much back scratching in there much pork barrel rolling and there is there is too much negotiation with the other branches of government and whether party et with that said if republicans take get up from position we are not negotiating whatsoever there on to bear the political front if something does not go forward you got o get the best that you can get an is it is my job to point out were that trace from principle but it is the job of people in congress to get the best that they can get rid it is all ha negotiation when jo bid demands a short from spending bill should he be given a short from spending bolt no he should not be re publicans should lay out a couple of key concessions they wish to win in the next spending battle another they should fight for those concessionsand they should say lissom were willing to give up a lot stuff that we do not want o give u but you got to give something to that is the way that you win a government shut down fight contrary to can of talk radio opinion the way the when a government shut down fight is not typically to shut down the government for prolonged periods of time it does not seem to redowncet the benefit of the party perceived as being more intransigent now as the say the democrats can fall in to the trap right the democrats can say we will not to negotiate at all organ a be intransigent then they will pay the political price for they are intransigents the chip p demands mark sharpbreake with the deal party leaders including how speaker my earthy worked you wit the president tho spring to raise the nations element the suppose to prevents another stale mate over spending this fall now the bit administrations explicitly asking congress to adopt what is known as a say that is continuing resolution at this point now were can t have that battle next week earlier of this month my earthy and chuckshume me each signaled early support for continuing resolution they might offer all makers more time to craft a full year spending deal ism but o bitch my cell sad on wednesday it is pretty big mass he predicted that all makers would adopt to short from dealing to remember while they trigger to struggle i fig out exactly with government spending level is going to be the reason that i say that the split government works that that that the split government between republicans and democrat's means that publicans are not going to get what they want out of the deal is because they will not coupons can overdo it this sort of the quixotic quest idealistically pure but politically politically counter productive a tempt by ten cruise in twenty fourteen to d fun the federal government to get cut at to get barockabo much orepealabomicar it was not going to happen rockoon was not going to repeal abomicar and that there is certain things that may help individual politicians because it make them look purer to the bays that do not actually achieve the thing but that there is difference between that an actively stumping for things that you think you can achieving negotiation right chip boy did that last time around he did that with regard to the the budgeting process and he also do that with regard to for example even mac earthy speakership itself and he wants him important concession that should be something that is is on the table meanwhile jobidon trying to lock up the youth not by giving them need apparently according to political the bite administrations department of health in human services is recommending that the d e significantly loosen federal restrictions on marijuana stope short of advising it would be entirely removed from the controlled substance is act the health agency wants the drug move from schetural one to schettural three under the sea that is potentially the biggest change in federal drug policy ans decade we already have a huge percentage of america youngsters who are toking and on making nothing of their lives then the first of all we have now bunked in very thorough fashion the scientific community has done the idea that marital is not addictive that is not true it is just true first salt it is significantly more potent than when you work second of all it is actually quite addictive for a large percentage people who take it the idea that it is completely benign portulif young people is a complete lie i do not no culturally got tote point were to back products are considered the great rout of all evil becauseyou might i have lung cancer when your sixty but marina which makes you useless if you if you use it on the regular is somehow considered what some sort of societal good i man i know people personally who have serious problems it marijuana addiction and it is a it is a it is a massive issue and meanwhile the bide administration seeking apparently to make everybody fat stupid useless is a is going to move toward more criminalization on on marijuana a can make the case the federal government is bad at the warrendrugs that that is a case that ism actually somewhat warm to but that is on a case that jobidnis over made he is doing this on idea logical grounds the each us letter is part of an official of you process initiated by bid in last october the the a conducts the of view it sent to the national institute on druggabuse in the h chess the whet just transients the letter of recommendation to the d e eh the white house is refusing to comment on the o view process this will lead to a federal state conflict because the federal low has failed to kep up with mass one changes of the past decades in state canvas lost by the way s worked out beautifully for californium and for states holerada ere denser is now basically an open air drug market things are things are working out absolutely beautifully h criminalization of marijuana it mighthave been an idea that was numerable for a time but the the effects of it have been pretty pretty bad meanwhile democrats continue to use climate change as there excuse for pretty much everything the governor of hawk josh green he is asked out whether hair's electric company had been responsible for the complete destruction of laminar which is one of the great tragedies of modern america history really is quite horrifying and it is pretty obvious that probably how electrictsior o shut down the electric substations and they did not and probably led to this fire in the middle of this giant want windstorm and a he was well ism not on to say anything about the power company bud om the sun global warming how much responsibility f you think the power company were here for the fire it is a very goo question to day then which was on the ten i ask my attorney genera l instructed her to do comprehensive investigations she is doing that right now she is brought n outside investigator in i from the mainland that has fire expert sees she is can find out exactly how much we do know that that early fire was spare as as he got said i do not at jump ta conclusions just because i do not think its fair for me to do that but we will hold everyone accountable one hundred per cent and will be very transparent about it release all the reports i think that in the end of the day we all have to acknowledge that this is a global problem it was a very very hot dry terrible storm we are feeling with label warming here we had six total fire emergencies from nineteen fifty three to two thousand of three and then we had six in the first two weeks of this month cay on it is the is to get out of jail free car for bad governments it turns out the human beings of been dealing with environmental disasters for literally all of human history how you handle that is a good measure of are you good at your job or not and on he handled this about of badges you can handle it so global warming is the problem of course meanwhile trobidin doing the same sactrotine it such a get out of jail freeboard climate changes now basely the excuse for everything and we handled the disaster badly in laheinot well it was climate change the the economy is having probing hell that that is probably because of climate change the the war is breaking out the mite is climate change everything is climate changes is the it is the ultimate political get out of jail free card we still some denied she there the turns yo o worthier nan climates doit ti is and the workman need a whole he of more money to deal is to mere serrations to dead is to all you taking cure oh the answer is a a lop or money and that i did not we that coming robin calling for more spending on things no no by the way the the notion that hurricanes are dramatically created by the globe warming issue that data is not particularly clear as born homburg points out and lactic hurricanes are not becoming more frequent the frequency of hurricanes making landfall in the contextual united states has to cline slightly since nineteen hundred airplanes in satellites of dramatically increase the number of storms scientists can spot at s which is by the frequency of landfall hurricanes reliably to common to back to nineteen hundred is better stay than the total number of aplanatic hurricanes there are more powerful hurricanes either the frequency of cat three in above hurricanes making landfallsonces nineteen hundred is trending slightly down you her a lot about hurricanes getting stronger a study in the journal of nature found that the increases are not part of these century sell increase but a recovery from a deep minimum in the sixties through the eighties yap i it is it is once again it comes down to governments an ability to governor a time force some things i and some things that i hate to day i begin with a thing that i hate because this is legitimately one of the dummistakes have ever heard my entire life here it is it comes o courtesy of warhead man due of the new a times who is a reliable a reliable source for some the dumb stay ever heard ka and hands helps enable a driveway that should pay for it wait you ask aria and end hiring g hangs of criminals to steal each others vehicles no that is non what they did apparently they just did not take enough precautions to prevent people from stealing their vehicles ism not getting this is his case in a recent analysis of data from thirty seven america cities the council on criminal justice a non partisan thing tank suggested a hopeful then the pandemic i a spite and crimavf pikes the homicide made has dropped significantly over the last year based on at ut from thirty america cities but there's a glaring exception auto thefts according to the council on criminal justice the number of vehicle thefts during the first half of twenty twenty three was thirty three point five per see higher on average than during the same period and twenty twenty two representing twenty three thousand nine hundred seventy for more vehicle thefts in the cities that we worth data that's be filly washington you see chicagon warrant buffalo in dirham and nor north carina motor f vehicle thefts this year have more than doubled relative to last year according to staffs collected by eff ashes a crime day to annalist why are many cars getting stolen police departments and city officials point to this millions of keeps and undine are ridiculously easy to steal oh that oh it is oh said the far it is that it is this the fault of the car you see the car basically wanted it it is skirt was too short it needed to be stolen that is the way that just works it is not the criminated the cars just sitting there and the criminal was not a criminal of just you you ere just walking down the street like a normal human never having stolen can life and there you saw it in the pure son summer sunshine a keep ultima and you are ah what is dust thing the time has come that is the easiest car to steel and you drawn a moth to the flame walked over two the sea you said sure that is non a very nice car surreally want a keep ow i was not desperate for any of of of keep's brands we i just they are envy six was not might was not my bag they are telluride was not thing but now that i see it now that i see gleaming in the summer sunshine and i know it superheavy to steal i a lifelong law biding citizen have decided to steal is keep that is exactly how went probably scoring o far had man for years now most actor makers have equipped most of the cars they see in the us to the loctronicimobalizers devices that prevent cars from starting unless they detect a radio idiot associate wit the cars right full key but hands and keep which come under the same e south rein conglomerate did not install this basic device in somewhere round nine million cars sold between twenty eleven and twenty twenty two a couple of years ago videos showing house to hot wire the vulnerable cars began to pop up a line without going into details the hack annals jamming a small object into the car starter and turning it as if reeky one perfectly shaped tool for the dob as readily available a u us fellow ism glad that far had man is now explained people how to steal cars is grab the results crime it his clobbered america cities were hiding close to six thousand cars that been stolen s yare alone at drain dead battles police's chief more than third of the cars stolen were undine and keeps and then thereat the follow on accident stolen keas an undine have been involved in numerous idly crashes armed robbery streets another crimes around the country who didn't expect that from the keeps an undine that is crazy basically the seas on their own n we are stolen thereisn'n known to blame for this it was their own fault because there easy steal and then the key a robbed a bank in one on an armed robbery spree or shall we set y u feels robbery spree all by itself amazing stuff from the key t was i cannot believe they programmed these cars to perform armed robbery wild well settle is one of several city suing kea and hands they make a compelling was says far head manta the caretaker should have known they were creating in safe to a you are did i guise did that if you create a product an it is stolen it is your fault it was stolen and you created an unsafe product because you knew was publican be stolen the costs of their decision have had far reaching effects on public safety and city resources there is no telling one thefts might abate i that is amazing fire mans you laments he says it is difficult for cities to prove that the is an thefts is primarily kea and sunrise fault richer rose fell to criminologist is one of the authors on the council on coronal justice and apsis told me motor vehicle theft is an under research phenomenon but staff's release by some of the worst effected city strongly suggest thefts of keys an sunrise are major part of the recent spike there is a chance cant and hunt will escape some of the blame for these thefts there is a juicer target for politicians toglafter social media platforms where the howtuvidios havebeen circulating this strikes me as a bazar blame shifting its demon hands not ticktock that sold therefrom cars wait why we lemming ticktock or you how about you blame criminals i do not understand there hi got third party you are doing all the chiming it dint ditto in hands in key it is the criminals but these people are stuplislic to stupidistic have ever heard we there is the knife who as sitting there in plainsight and you are just drawn to it you could not stop yourself and you stab your friend in the eyeball probably we should see the knife manufacturer ore alternatively the much of that you're you learned that knife stab things this how due we have become had out some basic level of personal responsibility well he cannot see that because you note this might require more police more active policing more throwing criminals in the jail and leaving them in the jail i know this is superbasic stuff but not apparently to these morons i slow clap for for that genius take there that that is some strong stuff of a meanwhile let us get to a thing that i things that i today when joroggen had on liver anchovy he is the guy from a rich men north of richmond who becomes from a national phenomenon he his song led off the first republican debate i he says he is to a political figure which is perfectly fine i thing most america he relax isn't fool politics allthat closely but that his generalized annoyance and t leak class that seeks to control the lives to america and a in use its power to redistribute as he says from sort o the productive to the in productive that is inherently political even if he does not wish it to be a partisan issue i we was fascinating to watch him on organ because as a a sort of blue collar died we was able to say some things to to job that a lot of people need to hear now now have quoted the bible to to my friend toboggan before it has having a diverenimpack when come from liver anthonhe hear is liver anchovy on with organ yesterday there is there is things it si like and ill be very brief r this a promise but one thing ironically it is a proverbs for twenty which i thought cere this anything better it ram print my son pay attention to what i say turn your ear to my words do not let them out o your sight keep them within your heart for they are life to those who find them and health the one's whole body above all else guard your heart for everything you do flows from it keep your mouth free from perversity keep corrupt talk far from your lips let your eyes look straight ahead fix your gaze directly before you give careful thought to the path for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways do not turn to the right or the left keep your foot from evil but om that is pretty profound but the whole book of proverbs is that it is not predict is not it is not what you think it is it is it is good guidance is good guidance that you would want a father to give to this son good for alive anchovy again this is the part of america life and he tells the story by thewy and his stories rally fascinating was he basically says that he was we was involved in drug use and he was involved an alcohol use and hots busily falling apart in your suicide and and then he discovered religion and just a lot of other people who have discovered religion over the course of religious history we then found inspiration there and within six months he was writing songs that people wanted to hear and basically his song is to plead for leave me alone and personal responsibility that is really what it is let these people not bother me and let me live my life in continence with walking in the ways of god this is the way that america used to work and and the fact that i it is kind of incredible how basic messages isms the book of proverbs is kind of an old book and it is familiar to many of us and in's mishap in in here it is been around for several thousand years and the fact that used to be the the sentences that liver anchovy is reading there these used to be the kinds of sentence is that pretty much everybody in america had it to their tongue youcould basically quote the book of heteronomy and it would be a common point of of reference in the same way that in brain you could quote shakespeare knows a common point of reference the bible was the tax that everybody used for literally centuries the text that was for many people the only text they knew was the bible there is a reason why the the most printed book in human history is the bible and now if you speaks a regular person on the street and you quote the bible they do not know a damn thing about it and that is a real problem because the bible does carry with it a set of values it is not just a bunch of vague standards that are unimplementable in your daily life as it says in the book of heteronomy it is not far from you it is close to you in your mouth writing that this the the basic notion that the morality of the bible is available to every one and that it is actually fairly understandable and fairly clear and the provides to basic guide to life this was the thing that fell away in favor of its notion the you can define your own value system in that just follow your stars follow what you feel in your heart follow that that is not what the bible is saying that is not what proverbs is saying and liver anchovy when he move from living in one way to a biblical way of living improved his life fairly dramatically the bible is still the greatest self help book ever written because it is not about you that the whole point of self help is that it really is not about yous that you orienting outside yourself you cannot help yourself if your oriental toward yourself you are the problem and we live in a society where you are not allowed to say to people that that they are the problem with their own life but the truth is ninety fie percent of the problem in your life are you problems mean that the promise that you can solve or that you have to handle and that in handling your life gets better that does not mean that horrible things do not happen in people financially health life of course horrible things happen to people but the only way that you can solve those kind of promising relish our army fixing the external circumstance is by how you approach that problem there's appoint that victor frank makes even with regard of the polices he says even when you are put in literally the worse situation that human being cam put into it is your measure of autonomy in dealing with that situation that makes you human being that is what biblical valleys used to teach and it used to be in grain from the time the you were very very young there is some people who lead that sort of life instinctively job is not a biblical liver but job is the kind of person who approach his life that way you actually no job ism friends with job that the way that you approaches his own life is in this way that how can i help myself how to i solve the problem not howdy i blame somebody else you then comes and solves the problem for me one they promise their politics is just that emery's waiting for the dayosec mascara re's waiting for somebody come along and solve all the problems for them and the politicians where those popular are the pie pipers who save this kind of stuff well i will solve your promise i will come in with the power government i will fix everything but that is not possible they cannot do that every'slooking as i set on twitter to day ever is looking for the days exmacanameing the god outside the machine there us to be something in green theater where basically the writer would run into a problem of his own making they could not fix and suddenly a god would arrive from the rafters apollo which a show of and boom fix the prom that was days ex madman out right was the god in the outside the machine that's can fix everything well instead of looking but but now we have basically attributed those kind of powers to our let and then were surprise when the can fulfill how bout's stop instead of looking for a cause macadam to fix everything or a miracle tho fix everything how about we actually look to the set of values the built the civilization that we have garnered all benefit from while giving very little back about that that would be the thing that action makes ma difference it was it was a pretty fascinating appearance at rogue also on during this appearance went after rain willow rain willow had gone after liver anchovy and here was a job going after rainwilson in returned it is it is a subject of discussion everybody is getting involved and and somehow another became cultural and then there is a wite from the office oh yet chive i it if he get a it cultural and the would it e say something you would not write about over a people on welfare he would ride about billionaires in their taxes yet there is nothing funnier then millionaires talkie ha ha ha ha there is s nothing funny funnier about millionaires pretending these millionaires are out at take you no take take delight from the office down tho west virgenia now take em take m through those coal mining countries take em through those places in appalatia were people of extreme poverty soave in pills of ravished those areas take em to there he is not wrong about any of that but but the key there is that if you do not want talk down to people who yourain willow i want to talk down to people who are living appalacha and in poverty then do not talk down to them meaning they are human beings with equal worth and equal merit in god's view as as just human beings thither can t have to earn there can have to earn you there they are good in front of god but the idea that that they are of equal godly worth that that of course basic logical van which also means they have equal responsibility is responsibility that that has fallen away here the alveranthony appearance on rogue is definitely worth the watch if she spend some time with it it is really it is really good ardygoes rest to hall

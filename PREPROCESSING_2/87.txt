the benchverishorsponser by express vision prince's a right don a privilege defendyau right t express epianzacam slashed why precisely is their a caulis in the united states congress that openly sympathizes and lies on behalf say new hating genicitl terrorist group that is the question that should be on the lips of every america to day after washing respite to lead the elected congress woman from michigan leading insurrection as protest into a congress building in solidarity with compass to we dispenser entire political career hating news she has routinely actuated news defending themselves from comassterrism with commasterrorism she routinely denounces israel as an partied state but has never founded in her heart to condemn either compass or hesballah according to the lashington free beacon to let has ties to a pro palestine actives to praised cabala for attacking quote agree to lee has met repeatedly with a mischcan base newspaper publisher who claims cabala has made lebanon safer to give to leads campaign bunglers have pushed anti israel and proterrorous views another to lead ally salisarsuer has been accused of financing compass through front groups in the nineteen nineties according to ape documents harsher and official at the atomic society of malarky organized fundraisers for s lead and both twenty eighteen and twenty twenty abas came day a palsinian actress who cheered that quote cabala slaughtered unreel attended to leads two thousand nineteen swearing in in short it is no mystery where respite to lead stand she stands with commas and other genicitl anti jewfish terror groups she made that even clearer this week when she issued no denunciation of compass specifically for their master of fifteen hundred news instead blaming their anti jewfish pogrom on america funding of israel quoting quit a parties government and then yesterday to leave promoted a blood libel as we talked about an yesterday show on tuesday a failed piston in hislomichy hodrocket landed in a parking lot next to a hospital comas promptly lied and blame the iserailies and claimed five hundred dead the claim was quickly debunk by rate our data vidiodata an audiodata thin matter the entire media ran with it but there is what respected to lead staid yesterday after the de bunking at a procomas rally at the capital continue to watch people think oka pajama hospital t anoa sometimes it watching idiot an anti gismo cry i person er e c ta continued no all of that was a lie bit not a shocking lie because to leap supports derris she has done consistently throughout her career she opening calls for the eradication of the jewfish state supporting instead what she calls a secular one state out come which would of course devolve into is gamic state she has never at any point expressed to any discontent about the presence of some fifty five is comic states on the planet of course and yet the media have treated oleic is a great lite bringer the nurtures magazine ran a glowing piece about to lead and twenty twenty two explaining in breathless terms quote she changed these rally palestininto bat in congress by reminding her colleagues of the human stakes it is a burden she would rather not carry tole is not the only member of the comas caucus of course within oar is a founding member oleic she pared comas talking points down to the lie that israel boy the hospital she to lei is a supporter of the called boy costovast sanctions movement that seeks the extermination of the take o israel she believes that israel quote hypnotize the world she blames republican support for israel on the benjamins operating the notion that news pay off congress people to support israel she cambered israel comas and the tarlatan to one another and yet democrats continued to avoid directly condemning either to lei or oar meanwhile other trunk members of the comes causes continued to incredibility in democratic circles in shine of this year nine democrats including the venerable alexandra o cozy confess voted against a resolution in congress declaring that israel is quote not erashistorapartite state and stating that the united states will quote always be staunch partner and supporter of israel the eight other democrats include hamal woman summerly cry bush opera carbon tellurate as ianocressley and promiligiapol lose of course wept openly on the floor of the house when the house passed funding to re arm israel defensive iron dome that is right she cried in front of the cameras because israel was being given funding for defensive weaponry to shoot down rockets aimed jewfish civilian areas why does the democratic party have such tough time dissociating from its tear supporting members why d they suddenly suffer from a cute amnesia when asked even condemn their comments the answer is obvious too many democrats have invested too much in a political strategy that is deeply depending on a single lie that there is in interjectional coalition of the oppressed that must be united in order to tear down the route institutions of a corrupt western society in this view be ale is the same as comas is the same as the democratic socialist of america is the same as the radical legit tiki plasmins dividabasin movement all our necessary cogs in a machine designed to wreck the west in the name of the called marginalized a machine design to tear down the supposed hierarchy dominated by white man christian now for a long time many the liberal jewfish community thought they could be part of this club after all have not news been historically victimized are not theyaminority now they were wrong of course it turns out that the news are too white and too disproportionately successful for the liking of the interjectional coalition in this view is will be golfer one said even the polices was merely white on white crime and when commas terrorist murder jewfish babies well that is just decolonization the democratic party cannot throw out the comas causes without also recognizing the failure of its new cops ideology if it turns out that dis proportionate poverty and failure among certain groups is not the result of western civilization itself or some evil white hierarchy that comes can be down and poor and also evil and that their evil is not the result of supposed jewfish colonization or exploitation well that would under mine the entire coalitional strategy and that cannot be allowed now the democratic party does have another road they could simply make the case for left then policies on their own merits on the basis of redistribute fairness or efficiency but they probably will not they stake too much in their interjectional future to toss out the terror supporters and they will likely continue to promotes the comosquawkets and she hatred will grow an the collapse of the west will accelerate and second will show you the insurrectionist activity at a capital building that will probably not result in long prison sentences four protestors because of course they are left wing procomas activist will get to that momentarily first last month the we twenty announce to

to lead gins up a bunch of a procamas supporters doubling down again on that gaze hospital lie an that that is a total lie common like purposefully deliberately we do not know ow many are dad from a rocket the into parkinglat it is certainly is not five hundred we we certainly know who fire the rocket according to both america intelligence and israliintelligence and rate our data and audiodata and visual data we know exactly what happened here there shetitly went and she like to an entire crowd and then that crowd proceeded too e mentally overrun the cannon office building that is a house office building that is located just a few yards from the capital building a to lead for her part she isn't answering any questions she ran away from reporters when she was confronted about the fact that she was lying openly about the bombing of the hospital she just ran away because that is what she does because she is a most terra she is an natural coward we the process protestors mobbed at the capital here is some of the footage of the protestors mobbing the capital again it is all good peaceful rioting when it is when it is people of the left when it is people supporting terrain groups they are occupying government buildings that is okay that is f a way this works and you are a canary six rioter or you are just an old grandmother wanders into the capital building under the weirdness impression the you're allowed to be in there on jaguar six you might get a few years in prison however if you deliberately storm a capital office building which is legal and then you occupy it then that apparently is totally fine kind of fine ism ism eager to see how it turning general merit garland decides to deal with the hundreds of people who are actually arrested because of this particular event look at the size of this crowd here is a giant crowd of terrace and their fellow travellers and useful idiots marching toward the capital office building the cannon house office building hat is a big crowd of people who really terrace right here in the united states always very encouraging again none of those people will actually condemicomants none of them in fact they have posters reading decolonize what think decolonize means have they been shy about this decolonized means killed the news that is what it means hey ben absolute clear about this what come o stay according to this crowd is they began the posts of de colonization by wiping out jewfish babies and small villages hats they did by by by literally have seen the photograph and to evidence o more of at yesterday nit con a she tea today but it is there certainly y confining on line of them pulling bodies out of wreckage that have been tied together with bailing wire and then and then murdered yet that the that is decolonization though and there is lots this sort of footage of these these evil protesters who have decided to take over the the cannon hat house office building here some of them what happened when they when they went into the office building again you areyou are most to loth metal detectors and actually but but apparently it is totally find occupied buildings now again when you are democrat can get away with anything or when your democratisociat a whether they got a bunch of useful idiot queasy news why take queasy news i mean the people maybe ethnically jewfish but they have about as much association with nudism as em as a hamshandwich does an i met my favorite part of the videos of the of the not in a name pseudo news who are we are joining this particular movement i do of it when there is body of people who are supposed to be looking jewfish and then hey just completely misheard the guard bitten my favorite things it's a lot of them are wearing what are called toll shim it the tolly theyyou seen pictures of orthodox news that ring what looks a prayer shawl right into prayershawl here more on were a intake loft betas they've no idea what they're doing no shock there they are useful idiots on behalf of terrace this is the least of their problem the comose protestors took over the cannon house office building a rests we are made i will say i do take a a bit of glee in the way these a rests go down i mainly because i if you are going to go and do a criminal thing and then you get arrested and then this is your reaction a ya your real tough my until the women you get arrested this particular protest are getting arrested for occupying a a house office building seems to have eaten a raw holopenio at the same time that he was arrested petit tub stuff there and there are these morons shouting at people not in our name now who is asking for anything to be done in your name i gan what they ma my free free palestine is not free the gas a three have come of they do not mean free parts of the west bang of passing authorities on the method or even critic pain an state they mean free tell of e i which they mean disturb that for news for the abolition of israel i me are not they are the they are not hiding the ball this is the part strikes me absolipawall the unbelievable gas lighting where people keep saying over and over and over outlook exactly what they want and then the entire western media plus the administration less totally not what they want none no there are comas supporters in the got stript none they do not exist they're re wonderful westerners we have just ben dominated by small group of evil terrorists which is wears that absolutely not what's happening and these protestors there they are not in favor of homaskys they are just in favor for palestine an state sure they say they want o completely destroy israel an sure not a single one of them we will go on camera condemning commit for it for its attacks or as an organization but what they really what they really wants and the projection of you are own thoughts and wishes into people who up who believe truly evil things continues to be a source of amazement to me prokomas protestors also try to climbarriers outside the white house si was exciting yesterday the no a trying you atonement little insurrection i happening it there i n'tknowhat they thin they are going to do whence they get over that fence other then go to jail but the ingenious level stuff from our prokomas crowd here in the united states process protestors also invaded us eat hearing there is send here and going on they decided to i go tote senate building and disturb the senate hearing that would be a legal right that is disturbing the functional workings of government i was told by all the right people that on statuary six this was a crime against humanity and a threats of the republic but it is totally find again when when members have left you the sort of stuff totally fine here so ism is the lady yelling the back that's just footing to the senators looking on li who idiocrasy eating how can we rester according to and beset washington hundreds of people who enter you less house office building went after have ben arrested after demonstrating to demand a sense fire in the israel comas war that makes ha town a lot less som egregious than it was again that is illegal you aren't aloud

police spokes person said that officials believe everyone went through security and enter the cancan house building according to guy lines but those to enter are suppose to not stay inside the con gressional buildings tat yourespose to be the for a reason protestors including rabbis i love this whenever they say including rabbis i say all get where is your smell from seriously no play my due card here you no no i do not i do not believe your credentials your crinantials a garbage you to them from the bottom of a cracker jack box i demon started from the main floor and from several balconies singing praying holding signs and banners in chanting seize fire now close to three hundred people were in custody more than three hours after the rally inside thecongressional office building began three have been charge with salt on police officer during processing according to the police this seems i if the rules apply for the goose they ply for the manner i expect that some o these people will be had in solitary confinement and then i expect that some of them will go to jo for prolong periods of time after all we are told that these are threats to the re public i not here's here is a question where are the democrat's blasting the famous cakes seriously whys re she'd it is leave stone congress she mixed it seems to me that supporting terrorists sprig o reason to expel a member of congress it is like a fairly obvious one why exactly should you be allowed to sit in the halls of congress if you support a terrorist group come ass work was bellow as we should its leave obviously does where is the democratic party in all this where are all the top level democrats sang anything insteadwhat they are doing is many f them are sang proisral things another their pretending to they that rescued is leave does not exist until it time to pose with her on the cover of a magazine they can show the strength of the interjectional coalition shuckshumer the sent majority leader he correctly said yesterday that the world blame d israel in fairly or the hospital bombing here a strucktumer but of course he is had nothing to say over the course of years about any of his colleagues inside the democratic party who support terrorism it is strucksumer by the way who also help usher the rue the garbage rondel pushed by the about administration that help strengthen iron two strength in the hand of compass for this attack in the first place striction ere voted against the deal but only after giving permission to members of his own cast town favor of the rondel anyway here is truck stumer we e was iris no there is there is who e this us that the on of course was not o is you but her was o wo of i of wosmass this lot us o is i e in e state gas the i ai a wonk of the truth more immediately did o the o the id en we i no or sirs wo my is early o the work and in the was i i oo well i mean that is true it would be great if you speak up against the terrace members of your own cakes or terror supporting members of your own cakes by the way won my favorite things about the all these demonstrations is that this this is now a realities happen all the tines up last night i spoke of the university of flora about this topic there is a pro compass rally outside members my team went you there wit cameras to ask people if they could describe what their engulf is the map of israel and the palstinian authority occupied areas in the comas but fairies the gosestrip and that do i want you to explain to me which part of this ought to be palestine none of them would answer the questions and that is because people are now being told do not talk to the media because you might in invertenltly show that your genocide which presumably is why for example pro palestine demonstrators according to the daily caller gathered outside the white house on money refusing to denounce come ass the daily callers tub gibbons asked one man why he was at the protest he started covering up his face people's people refuse to answer questions to seems to me if your hae a protest you should be able to answer questions about your protesting for that is the purpose of a protest but to not according to these folks because we all know why there a the protest the answers at they support terrace group you mite we dam mamas i cannot do that no one condemns violence but the same time what else it pusses whatelse he wants to do i proof of any one the fight for the freedom ism wasting lupin down the stats a why o anta ta it's rally avenge tags on madman were the literally bombing thousands of babies in the mamas fibers or under ground not be much can you explain to me why is rail is bobbing thousands of babies as we speak and you explain that to me i do not i do not o o ten o to not t afar es not a fan which much them are you abandon on which team are you fan yet to ism the answer to his question is the reason that israel has beenbobing these targets with as much precision as it can is to kill as many common terraces a can the reality is that if israel would do what what israel needs to you re bounce on the tunnels can the tunnels are all locate forty we underground israel does have the ordinance to do that they've bee refrain sing from doing that because compass will mot alow civilians to be cleared from the area it is the exact reason commons one to was civilians to be cleared from the area israel has been trying to get this civilians out of these areas is they can boy the terror tunnels before they have to send is daily men and women into these areas to fight hand to hand with terra well being shot at by civilians by judo civilians many of whom are located in these parts of the gazastrip that is the reality on a military level what israel actually needs to dos destroy the tunnels before it goes in but because compasses hiding civilians on top and they have the sympathy of the world media they understand the israel cant even kill the terrorists that is the whole plan to turn this thing into vet not for israel that if israel goes in it turns in to black hawk down that is the entire goal that istle entire goal that is why compass keeping civilians up there ts why civilians are dying right now and just one second we will get to the interjectional coalition which again continues to be quite robust even if it means backing terrorism get's that first every hollowing parents are worn about theptential dangers in kid's candy now a lot of that is exaggerated but thepotential dangers you encounter everyday in the meat isle is truly spooky lab grown meat is growing more more popular it is no unusual for foreign meet to be libeled as product of the united states you don't really know what is an thatstuff fortunately my friends to god rangers have made it their mission to change all of that this howling good ranchers is taking the trick out of their meat and thy are throwing in treat for my lists thirty bucks offyour order with brummocoachipero at good ranchers dot come the number one place to get america best pork beef chicken and seemly delivered is with good ranchers their products are transparently source all america and delicious when you shop if good ranchers to common tough to question whatsit your mate because again it is guaranteed one hundred percent america take the mystery

spectacular it is cod shipper for thirty buck off your bags at good ranchers that come america meats delivered again go checked am out right now good ranchers tot come use t my promacochipera and get thirty bucks off with free express t shipping the best meat in america to day okay the interjectional coalition everybody understands that what it is holding it together is hatred of the supposed power hierarchy that is what this is it understands the comas here is a flash back twenty twenty one here is the had of compass actually it is maya sinjoar condemning america racism now what what wise it is happening why the answer of course is because he is attempting to draw a kinship between black people in america and palsinian grabs living under the tyrannical rule of compass but not because the passing grabs living under the tannic full of of compass are being press by compass y know because israel is the great oppressor and it is the coalition of the dis possessed nonsense and by the way this is exactly how many organizers for black lives matter talk about the palcinian issue they suggest the black america are living under the boot heel of the evil white america races substructure in the same way at palsinians are leaving under the boots of the evils ionic oppressor that is the commonality you under i peeled was tweeting out actual graphics of hang gliding palicinian terra murdering people you won a there that is why you knowhow knows that come ass and they play on it here is egos singer doing exactly this just a couple of years ago not then by the infusion we the an i the go he says no one to take this opportunity to remember the races murder of gorge floods get's a fall terrorist you you gorge flood was killed you as h result of a races ideology held by some people literally his chock an chartists kill all the jaws by the way u should e r mind this same type of races i that killed gorge flood is being used by the israel against the passed insane they know the game they know the interjectional game they are playing the interjectional game and they are enabled by the media to play that interjectional game because the media a part of the deal the media lovely interjectional game the media allow them to continue to claim that the west is actually the gratsat in the west is the problem it is all western structures of power israel a colonialist outpost in the middle east never mind the fact the only reason anybody ever gave a crap about the land over there is because it is jewfish in the first place never never mind the fact tors continues to is presence in the land of israel since literally the time o the bible predating the existence of slam by millennia then matter non that matters all the matters is the narrative and the narrow is there is an interjectional coalition to take on the the halls and the into pillars of power this you one we she got sect in this thing they as knows leap about that least lose barely knows how to tide her shoes in the morning to s cannot make herself a bull obit tat lady has the eye pul a come quit what is she there is literal tape of her with margarita whoever explaining she knows nothing about the middies nothing o the t opaplea potion fa oh i i think hi a what i ma forfeit to eaten fontofo prefer or poftetofo tepefafeto thatohon do you think you can a ta why i done i think i do think to i am not temper tofoathi fate tuition and yet that lady is extremely vocal about all this why why but because again she is part of the dispossessed coalition this the interjectional coalition must be up hell at all cops even at the expense give lots and lots have dead news that is what is going on here this is why to s party girl of the democratic socialist of america is suddenly deeply concerned about iron dome in teeth this this ridiculous inside gram take took do been here here she was yesterday talking about tactsthe rich and slicing eminent on the instar also she is she is very much in favor of of the compass sech account of likes them there a they kind of cool why they would kill her first opportunity by the way an me light one of my favoritethings about theintersectional coalition is it they are willing to ride or die with compass up until the point were commas actually kills them i noted yesterday again at the university of flora there ware two protestant were simultaneously held outside my lecture at the in varsity of flora both fairly small one of them was a protest by the leg b t u crowd and the other or was a process by the promos crowd they get along all the way until the promos crowd decides to kill every member of the else b t u crowd in indicate he as as yesterday promoting her democratic socialist ideals we amigo cudalemen and i cans sit and it sic a sites to shalt my radicals who think tat make one way that we can dead i a a the shortcut a hates e do thingfli deli marijuana an tax is de c the la a a schools or to tax the rid mi pecan tax the tea her people what hell hat om their house or neither house cannot sabin far if you shake your had to si makes intelligent that doesn't make in is a and a dupes from the valley struck an nineteen ninety seven veer this allot it meansthat your smart according to the media by the way that that sketcher she is wearing the tax the rich sketcher he can buy it for fiftyeight dollars on her website exciting news from the tax the rich crab in aliases again the interjectional coalition is all and the entire media are in support of this this is why for example charges blow has a piece of the near times again his name is apt his column absolutely blow they are they are awful universally has it in entire piece of then your time stake called an involving moral highground in the israel goes war what is the evolving moral highgroun retell the first who paragraphs tell thewhole story the terrorist attack by compass against is rallies was horrid barbaric an and excusable what is happening to ionized citizens of goo is also horrid and not a justifiable response to derris to tax ah sartalliin against come is the same thing as comas by the way including tons of open civilians i know this part of the story that nobody wants to tell is it is ugly and it suggest the there a lot of gotten civilians who actually kind of love comas but there is songs footage during the actual terrorist assault worst attack on to since the polices of tons of gowan civilians were tong about kids is young is fourteen fifteen years old running into jewfish areas and stealing things or participating in the violence but according to charges blow there is moral equivalence why does he have to maintain the moral equivalency again it seems kind of weird why is it that advocates for black lives matter which is supposedly a civil writes organization are protesting on behalf of one of the worst civil writes in humonrites violators on plan earth why they doing that again interjectional coalition that is all that matters and the media continued to lie on behalf of this interjectional coalition across the west see be news disgusting we all know at this point it has been thoroughly and completely demon that the hit om gaze hospital either killed five hundred people cause did not hit the hospital hit o parking lot or two that even was done by these rallies who is done by papist mean his policy hod there is audio tape e played yesterday on the show of comas operatives talking to one another in sang o boy that was of was not it or yes it was but it isn't matter here is how seas news covered it who is still seals fault the but your mouth to goo mouse explosions at the o on the hospital is still a smoking bred which should have been a safe haven has turned into a living nightmare to beinsactin a we left our home to come here this woman says we thought it would be s but then we got bond the angelica church which runs the hospital has said it was struck before by is really rocket just four days earlier injury for members of stanspeaking to said ten futile time a doctorate all at says israel army sent to warning to a vaccinate of facility i sin forty eight hours before without explosion again now post you may notice that then air clip is there anything mention fact that it was a palacinian atomic g had rocket it fell in the parking lout of the hospital not a single thing there just ignoring it the pretending the story does not even exist that pretending the truth does not even exist the scumbags the media truly have blot on their hands because it turns up it turns out when you spin up terrorist supporters with lies about the blood liable news it turns out people die because of that the media do not care christian iron for another come orphan here was yesterday promoting the idea the as the idea f lying under these circumstances christian iron poor disgrace to journalism now the issue is as he said no matter what this any a now what you say a in in the beginning before there was any out o put investigate there was an investigation and they came to that conclusion in ignited the fatwa her this they have seen many time and because nim sorry to say this because in the pass is really idea has not been honest about what actually happen look attuning aqua that i know that we cannot talking about it they always her saterenabuapla which was a situation where as unclear who shocherin ablapla and then admitted that was these rallies these rallies in any case christian iron poor doing doing camasses work for them because this is what for memory many members of the mans fret to the b b s which is absolutely worst on this the be s is bad on this sort of stuff the by see in grin the antisemitism's unbelievably strong which is why seven separate journalist from the b b s in last week alone have had to be fired or suspended because they posted on public media about how they were in solidary with moss does it matter here was a busy journalist saying the attack had to be israel even not clearly was not israel this really military has been contact it for comment and they have said that they are investigating but it is haw to see what else this could be really given the size of the explosion other than and is ray strike or several strikes because what several tar rockets being flied outs of gas we never see explosions or the scale we might see half a dozen may be a fetal people being kills ja her such r honestly i ad but why they doing this why why the answer is twofold one actual antisemitism there has been in overt attempt particularly by members of the left since nineteen s sty seven israel victory in the sixty war there is been attempt by the left to basically convert israel into the world's big bad that was originally pushed by the movie union which was attempting to create a pan arab nationalism to use against the united states in the aftermath of israel victory in the sixty war that is the get politics of this sort of antisemitism but there is also this latent pro racism that has existed prertictarly in triton for a very long time an nor the to heard sort of at no centric exoticism that exists in written or what the helix is but it is pathetically antistatic and when you promote blood bibles lay the bee see routinely does it costs actual lives well get to that in just one second because the consequence of the media lying about ale the suited that they are so doing obviously on behalf of again that same interjectional ideal the west is bad the west is colonials israel is bad israel is colonies all these things are the same wrapped them into an interjectional ball and then that will be your new movement in ever a you have wondered whether the interjectional movement is dangerous yes they are extremely dangerous argue me light idea logically dangerous mean people will get killed dangerous an just a second we will talk about the reverberations of these lies and the interjectional coalitions garbage an just one second first the world is obviously witness taints attacks by homos terrace against innocent israel civilians the most recent attack was massive hit was devastating killed over fifteen hundred is really men women children babies thousands more been injured two hundred our being held hostage after been kidnaped the sworn enemy of israel in the swill stop in nothing to slaughter every last new obviously

is the bad i in the world an israel is just a spiarpoint for left that sort of stuff lends a lot of credent and credibility to the worst people in the world which is presumably why according to the wall street journal the situation in the middle's has got in significantly worse quote the explosion at a goa hospital tuesday night set off a wave of protests across much of the mideleast and the broader muscle world me of them calling for death to israel there's a shock now doesn't matter by the way that of palsinans killed their own people here and then lied about it then men re at all by the way i i love t it that people are still repeating the casual see casual the statistics brought to them by the comas health ministry a literal lying terrorist organization tells you how many people

to weeks ago the comose within minutes can tell you exactly to the person how many f it were killed their ages and who they were or their lying to you and the media are credulous morons or there nitrous credulous morons the actually are close procomas in any case all of this has now exploded in the middle east anger nevertheless bread quickly through the region according toe later journal riots broke out near the scaly amass an jordan where millions of palsnian diaspora live and which stay diplomatictizes both israel since the nineteen nineties by the way when try t the my the palcinian diaspora understand that is not correct transjordan was part of brutish mandate palestine transjordan is filled with palcinian airs because brutish panda palatine included jordan around eighty thousand furnish protesters ascended on the we rally consists an istonbooll some attacking security forces and antemptingtans or the compound according to authorities get not a shock there turkey has been a long time ally of comas they famously attempted to send a flotilla of weaponry into israel which ended with israel having to way raid the flotilla and that of course was then blamed on israel in iron thousands of people across several cities demonstrated including at the french and brutish how masses that of courses windup by the baronial government a lot of banians are not anti israel there such a sort of weird iron in he mddleast which is that in places where the government is the most anti israel the population tens to be the most can of apathetic or okay with israel baby a on and in places where the government is least anti israel which would be salty arabia the population hates israel its kind of its kind of interesting there are chance from protestors in a rock or on on tuesday night calling for the death of israel some governments turkey and jordan have declared days of morning at the governments themselves booking for an offal said they can please their domestic constituency they declared a day of morning on behalf of a hospital master that did not happen number one an number too was caused by palistonians policy hot if it did all this sispropagantistic and the the media did its best to promote all of that meanwhile seaman is is having fund there doing their mostly peaceful protest thing again fiery but mostly peaceful and iron jordan it we tho get the e hundreds e people go the i them cute the teen time stop story say and if the the what bit of an inure the the cure talk the h me e or mostly best i ma sure there trying to no break can amasses but it is mostly peaceful as well know this is the way that it works just the backsides eateries which cause to billion dollars and property as fiery but mostly peaceful is what is happening over there meanwhile jordan forge minister imonsophati said on weekday thatched do not care whether is lomicehod bomb a hospital they do not care about that at all instead actually there is deep skepticism duo nobody is buying that narrative in this part of the world every one here believes that israel is responsible for it these rally armies things not as be honest try and fight any onewhas been believe it in this part of the world i wonder why that is could that be because you've had generations of a of lies teaching the news are these scum of the earth and the they ought to be exterminate me maybe it is that may maybe it is because of that meanwhile all these rub nations which cares deeply about the palistinians in gosh they care deeply about them to we are up to twenty one moslemnations the have express solidarity wit the palistonians in gossip a a grandson of zero have offered any any refuge assistance any in fact crypt's for minister can not yester and said absolutely not when er not can take any refuges said there is pressure on egypt and other countries in the regions to absorb refuges from gossip egypt refuses on principle the principal is thatyou have to keep people in warszown that is the principal it is a helluva a main principle that you have found there or maybe you do not want the palistinian refugees in egypt because you are afraidtheye canary stabilized orpine as they have routine we stabilized regimes ranging from jordan lebanon again lebanon is a cabin point of what happens when palstoni refuge gs and their leadership on mass after a country lebanon used to be a fully functioning christian country be was known as the parts of the midaeleast it is now a trashy that would be the reason why egypt does not want a let in palistinian refugees from the gossipstrip that is the factories instead there just in to keep them in wars on and encourage them the stand directly over terror tunnels to shield the terrorist meanwhile it is its making i love is nations in themiddleast our apparently urging their citizens to evacuate lebanon multiple countries have learned their citizens inside lebanon they shouldimmediately evacuate as cesbelaw ramp its attacks on israel northern borders riders has report that vessel official hasshema safhidine give speech to thousand of support on wednesday claiming the terror scruple with thousands of times stronger tan it was i the past threatening israel and the west meanwhile tons of nations including by the coat and say arabia urging people to leave lebanon asap well that is that is interesting s the there willing to taken people from lebanon in saury but not from the gossipstrip the fat fascinating fascinating stuff meanwhile the idea is noun no that residents of twentyeght towns along he is real u an on boar needed to evacuate your talking bout thousands and thousands people be evacuated thanks to a husbela iron is camping up its activities in various parts of the world according to the jrusalem post the of military basin arc intercepted several drones targeting rocks all sad air was trust has forces at also sod en several other facilities in arc drones were intercepted soon is is sort of exploring around the edges now the reason that upon is exploring around the edges is because of the open question about jobiton and this is really what it comes down to does jobidon have deterrent power does he have the power to return iron from getting in that is the real question he is been saying lot f the right things but does anyone trust that joins going to pills word that cusbelass are firing tens of thousands of rocs at israel that the aircraft carries station the middle east will do something about that that is an open question jobidon's record up until now has suggested that he will do little to nothing which is why there is much tension in the region if the united states were strong and muscular it would lessen the chances of a serious regional war because everybody in cushat would know we step out that lone we a nay at clock the mouth en lose powerful military force the history of the world but because everybody sort of suspects that jobidon is a bluffer that is why everybody is on tenterhooks right now that is only exacerbated by some of the language that jobidon has been using sobidon is saying some of the stuff that is correct yesterday obviously he was in israel and he says that he knows tat the hospital attack was not in fact israel here ere is join yesterday ah a boy eyes is i issei sssiiisy oiiooalii icily jobidon is not project strong he does not he sang some of the right things there hes still projects weakness not only in his person but in some of his approach and just when second will get to more of that this is one of the biggest problems in the idlest right now is that when america is credibly dangerous the mildest tends to go silvan when dona trump was president the middies was quite silent why he is everyone was afraid that crazy dud was get a beatthesh led out of them that is what the were afraid of with dona true thous he is entire strategy but when it comes to hoiden everybody is kind of suspicious that may be he stuffy t as about standing alongside longtime allies maybe the mean lot since they did cut and run from afghanistan for example tit is more on this momentarily first

jobideing makes were sounds he makes weird sounds consistency and projection of strength are not merely about military posturing meaning make moving aircrafterrs people actually have to believe in your threat the the word the phrases credible threat not just threat the join visiting israel yesterday he express to sympathy an that he warned israel not to repeat rage field mistakes after nine eleven now in the sort of language is paternalistically weird it is strange what is even talking bout rage field mistakes is it it is now october nineteenth the sack happened on october seven that means it has been nearly two weeks since fifteen hundred sues were slaughtered men women babies two hundred hostages being held underground by the worst terrace on the planet israel has yet to do a grounding person even by the way for all the tome bow there is no electricity and water in gaze the reality is that because israel only provided ten percent of the electricity and water in gaze there still is in many parts of the godship electricity and water and israel providing that snout where are these rage field mistakes that biding is talking about what exactly as he warning of other then it is hat could get out of jail free card if a stray boy hit is the long target and the he in claim the i was a rage field mistake this it this is this dumb language from the president i understand a levy medicals understand you cannot look of what has happened here to mothers your fathers your grant currents sons others children even bags not scream out for justice juntas must be done but i push o this fa you field at rage do not be consumed by after nine even were inragein the states wake but justice and got just us o made mistakes ism wondering what exactly his referring to there in israel is not invading a rock i noticed they are talk about going caliber my into the area run by the exact terrors scrub that actually murdered all of it citizens were that was tong mut again the question of one's weakness is still first and foremost on a lot of mines that is particularly the case when in the middle of all this the by administration sad it will ease sanctions against companies that trade an oil produced in venisuala sovenisuala is an ally of on which is the sponsor state of the terrorist attack vennisuala is run by an evil dictator in and nicholas maduro anta jobidon is a tempting two tell then is walk because he wants to lower oil prices before the election and that of course is creating a feeling among a lot of america worst enemies that a now if the got leaver is on tome oil then maybe you cannactually no shift the president of the united states here hat going will do anything to keep the oil price is low which is not a place you on a be if you if you feel a can lovers mosh powerful country in the world that means of the president is projecting weakness and that is a real problem meanwhile anti feminism it continues to spread incredibly fast around the globe there's an attempted scynegogu burning in berlin the other night according it to the b b c barman's jewfish community has been shaken by two petrol bombs thrown in to synagogue but a spike an antiseptic incidents in some european countries police said two people through burning bottles filled with liquid and what was described as attempted arson chancellor off shoals is expressed outrage at the attack beans broke out elsewhere n berlin overnight during anti israel protest a emergency services were pelted with bottlestones an fireworks protestors set barricades a light in a number of streets and one demonstration close to the brand in burgage in solved seven hundred people that came as ctesbela was calling for eight day of rage gan european anti feminism on the rise largely in the radical muslin community that was been that is been imported into into rope over the course of last few decades meanwhile a synagogue was attacked in spain as well man's called the manila synagogue atom there is tape of of u see people rushing down the three ton the sight on t tack the place are going to try and stop this in france eight french air ports were forced to evacuate for security reasons in eastern france strasborg gaerparts as it was evacuated to boy threat antes their part western french was evacuated for the same reason the ports of benefits and to loose in the southwest little in the north and the onion in the south east set operations were resuming following a police operation all were evacuated earlier on wednesday because of at boy scare in tunisia a synagogue that is not in use but did contain torrisrols was burned here is video of that happening this is obviously of footage that is released bi fans of the of the arsonists that a can tell with the with the incredible strip to the incredibly wonderful strains of a arabia language music happening it the beautiful beautiful staff in spring music as they burn a snegogu hundreds of tunetcians according to the alumina reportedly burnt the a coma synagog on tuesday evening according t videos and images posted on victor is my favorite part of the li about the state of israel that if the state of israel ceased to exist do not worry the news be the a great in muslin countries yah i believe that you are totally right guys that that is going to happen the synagog does not currently function as a place of worship because om there is no josh community because again they were expelled the is post of the morning after so much of the synagog complies burnt wit tragic grade spread on the walls of the synagog rooms which remained intact they they shattered all of the they shatter all the art inside the ynegogu again there is another were deadly terrace attack in may against the let creepy synagog on the island of jerboa as well that that haven a few months ago that they love yes in this particular region of the world that is why its shocking when they when when a terrascrupt killsbunch of news in everybody reacts by blaming the news that is that is we we holdall be shocked is because every one over there weave ben told by the westermedia is a moderate liberal minded person would be perfectly at home in new york or defrost or chico or anywhere else on provide no threats the west whosoever they are all wonderful liberal minded people there just a few bad apples but actually therefore munch peoplewho think truly evil things and the their people are terrace there is distinction between the two people who believe truly evil things that is not a death penalty offense but pretending away the problem is not going to solve the problem nor is it going to give israel wherewith all to defend itself or the west the herewith all to defend itself again the west constant belief in it in its own narcissistic centrality is is truly incredible and meanwhile the republicans continued to do our publicans do which is out run directing to predicate themselves in the ball simultaneously that that that is the thing that they are continuing to do now you might think it this time that we would have some you know serious politicians on the scene unfortunately this is a america we do not do that sort of thing around here the a the speakership of the house representatives is still very much up in the air him cordon who was a the person who was going to run aftersteetsclis remember karma earthy as ousted by mandates for n u they they thrumming earthy and here plan was to and again concessions but they thrumming earthy because it had to be done could the establish i do love that the word establishment in republican parents now just means people who do not rant at walls but that's literally what it means but if you rant at the wall then your then your anti establishment but if you do not rant at walls an you are probably part of the establishment it has no ideological haunt content by the way the word establishment has no actual policy content if you are pall ran and you want deep cuts two the social security medical medicate that are driving media's national debt you are an establishment ring but if you want to increase spending if you are big spending your republican you are also an establishment ring if you are a socially conservative republican my sense sorry to say you are an establishment ring also if you are a socially liberal m ember of the republican caucus that chrisenon ha you are an establishment rhino if your hawkish on for policy lens gran your an establishment rhino but if your kind end dovish john huntsman hell that also an establishment rhino unit the word just means whatever people wanted to met in these days what it means is you are not sufficiently loud or something or you got a thing done if you hat a thing done that is evidence you the other side if you got thing done says while key my earthy had to be ousted done matter that by the way any speaker of the house is can have to get exactly the same kind of deals that kemicarthy did because i know this is hard hard to believe but believe it or not there is a democratic senate and a democratic president and it does not matter what house built you pass that does not make it through the senate orbs the president or get passed but it does not matter they you ere to to mac earthy because they are excellent excellent plan was in anyway they there to we my earthy then they hadn't internal election between steeve scores who is the husemajorty win and him word in the head of the house over si committee i both guys i know both guys both good guys both ton may good speakers scores one the internal lection one thirteen an ninety nine then they look fine we will go forward as united frons except they don't have the votes for sales because all takes his peeling of fourepublicans not voting for scores in order for him not it be come the speaker he wit through he is ism not doing this this is garbage turning my life nope him jordan is of a fine you fine all to its him jordan was on on the first ballet he him up twenty votes short on the second ballet he came up twenty two votes shorts with seven republicans voting for scores five voting for a earthy three for lee elder one voted for john banner by the way who did all the democrats vote for taken jeffreys this is all going absolutely astonishingly well because it turns out that again if being establishment means that you run directly into trees and kick herself in the ball simultaneously the republicans are doing an amazing amazing job on the one hand you have the grope moderates and in new york districts who are deeply afraid that if him shorten is the speaker of the house that they are going to basically lose their seats on the other hand you have the freedom caulis which is trying to be principled in some ways but refusing to acknowledge reality in others you can see you see the the battle happening inside the republican caucus because nonwall acknowledge the actual reality which is the incentive structure is exactly the same the fractures caucus certain cuts will be made you are not can get everything u want democrats r in the senate in the wite house deal with it sorry that is the reality and i know the a lot of people in my particular industry who spend all day and all night telling you that you can have the moon you cannot it's not how the game works it'll tell you hare the republican strict for principle i promise you it'll tell you he they come up short ism happy to tell you that what they could not get done also i live in a world called reality world and in reality world republicans arcane get everything they want because they have a cakes that is only two hundred twenty one seats and a minority in the senate and not the presidency in any case here is one grope moderates represent o dona bacon he he was boasting yesterday that jordan was headed for feet quote's fight to the dead likely and we will not let off there tactics angered us the harassing our spots even join hindebrickwall which by the way seems to be the case in the first vote for jordan twenty republicans defected the second vote twenty two republicans defected meanwhile chippy a representing actually trust member the freedom caucus chips really good guy would make a great speaker but would never be elected speaker because again many republicans our two left wing for that chippy inhere is talk now about democrats going with republicans to empower the speaker proton trick mac henry because there dis function they have to go to the democrats be what what concessions can we make to use we can have a functioning house here is chiprubbing what the heller doing guises what is this never in the history of this institution never to the best to not out have we ever appointed a speaker proem with boll powers of the speakership without having alert any duly ale the speaker we have not done that the best on out yo do that would be playing or games with such an important position as third an line to the the press the we should do our jot's the speaker the constitution says that any move to do otherwise is contrary to the constitution and would do ginormous damage to not just republican part but the house representative and i violently pose any ever do then before thou ink chiproyis exactly correct but that is where it maund up if republicans cannot actually agree amongst themselves to elect a speaker even if they have disagreements with the speaker from time to time and his just stupid first rule of politics do not interrupter opponentswither make a mistake second real of politics do not run directly into trees while kickingyourself in the balls republicans seem dedicated to breaking both rules i dogs tat the rest of the show is continuing right now we will be joined online by all beer he is the founder and president of united hostile which is an emergency response service in israel if fore not a member become member use coach chipper a checkout for two months free and all angel plans pick that line in the description and join us

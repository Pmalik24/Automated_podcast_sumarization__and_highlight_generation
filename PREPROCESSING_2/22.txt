jo bison believes he is going to win the twenty twenty four election based on one simple idea donate trump is a sic fog gave is literally what he says behind closed doors according to politico and the language here is not mine the language here is jobidons according to politico president bison has reputation for salty language behind closed doors but it nearly slipped down n public during his speech o valley forge last month to mark the third anniversary of the canary six insurrection animated and angry he divided donate trump and is followers for drawing glee from political violence he apparently came very close to saying what a see blate button private he does not actually stop short the president has ascribed trump to long time friends in closiates as a sic fog who delights in others misfortunes according to three people who have heard the president use the profane description according to one the people who has spoken wit the president by recently set of trump that he was a ask this apparently is the way that jobidon thanks of donate trump and because of that jobidon simply cannot believe that donate trump is actually poise to win the twenty twenty four election now here is the reality by the pulling data donate trump is poise t win the twenty twenty four election if he just look at the trump verses bison pulling right now what you will see is that dona trump actually has a lead donate trump has a lead over jobidon every poll except for one in the last couple months has trump up pretty solidly the latest pull comes from signed and i has donate trump up forty nine forty five over jobidon if don't trump line the popular vote for the first tampon's re publican won the popular vote in two thousand for he is going to win the election it is that simple he came close twining the election even losing the popular vote by seven million votes he is also leading big in states that he lost last time particularly in states georgia the latest pulling from georgia has donate trump up eight per cent over jobidon and donate trump is running dead even in wisconton donate trump is running well ahead apparently in michigan not only that jobidon is failing as as a mental force he just he is spent he is spent and and he is begun to my in to the this that he is been telling for years to the plonker just repeats the mad hassium nobody feels he is in control of the world situation nobody feels like is in control of himself it is real problem for him for example two days ago he called up the family of an army specialist who had just been killed by agrarian proxy forces in cordon and in the middle of this call to the parents he at tempted to do this rotten the he is been for a long time where he he demonstrates sympathy not by actually sympathizing but by talking about his own experiences which by the way is actually not how you do sympathy typically speaking an unfortunate had been to lota she a households right people have died and you going to visit the grieving family members and when people are grieving the last thing they want here is about your grief experience if donate tempting they particularly want hereabout because they are in their own grief experience in indicates jobidon does that routeing both does not just do that he also whin h his talking to the families of service members have been killed he lies to them he lies them at his son beau he is been doing this for years at this point to the point where it is no longer excusable in this particular phone call which was take by the atlantes journal constitution he suggests that his son you died in a rock which of course not true bourdon tragically died o brain cancer years after a turning from a rock which abide has been telling this fib for long that he may believe it at this point here he was o e know e eririrhe in the the the parents overcome with the motion when the president reveals how their daughter will be nerd er river a oh wow t fee he do not know that an thereat story about not is not true he keeps telling it over and over and over and jobidon is prevaricator and he lies a lot but the fact is that it may be if he believes it sent whatever the whatever the symptoms of his mental decline they are not going to bow well for his reelect effort again when you look at the state by state pulling downed from his well ahead in what used to be as swing state of shies up by eleven points in oho right now he is up as i say solidly in georgia he is running dead even according to new fox newspole in wisconsin it is hard to see frankly how jobidon recovers his standing among various groups in the united states a durian impulse shows that jobidons job approvalrating is standing at thirty eight per cent thirty eight peace sixty two percent disapproving he is under water with every one eighteen to thirty forgets he is underwater s a thirty five per cent approvalrating among people or eighteen o thirty four among white voters he is at thirty four percents approvalrating even among people of color forty five per cent approvalrating the are terrible members four jobidon his cannon from is how can he possibly win the selection now his strategy in twenty twenty was changed by one simple fact and that is the change in devoting rules as have discussed at hassium the fact is that voter turn out in twenty twenty was leagues higher leagues higher than it had been any time in the recent past the voter turn out in that election was extraordinary you saw he jump in election turn out of at lee almost ten per cent is a sixty seven per cent voter turn out in twenty twenty how is the highest level that the united states had experience in arms motor turn out since nineteen hundred basically mean that that that is an insane voter turn out why because they changed all the rules because all the rules change when it came too voter turn out e cause suddenly your gone a vote three months in advance and jobidon was going to deploy the entire democratic party apparatus to rive at your dower pick up your ballet and mail it in for you and the entire state apparatus in swingstayes pennsylvania is going to change that you could vote early and and vote by mail again sixty percent of democratic voters in to thousand twenty voted by mail when about thirty five per cent or thirty per cent of re publican voters in twenty twenty voted by mail and your trobidon still only squeaked by that was a close election you can run up the scorning places californium in new york is people hate trump in terms the popular vote and terms of the actual elect total college vote this selection in twenty twenty was decided by an extraordinarily low number o vote you are talking about twelve thousand votes in gorge your tongue at may be eleven thousand lots inarizona you are talking about something forty thousand votes in wesconsin am at eighty thousand votes in pennsylvania is are not big numbers mean by any striction the imagination the are topic numbers well get to more on this in just one second first if you are me there is not a day that goes by thy do not call or test some one you care about my friends at pure told are making it easier and more portable to connect with the most important people in your life pure take if you phenomenal coverage on america most dependable five you network it is the same covered and love but for

company you can be proud to spend your money with again pure talk dot come slash a pro god check them outright now pure talk dot come slash pure get fifty per cent off your very first month could dona trump reverse that then not only could he it seems yo probably will and the reason i say it is because jobidon is not going to duplicates the voter turn out numbers of twenty twenty and let you be clear about this president win narrow elections and then lose votes between election one and election to ten not to win reelection the only president who has lost votes in the modern era from his original election to his reelect effort is barokobama and to one that is the only one if you lose votes bet tween your first selection your second election typically lose and that is probably what is going to happen with jobidon given the trends the is perticularlytr because jobidon has decided that he is basely going to a bands in blue collorwide voters the democratic party has been taken over since twenty twelve by this vision and it is to find both parties actually we have talked about a lot on the show there is a is ion that was promoted by the media and by the bomb campaign in twenty twelve and that vision was in everlasting democratic majority for ever and was going to be demographically based the idea was there is a rising minority coalition thawed eventually become a democratic majority in the united states and they would never lose another election could bands in white voters increasingly and could build the coalition on the basis of minority voters and college educated white ladies that was the coalition that barokobamarode victory an twenty twelve despite being a deeply in popular president at the time but that relies on really heavy turn out from groups that very often do not turn out at those rites everybody red twenty twelve as it as a new then line year instead and turns out the twenty twelves exceptional in terms of voter turn out for a wat while verity of grows because baraokobamos a singular political character ut that cannot be duplicated bite killer canton or bite jo bison again the only reason jobidon one an twenty twenty is because all the rules of voting change and people marginal voters lot prepense devotees people who would not show up to the polling place if it were a normal lection simply filled out their ballade and resending it in because bovid that is all that happened in twenty twenty she go through some the stature because it demonstrates what exactly jobidon is hoping for who he is unlikely to each event and also explains his current political strategy which is not to swivel back toward the middle to trying win those white voters in the suburbs to win white voters and rural areas thou suppose tore jobidons pitch by the way is that he was supposed to have a rural white appeal that other candidates in the democratic party simply did not have and instead he seems to be duplicating the twenty twelve mama campaign but he's not barocobama and he is not con tot get the the changes in rules they got in twenty twenty he seems to be increasingly trying to cater two again this new vision of what the democratic party base should be right now the important in n understand is that non white voters represent about forty per cent of all democratic voters as a huge number forty per cent of all democratic voters are not white cane now the only reason that matters is because if the priority for the democratic party is get that group of voters to turn out at very high rates that means that you are going to have to pander presumably to that group of voters and that group of voters tends to have views on many issues that are left of were jobidon traditionally has been the same thing happens be true the youth vote forty nine per cent of democratic and democratic leaning voters are under the age of fifty compared with just forty two per cent of republicans furthermore nineteen per cent of democratic voters are under the age of thirty compared with thirteen per cent of republicans the areas where democrats really outsole republicans minority voters and young people the problem for democrats is that those two groups of voters historically speaking have incredibly variable rates of turn out the white turn out rate in terms of voter turn out tens not to vacate all that much tents to be fairly stable but depending on who the candidate is for here various script i can wildly shift for example here is black voter turn out the united states by year since two thousand in two thousand there's fifty three percent black voter turn out in to thousand four was fifty six per cent in two thousand eight it was ha popping sixty one per cent and in two thousand twelve that was the year that barockobomal was able to swing an election he probably should have lost it was sixty two per cent and it was particularly located in swing states oho i brockobma one oho be s a heavy black voter turn out in oho but just proportionate two share of the populace then s something happen in twenty sixteen the number of vested back board historical friends the fifty six per cent of black voters ho voted in two thousand sixteen looked a lot the fifty six per cents o black voters o voted in two thousand four voter turn out went down filter client probably lost the election because of that and in twenty twenty there is a heavy effort to get out the black vote but the good news was there was not at much effort to get out votes in twenty twenty is i should quite easy to get out votes in twenty twenty by the with that also explains why the democratic party was pandering shard to the black lives matter movement because the idea was if you panned a really hard to be alarm then they will act as a voter turn out machine in favor of jobidon it is why everyday once soft on the riots in the middle of the summer in twenty twenty in the democratic party and again voter turn out did rise again fifty nine per cent black voter turn out in twenty twenty which looks more the barokaba ma sixty one per cent voter turn out for black america in twenty of eight then it dos likely twenty sixteen numbers for killer canton now here is the question do you think black voters are going to turn out the we that hey did not twenty twenty for jobidon an twenty twenty four on look that does not it his black voter turn out number at me right now among people o color jobidon is pulling at forty five per cent it is are not toe numbers for jobidon that is his job approval rating and not only that there is no personal illusions in anyway ship per form from people of color in the united states toward old white man obit on that is not fighting is that voter turn out number likely to go down or is it likely to go up the answers it is very likely to go down in the twenty twenty four election e get to more on this in just one second first think about the joy you feel when you treat yourself and buy something new slipping into a new pair of lounge where it is a simple but delightful experience for me hit is the feeling i get every time i put on mommy john mommy john lounge where is cosy enough to use as sleep where finish enough to wear for a quick stroll to the coffee shop you will not even look o just rolled out about even if you probably did the lounge where is guarantee to fit perfectly it features tom

when into business go chick this ut right now shop mommy john get twenty per cent off your first order right now at mommy john do come lashes if twenty per cent for limited time an mommy john dot cam slash men that is mommy john do calm slash bends he sign forty tails and that is not the only probe for jobiton the youth vote is something that he heavily counted on really heavily counted on in twenty twenty now the youth vote in the united states people eighteen to twenty nine those votes really heavily vacillate based on election cycle let us go his tonically here what the youth voter turn out rates a historically in the united takes wherein to twenty nine every election cycle you hear the youth are finally on to turn out this is the year where we mobilize the youths and the youth turn out swing us to victory rock the vote in all of this can an nonsense i a here is the youth voter turn to by were in two thousand forty per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty nine voted whore eligible devote two thousand four that number jump to forty nine per cent is fifty one per cent in to thousand the right for brokomama which was the year that every young person voted because man o man hit is transform even and all the stuff that dropped two forty five per cent into thousand twelve which is one of the reasons whybrokobama one feu are absolute votes in twenty twelve than he did in two thousand eight in twenty sixteen it went down even from there it was back down to forty four per cent i young voters were not turning out for brokomama two another did not turn out for killer canton but the voter turn out rate for young voters in the two thousand twenty election was fifty five per cent fifty five per cent tat is a massive spike a spite from forty four per cent of young eligible voters in two thousand sixteen two fifty five per cent of young eligible voters in two thousand and twenty now the last time any the last time young voters turned out that way was wait for it nineteen seventy two in nineteen seventy two fifty five percent of young voters turned out the turn out for georgemon govern who promptly lost forty nine states to richer ninon young voters are not obviously where the mentality of of most america is randingthat mentality of most america is not the same as mentality of young voters but jobiton is looking a the stay and he realizes the things he needs heavy minority turn out heavy youth turn out is he sing able to duplicate anything twenty twenty he is thinking not but his teen instead of saying it'll say we need to let scrap the stratatue you blow up the strata you mean to look at the numbers and we need to in stead focus unwinding suburban white ladies right which is what they shall mean to do folks on ring suburban white women blue colewort is in respelt states that is where jobiton really should be puttinghis effortright he should write now stop looking at the brokobon twenty twelve motel and should star looking at the billclintin nineteen ninety nineteen ninety six model i which is why youwould imagine if they are smart later in the summer what you'll see from the democratic party is therein a shift tart industrial policy well for policy and abortion and that will be the main state of the campaign if they get wise if they are not wise then job is gin a continue to pander to the most left wing parts of his base because he is looking at these numbers the same is you an ire looking them right now and he is seeing lower voter turn out among young minorities for voter turn you among youth and minorities rather he is he is seeing that and what can he do well he can sure pander he can sure pander and that is why there is all o this hart burn over for example israel ware against commassand gaze it is why the democratic party seems signally unable she sounds off on the on the southern border despite the factual that is a burgeoning huge problem not burning i real real time huge problem for the united states now the problem for jobidon of course that if you hands your left wing bays you're also alienating that center that you need jobidon is really hoping that the only way the he can hold that coalition together is just ta hate true trumps jerk trumps this is why as have said done trump's election strategy is very simple he should go to the basement and he should state there jobidon has an unwieldy coalition that is very unlikely to stick together job is nothing to get the levels of voter turn out that got in twenty twenty absent loved absent beaten absent the ability to go after these sitting president annal true doll trump should go to the basemen and he should stay there and he will win if he does those things is the only thing in the end that jobidon thinks he can win on really is not even the policy he thinks we can hold together this coalition by hook or by crook with gum an and sticky tape if he can do that and in king he's point od trump and comes sic fa than that's win him the election that is what that is the difficult proposition jobidon is not any wining position in the selection cycle now the problem for the democratic party is that neither would any one else be because if jobidon were to be replaced on the ticket the question would be by whom and why would not that person faced the exact same electoral challenges as jobidon is currently facing if he but coma garrison place she is way worse she is not gong to get have your black voter turn out and not only that she isgingto alien at everybody she is super high in favorable ratings if it we somebody gavenusum they've a serious problem thymi shollabama apparently don't want it there stuck with widen and again as his presidency gets horse and as the symptoms of that presidents he become worse he is goes actually early enough be forced more and more to the radical left in the hope in the desperate hope that he can get the voter turn out on his side up that he can get people were forty percent propensity devote to fifty percent propensity devote by pandering to them which is why again we have been sang for a long time rare is the political genius in not closing the border just close the border there's more on this in just one second first there's something absolutely magical about reliving old film memories of my family when i sit down i hippie ism transported back in time the flickering images on the screen there more than just recordings the record how my family works how my parents grew up to be who they were thanks to legacy box these precious memories are at the touch of a button you can relive your own memories simply create your own legacy box filled with cam for tapes film reels pictures you'll get digital copies that can be easily enjoyed shared and organized magic legacy box is the world's largest digitizer we've hoped over one million families relive their wedding days chaotic child good sports and even those long road trips i love legs box have done for my own family a don for my parents done for my inlays by going to legacy stock am slash per you can enjoy fifty per cent off when you get started with legs box to day for learned time stop preserving your past and save i fifty per cent for legs bitstock come slash per to re visit and there special memories from repast that is legs bitstock come at slashapero its the best service in the business go check i out right now truly mass match will gift is well legs bocstoct come slash per if jobidon close the border the issue would be off the table for donate trunk but your bison can do it and that is a real problem because people are seeing the say for example there is a tape that is now emerged of a in legal emigrant is one of the elleglum bring to attack the police officer i is yon blade and who is release from police custody after assaulting a police officer and here is video of this person as he a marks at reporters leaving e midtown south precinct here is what a look i there he has flipping off the out flipping off ant reporters in is man i it's my land mi yon eoweweis else this i associate batoscy and there he is slipping off the idiot o gay even epic dams the mayor of new york is looking at this an sand we need deportation of criminal migrant rightmans pretty simple stuff who exactly is against deporting eking glemigrans fore not you are legally and wo are counting crimes here is epic dams the mar of new york and those maigres who i here because they want to bead of the medical dream that is i we say yesterday but those who all brain i lot i were to be examine i the lot that don allow us i to dealt them i because they you in mining acts cannot credit atmosphere we you want to being mines in it'll city but i the over woman number of miss in sin cedis i waited to have work to to vision or they determination and we need to be clear on the o get even democrats are starting to say this is too much rabbit the democratic party is a whole cannot abandon what they think is the minority voting base in the youth voting was which presumably is why there is a vote yesterday two in congress to deport illegal emigrants to commit do you i this seems are a pretty easy one you are here illegally and the you are driving trunk deporting you seems a pretty easy solution well the measure pass it passed two seventy for with to one fifty all one hundred and fifty votes against to deporting legal immigrants with a do i were democrat all of them in fact that represents a majority of the democratic caucus only fifty nine democrat joined republicans inviting to deport illegal emigrants we are caught d u i the bill would make people charged wit the do i and are in the us illegally automatically eligible for deportation and permanently in admissible as fox new's reports just last month and document ad migrant f malsalvidor who had been deported for separate tines was accused of killing a mom an a son in a carcrath that police sent involved call what exactly is the democratic logic here why exactly would not they vote to de ports people who commit d eyes in ere here illegally why not we let the chair of the progressive democratic caucus progressive congressional caucus in mum in the democratic cacao my promilogipo who not e let her explain but my colleagues on the other side of the isle have made it clear that they are not interested in sensible solutions just in sensationalism this bill is another example of that and i hope my colleagues will stop referring to people as illegals people are human beings they have different statuses some are undocumented if you want to say some are a legal but let us not call human beings illegal tired of that language i urge my colleagues to reject the spill an i yield back the balance of my time nay this is what the democratic party is now pandering to which is incredible i mean that's just such a signal failure by them they can even say we want more legal immigration into the country but see you soft want to port people a do eyes that is political malpractice and yen a majority of the democrats in the house voted against a bill to deport people who here illegally and have a do i that is insane that is totally insane by the way this also the reason why republicans are having trouble getting on board with any bill that allows more executive discretion with regard to the border they do not want be held responsible for jo bison interpreting that bill in the most absurd possible way to keep that border open to at infighting in the republican caucus right now about a border bill that can be brought up for a test vote apparently to day it is unclear what exactly is in the bill and we keep hearing from different republicans in congress they cannot rip on the bill until what is in it well how bout you cannot ask me to support the bill until i know what is in it because it seems to me that the status quail which is that jobidon should close the border given the authority concurrently has is perfectly sufficient for obit inclose the border the executive branch refusing to do its job is not going to be cured by the legislative branch passing more authority for the precedent the he can not do his job that is non can be the cure unless the legislator branches forcing the executive branch to actually enforce the law a new bill is not sterling in to change anythings will have to see what exactly is in that bill but the bott om line here is that jobidon is pandering because jobidon feels he means pander in order to win reelection and the same thing is happening with regard to the midaleast two separate stories yesterday that are both insane one story is that jobiton desperately de desperately was to make sure that there is not a broader war in the idlest well he is running join is willing to appeasoron up to the neck long as iron does not escalate into something resembling morefullskale war he is basically now playing the same game the barakobama in serious reelect trouble in twenty twelve played with delete medvidav who is then the stand in pressing and for vladmerpooten in russia you'll recall the brakbama sat with medvadav and he said it'll have much more flexibility after the election which was basically him begging medvadav tell photon not to do anything aggressive until after the election and after the election if he does something ingressive all probably came to him which by thewy is precisely what happen you will receive that barakobama is reelected in twenty twelve is ingrate in twenty thirteen and in twenty fourteen russia invaded crime and the donnas in youcrane and took it anbrakobaman ted basically nothing and you will remember that twenty fifteen barakobama drew a red line in syria and then promptly backed off the red line and handed syria as essentially a protector it of russia worked out beautifully for every one brakobama wins re election russia gets exactly what it wants well the same thing is now happening with on cording to politico intelligence officials have calculated the athanor does not have full control over its proxy groups in the mad least including those responsible for attacking and killing you us troops in recent weeks according to two you us officials familiar with the matter lets just get the straight we know that iron is giving the weaponry and the advisory council and members of the of the darg c are working hand in glove with his ball commas various groups the the woods force in each and syria the soothes an yeoman the aronians are coordinating with all of them the ponies are giving them the weaponry the artisans ware giving them the runny but the intelligence officials our trying to create the tranctunnel a way out of this terrible bind that bid is put himself in where his appeasement erring in that middleastern policy has i bold in the aronians to push on every single front jobiton does an action want to take harsh action against the aronians that would shut them up because he is afraid that then that will maybe spin into something broader or he is afraid mostly that his own basing to commandant him e realms in of he is not join is not afraid of a full sale worth rock the on is not going to go to fullskale war with he united states unless they wish to live under ground and i mean by that not live underground be dad they do not want that war pellet to more on this unjust one second first in a world filled with uncertainty you should be prepared for any possibility you need my patriot supply my patriot supply is your

go to prepare with bend comrade now that is prepare with ben dot con what jobidon really is seeking to o what is blow back from is own party from the radicals in his own party jobidon is afraid of losing michigan it is that simple he is afraid of losing michigan that a lot o muslin voters an michigan muslin voters an michigan are very unified in their hatred fiasco by pollingdata museums in michigan ore very much in favor of an appeasement orient by polling data an a plasma oriented policy toward states a on in the least and therefore jobidon is trying to find away to a pease now he is basically caponizing his tell officials to say that iron is not responsible for things that iron is clearly responsible for basically jobidon's white house is now a par agency for a on again that is not any sort shock brockobom did the same thing after he sign the iron nuclear deal then it became incumbent on the united states to pretend that tat was actually a good deal and the nomad ministration started to make noise vat how on was now moderate iron was now good evenest they pursued spreading terror all over the region o now jobidon is in the same bine well iron spreads tear over the region well iron is shutting down shipping in the reset well iron is in sensitizing who the attacks chipping and hesbelaw attacks on the north of iron and commons rock at attacks attacks on america troops in jordan well iron is doing all of that jobidons in tell officials r at iron mood they e anyway rely maybe rondos in have anything to do maybe it is all a bit going keying who knows yet probably the not in control that is a way for jobidon to escape having to take the harsh action that would be necessary to protect america lives if you not want fort operating basis for america troops in jordan make the case but fire in to leave them there and then america soldiers die you do not get to claim that the power behind the killing was not actually the power behind the killing as a way of boarding out which is what jobidon is doing right now according to politico the food's force an you lea branch of the march s is responsible for sending weapons in military advisers as well as intelligence to support malicious in reckon syria as well as the withies in remain the groups have varying ambitions and a cheddar which sometimes overlap but terror is not appear have complete authority or for their operational decision making well the disclosure means it might be particularly hard to predicts what actions the groups will take it could lower the chances of the us getting pulls into a direct confrontation with iron now again this is their way of escape wore juskonpretend the teething is nine happening rigger proton that iron is it responsible for all of this as to avoid escalation with iron because jobidon does not want to alienate muslin voters in michigan again that is what he is doing how we know tit isn't he is doing because that is what to day is all about he is visiting michigan to day he e visited michigan on thursday he met with members of the u a able you tot michigan democrats have press to widen for months to spend more time campaigning in their state according to the washington post but affix chaos have been worried about his visit being overchatowedr interrupted by demonstrators bison went to michigan he went to michigan am out it you a u he did not me with arab america voters but do not worry he is in to be sending his surrogates to say the quiet part out loud according barren john pier the white hose press secretary sheetstolds reporters on thursday senior began officials will travel to michigan this month quote to here directly from community leaders on a range of issues that are important to them and their families including the conflict of israel and gas last week jury shaves at rodriga as biding campaign manager travel tommichigan or so plan to meet with arab america elected officials and community leaders some refuse to meet with her again bison is trying to reach out specifically to michigan democrats because he is worried that he is going to loose michigan and then lose the election intireartical in political about this a quote president jobidon's attempt who block down many of t e young climate minded voters who supported him in the last election is running a ground over the war between israel and comas bison promised o be the climate president when he won the whorehouse four years ago but that message is in danger o being drowned out has many of those youthful environmentalists voice their frustration with biding refusal to demands in immediate sense fire and gaze s again this all comes it you would say is a normal person watching politics it'll ka who cars young people do not turn out to for the much anyway i just real direct your campaign energy toward more fertile grounds but the answers jobidon cant he is town popular and he now has to actor to all the crazies that is the reason why he has been hangings sunders hinderstaner passion water shouting out is matixlogan to might it are you i done got gonna that is why he is doing that not only that he and his team have been fairly overtly reaching out to versus groups in michigan tetter connected directly with prokomas forces according to the washington free began chuck rob reporting the biding campaign and a bin to shore up the presidents waning support among urban muscle voters dispatch campaign manager jury shovizrdrigas last week to me with an arab america activist as praise camps and refers to the president as quit genocide job rodrigas met fridge with arab america newspublisher stamp sibling in airborne michigan sublony who carries significant influence in michigan's arab community has an extensive history of praising terrorist groups in two thousand twenty two he urged arbs at a rally with trichina to leave to fight israel with quote stones and guns and praise the fedayeen this wo be is on a tears his referred to comas yes ball is freedom fighters the outreach comes as subsonic and other actives have called to boot the biding iris ticket over the administration's opposition to a sense fire in the commissar sublony told the a his meeting with rodriga's went very well and not a big shockright there because again jobidon is trying now to cater specifically to this radical voting base which bi by catering to the radical voting base by what you are making conflict and death the idly significantly wore likely if you shape america for policy bases on the needs of radical mole voters in michigan who do not you because you will not stop israel from defending its the that is likely make for some pretty bad policy one of those bad policies will discuss in just one second first it is ground today

where we can trust to groundhog more than scientists prick the climate at least you can trust enemy's razors to deliver a grachave every single time came meanwhile already hell as we have been talking about jobidons policy a cross them at least absolute garbage it is what is facilitated all of this from october seventh and beyond well now in an attempt to demonstrate that he is a both sides kind of guy his unleash an executive order that is supposedly targeting violent settler extremes so let us be clear if you commit a criminal act against palistinians in the west banks ay you beat up a palistinian in the wetback you will be arrested by the sailing military ta is under his rally military governments if you burn down places in the west bank and your new you will be arrested by the israel military governments there is in fact a legal structure for you in that particular area but what the by administration has been trying to do ever since october seventh is tried to establish a false moral equivalents between is rely settlers meaning people who live east of the called green line in judge and solaria the historic heartland of what used to be the kingdom of israel and here trying to establish a basic equivalence between those people and terrorists in the west bank and derris in the gosesstrip many of the titis statistic the you seeing about supposed settler violence are falsified not true not only that what the by administration is doing right here is making sure in the executive order that there is a very fuzzy line between actual criminal activity which every one should oppose and is daily state policy which includes allowing people to for example build additional bathroom in a from a now the bide administration has not taken a formal position on what exactly israel should legally be allowed to build on in areas that israel currently has military presents in there is never been any sort of a agreement between israel and the palistinians on which parts of the territory injury and solaria are supposed to be left for a palistinian say the has never been finalize who is separated under the solo cords into areas a b n c area's a were given over to the paliconian authority to govern that belike gene nobles many of the big arab cities aria bee was supposed to be mixed security control an area we was supposed to be sort of four further discussion but large up parts of of area s because they ere four for their discussion have been areas of major your settlement about six hundred thousand news who live injudaa and solaria of jobidon is attempting to now effectively suggest to moral equivalent between settlers it large and terrorists that is what he is doing with this executive order d he is opening the dor to he most radical members of his coalition to a sensually set up a boy cot of israel over disputed territories and these are disputed territories historically speaking many centers of jewfish settlement have been in these areas prior to the existence of the state of israel entire gushut'szhe own region for example would be a good example an the is obliterated during me forty eight war by the arab armies and then post sixty seven again halos area s been built back up by polish areas in any case biding sign and executive order on thursday declaring a national emergency notum whites on national emergency exactly allowing him to implement new measures to combat settler violence including sanctions can currently announced against four is rally extremists who carried out action viands in the west bank is according to the times of israel band set in the order the situation in the west bank in particular high levels of extremest settler violence force displacement of people on villages and property destruction has reached intolerable levels and constuty serious threat to piece security in abilities sobaselys as jordan saying the when terra o thank news it is because there is some crazy settlers n where time ligate small number people who commit crimes and the are then arrested and go to his daily gravel that that that is what he is saying again it is important to nosier that an extraordinary hull o violence exists against settlers in this area by palistinians a huge number of killings if happened or the past three years in these areas people driving on highways and palistinian arab derris just shooting them just murdering them that sort thing happens unfortunately fairly regularly in fact there are signs off the highway if you go to you d anomaly there signs off the highway big red signs and the say if you are a new or if you holding his rally passport and you drive into these areas we cannot protect you you may be killed if your palistinian and you drive to the junction in gushettsyon your fine you go for a comic offer if you are new an you essential e make a mistake and you drive into the wrong areas the west banker dad it is just that simple a but that of course not the view of hoiden who again brings everything back to the centrality of his daily policy this is one of the great lies that you see on both the far left an on the far right when it comes to foreign policy for any western state and that is no one has agency except for the western state it is stupid no one has their own interest nobody has their own priorities it is all just reaction to western activity when there is a terrorist attack against news on the border of gaze which again is not he west bank when that happens ut trolley because israel did something in the same way that everything when it comes to the united states for both the far left and the far right isolationist is blowback everything is blowback all the time or alternatively palistinians seventy five per cent palistinians in the wetback believe it israel should be obliterated eighty percent to prove the october seventh attack its what jobidon is doing here again is the predicate to possibility of much larger action against his reliability to live in historic jewfish land and that is in fact historictuish land trying to pretend that areas mentioned in the bible are some how historic palistnian land is very very weird in any case the the sort of message here is pretty clear is really officials had already told the times of israel last month that security estrone had taken a number of steps to clamp down on the phenomena of an individual settlers committing violence one of the things the e also seen is the israilin army will clear what is effectively a a tent village and then that will be declared settler violence the ten village does not have legal right to be there and much of this could be dispelled by simply one drive on route sixty through israel but nobody bothers to do that if her in the medius literally do not know what the all you are talking about but that is effectively what is happening right here judge join this all a a ploy to win to windows tin michigan that is all this is and that again is because hoiden is seriously weak position now jobidon is hoping that he is going to be able to recover and that that is going to come on the back of new economic reports the latest economic reports are now out and tom there's a jobs blow out in canary which is good obviously god for the country non farm part's expended by three hundred and fifty three thousand for the month that is about double what the dow one's estimate with going to be the unemployment rate remains that three point even percent which is near historiclothes job growth was widespread in canary let by professional in business services with seventy courthouse and get that is based on perception of inflation basically being curbed at this point according to verge matzo chief vestment officer keep private banks has make no mistake twas o blow out chobsuport it will vindicate the recent pestering by the fed which effectively ruled out and interest rate cut in march moreover strong organs combine with faster than expected wage games make suggest an additional delay in rate cuts for twenty twenty four if the economy holds up then presumably the federal reserve is not going to rush to cut rads which might reinvigorate inflation the question for the fed is going to be when do they start cutting rates again to a lot of the a lot of the speculation has been the the in to cot rates directly before the election than attempt to jog the economy to boostbidons reelect they are going to do that obviously if job growth continues to move at this pace then they are not going to have to do any of that and i am still skeptical of of the state of the america economy i still think that there is another shoe that is get to have to drop here ay you might just argue that basically prices and wages have now readjusted to the new normal that inflation meant threes more money in economy the the inflation boosted the prices but people were still spending ins that boosts the wage growth eventually and eventually reaches a new equilibrium e can make that case presumably there is still massive sustain unsustainable that packages tat n in to come do for the united states says have said before have ben sing the action for several years i do not actually think to what you are going to seen the united states a deep long lasting depression i think wat you are going to see is a long lasting economic stagnation into the future as we sort of reach that new normal of wage is and prices instead the regulatory i pacts of what jo bison has ben doing in a wive reedy of industries is going to come home and what you are going to see is lower growth rates basically bomb level growth rates probably for for the for stable future meanwhile the federal government continues just spend money out the a to there is a by partisan bill the got past over the course of last week that most people are ignoring it is just another seventy eight billion dollars who pairs thrown money out there why the hell mot good piece by somberly trestle over the walstrgernal talking about it is proving the gan that congress is in capable of anything beyond redistributing other people's money three hundred fifty seven representatives passed another seventy eight billion dollars spending bill do not go looking for a former spending discipline or any of the usual gulp catchwords in this blob the beatinghard of wednesday's package is too long time democratic priorities increasing the size of the child tax credit and it is availability to parent who do not even pay income tax basically this would be a redistribution of wealth to a largely single moms would kind of be the idea democrat's bit this roman horse in nineteen ninety seven when bill canton one a five hundred dollar child tax credit there go since then has been to increase its side n expand to eligibility many to the basis for a future universal basic income republicans wen from understanding the perfidy of government hand outs toping that catchabit of credit fore said income redistribution that is the basic idea here and again that is not totally wrong in the fact is that the child tax credit if you send money to people people have more money on the other hand if you visit sent fie work you are not actually allowing people to rise from poverty because it y actually require to rise from poverty in a permanent way is not the pendency on government while you actually require is a in income trajectory terebene a bunch studies about the child tax credit many of them conflict with one another there is one estimate from the university of chico reported by the cat institute that takes behavioral affection to account meaning people dropping out of the work force because the child tax credit is available or working fewer hours or whatever what they found is that a larger child tax credit without income requirements would lead one point five million workers to stop working eighty three percent of those would be the sole earner in the household which again those to be single moms then that effect of expanding the c t c would re use over all child poverty by twenty two per cent and would not reduce deep poverty fifty per cent of the poverty find that is say study estimated that any re auctions in poverty from a larger child tax credit targeted to families without market income would come at effysical cost almost double that of other stamps food stamps s again on those things that looks good on paper but is not particularly useful in practice and meanwhile the democrats move to the left is on every issue they if the paper to the outs and the outer apparently are very hot on the than stuff which is the only possible reason why you would see the democratic crazy resonating to what is the stupidest idea in human history that men and women are not separate categories of human beings are not actual biological distinctions sort of a made up thing in your own mind we have seen a spate in last twenty four hours of various authority figures preaching why children should be trains for example here is a aliform a general specialist name johnny also kenned talking to an eleven your old untamed an saying you are in the perfect place for purity blockers yes that is right we needs a puberty block a even years en this just this is mangle a top experimentation on children it really is doctor reason had a decision you are in the perfect place to start on blockers and she promises to begin giving her estrogen the male hormones in two years around thirteen that is what i think yes you are not going at at all breastbuds on the blockers but om you are nothing await until sixteen to start that of a lose received the blockers as in implant in her arm with all the bravery she could muster could feel littler lose held on time bravery o i sate o another chapter opening this young girls lis train young of this young boy being longhouse an syndrome by proceed by madam just just terrible stuff job terrible stuff in the fact that are treating tissue heroism by the parents some the kids fault the parents in the doctor just just vile meanwhile if teachers we're going to the clanswoman explain that they themselves do not know whether they are a girl or boy what seems to be a are requisite if you actually teaching a child should be to know whether your boyar girl since literally all my children can do it excluding the eight month old we cannot speak yet but definitely knows that he is a boy very my goodness these people i have a small dilemma o i am starting anew job i madam and it is a teaching job the kids t at are going to call me either mister or missus jam depends on what i want but i as it on by nabbing i do not know what the pa i a misses a be easier fin the kids but mister if e feel better but also to on try make tat i don't the the kind can do that ton what did i do when they ask me from a buyer girl i not n it is young kids my crosses e me for yours e and then i do not over want to go by jam or jam ray because they be reason in the i go by now i do not know o any advice to be grad i get the advices to seek mental health help from a from press hopefully a non work professional in e really they ad stuff meanwhile have a doctor name just i to misses in she will die on the hill that kind should have aces to irreversible pure blockers and exchanged surgeries over on tiptoe which is fostering the sort of stuff as a chines stop doctor and apparently the sate a takes needs to be consider what it considers child abuse of it is abusive ignoring the needs of your child when your child is telling you what they meed and engaging in behavior as a part that could lead them to unalike themselves over eighty per cent of trains on o time an themselves having thoughts about unliving themselves and over fifty per cent have actually attempted it in these individuals denying them care that we know is seeing is child of you is not life saving to here run mantedid have enmigtin that center vermin car strongly produce this great do not a u deny reflates for these that a lie that is not true i will die on this hell it is an than right a hemin right and it does not matter his e rushed ill never trust anybody who does their hair this ever ever ever ever somebody who has their his this not not visit visit dish the dislegasine in rational doctor the some you would walk an to it a cancer treatment from got your kids the hands of this person my goodness in is that is not the only story along these lines crazy story out of connecticut apparently students are in

increase my chances of being believe to day and i show way have the story of somebody who came forward and what happened to her next has never been told fact she is only bee known as jane doll i she remarkable in a few ways first of all she is young hes a tea nature she spoke out about one of the most powerful people in her state and in this case the story that the public not is very very different from what actually happened to her somebody the public story is the opposite of her experience of it b by chico america life a mara glass stay with us argon the in turn the person show us about to day was a nineteen year old in turn in the idohostate legislature and i she say be i am going further there is no ay to discuss what happened to her without talking about sexual violence take tat is a heads up frit is to follow in twenty twenty one this teenager reported that a state representative twice her age raped up she came forward her story and then many things went differently than the would have before me to i d hose statehouse had put in place o basic reporting system from points this the incant was investigated there were consequences all within a month and a half mir the house put on a hearing came to a fast decision mend we have a motion some rides that motion motion is it represent on finger should be ensured with the following restrictions and conditions one that hoe be immediately suspended without payer benefits to that he must to me to evacuate his office in the capital an not returned to capital grounds for the remainder of the sixty six do legislature and three comitteevote was unanimous resent should be point they then called for vote from he full house to expel the representative he immediately resigned that is change right post me too sat legislators talked about how proud they were there billy do right things quickly the prase the colleagues around the hearing as masterful whatever producers a meek me watched all this happened back then she had a question namely what was all this for jane doll here is make i lived just south of voice and the story of jane do was all over the news mister chairman there was a public antics hearing in the do house i watched her answer questions did you make a report to noisy police department and on march ninth you had been raped by representative on linger yes the first thing i notice and was young just a tea anger just at a high school they had her behind these giant black curtains up on a days at the very front of the room these big black curtains that hung off some tall metal frames were suppose he shield for identity which was weird because nothing was being done to disguise her actual voice first i could not stop thinking what is happening here it felt very handmade talk she was on trial did you tell him to stop said no did you say other things that indicated no most soul wont of what different reiterations i even try to just convince him to not telling him i was an decontrol and i had it shaved myself for de us to make me seem unappeasable you know and he just continued that is ta pretty intense thing to hear a tea eager recounting behind a black curtain reinforced that the proceedings and then here is the put that really me me wonder what this was all for jane something happened after she finished her testimony o your excuse after she exitedtive room the mikes picked up a faint screen how it was hers some of the representatives conducting the hearing looked around in confusion for a split second and then got back to work calling up witnesses ones w es watching this back in twenty twenty one just four years after the meet movement broke i assume jane doe was part of a younger generation of women who were reporting sexual violence but who knows she was literally invisible at the hearing what was a for her back behind that curing and what was that screen i wanted to find out more about what exactly happened to jane you i reached out to jane doe through her lawyers after the hearing to we if she want to share more five months later i noticed a couple of miss calls on myephone i called back it was jane shed been calling me and not leaving messages thing to reach me out of the blue because she worried i tried to report our call without her knowing she said she was feeling paranoid when i finally met jane in person she was very direct she been seeing all these people talking about her and finally wanted to give her side of it she had a lot to say about every part of the process the letter up to the seat behind the black curing she just turned twenty she was really funny a total goofball she has a membership at a trampling him but go four times a week i love there our favorite the dodge balloon and i just love messing up kids mailing them with a ball i love be big sister i do not get the chance to be bigsister lot what i get chance just going violates an little while nine year old i will there always a a you cat me like i

the tree at the learn omen i think it is beautiful her favorite pictures were of her cubicle a bigot desk swivel chair an her own name place and it was really funny too the charge arms but my name in all caps on it because she said and that people would find me as ha an office before no never had my own office i was shook did you love about that honestly if i will just es straight to really what made me feel i fell is walking in gold literally entire family i ism the first worn t ever work for the government right i mean have just proud of myself the capital had been a serial place for jane to find herself in just a few years earlier she was a pregnant high school freshmen trying to figure her life out she started making money by working field jobs on potato in corn farms and picked up a nightshirt at panic's brush as a sophomore she ruled herself in a special high school for teen parents and started volunteering and domestic silent shelters she quickly became the kind of model over achiever who gets voted most likely to become president of the united states when jane was a senior in high school she sign up to be a page in the dah house of representatives she ran errands for a special committee and was celebrated on the local news for it the first teen mom to serve as a page in the state house her working domestic violence programs brought her here to learn more about the we just at a process and rut ane learn the steps on how to make a bill and for fun sat in on meetings of the judiciary and rules committee she tracking all the different rights of bills that i introduce and seen what happened to them she would grown up with an abusive dad and then had a boy friend who was violent with her seeing first hand just how badly the criminal process worked for victims she wondered why it was not better and now that she would seen the work of a lawmaker up close she decided that is what she wanted for herself after the page program was over after she graduated from high school jane decided she had to get back to the house she applied for an internship and to get it she needed to find a representative who would sponge for her i just raced out everybody i could that i knew i a easy to find their contact on mine the yo find their emonsteffs i just as sending ye old i hey was i i and enough to remember me was a page last year a remember on

that i wont won i i was i wanted i wanted to be there i noted to learn she got an internship with a republican representative not on clanger the one she reported for raping her it was another one she started at the beginning of twenty twenty one a desk of her own on the ground floor of the idahostate capital she felt this was the beginning of something much bigger jane remembers running into representative on linger pretty soon after the twenty twenty one legislative session started she was not interning for him he was just another republican representative a very new one i reached out to on linger in his lawyer for comment but did not get a response he has not been talking to the press it was this first term in the house he was a substitute teacher from northern too there was a few times hen i walk at a committee and he was there and i just in i i smile on way tat everybody and then he just come stared at me there limos he walking and their a second time it was a bunch of people

non urgent work question who keep her in his office too long and who she overheard talking with other sirs about whether she looked better in her tan skin er her striped one she told me the real lot of sirs in the house sometimes she would get this creeping feeling that they would look at her and think well how exotic lane's stannic many o the other women working in the capital were blond and white after in linger gave her this idahoshape cookies jane says he was suddenly walking by her desk multiple times a day to make small talk he gave her his then number food seemed to be the main currency of flirting for a lot of the sirs jane says they were constantly offering her snacks from the many forgives were dropping off lunch at times all this free food was nice jane internship was unpaid she is supporting herself in her three year old son with a second job she worked the overnight shift at a domestic violent shelter for eight dollars an hour when on linger eventually asteroid to dinner jane says she initially felt reluctant but talked about it with her friends who told her to go for the food remember she was an nineteen only a year out of high school he was thirty eight did you think of it s this is a date this is a working dinner this is something in between her who know i obviously knew that he was interested in me but i more or less was well he is er to help me

he definitely was a i could help you out and that is was my to she wanted to grow her network on longer picked jane up after she would finished her internship for the day and a beam w he borrowed from his rooming then drove her to his stay rush brought down town and then over dinner he had made some weird remarks and i was this is kind of weird li cause he was i have a dry sense of humor like what are you doing later and i a on go pick up my i us i don't i i just go home an he is oh i hoping to do you in he was just laughing and then he just at and then the waiter guy came up and i was o we it just wanted to ignore it i the other things ism just s rete her the as not to a it on i deafen he was not trying to make a worse an then we were gin to levin i was coo ism i go home on clanger disposed to take her straight back to her car at the capital but instead he made a detour to his apartment supposed my to run a quick errand this is probably evident but it hadst that this is where the rate pains and i mane to give some of those details jane gave me permission and felt it was important to we out the specifics of what happened to her after he parked jane felt prospered to go went she says he opened her car door and reached for her arm she felt anxious knowing that he sometimes carried a hand gun once inside his apartment jane tried to keep some distance she wen sat on his couch but he picked her up and carried her to his bedroom i want to run out of i visit visioning myself running out of his room and i running on the hall but was just in my head i could do it a i i do not know a my brain was shot i could not move i aitknow o paradise i cannot move jane kept say no but on linger forced his penis into her mouth she polled her had away hard that it snapped back and hit the wall he then climbed on top of her pitting one of her arms under his knee master bating on longer was over six feet two hundred owns lane's five foot three i just stared at his curtains the was dark the i called him america rake in my head is what i was naming i like i i was in disbelief i said no i i said me was i spoke to do hit him was i suppose to attack him i he should have just goal off in me and he did not he just did not and i was shocked afterward she says he told her when ism at this point i just become an at of control man he then acted nothing happened and drove her back to her car jane do had been assaulted by a state legislator now she had to try to figure out what to do next the vast majority of sexual assault survivors jane decided she was not going to tell any one she want to get back to work she tried to convince herself she was fine but that plan fell apart when she showed up back at the capital for for just a couple days later and is on the ground floor going towards more my offices and i seen him at the very end walking out of a committed room and i was i cannot do this i cannot i cannot do this you saw him did he see you go my gash i thought hold on to the walls like in the middle a origan panic attack of i not functioning i the did not function i was scared a scared i went straight id can blackbody can blackbird that is who she talk to the assistant sergeant at arms for the house when jane was a high school page the previous year can was her supervisor it was hard to find a private place to talk they walked out to the rotunda and sat on a bench facing that big dah state flag jane told him that on linger had raped her then she went to the bathroom and threw up well initially to even report of to convince myself all as well ism a citizen of constitute i witness a crime brought by one of their legislators and i am giving that to the hear hiccup but whatever he not been ism reporting that because that is what a good samaritan dies that's what i you do was sis your supposed to do and i me being domessiclines sexual all advocate myself a would i be telling a different nineteen year old who got assaulted by a legislator i have as cold not hold that wool ill this i do not really wat to do this but i have to do this oh ye why why would you on do that wat any way won o out isn't be chose to be a ya take my life i an my whole life at that royals i it sis my job now this is where things started going differently than they would have in years pass at the do capital jane did not know this but when she told the supervisor about on linger she became the first person to publicly passed out the legislature's brand new process for responding to sexual misconduct allegations the assistant sergeant at arms was now required to share lane's report with one of the heroes she went to the top person in the house the speaker who took it very seriously within minutes of receiving lane's report he notified the attorney general's office who then notified the body police they took her to a victim enter where nurse gave her a rate could exam but jane waffled about whether she wanted to move forward with a police investigation and decided she did not want a push charges she wanted to move on focus on her work and let the capital dillies anon longer another interned in get her the new protocol at the capital landed with the thick committee in the idol house but then what while the legislature had a way to respond to sexual misconduct complaints it did not have any guide lines for how to conduct this kind of investigation represented sage iron a republican from northern idea ho charged the ethics committee he was the first one on it to see lane's report the chalked s i was in aware of any that o it was a lot to absorb i was disturbed in thinking this is oui possibly going to be something larger than we would of the is for with at into have you ever handled anything this as a legislator no most everything that happened next iron in his committee had to make up he had know training on how to run an investigation into a sexual misconduct complain his job outside of the house is writing an electrical contracting business one of his first thoughts was we should talk to jane jane was at the capital when a secretary notified her to appear before the house affect's committee she did not know what to expect when she headed into that interview she brought a lawyer who is also as sexual all advocate and right before we walked in there all we heard from that that room a burst of laughter i that already made me what the head did you hear that ma an my lawyerwer a they laughing r now what are they laughing about you feel walking into that room is more irritated you know more i con ours con a hard kind od felt judged iron says he does not remember what they were talking about but was certain they were not laughing about jane once jane walked in the room she saw the the committee was made up of representative she saw all the time at her in turnip she felt ashamed they were seated around a long table three men two women she took a seat at the end iron asked her o recount the night on linger raptor but as soon as she got to the part about him climbing on top of her don stopped her he said u i think maybe the committee's getting on comfortable to at fir such a sight what did you say way why did say that but i was you are telling m i making you uncomfortable you are telling me you are telling me i what's a salted sexually but your uncomfortable with this conversation after you asked me to have this conversation you asked me you brought me here you you made this happen and you are just going to tell me to stop you what this does not it made me angry i heard the transcript of this and later he said please do not think that were were ism cutting you off because we d want to hear anything more in did that clarification make a difference to you no in anyway that was a huge insult you make me relive a horrible experience in just tell me you'eincomfortable by it i was hurt i was hurt by iron because i know his son am friends with this son he was a page with me dang i r ne diamond you hurt me you hurt me there were some well establish practices for interviewing sexual salt victims using trained investigators who know how to interview a victim without retromatizing them is one and those investigators should be external and independent not people who worked together every day i asketixon about that moment in the room he told me after jane laughed a deputy g who was there told them you do not interrupt sexual salt victims in the middle of their story i can tell can do was getting this about disturbed and i didn't want her to be that way i told er you do not e we answer in i words that stop were don refine trying to protect her best was has been a father that i would think protect somebody is numerable and having hard tot not knowing that dynamic not now i know tan it as hard at that point that was one of the difficult things si i apologized to her about that i to the mad it tougher the ethic committee does not investigate crimes they had no protocol for what to do but they did have this one thing something that was clearly in the purview of the ethics committee conduct on becoming was representative on clinger's conduct conduct on becoming as they looked into it report started surfacing about other women he pursued and made uncomfortable in his very short time at the capital he journal clerk a security guard and the lobbyist who said he followed her to the bathroom all of them were younger than him the committee also discovered that the top leadership in the house knew about two of these reports instead of confronting on linger they sent a represented to to warn him to stop being quote overly nice iron and the committee brought these allegations to him and gave on linger the chance to resin quietly and to avoid any public embarrassment but he did not step down instead he told the committee he and jane do had consensual sect to them pursuing a sexual relationship of any kind with an intern was not okay it seems a clear violation of the rule conduct on becoming since he refused to resign the only option they had last was to convince two thirds of the house that on linger had violated conduct on becoming then they could get a expelled but to do this they would have to hold the public herring once the hearing was announced one of on clinger's attorneys did something that shocked jane in her lawyers she released lane's name to reporters it ended up on a far right new sight with her photo jane was no longer anonymous i just a wholly she at my worlds an nobody would talk to me nobodywould even look at me in the any there i would from smiling waving to everybody to nobody betook at me is is not that what i us really jane they hate me everybody that statehouse just hates me an ally of on linger in the house one after jane too and then representative named procilla getting she posted lane's foot on face book and smell the news letter to her constituents calling on ellingar dagos very own cabin and jane a honey trap out on a liberal smear job the hearing she said was part of a national me too witch hunt i reached out to pettiness but she did not respond jane tried to keep going to wort but she hated that every time some one looked at her they thought about the rape she could not function and needed to get out of the capital back at home all she could do to get through the day was sleep she could not keep so down and was failing all of her college classes except for one a criminal justice course it was victimology a not even getting not even keying i is victimology as i was taking victimology all through that in victimology one of the things they talk about is how victims are often retromatized by the very systems that are supposed to get in justice if you are a victim of sexual violence the drama is about having no power any attempt toward just ice police or or each our procedures should be design to make sure of the person feels a sense of control for instance before a victim even makes a report they should know what all the possible steps of the possess could be that way they can decide if they still want to provide and if it is a work place the state house ye want to give the victim the option to give their testimony in private instead of foreseen them to retire and relived their assault in public in the idea ho house the process was not designed with a sexual assault victim in mind instead it looked a lot more a regular criminal trial iron talked a lot about on clinger's right to defend himself where jane says she was not consulted about whether she even wanted to come to the hearing they issued a sepia for her to appear i asked iron why he thought that was necessary we were scheming other witnesses insodomen to aced sistenceo think is why id just it it did not look we were savoring one side of the other because it is a sepia if she had not appeared then a rash is the consequence of that right yes i do not think it is absolute that arrest is the consequence of that if we wanted ta that an we could s si she had not cam i mean i what would have i i do not know is that is to because i feel she needed to be there for that face your cause retortion of it in the days leaving up to the hearing lane's lawyer said they did everything they could to prevent the hearing from being a disaster for her they asked if she could testify remotely with her voice disguised or even better in a closed section that was not open to the public they said the answer they always got back from the attorney general's office was now no one seems to have a clear answer on why this was one of the deputy gs running the case declined to comment iron told me he never receive her attorney's request insist he would have been open to jane testifying remotely in the end lane's lawyer said the only protection that was offered up to her were those black curtains she would tell her story in public behind a black curtain making to a the hearing and the protective power of tennechos its in a minute cicada pabagratio when our program continues smoke mi my glass to day's program jane do five years since me toobooup there are these systems at dispose to crank an action now can somebody steps forward we hade the story of jane do add made drew an i to ho not to be clear jane did not come forward because of me too a she went of producer making me master about it jane ad all she knew about me too as it was something for celebrities then the less he response to her was shape by me to shews a test case of the legislature's new reporting system they were making up as they went we pick up our story with at too the witness it is up this part story contains brief references to suicide her s my the morning of the hearing jane woke up terrified she had a full blown panic attack and threw up she jumped in the shower and put on beautiful by emblem to try and pump herself up we then put on a black dross this was an inside joke to herself because she felt she was about to attend her own funeral lane's mom picture up and they headed to the capital her lawyers told me that nobody came up with a secure plan to get her into the building without people seeing who she was one of her lawyers reached out to a senator who met jane in german at a private entrance outside the capital then led them through a series of tunnels and some back hallways until jane finally got to a door in the hearing room she looked at the curtains and a random bronze statue of graham lincoln's head her chair was right in front of him his eyes would not moving no rhesus staring an e of siren si o we it was just were just flat out heard what did you think when you saw that black turn was i can see through this i can see everybody they can see me and i was centimo he effort wit they e dudnseem from her side the curtain looked more shear she looked through it to a room packed with legislators an pass the people who could actually see her though included vivatthix committee members their counsel a secretary to deputy a gs on ellingeris attorney and on linger jane had only seen him around the capital a couple o times since he raped her her black curtain was slightly open to give those people line of sight on jane during the hearing my body was not there i just held tight to my chair just hollow to it i had something yoouever get a protector voice good in servo lane's voice was ligistring the hearing was broadcast on line i think we need to be able to cross examined a the accuse yer that is on lingerie attorney publicly cross examining witnesses of sexual salt is certainly not best practice for this kind of thing for instance other stateblegislatures that have adopted procedures for handling complaints do not allow victims to be cross examidon public certainly not by the perpetrators that again they had no process for the night oho on clinger's lawyer adopted tactics out of a criminal trial he predicatively turned jane into the defend following the usual playbook that gets used on sexual salt victims he cast her as mentally on stable an a flirt which was a thing jane had fall around the capital ever since she reported by linger that she was being judge and cast in her words is a quote gold digging crazy medic an pothead on clinger's lawyer nitpick tiny details insinuate that maybe she was a liar ism just under if you count just read that just at once sentence on the night of march ten twenty twenty one she met him down town noisy think she'd bet it was not march ten point zoning on was it no it was mar ink is an ether yes i told police that they why did you tell miss baron that it was march to can i did not i said the other night this supervisor who jane had reported to as the one who accidentally made a mistake in her get report not jane meanwhile on linger barely spoke he kept pleading the eff when the ethics committee kept pointing out that this was nan a criminal proceeding and it did not apply he still refused what sucked up most of the time though was the corps of vonelinger's defense which was essentially this was not rat we were dating er a date which is aloud there is no anti fratinersation policy in the idea hostage house again here is his attorney is represented on linger have any hiring r firing authority over you no there is represented on linger have any supervisory authority over you no he asked con version of this question more than thirty times to different witnesses are you aware of any policy that would be violated i representative having any relationship with akin turn of stage majority i i have seen nothing in policy no thank you he is basically saying tell me where it was a powerful middle age legislator cannot de and nineteen or old in turn and always got the same answer written policy no not that ism not that for absolutely not on clinger's lawyer do the same kind of thing with the other woman who testified about on clinger's troubling behavior a chief clerk who said one of her employs complained when vonellinger asked her out his attorney's response to the this she was not wearing a wedding ring which of course has nothing to do with whether on linger should have asked her out at work his attorney charge to had you this small an your experience is not were in a wedding ring a generally expected sign that a woman is unavailable you can be conjured that way but i do not think that that is a requirement to be unveiled at i did not ask if it was a requirement is it completely unreasonable in your opinion for an individual who is interested in a woman to notice that she is not wearing a wedding ring and assume he is permitted ask for a question i do not think of a wedding ring is indicative a weather or not you can ask the woman a question this is an absurd thing to argue but he is also arguing and side an absurd incoherent sat a rules the idea who legislature has a process for reporting sexual harassment but not actually a policy against it in the rules for the sunny in the house they do not have an anti fratinersation policy but they have rules about decorum rules forbidding smoking drinking and eating on the house floor the rule about conduct on becoming of a state legislator but nothing for sexual harassment the part of the hearing it'd always wanted to know more about ever since i first saw it was what happened when jane finally walked away from that black curtain she sat behind it for forty minutes answering questions your excuse i free lose it i lust i i an then take i as is anger as aunt to here recant wen be hearing were you to gone to help you jane told me that when she stood up to leave she had a panic attack there was a private exit she was posed to go out of but she was upset that she pushed through the wrong door and landed out in a public hallway that is when that scream came out of her o just at running up the hallway an asweday hear people behind me some of on clinger's supporters all women followed her out into the hallway there was a local reporter with them to they crowded around her and started filming jane with her phones i i broke i be ut i screen i screamed a lot screaming him much i was an to kill myself all i wanted to do as gets the top of the building she was trying to get to a balcony in the rotunda to throw herself off her lawyers blocked her sane collapsed on the ground her mam held her while her lawyers pulled out an umbrella and opened it to try and block her face from the people filming her it took several minutes before security at the capital finally showed up and escorted jane out of the building the hearing lasted two days at the end of the second day the committee recommended to expel him he resign just hours later representative iron had of the attic committee saw this as a successful outcome i told iron how aromatizing the whole experience was for jane and what happened after she ran out of the hearing room i mean if that is what the consequences were for her for showing up in public for testifying in publicamean is it the a was at worth having her be in public that probably not but again is us was alley to us as her committed not am it being familiar with with that drama and how it expresses itself for people we had no iran it did everything we thought we were doing correctly to protect or i i think we could have gone on without that because we did have her previous testimony that we could have brought up in an had or show everybody we ha that the transcripts w were able to show the body which again was support ma sos they knew what we had known and ow that probably a sufficed this of course is impossible to know another member of the attic committee told me they thought without lane's testimony in person monnylinger would still be in the legislature i mean is there anything that you would want her to know or think us ism very sorry if we increased that trocar that we did as it never was print i know each one of those members feels very strong i that she was wrong and and waded to protect her it just you o are an experience thinks in come out may be is lovingly is the good of what happened to jane after all of that she never finish the internship she loved at the capital and after the hearing and never went back to her office with her name and all caps five months after the hearing she was cleaning houses and she was a rack head lost twenty pounds she could not stop replaying the assault and the hearing in her had much of her day to day now was a physical battle she was dealing with severe pities just going on the free way and he would see the see to the capital my body which i say like immediately just en your falling she imagine just that moment just saying in that my body is just in a state of shock e an o frozen she was still getting harassed by vanillin her sympathizers continued to publish her name on mine random strangers had shown up at her old apartment asking questions there was even a man who show up that noisy political events mocking her trust as a woman wearing a sash with lane's real name on et there were also people who sympathized with her to and that was also hard when she was out in public she never knew when some one was going to try and approach her my people are are you we where dos this come up when you get report y i is i were to job fair ocaingt is us a bunch of we do not boost people wen yours go to the next one and is one layaway up to one another like now many rich here here law i think i be i liked to con application n she isioslay her eyes were are watering

own why woad you share that that i do not that do not care perse i but i do not care i do not want to hear it jane started talking about herself in the past fence i was high energy i was punk i was funny and her plans felt past tent to she no longer talked about being a lawmaker she was sure she could never set foot back in the capital and was thinking about moving out of state the statehouse had a process to take her seriously when she reported on linger but after that they had nothing jane felt they were not concerned with what the experience it did to her it is needed my testimony a needed to do to there do the jobs aniinerly look at me as a pumanars oo importunes as she has to do this might as well as i can make her i is what is dot the day only needed me to get this process going they did it consider anything else and the i mes it it gets me i mean what would you do whatwould you have done if i was your kid what would you have me sure happen if i was yours all jane had wanted to do was work at the capital but after she got boxed she said every one there who talked to her about job opportunities went silence to make money she started helping her stop at out at his plumbing business and picked up work as ha care giver at a memory care facility and then one year after the attic hearing jane got a rare sort of do over of the entire ordeal with on linger the district attorney in the county for noisy charged him with fella rate this happened because after she got boxed jane told the please she to operate with the criminal case she was scared all the time she felt she had to for her own protection this time things went very differently the prosecutors handling her case understood that they needed to deal with her with care they walked her through each stop she always knew what to expect they did not sepia her theyinetentionally built a whole case where she did not have to take the stand they had other witnesses the nurse who did lane's rape could exam but jane decided that she did want to testify against on linger he sheriff picked her up in an mark car and drove her to as secret courthouse entrance she had a the be donna you in the courtroom and the victim witness coordinator by her side i was there sitting a couple rose behind on linger but even with all that support watching jane on the stand that day was herring she looked she was having and out of body experience she stared at him blankly and could barely talk would she tried to answer questions about how he reaped her she suddenly stomped she pushed her chare away from the mike stood up and said i cannot do this she walked out of the courtroom wat i ran out of the room and e immediately fell down a flight stairs that sound stupid but i did and that i do not know what in my mind i see it a run and the nice i ran across front street i ran across mural which is the big rob big busy roads down town noise fortunes i was thing to go to the bridge a i and my bran as when i was going my ankle was getting to me the bridge she says because maybe she could jump she was having a pushed dramatic reaction same is at the hearing lane's first instinct was to do what she had not been able to do the night she was rape run away she torn attendant and leaned up against a tree one of her attorneys named guy followed her out to try to calm her guy says when the police showed up one of them grabbed her arm and drop her to the ground jane was distract she does not remember that many people nine different officers a mean as his on the floors streaming hitting e head over never an looks over and ill never forget this and i skin guy an is hands in knees he was crying and he is i shaking his head and i know what about that hurt me and i stopped for a second during this brief pause the police put a full body restrike rap a helmet and handcuffs on jane they put her in a squad car and transferred her to a hospital for psychiatric care she spent three days there when she was released her mom pick er up as soon as they pulled on the free way a tack showed up on her homophone i here that e and then she oh hit is i do you want to read that and i dis i e an i have as million man i he it was a take from one of lane's attorneys the jury and vinalinger's trial had just come to avert i and is and she said that he is soon guilty an what was though it did that feeling i did not believe it i was i no way what why did not you believe it nobody thought that he would have oh just up on the is he son a gat e she a good old boy whether is many comments when do you get to here about full a prosecuted convicted for what they did and he got that you know how lucky i am its true jane is the best case scenario for what rate survive can get one linger was kicked out of the idea capital a month and a half after she reported he was arrested and a judge sentenced him to twenty years in prison last send three per sent of sexual assaults ever result in a conviction or incarceration but the lived reality of best cassonareo for jane hardly fells a win vonilinger still maintains he did nothing wrong he is a pilling his conviction to the state supreme court the sympathizers continued to harass her and she regularly sees a psychiatrist and a therapist for petiasty she takes ice bats a few times a week to shock herself into feeling she is back in her body more than two years after the attic heroin nothing is preventing another jane do from going through almost the exact same process she did this really gets to her think house in the sent still have not adopted to sexual harassment or anti fratnersation paunch into the rules they also have an adopted a specific process for have investigate future reports of sexual is conduct there are state legislature that have adopted some ass practices organ offers confidential counting for victims to help them decide what kind of action they want o take and new york and organ use independent textural investigators neither state requires victims to retire and relive their assault in public the one improvement iron in ether attic committee members did make his stronger confidentiality protections for any one who reports any one who releases o victim's name could face consequences but at the same time the committee all decided they can cover the legal fees of lawmakers accused of sexual harassment or assault this is where we are more than five years after me to more awareness there is a problem a more immediate sent that you should care and respond when some one reports but nobody's invented new systems were what a victim actually wants and needs is after senior or the idea legislate sure is not different from state houses all over the country including the very highest levels of the guess government three of the past five presidents have been accused of inappropriate behavior from unwanted touching treat and more than three decades after enema hell for s testified about clarence homes the you e senate in house still do not have a clear in dependent process for investigations i recently listen to a conversation between hill and christie close forward about their experiences testifying in front of the senate judiciary committee in it he will said that she reacts the idea that things will change if more people come forward and speak out she says it is the other way around more people come forward if the systems were better a little while ago jane step back into the medical capital for the first time since the hearing not for a new job she says a representative called her out of the blue and invited her to a meeting with some other law makers they wanted her in put on better processes for sexual harassment and a salt victims part of me was excited part of me still admired the statehouse what was the other part of you flat is scared confusionlike scared i do not want you that i want to ha i want to very shard i mate i had running those maser i tike stretchy pans were ready to yogi just take precautions i had somebody on stand by incase need pie now more than two years out from the hearing jane been back at the capital more than a dozen times she says some times she gets random stares from cobias female representatives who will not look her in the eye but she does not care really in canary she went to the inaugroball holding the refund of the capital what was a it was fin an the idea or heel they did still wear flask justify yah she pulled up a video on her phone yes things speak e then the refund as all it up can it is

popping into committee means for things she wants to learn more about tike health an welfare or state affairs in stay she is here some where between where she intended to be in the very dark place she is bet in for the last couple years she just now returning to her original plans ism going to be to maker you knowi'll never be i will never have shame looking into that building antre going forward hem hem ism a molly generation a at home my mother is here my siblings i here my son is here am here no way your use to me from i pay my tin this is orbit can jane mapping out her path back p t e city council and then the state use making me is a producer on our show if you have experience sexual assault an when a talk somebody you can reach out to the national sexual assault o outline one eight hundred six five six hope fyouoving thoughts of suicide called the nationals swops had convention outline you do that by dealing nine eight eight on your thrown that is ad just nine eight eight yuan pal reported this for us you oi a an us possess dispose as and no ass a s of we eveytand a w a s s o a oo ss s o o i e mistake i great la wits et a o o ya aether of a so t sit i ss o a ooh s a ut he i know that we can avenged the showfreight here with a song and in fact we did plane on ending it right here but then last week i did this one more interview that just got to those of us who were putting together the show and it is in nine e was somebody who jane do has been thinking about a woman who for a while was known as family you and here is just one more thing before we go to day is is act three dough me you ut his a while up meek was tacking to jane for this story came was reading this book called know my name and now my cameras written by a survivor who had been anonymous for several years and then came out with her name this is somebody who we had actually one quick quote from in the top of the show phone miller is her real name stamford swimmer broch turner sexually assault of her in twenty fifteen and then she wrote this victim impact statement as family due and this statement when o mine millions people read it eighteen members of the house o representatives democratsand republicans took turns reading at outlook in congress it was he thing and jane dough is thinking these days about whether she was to come out with her real name into i talk to she knoll mellow about how she decided to do that null what it was for her to be anonymous as family dough for long before she did in those four years less than ten people in my life new and at the time it was cool that i had the power of invisibility but long term what is not cool is when you cannot turn the invisibility off because if you're always invisible than you just start to slowly dissolve and just to be in the world and leave such a big part of me at home every day led to such a fragmented experience by the end did family dose seem a person who as separate from you in some wood oh yes yes say more beta am well she is titi a beacon and shes very bold family dose just this unshakable clear headed person who did not take anything from anybody and i do not know i ism i am not conferment national you have understand in my book i talk about how when ism handed change at the grocery store i just throw in my bag because i do not want to hold anybody up i get nerve if ism to a calf and i have to ask the breeze of the wife i pass word rather not it'll figure out away to work without in er not for an hour and in my day to day life ism some one who is very shrunken most of the time and it takes a lot to be able to assert myself i think what is incredible about family dough is that she she can show up when she needs to i family do not takes a stand yes family dough asked for the wife i pass word yes and you reading by the simply dough who seems amazing and it does not feel you family dough i do not think is allowed to make a lot of jokes oh i she exists in his pace that ha a that is can be sensitive where you want to be really conscious of what you are saying you want to take care of people even now when people people sometimes see me on the street and burst into tears and i do not know what that is but i i just any time somebody gives me a compliment i imagine family dough as this statue and they give me a flower and i walk over and put the flower at her feet and then i come back to myself the next sang when it do is something unusual a jane dough from her story has read your book i she read it with interest and she sent these next questions i that she would love to hear your interest to look looked first one but when did you can told we see where she is coming from in this question to when did that you were emotionally an mentally ready to put your real name out there what would the signs you were seeing in your own life tell me you that you were ready there is many things i sought were impossible at the beginning that of now become ordinary and i want her to know that for herself i could not even verbal eyes what had happened to me when i was alone in a harps office and i wore a jacket this is a the beginning is is that the very beginning i i had wore a jacket with sleeves that covered my hands and now i can walk in in a regular afternoon make her a cording that will go out t o millions of people and afterward i will move on to something else i quirk hating you be token a this interior you we doing redirect ye this will not sink me and by the end i could get back on my feet quickly and i thought i do not have to be afraid any more that something is going to blindside me and that is when you knew that you were emotionally mentally ready to put your name outdo yes i can do this handoff next question for you is what is the prison consist you made before you came out a with your own name o i cons cons is that any time you are guggled it is the first thing that comes up it will be the first thing everybody sees you as prose prose i get to be and rooms with people again but i me y i do not have to be lonely any more i was lonely it is lonely to be hiding this much it is isolating other cons feeling exposed it felt i was in this storm and i had a little tarp covering me and at any moment the wind was going to rip the tarp off and ism just clutching it down all of the time and when i finally rips off you are oka now i can just give in to it i can get soaked and see where we go from here the any other prose or cons you it is hard every time ism introduced there is a trigger warning think that the folloyry one at the top it's son and everyday i even time your introduced you mean on the radio or something that don an event an an event the other ow this may not be really distressing and ism sitting there what am i about to do that e pe i in want to be introduce and not have to warn people that ism about to start speaking a cat is your last question from shametow who is family do to you now is she gone she is there she will definitely always be there be there is a separate person from you yes really ye she is a but you i thought you might say that you have now she integrated her she is now part of you oh ye i think in the beginning and of views i said that eras it sounds very is the eiiniantm i not i she still after can toner cenalmelor shenalmowes spoke again as seal on my name she shall to visual artist of you o

welcome to the hubermenlaoca science science ace to r i mandrel supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science nescience related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gotmicrobiom and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer the give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of date and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium an potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you wan a try element you can go to element element team slash superman for the last month four episodes to be exact we have been discussing physical performance and skill learning we have talked about how to learn skills faster whether not those a skills for athletic performance dance music things of that sort we have also talked about how to gain strength and how to lose fat fast or by leveraging the nervous system things shiver and non shiver non exercise activity induced thermogenesis we talk about how neurons can actually trigger accelerated fat loss we have talked about hypertrophy also call muscle growth and we covered everything from sets and rests protocols how long to stay in a cold ice bath when to get out how to keep shivering we have covered a lot of tools an a lot of science if you've interested in those things in you even perhaps one a learn a lo bit about how we make energy a t p from carbohydrates or from facts it is all covered in the previous for episodes this was going to be the time that we move to a new topic entirely but we are going to do one more episode in this series on physical performance for the simple reason that you asked many questions about something that is vitally important both for physical performance and long term and short term health and that is endurance and to day we are going to talk about endurance now if you are a strength athlete or are not interested in endurance do not depart just yet because it turns out that there ways to train endurance that are very different than i would have previously imagine if you only think about long runs long swims marathons half marathons ten was five case and that sort of thing puts you to sleep omelet costelloous snoring in the background right now he is not a long distance endurance athlete that is for sure if you are interested in those things or if you are averse to those things i encourage you to continue listening because we are going to talk about a little bit of science and then some specific protocols that really define what insurance is the four types of endurance and ways to train those concert with the other things that you might be doing weight training or skill training or yoga and if you are an endurance athlete we are going to cover a lot of tools and science that ism certain will also help enhance your training and performance in races or even just recreational the topic of endurance i think has been badly misrepresented frankly on line and when you start digging into the science and you start talking to real experts in this area what you discover what have discovered is that it is an incredibly interesting area because it teaches us much about how our body and our brain use fuels and how we can control which fuels are used by our body endbrain to day we will talk about the four kinds of endurance we will also cover the topic of hydration which might sound incredibly boring gages drink more water but it is really interesting because not only is hydration a limiting factor on performance but there is a right way to hydrate and there is a wrong way to hydrate there actually is a formula that it'll teach you to know how much water to be drinking depending on your activity levels and if that sounds a simple thing just tap off water until your ruin runs clear that is essay the wrong advice it turns out that if you do not hydrate properly you can see twenty to thirty per cent reductions in performance whether not that strength without that you increasing hypertrophy whether o that is running swimming even mental performance even if your not at lead or recreational last lead at all i encourage you to stay tune for the part about hydration we are going to cover as usual little but of science and they are going to dive right into protocols that you can apply if you in if you deem those correct and safe for you before we dive into all that i want to make an important announcement which is all the episodes of the superman lab podcast are now housed on a single website which is superman lab dot come you go to superman labor come you can find all the episodes in tube apple and notify format with link there the website is also reachable if you go into the will search function which you will find very easily and you put in for instance a creatine or sleep or ice bath or sand it will take you to the specific episodes that contain that information and in addition if you go to the website superman labor come you have the opportunity to sign up for what we call the superman lab at neural network the superman labnurl network is a zero cost resource where once a month perhaps more often you will receive a e man news letter and that news letter will contain specific protocols announcements attachments of media's and things of that sort of protocols tools and science from the podcast we will also make any announcements about live lectures which at some point out probably start doing in various cities in the us and probably round the world as well as well as other things that i think would be really useful to you all of course at zero cost that superman labor cam sign up for the neural network newsletter you can find that in the menutaber it might pop up when you get there and i hope you will join and as a final announcement if you are not already following us on instrogram you can go to superman lab on instrogram and if you do that i often make announcements and release protocols and links to protocols in things there as well i briefly want a touch on something from the previous episode which is that if you are somebody that is trying to increase muscle strength and or size or if you are simply somebody who does not want to increase muscle strength and size you just want to manta n the musculature that you have it is vital that you perform at least five sets of resistance training per muscle per weak if we do not do that we lose muscle over time and that is one reason among many to have a regular resistance training protocol nobody wants to start resembling folded over envelope or melted candle no one wants to have challenges getting up out of a chair or off the ground maintaining musculature is vital not just to our immediate health but to our long term health trajectory i just want to emphasis that point if your curious about the sets the reps how close to failure to go or not go whether not you should be doing your cartyofascular training before after your weight training all of that is in the previous episode right down to the details and i to think made simple for you to understand but i do strongly believe that resistance training whether not t with body weight or bands or weights or simply lifting rocks in the yard or logs in the yard is vital for our systemic physiology and our over all health and that includes our brain health and i describe the reasons for that in the mechanisms in the previous episode to day it'd to talk about endurance and how to build endurance and how to use endurance for the health of your entire body endurance as the name suggests is our ability to engage in continuous bouts of exercise or continuous movement or continuous effort of any kind and i do believe that our ability to engage in activities that we call endurance training or physical endurance activities do have carry over to mental performance of things that require long term effort it'll touch on that at the end and wive there is reason to believe that there is a biological cross over between those two things i do not think it simply the case that if you train yourself to be a strength and speed athlete an to do short bots of exercise or very intense that you can only do mental work that is of short bouts and very intents but it is clear that carry vascular exercise exercise where you are getting your heart rate up continuously for a period of time and endurance exercise we will define what that is in a moment is vital for tapping in to and enhancing various aspects of our biology in the body end in the brain such that our brain can perform work for longer periods of time focused work learning et camera i want a dive into the topic of endurance and i want to just begin by addressing something that is vital to any kind of effort whether not it is mental effort or physical effort as always a littlest of science than will get right into protocols the key thing to understand about energy production in the body meaning your ability to think your ability to talk your ability to walk your ability to run is this thing that we call a t p a t p and mitochondria which are just little what we call organs within cells see a little factories that make energy if you will a t p is required for anything that requires energy for anything that you do that requires effort and there different ways to get a t p and we have been gifted as a species with the ability to convert lots of things into a t p we can convert cargo hydrates literally the kinds of carbohydros youth ago auto piece pizza pizza usually as do and it has cheese and some other things castellan hears me toll y about the costly loves pizza by the way eating apiece of pizza it gets converted into various things fatty acids from the fats glucose from the bread and those things get converted into a t p within cells through things closes things politics i talked about this in previous episodes are muscles and are neurons use different fuel sources to generate a t p the ones that are used first for short bouts of intense activity are things phosphor creatine if you have only heard about creatine as a supplement well phosphor creatine actually exists on a muscles that is why people take cretin you can load your muscles with more creatine and tho and excuse me phosphor creatine is great for short intense bouts of effort when you really pushing hard on something physical let say you see a car on the side of the road and that cars stalled and e person to ha can you help me push my car and you start to push that is me phosphor creatine is can to be your main fuel source then you start to tap into things glucose which is literally just carbohydrates to sugar that is in your blood and the if you keep pushing on that car you keep in engaging in a particular effort or you keep studying or you keep listening to this podcast you start to tap in to other fuel sources glikachine from your liver which is just it is a little pack just yuan you might have packed a sandwich or something for work you have a little pack of gliadin in your liver that you can rely on and you have fats stored in adipose tissue even if you have very very low body fat percentage your one of these people has three percent or five per cent body fat really thin skin very little body fat you can extract limits fatty acids from that body fat it is a storage pack it is a storage pack for energy that can be converted to a t p without going into any more detail when i say to day energy or i say a t p just remember that regardless of your diet regardless of your nutritional plan your body has the calpac my to use creatine glue cost glikagen lipids end if your qeitogenic key tones well talk about mitosis in order to generate fuel energy now the other crucial point is that in order to complete that process of taking these fuels and converting them into energy most of the time you need oxygen you need air basically in your s system now it is not actual ere you need oxygen molecules in your system comes in through your mouth and your nose goes your lungs an distributes i the bloodstream oxygen is not a fuel but a fire that has no oxygen you cannot actually burn the logs but when you blow a lot of oxygen on to a fire basically on to logs without flame there then basically it will take fight it will take fire it will burn of oxygen allows you to burn fuel to day we are going to ask the critical questions what allows us to perform what allows us to continue effort for long periods of time and that effort could be a run it could be a swim it could be studying it could be anything that extends over a long period of time well you are going to need energy and you are going to need oxygen but the way to answer a question what allows us to endure right endurance what allows us to keep going well we think of tings will power but what is will power will power is neurons its neurons in our brain we have the thin call the central governor which decides whether not we should or could continue or whether not we should stop whether not we should quit oke whether not your somebody who has a lot of what we call resilience and endurance or whether or not your somebody who taps out early and quits early or cannot handle frustration that has to do with your fuel utilization and specific neurons we have to ask the question what is the limiting factor on performance right instead of saying what allows us to endure we should say what prevents us from enduring what prevents us from moving forward what are the factors that say what no more ism nothing o continue this run or what have had a really long hard day or may be have a an easy day ion feeling lazy i just do not even really feel getting up and moving what were gong to talk about to day shall gets right down to the heart of motivation and fuel use motivation and fuel allocation end we are gong to talk about specific training protocols that you can follow that have carry over between the bodily systems of running swimming et camera and the way that your brain works let us talk about endurance by asking first what or the limiting factors on endurance what stops us because in addressing that and answering that we will understand what allows us to get into effort and to continue effort there five main categories of things that allow us to engage in effort and they are neurons nerves muscle muscle blood things in our blood our heart and our lungs now i do not want to completely right off things the immune system and other systems of the body but nerve muscle blood heart and lungs are the five that i want a focus on to day because that is where most of the data are as we go forward into this i want to acknowledge doctor and gain who as with the last episode as been tremendously helpful and informative in terms of the exercise physiology is a true expert he has e laboratory he is a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy who understands the science but who also works with athletes and works with recreational athletes professional athletes really understands at a variety of levels how all these systems work he is the person i consulted with about to day is episode although i did access other literature is well and i am going to mention a key review for any of you of physionatos who really want to get down into the weeds but i encourage you if you want more detail to check out doctor and gallons you two page i think he is also on twitter he is definitely on histogram his content is excellent and he really understands i have learned and i really believe that an intellectual is somebody who understands a topic at multiple levels of specificity of detail and can communicate that and and is a true intellectual of muscle physiology and performance and we hear the word intellectual and coupon aback up an cringe from that understand that he is also a practitioner thank you drew gain and gallant a for your support in these episodes and we hope to have you as a guest on the podcast soon nerve muscle blood heart and lungs let us talk about neurons and how they work one but i want to tell you about an experiment that is going to make it very clear why quitting is a mental thing not a physical thing why do we quit well an experiment was done a couple of years ago and was published in the journal cell sell press journal excellent journal showing that there s a class of neurons in our brainstorm in the back of our brain that if they shut off we quit now these neurons release epinefran epinefran is a drenolan and any time we are engaged in effort of any kind we are releasing epinefran anytime we are all awake really we are releasing epineffron into our brain in fact this little group of neurons in the back of our brain is called the locust seraglios if you is churning out pine ran all the time but if something stresses us out it turns out more and then it acts as kind of an alertness signal for the whole brain we also of course have a preplan pin errand released in our body which makes our body ready for things think about epineffran as a readiness signal and when we are engaged in effort this readiness signal as being churned into our brain when were relax and were falling sleep epinefron levels are low of they did a really interesting experiment where they had subjects engage in bouts of effort of trying to move forward toward a goal but they manipulated the visual environment with these stripes kindilike fences passing on both sides of them and by doing that they could trick subjects into thinking that their effort was either allowing them to move forward right because these wrongs on the fence were moving past or that their effort was futile that they were no longer moving forward because they would make the rungs move slowly even though the subjects were making a lot of effort to move forward of this is analogous or similar to being on a treadmill in your trinal walk on this tread mill and you just cannot move the conveyor high or your in virtual reality and your putting a ton of effort but it seems your moving excruciatingly slow i had this experience recently in real life i was doing a swim in the pacific i was trying to go south and i was swimming and i was caught in a current not the pulls you out to ocean and i kept looking to my left and i saw this hotel on the shore line and then i was swimming and swimming and swimming and swimming and twenty minutes later i look to my left and the hotel is still exactly where it was before which meant that i was not moving it felt futile eventually either the current changed or something change and i eventually swam past the hotel got back on the beacon eventually drove home that is a central what they did in this experiment but what they found was these neurons that release pin effort there is another cell type called plea which actually means glue in satin that is paying attention to how much epineffrnt is being released and at some point the system reaches a threshold it reaches the threshold and it shuts off the release of more epineffrnt its i i quit that is it no more effort signal if they could extend the time before those plea said enough if they could release more adrenaline into the system then subjects would keep going our desire to continue or put differently our willingness to continue and our desire to quit is mediated by events between our two ears now that does not mean that the bodies not involved but it means that neurons are critically important we have two categories of neurons the are important the ones in our head that tell us get up and go out and take that run and the ones that allow us encourage us to continue that run and we have neurons that shut things off as a no more and we of course have the neurons that connect o our muscles and control our muscles but the reason we quit is rarely because our body quits our mind quits now we never want encourage people to derive themselves to the point of injury that is not going to be good for anybody but it is good to know that it is nurse our ability to per sit is nurse when people say is it i hear that in sports a effort or fighting or a it is ninety percent mental ten per cent physical you not that that whole discussion about how much is mental how much is physical is absolutely silly it just proves that there is no knowledge of the underlying biology behind that statement it is neither mental nor physical everything is physical everything is neurons your thinking is the responsibility of chemicals and electrical signals in your head it is not ninety per cent mental ten per cent physical it is not fifty fifty it is not seventy thirty it is one hundred per cent nervous system it is neurons oke when people say mental or physical understand it is one hundred per cent nurse and i love for the how much of of it is mental and how much is physical to just disappear that that argument means nothing and it is not actionable now what do nerves need in order to continue to fire what you need in order to get neurons to say i i will persist well they need glucose unless your veto and erogenic adapted you need carbohydrate is glucose that is what neurons run on and you need electrolytes neurons have what is called a sodium potassium pump of able they generate electricity we could go into all this i will proxy do an entire lecture about the action potential but basically in order to get nerves nerve cells to fire to contract muscle to say ism in a continue you need sufficient sodium salt because the action potential the actual firing of neurons is driven by sodium entering the cell rushing into the cell and then there is a removal of potassium and then there is a count of resetting of those levels i they can the sodium potassium pump and the sodium potassium pump and sodium and action potentials even if you do not know anything about that is i t p dependent it requires energy you need energy in order to get neurons to fire and it is p h dependent it depends on the conditions or the environment within the brain being of a certain p h or acidity p h is about how acid or how basic the environment is and we will talk a limit about p h in simple terms the can understand nerves need salt they need potassium and it turns out they need magnesium and you need glucose and carbohydrates in order to power those neurons less you are running on ketones and to run on ketones you have to make sure that your fully kept adapted i will talk about adding in ketones on top of carbohydrate at the end of the episode o k that is how nerves work you need carbohydrate you need sodium potassium and magnesium in order to drive the brain muscle muscle is going to engage in generate energy first by using this phosphor creatine system high bouts of effort really intense effort short lived seconds to minutes but probably more seconds as con be this phosphor creating literally a fuel source in the muscle that youregoin to burn just you would logs on a fire and glycogen which has stored carbohydrate in the muscle that also can be burned just logs on a fire to generate energy let me make this crystal clear if you move your risks towards your shoulder and contract your except really hard muscle fibers are burning up their own carbohydrate their converting that into a t p in order generate that energy o and p h is important and temperature is important in the episode on supercharge your physical performance i talked all about how by using cooling specifically of the palms or the bottoms of the fee or the cheeks of the face us in particular methods you can just the temperature of the body and of muscle in a way that allows you to do more work to do more raps to run further to keep going and to persist and that is because if temperature is too low or too high then t p is not going to be available because of this hell thing call the private kinas pathway and the temperature dependence of private kind often check out that episode if you want learn more about that but temperature is important and p h is also important s wo got nerve muscle and then their stuff in our blood that is available an energy source and in blood we have got luck to literally blood sugar that is floating round let say you have fasted for three days your blood glucose is going to be very low that is not can be a great fuel source but you will start to liberate fats from your adipose tissue from your fat fatyacids will start to mobilizes into the blood stream and you can burn those for energy and oxygen in your blood when you inhale your bringing oxygen in your blood s these are all fuel sources in your neurons in your muscle in your blood in your various tissues that are providing the opportunity to give effort to to induce effort whether not to run or swim or writing or talking now there are some other factors that are important and those are the heart which is going to move blood the more that the heart can move blood and oxygen well the more fuel that is going to be available for you to engage in muscular effort and thinking effort your heart is vitally important to your your muscles ability to work in your brains ability to work and as have mention oxygen a few times it should be obvious then that the lungs are very import you need to bring oxygen in and distribute it to all these tissues because oxygen is critical for the conversion of carbohydrates and the conversion of fats and we could get into the discussion about whether no oxygen important for erogenic metabolism but you need oxygen there you need to breathe any need to breathe properly i just covered what would normally be about for lectures of energy consumption and energy utilization i did not going to much detail at all but what i want you to imagine is that you have got these different cell types you have got anurans you have got muscle they need to collaborate in order to generate effort or to make the decision to do something or to think hard or to run hard or o run far and then you have got fuel sources both in the anurans in the muscle in your blood and then the heart and lungs are are going to help distribute the oxygen and those fuels and of course you have that little energy pack the we call the liver that will allow you to pull out a like more carbohydrate if you need it for work that is as much as i want to cover about energy consumption because that is a lot but what it tells you is that when you eat and you use food as a fuel source that food can be broken down and you can immediately burn the glue costs that is in your bloodstream or you can rely on some of the stored fuel in your liver or you can rely on stored fuel in the muscle call glycogen and there a lot of different ways that we can generate a t p when we ask the question what is limiting for performance what is going to allow us to endure to engage in effort and endure long bouts of effort or even moderately long counts of effort we need to ask which of those things nerve muscle blood heart and lungs is limiting or put differently we ask what shall we be doing with our anurans what shall we be doing with our muscles what shall w be doing with our blood what shall be doing with our heart and what shall we be doing with our lungs that is going to a low us to build endurance for mental and physical work and to be able to go longer further with more intensity that is the real question how can we do more work and the way we do that is with energy and the way to get energy to it is by those five things and now we are going to talk about how you can actually build different types of endurance and what that does at the level of your blood your heart your muscles and your anurans o ore gan a ship back and forth between protocols tools and the underlying science rather than heavy stack the science at the front end and then just give you all the tools at the end were going to talk about the protocols the four kinds of endurance and how to achieve them and we are going to talk about the underlying science as we move through that if you would a lot of detailed s fence i encourage you to check out a review that we have linked in the shownotes and the review is called adaptations to endurance and strength training this is a review article with many excellent citations it is from coldspring harbor perspectives in medicine the coldspring harbor press as an excellent scientific press spent the last twenty one years doing summers at culturing harbor teaching neral science but culturing harbors involved in all sorts of themes and topics related to negro science in medicine this review by his el elephecin elepheson that is the name elphisin and bar b a r adaptations to endurance and strength training is rich with citations it can be downloaded as a complete media there is no payroll and we will link to it and it gets really deep into all the signaling cascades the genetic changes within muscle a with high intensity interval training short term osuperhigh intensity training a weight training if sure a real nerve for this stuff and you want to get right down into how p g c one alpha p fifty three in h twenty change the adaptation features of muscle an get regulation that is dealing the review for you if you are most people and you are not really interested in that level of detail no reason to pick up the review unless you just want to check out some of the the figures and pictures but i do one to offer thaws a resource it is been in addition to discussions with doctor any gain it is been a a primary resource for the content of this episode let us talk about the four kinds of endurance and how to achieve those i do believe that everybody should have some sort of endurance practice regular endurance practice it is clear that it is vital for the functioning the body and the mind and there are clear longevity benefits there are lot of reasons why that is true but the main one is that if we have good energy utilization in our musculature and in our blood in our vascular system and in our oxygenating system are lungs the call cardiovascular system respiratory system and musculature the body in brain function much better there are many papers now much data to support that i do believe every one should either try to maintain the muscle that they have provided they have already gone through purity and development and they should be engage in regular endurance exercise now for many people they think endurance exercise that means what a our long run are i get target on the stair master arrive to tread mill for hours on end each week and turns out that is not the case there four kinds of endurance and you can train specifically for any one of those and you can varied training let us talk about those four kinds of endurance is a very interesting and they each have very different protocols that you misuse in order to build d and maximize them and now you will understand what fuel sources they use in order to build that thing we call endurance first of all we have muscular endurance muscular endurance is the ability for our muscles to perform work over time and our failure to continue to be able to perform that work is going to be do to muscular fatigue not to cardiovascular fatigue not because we are breathing to hard or we cannot get enough blood to the muscles or because we quit mentally but because the muscles themselves give out ski one good example of this would be if you had to pick up a stone in the yard and that stone is not extremely heavy for you and you needed to do that anywhere from fifty to a hundred times and you are picking it up and putting down and picking it up and putting it down and picking up and putting it down at some point your muscles will fatigue they will fail to endure muscular endurance is incredibly useful for a variety of physical pursuits and we will talk about the mental pursuits that it supports as well in terms of physical pursuits the ability for a given muscle to perform repeated work is going to improve your pulsing it is going to improve your tennis swing it is going to improve your posture your ability to dance your ability to repeatedly engage in an activity that requires effort in a way that is very different from the kind of endurance that you will build simply by increasing your cardie vascular fitness your ability to generate kind of easy repetition let us talk about muscular endurance in what it is muscular endurance is going to be something that you can perform for anywhere from twelve to twenty five or even up to a hundred repetitions and that is astrally how if you you would train muscular endurance and i will give the specific protocol in a few moment a good example is pushups right if you are to get on the floor and starch doing pushups even if your somebody has to do geese down pushups and you are doing your pushups eventually you will not be able to do any more pushups and that is not going to be because you could not get enough oxygen into your system or your heart was not pumping enough blood it is going to be because the muscles fail that is why if you not to be able to do more pushups or even more pull ups muscular endurance is really what it is about it is actually no coincidence that a lot of military boot camp style training is not done with weights is done with things pushups pull ups sit ups and running because what the really building is muscular endurance the ability to perform work repeatedly over time for a given set of muscles and durance what is a good photo can l to build muscular endurance lets just give that you now in explain some of the underlying science as the as it follows a really good muscular endurance training protocol according to the scientific literature would be three to five sets of anywhere from twelve to one hundred repetitions cat's a huge range now twelve to twenty five repetitions is going to be more reasonable for most people and the rest periods are going to be anywhere from thirty to a hundred eighty seconds of rest anywhere from half a minute to three minutes of rest this might be five sets of pushups done getting your maximum push up for some people that might be zero and you have to do it knees down for some people it might be ten push ups for some people might be twenty five but y could go all the way up to a hundred rest anywhere from thirty to a hundred eighty seconds and then do your next set for a total of three to five sets does not actually sound a tonnes work the other thing you could do is something a plank a plank position is actually a way to build muscular endurance not strength of it is ism sure it could be used to develop strength but it is really about muscular endurance so you would do three to five sets of planks those planks would probably even because your not doing repetitions it is an ice some metric hold as we say as conostatic hold or a wallet would be another example and you would do that probably for a minute or two minutes take some rest of anywhere from thirty sixty or a hundred eighty seconds and then repeat things pushing a sled pushups icemmetric planks am even pull ups those will all work and as with other forms of training you would want to do this until you approach failure or actually fail and where you're unable to perform another repetition that would mark the end of a set the one critical feature of building muscular endurance is that it has no major eccentric loading component now i have not talked much about eccentric and concentric loading but concentric loading is when you are shortening the muscle typically or lifting await and eccentric movements are when you are lengthening a muscle typically or lowering a wait if you do a pull up and you get your chin over the bar or a chin up that is the concentric portion of the effort and then as you lower yourself that is the e centric portion eccentric portion of resistance training of any kind whether not for endurance or for strength is one of the major causes of soreness some people will be more susceptible to of this to this scum me than others but it does create more damage in muscle fires muscular endurance and building muscular endurance should not include any movements that include major eccentric loads if your going to do pushups does not mean that you want a drop no smash your chest into the floor and by the way your chest should touch the ground on every push up that is a real push up o it is not about breaking ninety with the elbows it is about pushing down till your chests touch the floor and straightening out that is a proper push up and a pull up is where you pull your chin above the bar neither of those should include a slow eccentric are lowering component if you are using those to train muscular endurance the three to five sets of twelve to twenty five in may be even up to a hundred repetitions with thirty two hundred eighty seconds of rest and between that means that jumping also is going to be a very poor tool for building muscular endurance because jumping has a slowing down component as you land things cliometrics or agility work where you are moving from side to side and your decelerating your slowing yourself down allot not going to be good for muscular endurance terrific for cartyovasular training and conditioning of other kinds and skill training and n ability in all that but if you want to build muscular endurance you want to make your muscles able to do more work for longer it is going to be this three to five sets of twelve to a hundred raps thirty two hundred eighty seconds of mainly concentric movement ski not a a slow lowering phase or a every lowering phase that might be kettle bell swings and things of that work asymmetric as i mention things playing wallets will work now what is interesting about this is that it does not seem at all what people normally think of as endurance and yet it is been shown in nice quality previewed studies several of which are cited in the review i mention earlier that muscular endurance can improve our ability to engage in long bouts of what we call long duration low intensity endurance work this can support long runs it can support long swims and it can build also it can build postural strength end endurance simultaneously and that is mainly accomplish through isometric hols things plans are actually quite good for building insurance of the final erector muscles that provide posture of the abdominal muscles that are helpful for posture for being upright for the upper neck muscles and things o that sort we these days everyone seems to have ten neck everyone is basically staring at their toes all the time has a default towards their toes asymmetric holds can be very good for building muscular endurance you can spot people including yourself perhaps with poor muscular endurance in the postural muscles because any time they stop moving they have to lean against ta wall or their hip will move to one side or the always lean to one side i am guilty of this too some of you have actually pointed out i to think out of concern that i often m rubbing my lower back and indeed i have some a symmetries on my postural muscles some of which are probably genetic and some of which are provlegious from excessive work or s something of that sort that have my right shoulder set lower than my left and thinks that sort if i were wanted to improve those i could improve those by really focussing on symmetry and asymmetric that symmetry meaning hold my holding my hands at equivalent positions in planks and doing asymmetric holds for building muscular endurance of the postal muscles but this can also be done with as i mention meatball swings for the lower back an legs and posterior chain there number of different exercise you could do this with but it should be compound exercises mainly it is rare for people to do this kind of muscular endurance work specifically for things bicep curls or triceps and there are not many activities that really rely on isolation of those muscles of repeatedly i ad's tart ism sure there are somehow there but it is con hard to imagine you can o this with isometrics you can do this with or standard non asymmetric type movements but make sure there is not a strong eccentric load s now let's talk about the science briefly of why this works well that takes us back to this issue of fuel utilization and what fails if we were say of a let say you do a plank a and your planking for may be your able to plank for a minute or two minutes or three minutes at some point you will fail you are not going to fail because the heart gives out you are not going to fail because a you cannot get enough oxygen because you can breathe while you are doing that you are going to fail because of local muscular failure which means that as you do if you choose to do this protocol of three to five sets et center et camera to build muscular endurance mainly what you are going to be building is you are going to be building the ability of your mite conduit to use oxygen to generate energy locally and that its something called mitacondrual respiration respiration because of the the involvement of oxygen and it is also going to be increasing the extent to which the neurons control the muscles and provide a stimulus for the muscles to contract but this is independent of power and strength kiss even though the the low sets three to five sets and the fact that you are doing repetitions and you're going to failure you've though seems to resemble power and strength and hypertrophy typetraining it is distinctly different it is not going to generate strength hypertrophy an power it is going to mainly create this ability to endure to continually contract muscles or repeatedly contract muscles o kat continually for using i symmetricolds repeated repeatedly souse me if you are using repetition type exercise where there is a a contraction and an extension of the muscle eccentiay con a a concentric enemy centric portion but remember that you want the eccentric portion to be light and relatively fast not fast that you injure yourself but certainly not deliberately slow down it was recommended i should say by and gain that you not use olympic lifts for this because once you get past eight or twelve or twenty five repetitions especially form on those olympic lifts is ki for not getting injured and while some people can perform those sorts of of lifts likes snatches and dead lifts and cleans and jerks and overhead presses probably not a great idea if the goal is to push the body to points of fatigue because you do open yourself up to injury unless your very skill that doing that or you have a really good coach who can help be guide through those lifts that is one form of of endurance which is muscular endurance ans mainly going to rely on curl energy a nerves and muscle and it is not going to rely quite much on what is available in your blood your heart or your lungs now let us talk about the other extreme of endurance which is long duration endurance this is the type that people typically think about when they think about endurance you talking about a long run a long swim a long bride will how long will anywhere from twelve minutes to several hours or maybeven an entire day may be eight or nine hours of hiking or running or biking some people are actually doing those kind of really long events marathons for instance anything longer than twelve minute and this type of work builds on fuel utilization in the muscles it builds on the activity of neurons in the brain that are involved in what we call central pattern generators we talked about this in a previous episode or several previous episodesthese are groups of neurons that allow our body to engage in get regular rhythmic effort without having to think about the movement too much for running and stepping or swimming if you already know how to swim or peddling on a bike or walking upstairs and hiking you are not thinking about right left right left it is all carried out by central pattern generators this is going to be at less than hundred per cent of your maximum oxygen up take your via two male talk about what via too maxes but i just want to give us sense o what the protocol is and the underlying science how many sets one long duration effort is one set of twelve minutes or longer you are not counting repetitions i sure hope that if you are going out on a thirty minute on or even a fifteen minute run the you are not counting steps that you are not counting petal strokes that you are not on the rower counting pulls on the rower i suppose you could but i thing that will be pretty dreadful seems a poor utilization of cognitive brainspace your getting into regular repeated effort and your ability to continue that effort its going to be dependent mainly on the efficiency of the movement on your ability to strike a balance between the the movement itself the generation of the muscular movements that are required and fuel utilization across the different sources of nerve muscle blood heart and lungs let us ask the question why would you fail on a long run why would you quit well as you set out on that long run assuming you have some glikagen in your liver and in your muscles you are going to use that energy first even of it is very low intensity guess were not town about sprinting or talking about heading out the door or starting off on a marathon you are starting to assuming you have some conditioning or even if you do not you are going to burn carbohydrate you are going to burn glucose in the bloodstream you are going toe burn carbohydrate as those muscles contract those what we call slotrwich muscles are contracting to start burning up fuel to make eh t p to continue to contract your mind is going to use more or less energy depending on how much will power how much of a fight you have to get into with yourself in order to generate the effort i really wane to underscore this if you are somebody tit is thinking make i go for the run maybe i do not go for the run it'll do it at two o'clock relate two office no i only one to go on the half hour or maybe on the main hour and you are going through all that guess what you are burning up useful energy that you could use either for the run for example or for something else when we think about something hard when we ruminate when we purperseperate on a on an idea or on a decision we are burning nerd energy and nerd energy is glucose and at beneferon and all the things we talked about before will power in part is the ability to devote resources to things and part of that is making decisions to just either do it or not do it ism not of the just do it mind set i think there is a right time in a place to train but i also think that it is not good in other words it utilizes excessive resources to churn over decisions excessively and you probably burn as much cognitive energy deciding about weather or not to do a given training or not as you do in the actual training of we will talk more about ho this longduration effort can relate to mental performance but the u longdration effort should be one set twelve minutes or longer it could go for its thirty minutes or sixty minutes or an hour we will talk about programming later in the episode this is going to be less than a hundred percent of your maximum oxygen uptake your heart rate is nocking to be through the ceiling or maxedout but it is all about efficiency of movement that is what you are building when you go out for a run that is thirty minutes you are building the capacity to repeat that performance the next time while being more efficient actually burning less fuel and that might seem alibi counter intuitive but every time you do that run what you are doing as you are building up might cordial density it is not much about mite construal oxidation and respiration you are building up mitochondrial density you are actually increasing the amount of i t p that you can create for a given bout of effort you're becoming more efficient o a you are burning less fuel over all doing the same thing that is really what these long slow distance or long bouts of effort are really all about now why do this long duration effort why would you want to do it why is it good for you well it does something very important which is that it builds the capillary beds within muscles that's talk a little bit about musculature we have not done this too much a yet but if you have seen the episode on supercharging performance we talked about a v as these arteriovenous astemosies where blood moves from arteries directly into veins but that is unusual that only takes place in that called a glamorous skin of the of the palms the face in the bottoms of the feet typically for most all other areas of the body what happens is arteries bring blood to a given tissue a muscle and veins return that blood back to the heart there are exceptions but in general and between arteries in veins are these little tiny what are called capillary beds or microcapularies these are tiny little avenues little tiny streams and estuaries between the bigger arteries in veins now those are actually contained within muscle and what is amazing is that you can increase the number of them you can literally build new capillaries you can create new little streams within your muscles and the type of long duration effort that i was talking about before t twelve minutes or more of steady effort is very useful for doing that and is very useful for increasing the mite conduit the energy producing elements of the cells the actual muscle cells and the reason is when blood drive to muscles it has oxygen the muscles are getting awesome of that oxygen and then some of the deoxygenate blood is going to be sent back to the heart and to the lungs now the more capillaries that you build into those muscles the more oxygen available to those muscles i do not want to get too much into the physics of a fluid flow but basically it is the difference between taking a hose and sticking into some dirt a just directly and turning on the coset at a given rate a the spigot rather ore having a bunch of little hoses a sprinkler system that go out and irrigate the whole yard the irrigation is equivalent to this capillary bed system and it is very good at using energy sources within blood the simple way to think about this is when you go out for a run let sates the first run you have done for while you out for twelve or fifteen minutes and somewhere right around twenty minutes that is it i just cannot continue well when you come back the next time to do that run you have built endurant largely because you have built these capillary beds you have expanded these little streams in which blood can deliver oxygen to the muscles and it is going to feel relatively straightforward to either go a little bit quicker for the same duration the same distance or to extend that run for another five to ten minute this long duration work unlike muscular endurance planks and everything that we are talking about before is really about building the capillary systems and the mitochondria the energy utilization systems within the muscles themselves and that is very important understand it is distinctly different than say building the neurons that fire the muscles the neurons are already there there can a fire those muscles just find in fact if your life depended on it to day you could probably run a marathon you probably get injured it would be very psychologically and physically painful i do not recommend you do that unless you are trained for it but if you were to train properly for it if you were to do long duration bouts of effort once or twice a week or three times a week pretty soon it would become easy because your building these vascular microbes or fibrovascular beds as there called case you are able to bring more energy to the muscles andtheyre able to utilize more energy that is long durations s we have got muscular n durance and were got long duration endurance and then therefore two kinds in between that in recent years have gotten a lot of attention and excitement but most people are not distinguishing between these two kinds of endurance and that is a shame because in failing to distinguish between the two kinds of what we call high intensity training sometimes called high intensity interval training most people perhaps you are not getting nearly as much physical and mental benefit out of high intense training as you could i want to talk about the two kinds of high intensity interval training and what each of them does for your brain and body and what sorts of adaptations they cause because in doing that you can really start to build up specific energy systems in your brain and body in ways that are best serve you for sure cognitive work and for other sorts of things strength and speed or hypertrophy or for running marathons for that matter there are two kinds of high intensity training for endurance sometimes called high intensity interval training one is anerobic called anerobic endurance for no oxygen and the other is aerobic endurance both of which qualify as h i it hyintensy interval training let us talk about anerobic endurance first anerobic endurance from a protocol perspective is going to be three to twelve sets and these repetitions and it'll talk what with the repetitions are are going to be performed at whatever speed allows you to complete the work in good safe for so could be fast could be slow as the work continues your repetitions may slow down or it may speed up chanzartsz kin a slow downs what is this work what are the sets look remember long slow distance is one set muscular endurance is three to five sets high intensity anaerobic endurance is going to be somewhere between three and twelve sets and it is going to have a ratio of work to rest of anywhere from three to one to one to five what would a three to one ratio set look well it is going to be thirty seconds of hard peddling on the bike for instance or running or on the rower these are just examples at could be in the pool swimming it could be any number of things or air squats or or weighted squats if you will provided now you can manage that thirty seconds on ten seconds off that is a very brief rest three to one is just a good example would be thirty seconds on ten seconds off the opposite extreme on that ratio be one to five twenty seconds on a hundred seconds off s you do the work for twenty seconds than you rest a hundred seconds now what is the difference what should you do three to one ratio thirty seconds on ten seconds off or should you do one to five twenty seconds on to a hundred seconds off will that will depend on whether not the quality of the movement is important to you let just take a look at the three to one ratio in the three to one ratio if you are going to do thirty seconds of hard peddling on a bike follow by ten seconds maybe one of these what they call a salt bikes and then you stop for ten seconds and then repeat chances are you will be able to do one two three for maybe even as many as twelve sets if your really in good condition the you will be able to do all those because peddling on the bike does not require a ton of skill and if yo do it incorrectly if your elbow flies out a little bit or something it is very unlikely that you will get injured unless it is really extreme of but the same movement done for instance with kettle bells thirty seconds on ten seconds off the first set will probably being good form the second one will be in pretty good form but let say your getting tote fifth and six set and you are going thirty seconds on ten seconds off chances are u the quality of your repetitions will degrade significantly and you increase the probability that you are going to get injured or that you are going to damage yourself in some way or that you cannot complete the movement or that some smaller muscles your grip muscles might give out of the quality of re petitions is going to drop con miserably with the three to one approach if you are just doing it for effort and will talk about what this builds in your system in a moment that is fine but for most people if quality of form is important maybe this is a using weights m maybe are doing squats you can do twenty seconds on and a hundred seconds of rest maybe it is even a barbel loaded squat maybe re doing kettle bells maybe you have got a some other resistance there that is allowing you to do this what you will find is that the longer rest even those twenty seconds of intense effort followed by a longer rest of about a hundred seconds will allow you to perform more quality repetitions safely over time what is building anaerobic endurance look and then it'll tell you what is actually good for in the true practical sense what anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks is that if you decide to do this for the first week you might do this two or three times a week maybeven just once a week depending on the other things your doing will talk about programming at the end and you would generate just three set it might be three sets of twenty seconds of hard effort followed by a hundred seconds rest than you repeat twenty second hart effort hundred seconds rest twenty seconds of effort her hundred seconds rest you might do that twice a week and then each week your adding one or two sets in doing that you will build up what we call anaerobic endurance what is anaerobic endurance will let us ask why we fail anaerobic endurance it is going to be taking your system into greater then one hundred per cent of your via two mass it is going to be taking your tartrate up very high and it is going to maximize your oxygen utilization systems that is going to have of effects that are going to lead to fatigue at some point in the work out and that fatigue will trigger in adaptation let us ask what adaptation its triggering well it is triggering both mite conceal respiration the ability of your mitochondria to generate more energy by using more oxygen because your bring in som your maxing out literally are getting above your via to mac your hitting that threshold of how much oxygen you can use in your system one of the adaptations will be that your mitochondria will shift such that they can use more oxygen and your going to also increase the capillary beds but not as much as your going to be able to increase the amount of neuron engagement of muscle normally when we start to hit fatigue when we are exhausted when we are breathing really hard because the systems of the body are linked and we there is a mental component to this as well a kind of motivational component after that third or fourth or six set of beyond twenty seconds on hundred seconds off or if your at the other extreme thirty seconds on an ten seconds off there is going to be a component of you want to stop and by pushing through and repeating another set safely of course what your doing is your training the neurons to be able to access more energy literally convert that into i t p and for the muscles the therefore to as us more energy and a t p and the adaptation is in the the mitacondrea's ability to use oxygen and this has tremendous carry over effects for other types of exercise while i know and appreciate that people are using high intend the interval training of this kind or similar in order to just burn fat do their workouts quote quote it is very useful for building a capacity to engage in short bouts of effort repeatedly to really lock in i do not use the word focus because it is not strictly mental focus but to be able to to generate short bouts of very intense work this can be beneficial in competitive sports or team sports where there is a sprinting component where the field opens up and you you to dribble the ball down the field for insane and shoot on goal or where your playing tennis and it is a long rally and then all of a sudden somebody really starts you no putting you back on your heels and you have to really make the maxim amount of effort to one to the net and to get the ball across that things of that sort of there are variety of places where there is carry over from this type of training but it does support insurance it is about muscle endurance it is about these muscles ability to generate a lot of force in the short term but repeatedly so that is the way to conceptualize this and it is different than maximum power even though it feels maximum effort it is not the same as building power and speed into muscles those are distinctly different protocols the key elements again are that your bringing your breathing and your oxygen realization way up above your man it is not quite hitting failure but your really pushing the system to the point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin another set you are not in surely psychologically ready it'll talk more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this sort can increase our hearts ability to deliver blood an oxygen our lungs another tissues ism going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what is happening at the level the heart but i want to make stay touch on the fourth protocol which is high intensity erotic conditioning hit has these two forms anerobic in a robin and you just heard about anerobic high intensity erotic conditioning also involves about three to twelve sets starting off of course with fewer sets as you regretting into this training and then extending into more sets as one perimeter you could expand has again the same ratio of three to one s the thirty seconds contents seconds off for one to five twenty seconds on a hundred seconds off or a very powerful tool for building up a robin conditioning is a one to one ratio one to one ratio is powerful for building on average most of the energy systems involving member we have these nerve muscle blood hart and lungs a one to a one to one ratio might be you run a mile and however long that takes let us say it takes you six minutes or seven minutes than you rest for an equivalent amount of time then you repeat and then you rest for an equivalent amount of times you might run first miles let say seven minutes than you rest for seven minutes than you run a mile again and i might take eight minutes an you rest for eight minutes and you continue that for a total of four miles of work for four miles of running work i should say or seven miles of work you can build this up many people find that using this type of training allows them to do things go run half marathons in marathons even though prior to the acetate they have never actually run a half marathon or marathon now that might seem incredible how could it be that running a mile on and then and then resting for running a mile than resting for an equivalent amount of time running a mile resting for equivalent amount of time for seven miles allows you to run continuously for thirteen miles or for twenty six miles well ism not discouraging people from ever doing the long duration en durance i think that is very important but it is because it builds up many of these energy utilization systems it really teaches you to en engage use me the nerve to muscle firing it improves eight p and might a construal function in muscle it allows the blood to deliver more oxygen to the muscle end to your brain and it'll explain how that is and it allows your heart to deliver more oxygen over all and it builds a tremendous lung capacity and we will talk about exactly how to breathe an how to build lung capacity both for sake of warming up and per performance what would this look and when should you do this om well it is really a question for these work outs of asking how much work can one do in eight to twelve minutes right and then rest and then repeat how much work can you do for eight to twelveminute than rest an then repeat and how many times she do this well this is the sort of thing it is pretty intense and you would probably only ane to do this two may be three times a week if you are not doing many other things i will talk about how this programmed can be moved in with other forms of training bail just give you little hint now it is very clear and it is described in the review article refer to and we will link another article as well that concurrent training doing straight training end thy endurance training of any of the four kind them describing to day can be done you can program those in the same week but you want to get for an ideally six or even better twenty four hours between these work outs because it is very hard for instant do a one to one mile repeats run a mile rest for equivalent time run a mile rest for equivalent time to do that two or three times a week and also do weight training before or do a long run afterwards that would quickly lead to break down for most people unless you have very very good energyutilization systems the really kind of advanced a a let athlete candor a dare i say your using tools to enhance your performance at the level of blood or hormones and now maxing a talk about those at the end and why they work we have four kinds of endurance muscular endurance we have long duration endurance we have high intense interval training of two kinds anerobic and erotic and this last type the erotic one works best it seems if you can't do this one to one ratio how would you use these and what are they actually doing let us talk about the heart and the lungs and oxygen because that is something that we can all benefit from understanding and it will become very clear in that discussion why this type of training is very useful even for nonathletic in order to improve oxygenation an and energy utilization of the brain and the heart the brain and the heart are probably the two most important systems that you need to take care of in your life yes your muscular we needs to be maintained if you want to build it that is up to you but you should try n maintain your musculature but maintaining or enhancing brain function and cart vascular function its absolutely clear are key for health and longevity in the short an long term and the sorts of training on talked about to day has been shown again and again and again to be very useful for enhancing the strength of the mind yes it'll talk about that as well as the health of the brain and the body let us talk about the sorts of adaptations that a happening in your brain and body that are beneficial in these different forms of training if you are breathing hard and your heart is beating hard this would be certainly in the high intensity anerobic and erotic conditioning cause you re getting up near your viotwomax in hyintenseeurobic conditioning and your exceeding your viotwo man in my intense anerobic conditioning what is going to happen is as of course your heart beats faster your blood is going to be circulating faster in principle oxygen utilization in muscles is going to go up and overtime not long very quickly what will happen when those capillary beds start to expand we talked about that but in addition because of the amount of blood that is being returned to the heart when you engage in these really intense bouts of effort repeatedly the amount of blood being returned to the heart actually causes an eccentric loading of one of the muscular walls of the heart your heart is muscles cardiac muscle we have skeleton muscle attached our bones in a cardiac muscle which is our heart when more blood is being returned to the heart because of the additional work that your muscles and nerves are doing it actually has the effect of creating an eccentric loading a kind of pushing of the will the left i realize ism not using the stricken aim here but i do not wan to get in to all the features of the structural features of the heart but the left vertical essentially getting slammed back and then having to push back and a kind of eccentric loading of the cardiac muscle and the muscle thickens but not because the heart thickens over all it is actually a strengthening of the cardiac muscle in a way that increases what we call stroke volume meaning as more blood is return to the heart there is an adaptation where the heart muscle actually get stronger and therefore can pump more blood per stroke per beat and as it does that it delivers because blood concontains glucose and oxygen and other things it delivers more fuel to your muscles which allows you to do yet more work per unit time case when we hear that oh you not a and has a ore maybe you have a nice low heart rate that maybe are one of these really extreme folks thirty or forty beats permitted although most people are sitting at fifty sixty seventy eighty that is your resting heart rate if you exercise regularly and you do long deration erotic work your heart rate will start to go down your resting heart rate it will increase the stroke volume of your heart if you do this high intensity type training where your hart is beating very hard maybe the one to one ratio a mile run repeats that i described a manage to you do that twice a week for three or four and i said it could go allwyat the twelve o sets which is a lot i do not recommend people start there pretty soon the stroke volume of your heart will really increase and as a consequence you can deliver more fuel to your muscles into your brain and you will notice that you can do more work meaning you can do the same work you ware doing a few days or weeks ago with relative ease your cognitive functioning will improve this has been shown again and again because there's an increase in musculature literally capillary beds within the brain the hippocampus areas that support memory but also areas of the brain that support respiration that support focus that support effort this is not often discussed but the ability to deliver more blood and therefore more glucose remember neurons run on glucose and oxygen to the brain is a big feature of why exercise of the kind of describing helps with brain function now weight training does have some positive effects on brain function also once a weight training on really a i should be more specific i really in referring to strength and hypertrophy training strength an hypertrophy training especially if its of the sort where you get into the burn as we talked about last episode and you start generating lactate as a hormonal signal that can benefit your brain et camera it can have positive effects on the brain and frankly there have not been as many studies of resistance training strength and hypertrophy training on brain function mainly be because most of those experiments are done in mice or primates non human primates i should say and a it is hard to get mice to do resistance training kind it shard to get humans to do resistance train it is dealing hard to get mice to do resistance train there always to do it but it is hard to get them to do say out three sets of eight on the dead lift and then do some curls and then do some chinos in this kind of thing came it is pretty easy to get a mouse to run on a treadmill and you can set the tension on that tread mill to make it that is easier or harder for the mouse to turn that wheel that is one of the reasons however it is very clear and you should now understand intuitively why the kind of standard strength and hypertrophy type work outs are not going to activate the blood oxygenation and the stroke volume increases for the heart that the sorts of training on talking about to day will it just does not have the same positive effects now that is not to say that if you just weight train that you will be dumber that you will lose ah your your memory over time you might but it is to say that insurance work in particular the high intensity and longderation work that have talked about to day the two intents protocols and the long duration work has been shown again and again and again to have positive effects on brain function not through the addition of now neurons sorry to break break it to you but that is not a major event in the exercised or non exercised human brain for reasons we can talk about in a future episode but it still has many passive effects through the delivery of things icy of one but also just through plain oxygenation of the brain and the way it promotes the development of microvasculature to develop to excuse me to redeliver neurons more nutrients if neurons do not get oxygen and glucose they do die unless there is another feel force heptanes which can replace the glucose if you do not give oxygen to neurons i you do not deliver enough to them you get what is call the ischemia you get little micro strokes the type of exercise on talking about to day engendering intense heartbeat increases provided that safe for you to do breathing hard that is going to deliver oxygen and blood increase stroke volume of the heart and is going to improve brain function this been supported by many many quality pe reviewed studies that is one form of positive adaptation i also talked about just sort of performance adaptations how doing high intense erotic conditioning of the mile repeats type training can actually improve your ability to do long bouts of intense work it also seems it dove tails or is compatible with resistance training that is aim towards strength and hypertrophy now in full disclosure the dadas seem to indicate that if people just weight train or train for strains of three raps a rest five minutes three raps of heavy weights et camera yet you will get much stronger than you would if you are doing things five rep actions up to twelve or twelve to twenty five raps in your what you are going out for long jogs there is always going to be a compromise in adaptations unfortunately it does seem you can do concurrent training as i mention before if you allow anywhere from four to six or ideally twenty four hours between work outs as i mention in the previous episode if you want to know if you are recovered from a work out a great way to do that is to apply the carbondoxi tolerance test which is four breaths in and out inhale exile inhale exile in had exile inhale exile than a big inhale and then a slow controlled exile if that slow controlled exhale is sixty seconds are longer it means that your parts sympathetic your calming nervous system is under your control and its likely i should say likely that systemically your whole nervous system has recovered from whatever it is that you have been doing and experiencing in life including work in relationships if not you might want to take a rest day dare i say or costelison is what he is ten now i think he is on is twelve thousand rest day a most people need i should say one to two full rest days per week i know their people can say that is ridiculous and of may b you have a amazing recovery abilities also depends on training intensity many people benefit from having one or two full rest days per week at least one some people do not need to but if you are not able to extend that exhale on the carbon an doc dioxide tolerance test past sixty seconds or forty five second sixty seconds chances are your called sympathetic nervous system your stress system is chronically elevated an you are not really putting the break on that system enough and that is a subconscious thing there are ways that you can accelerate recovery but i would encourage you to listen to the previous episode its time stamped for how to assess recovery how often to program these things will depend on the other things you are doing i think it is perfectly reasonable to do this type of training with other types of training andi'll talk about a variety of combinations of those toward the end of the episode i do want to talk about how to deliver more energy and oxygen these are tools that are extremely useful i believe and that are grounded in physiology the three things it'd to talk about or how to breathe what to do immediately after training and hydration and i promise i will get back into programming and sort of protocols but i these are vitally important to your ability to perform endurance work in particular and they are grounded in how neurons and blood and oxygen and your hart work together let us first talk about breathing or respiration we breathe a couple of different ways belestious remind ourselves why we breathe we breathe to bring oxygen and our system and we breathe to get rid of carbondoxide and we need both oxygen and carbondoxide in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work it is not that oxygen is good in carbondoxide is bad they have to be present in the appropriate ratios one thing that is very clear is our ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles into our brain is going to be important for our ability to generate muscular effort especially of the kind of was talking about to day but also weight training and other forms of skill based effort et camera and our ability to think if you are holding your breath for too long if your breathing too much if you're what they call overreaching or underbreathing if your shallow breathing if your mouth breathing these a all things that can really impede mental in physical perform ant split let us make it really simple and ten i promise to do if youyour episode all about respiration there two main sources of air for your body in its a coming in through you nose and incoming in through your mouth in general nasal breathing is better it scrubs the air of factorianvirases you have a microfilm in your nose that benefits there are number of reasons it is also just a more efficient system believe it or not even though it feels you can gulp more air with your mouth getting good at naval breathing is useful a gear system of the type that brimackensi and colleagues have developed i think is a good way to conceptualize this if you are doing long duration work trying do it all naval breathing if you have deviated septum it is problem as you do not nasal breathe enough mouth breathing is something that many people suffer from it cat your more prone to infections it is not as an fit efficient et camera there is a place for mouth breathing however its usually if you need to do a strong exile often times you can discard more volume through the mouth unless your very trained at nasal breathing if you are doing high intensity training a good wait to conceptualize this is to exhale on the man effort and then to inhale on the less intense part that might be as your generating the movement you in the concentric part of the movement you exhale right just on a bat swaying or something that or a fighter's a marshal artist do this differently depending on how they were train and the different purposes but the kind of or sh the kind of exhaling o during the effort and then inhaling on the portion of the repetition that is not the highest effort portion usually that is the eccentric phase of anything involving weights are rowing and things of that sort nasal breathing is great but as you increase the intensity of your endurance work you will need to in corporate the mouth a gear system would look something first gear would be just naval breathing or second year would also be just nasal breathing but with more effort third gear again power speed endurance has a lot more about this you can go to their web sight i thin it is a very intelligent way to conceptualize this a as you go into more man effort then your gain to you a third and forth and fifth year and at some point you are not thinking about nose or mouth you are just trying to hang on for dear life and complete the work safely and that means breathe through a whatever a orifice a works for you that is one aspect c nose verses mouth the other aspect is whether not you're using your ribs the intercostal muscles are these muscles that that the bravely had these you do not remarkable intercostal muscles a that allow you to lift the rib cage or the diaphragm which has a skeletal muscle that sits below the lungs just remind you when you inhale the diaphragm moves down when you hail the diaphragm a moves up oka here is something that most people do not do and would benefit tremendously from and i can say this because and galpanslab has done work on this exploring how warming up the intercostals and the nerve to diaphragm pathways before any kind of endurance work or in the first few minutes of endurance work can allow you to breathe more deeply and to delivermore oxygen to the blood and excuse me end to the muscles and to be able to do more work more efficiently what that involves is sometimes sitting sometimes standing and just really concentrating on two things we always here about how we should diaphragmatic breathed that means tour belly moves out when we inhale are tour stomach expand but also expanding the intercostals which means actually raising the ribs chest breathing we are all told that in yoga class do not breathed with your chest this but actually that is is warming up the intercostal muscles this is also a great way to generate a adrenalin if you do it a little bit intensely the say your feeling unmotivated to train i do not particularly doing endurance training until ism actually doing it a i i use in benefit from having a practice while just sit there and for about three minutes it'll just breathe very deeply trying to raise my chest as much as i can for maybe a minute and then expanding a contracting my diaphragm and expanding my stomach outward when i inhale by the end of that your actually delivering more oxygen to your system a my lab as looked at this in a totally different context and these was looked at in the context of physical performance warming up the breathing muscles should make sense given that you now know that muscles and neurons need glucose and they need oxygen in order to function and that is a great warm up you can also do this while walking or while getting on the bike and starting to peddle really trying to think about warming up the breathing system and then you can decide if you want to do pure nasal or commination of nasal and mouth breathing and on that something that we do not often hear about the other one a the other tool rather that i talked about in a previous epistle just mention again as some people when they do endurance type work they get a stitch in their side the if you they've got a side cramp very rarely is it actually a skeletal muss muscular cramp it is often times it is a referenced pain of the irenic nerve that enervates the liver the frantic nerve as responsible for the a movement of the diaphragm a it is a very important system but it has a number of what we call collateral it branches to other organs runs over other organs sometimes when we are breathing shallow and we are in physical motion and were engaging a physical effort will feel that side stitch when they got a cramped may be i dehydrated or if ma need to run with my hands over my heads my head souse me typically you can relieve that side cramp which is not to cramp at all that side stitch by doing the double inhale exhale really breathing deeply and then sneaking a little bit more air in that is a double kind of firing or what we call volley of action potential sent from the frantic nerve to the diaphragm which will also activate that collateral that branch literally of the nerve that enervates the liver and then when you exhale you offload a bunch of carbonioxide but if you repeat that a few times often fact for me every time but often what will happen is that side stitch will just naturally disappear just means you are not breathing properly your the afraid nerve is is firing in a way that is kind of aggravating that reference to pain there is nothing kind of loud or mysterious about this just has to do with the way that the different nerves a travel in the body as you set out on your run or may before going to do some a muscular endurance work or his intensity work warming up the intercostals warming up the diaphragm is is good and there there are exercises there is work that you can do to strengthen the intercostals and to strengthen the diaphragm during bouts of this kind of effort and i would say that one of the ways that you can do that best is by really focusing on getting the maximum diaphragmatic expansion and chest lifting what we are all told now not to do do not do not chest breathe belly breathe the intercostals are there for reason and they are perfectly good at filling your lungs that they work best when they collaborate with your diaphragm but when you are starting to fatigue to start to really inhale deeply and trying really expand those to deliver more oxygen to your system while were talking about delivering more oxygen to your system i wont a share with you a useful tool that will now make total sense mechanistically why it works which is often times when we are on a long run or in long duration bouts of effort we will hit the called wall i we will bonk i thin hey use to call tor may do to call at that costal he is asleep we bonk revs just t re think no we cannot continue it is a curious thing as to whether r not that curl or whether no its fuel based there is certainly on to be a psychological or motivational component but one way that you can reveal this kind of extra gear or the capacity to push on is by understanding the way that different muscle fibers use energy differently remember the fast which phosphocreatine system in the slow to which system that relies mainly on lipids and glucose o get well even if you do not remember all that if you have been running steadily for a long time your starting to fatigue and you feel its time to quit you may have not tapped into an alternative fuel source one thing that you can do is you can actually increase your speed this is also true of work were you doing repetitions with kettle bells or something you can start to increase your speed run fast or petals fast or row fast or swim faster not all out sprint but in doing that your shifting the the muscles and the nerves over towards utilizing a separate fuel source or a distinct fuel source maybe the phosphocretian system if it is a quick bout of intense a acceleration or maybe it is a commination of lipids and carbohydrates in your system that were not available to you prior now of course if you completely complete your liver glykage in you completely deplete everything you are only con be running on stored fuel and fats and a and a ventualyou startmentabolizing proline muscles of themselves but this is a kind of a a unique way to realize that oh you were not a you were not out of energy at all you were just over relying on one fuel source and this is the reason why especially eledathletes are starting to both rely on carbohydrates of the doing the whole care depletion than car loading thing their loading up their liver and their muscles with plenty of gliadin by eating posses and is and self before rases but they are also in getting ketones during races during long bouts of effort because ketones can be a quick form of energy there is no reason why you cannot use ketones if they are taken exogenistquytones and carbohydrate and in commination remember the body is accustomed to using multiple fuel sources fatyacits carbohydrates all these things it is only in the know kind of internal age that we think in terms of a your either kept or your burning sugar or your fat adapted or we or fat fasting or fast fasting or fat fitting dostella what when i said fat fitting ism not tiyumat you costello that the point is that your bodies used to using multiple fuel sources if your can of hitting that wall sometimes accelerating can actually allow you to tap into a new fuel source or commination of fuel sources just based on the was that muscles use fuel that is another tool the other thing that is really important to think about in terms of endurance type work is hydration and i think hydration is important for all forms of physical work and exercise not just endurance the deal with hydration is that we have been taught about hydration all wrong but let us remember what neurons work on what what do they use in order to fire well they certainly need water right we need water in our system i should say but they remember they use electrolyte sodium and potassium to generate those action potentials tactual get neurons to contract to be able o excuse me muscles to contract and for our brain to function and to be able to think typically typically we are going to lose anywhere from one to five pounds of water per hour of exercise and that is going to vary tremendously it is going tor very on weather it is going to very on intensity probably more five pounds if it is hot day and your exercising very intensely about one to five pounds per hour now how much you we if you think about your weight in pounds once you lose about one to four per cent of your body weight in water you are going to experience about a twenty to thirty per cent reduction in work capacity in durability to generate effort of any kind strength endurance et camera your are also going to experience a significant drop in your ability to think and perform mental operations hydration is key now many people have been told well if you urinate and your urine is clear well then you are hydrated enough sometimes that is true sometimes that is not true also and this is not a topic i enjoy a discussing but a urine is a biological phenomenon like a filtered blood a like to every once awhile if there is a kid and its a family friend it'll say did that your pea is actually filtered blood and the usually conto go wide eyed but then they go that is kind of cool that kits out this natural curiosity about blood and pea and stuff that is not am contaminated by hour a preconceived notions of those things being gross a because rein being filtered blood can give you some indication as to whether r not your hydrated enough or not and in order to really access that it is not going to be sufficient to urinate into another volume of water and assess whether not your urn is very dark er very lighted actual requires urinating into a small volume and sang well as at darker or lighter than before it is not something you really want end do most places a it that the etiquette of most a gems an environments is not suitable for that but one of the things that you can just you as you can figure well ism an to lose one to five pounds of water per hour you can show up to exercise reasonably hydrated with electrolight potassium sodium an magnesium are really key yes it is true you can dive from drinking too much water in particular because it forces you if you drink too much water you will estreat too many electrolytes in you brain will shut off you actually your heart will stop functioning properly s you do not want t over consume water to the extreme either but there are a number of equations that go in to figuring out how much water you need based on how intense your training at camera body size et camera just remember you burn you lose use me about one to five pounds of of water per hour depending on ow hot it isn't how intensely your exercising once your body weight drops by one to four per cents you can just figure it wealth you lose five pounds per hour you exercise for two hours let say you are about two hundred pounds that is about ten per cent one will you want a replace that before you very quickly or not ad you want ta replace at all long before you start experiencing this mass i twentieth thirty percent reduction in work capacity of muscles in the brain a simple formula what i call the gain equation hereafter refer to as the gain equation is a formula that gets you close to the exact amount that you would want that doctor and galloping came up with which is your body weight in pounds divided by the number thirty and that is how many ounces you should drink for every fifteen minutes of exercise once again the galop equation your tidy weight in pounds divided by thirty that is the amount of of fluid to drink in ounces i every fifteen minute of exercise now if you are sweating a lot you may need more ski if you are already very well hydrated you may need less but that is a good rule of thumb to begin and to start to understand the relationship between hydration and performance there is a phenomenon in which gastric emptying the ability to move stuff out of your got including water an electrolytes out of your got an into the blood stream en for delivery to the tissues of your body for effort is hindered when you get above seventy per cent of your via to man in other words when you are doing high intensity training sometimes people experience that investing water during intense training is difficult it is something that can be actually trained up it is a matter of learning to kind of relax the you are abdominal muscles and there some other aspects of adaptation that will allow you to drink during higher intensity work as galloping says do not trying in just fluids when your working out or competing it higher than seventy per sent of via to mats if you have never done it before you want a train up this capacity people can learn how to consume fluids during your race are consume fluids during bats of exercise that are very intense and lotpeuple do not want to do that was they do not wat to have to stop to urinate get camera but given the crucial roll of hydration for muscular performance and for brain performance it seems that if you're going to be doing a lot of high intense the interval training of the various counsel talked about to day or higintensy training of any kind that hydration is key and learning or in other words getting your system to adapt to ingesting fluids in the middle of these work out to something that seems beneficial at least to me in terms of the trade off between being dehydrated and the somewhat discomfort of may be drinking some fluid you sip small amounts of fluid initially and then you are able to take bigger and bigger gulps as time goes on an pretty soon o you are able to drink midst or a bascule me not midst i please do not do that between sets and your work out or while you are still breathing hard after a mile repeat or something that of that sort without much disruption or any at all to your performance last episode we talked about how to access recovery and things that you might want to do to improve recovery how exposure to ice was and cold showers can reduce inflammation which can be great for recovery but can inhibit some of the adaptations for strength and hypertrophy because inflammation is not good or bad inflammation is not a nice person or a me n person it is both it is a great thing for stimulating adaptations but you do not want it around too long and we suggested that you not do ice was within probably six hours of any training where the goal was high purchase hyperthafhr your strength training there is some evidence the getting yourself into an ice bath or cold shower after endurance training can actually improve the mitocondreol a aspects of endurance exercise that you can get improvements in mitochondrial density and you can get improvements in mumitacondrial respiration bi doing that afterwards attic can facilitate recovery that still a bit of a controversial area i do think that what i mention earlier that waiting at least six hours and probably more twenty four hours between work outs is a good idea that getting at least one full day of rest each week for some people that will be to i have to say ism one of these people that after two days of absolutely no exercise i do perform better consistently across all aspects of physical performance and mentally i feel better as well even though i loath to take those days off unless ism really exhausted it does seem a to help my training some people can train seven days a week in their fine i think it just as there is a lot of individual variation you want a work on sleep in maximizing sleep for recovery nutrition of course as well a i talked about sleep in the first four episodes of the pod cats if you have trouble with sleep definitely check out those episodes it is very clear and a number of sport steams a even some folks that i work with a and and gain in others are starting to incorporate a what is call the parasympathetic down regulation after training of any kind as a way to accelerate recovery and enable you to do more work in motherworts get back to work out sooner what is part sympathetic down regulation t means finishing your your training and instead of just hopping on the phone or hopping in your car and and a getting off to take five minutes minimum may be i dealing more ten or twenty but for sake of time five minutes minimum and doing just some slow pure nasal long hail devoted breathing or lying down in just kind of zoning out that it seems can accelerate recovery and allow you to get back into other types of work mental work or physical work more quickly which makes total cents because remember your nervous system and recovery and work is a local phenomenon which muscles were using we do not reusing your gluts your hands in your and your back or were using your shoulders et camera but it is also a systemic thing it is also about those neurons in the locust ceruminous that a releasing up and effed you want it quiet all that down after training you want a really fusion out think tortilla channel your inner costello and just hello out for five to twenty minutes and then move into the rest of your day five minutes should be manageable even it its just sitting in the car with your eyes close doing that down regulation breathing i think you will see big benefits in terms of allowing yourself to comeback sooner do more work over time i just perform feel better generally as well as be able to think about other things besides the just how much the previous work out and a beat up a couple more things i think ere o be useful and i do wanted just pack these in cause we are a closing out the month on physical performance and that is about programming and about pacing and the kind of mental aspects of endurance let us start with pacing and mental aspects of endurance i learn from a friend in colleague here is the podcast that whose very active in triathlon and marathon and other knows a lot about that whole world and the compete landscape there that pacing and literally physical pacers of a later on the ground or visualizing a or having a pace car or a pace runner in front is actually not aloud in many competitions and if those are present does not allow the race times to qualify as legitimate record holding times and that is very interesting to me because what we know is that the visual system has this capacity to switch back and forth between what we call panoramic vision were we are not really focus on anything things are just flowing past us or our eyes are just cone i down doubt i can do the straight now and you will not be able to tell but ism looking at the corners the from i see costello down there on the floor i see my a podcastime here and i can also see the microphone i can see myself in this environment that is panoramic vision whereas if i draw my eyes to one location right there in the center of the camera it is what is called a vengeance i movement ism contracting my visual window the contraction of the visual window when that is done is the same thing that would happen if i was tracking say a pace car or a pace runner or a later on the ground the mere bringing our eyes together to of what we call a vengeance point has the impact of triggering the activation of nerd circuits in the phallus things zone in sorta if your really want en with their names are of these granaries as well as in the brainstorm that activate the called alertness system things locus ceruminous was panoramic vision tends to bring us into states of relaxation you can actually leverages during your runs let us say your out for a long run or your swimming or your cycling this is probably easiest to imagine out of the water baby doing the water as well if you focus your attention on a landmark that you are going to run to you will find that it is much easier than if you do not actually have a set milestone or landmark that you are gong to run to however if you were to continue that repeatedly just going milestone after milestone after milestone you would feel more mentally fatigued and you would actually be able to degenerate less work over all one thing that can be useful is focussing on a milestone running to that milestone or biking whatever it does the activity happens to be and then dilating your field of view to relax this system and then continuing again an it is this kind of active contraction or of the visual window and then dilation of the visual window contraction the visual window allows you to generate more effort but there is a cost to doing that because neurons consume energy and now how they do that whereas dilation allows you to essentially be more efficient right now pacing is not allowed or having a pacer of visual pacer because it does allow you to access systems in the brain and body that allow you to create more energy more effort and i find it interesting that i think in a kind of subconscious genius the race officials and the the governing bodies of these of these races have said oka sure having u pacer there or some one in front you can draft offer them there is atshaly a kind of a a grow dynamic effect of having some one in front you that makes it easier to run in the was of their of their air stream to speak same as true in cycling says why the cycling teams are good at maneuvering an packs in very specific ways you can go faster with less effort if your drafting as it is called behind somebody but as well when you place your vision will allow you to generate more effort and it is interesting that they have taken out this kind of a a if you will performance enhancing tool i imagine and i have to imagine ins the appropriate word here that it good runners good cyclists have the ability to create a kind of pacer in their minds eye i have to imagine that there not just completely allowing their attention to drift although they do that when they want to be in highly efficient mod entering effort without having a tacks their mental capacity and remember mental capacity is curl energy and consumes glucose energy that they could devote to the function of their body but that when needed that they can focus their energy in and actually an of chase of mental pacer or pic milestone this is a mental game that you can play as well it is a little bit hard to do in the contacts of weight lifting in the gem it is more of a moving through space kind of thing but some people do this by counting rests et camera i think it is especially suitable for endurance type of exercise saucily done outside one there s i hate running on a treadmill is it just feels it is never ending and i have never tried one of these relation things i try and avoid looking at screens as much as i possibly can but if you try this next timeout are out for a run or win what you find is that you have a capacity to engage a system of higher energy output when you focus your eyes on a particular location but you want to use that judiciously because your goal of course is to become efficient at moving through space over time and not taking your brain and body to the point where you arrive at the end of that unless it is ray stay just completely tapped out that is a kind of interesting aspect of a running if you are a fan of running o which i am and you get the chance to look at any of the documentaries or docudramas made about souse me about steel prefontane it was clear that he was mostly in a battle with himself but that he was also a highly competitive individual and you will see this in some of his races i do encourage i look some of those up on on you to we see the docudramas they are quite good where he ran the the the essentially was twelve lapse on a track its essentially the five it is the five thousand meter race for century three three miles and he essentially try to print the who thing which is ridiculous actually knowing what today you'll realize that stove prefontaine easily was pulling from strength speed power must killer endurance long duration offer high intensity erotic anerobic is sort of try to maximize every fuel system and you will see that in the the races that he runs but that when runners are nearing the final lapse the call bellhop of a race they will often look to one another to see where somebody is obviously to assess their progression and how close somebody is but when somebody gets past oftentimes you will see some one access this mysterious kick this ability to tap in to some additional gear that allows them to run forward or faster when they themselves actually thought that they were mac out one could be running for the finished line they are convince there going to when they are going man effort at least they perceive man effort some one passes them and allow a sudden man effort has changed because of that visual target they are able to acts higher levels of speed and output and effort in performance they do not always catch up to that person and win but having a target a mile stone is a powerful way that we can generate more force and energy in anything and the visual system is the way that we bring those mile stones into our brain which then brings about a veneering which brings about neral firing which allows us to cuss whatever resources happen to be available to us i find this am fascinating because people often wonder where toes the kick come from where is this i kind of gift of an additional gear where's that deeper resource and we often express it and talk about it in and of psychological terms hart or will power or that something kind of got transplanted into us or descended into us and not to remove any of the spiritual aspects of of a sport or running or effort or the human a heart but it is very clear that the nervous system when it has a specific visual target can generate the sort intense effort that it could not otherwise and it sometimes even comes as as so prize to the person generating the effort i promise that i would talk about programming meaning when and how many times a week to do the various work outs related to endurance and how to merge those with other types of exercise that you might be doing for strength or yoga or other things that you might be doing work and other things unrelated exercise since that is a vast space with many different parameters and you all have different lives and life styles and backgrounds with fitness et camera what am going to do is ism going to put three different levels if you will or protocols that one could adopt in a link on the show note in the caption on future if you click on that link you will be able to see three possible comminations of endurance work strength and hypertrophy work or endurance work flexibility in hypertrophy work the are grounded in many of the major publications the doctor and gasping and colleagues and other people have described including this review that is also linked there on concurrent training and how one can use concurrent training meaning training for endurance training for straight training for hypertrophy training for all these different things without having to train constantly everyday twice a day et camera if you are interested in taking the protocols that you learned about in this episode and in previous episodes and combining those we have place them there for you as a completely zerocost resource please understand they are not wholly costello agrees they are not wholly there will be variation in terms of what people can tolerate what they have time for but i think they will serve as a useful guide line in getting started or in continuing with and expanding on existing endurance work strength work hypertrophy work and forth just really quickly we did not talk about supplements much to day in the previous episodes i talked about the phosphocretian system and supplementing with creatine talked about data alanine for and of moderate duration work you really the only things that have been shown to really improve in durance work it across the for varieties of endurance work i described to day a the they have essentially two forms one or stimulants things caffeine will defy improve endurance work and power output ah there is a little bit of evidence that canine intake can actually inhibit the function of the creating system but its that just one study a but that is interesting a if you want o read that study you can put a canine into examined out common an will take you to that study many people get sore after work outs an particular work outs that involve a lot of eccentric loading or work outs that are very novel where they have can a pushed it instead of a moving gradually as i suggest into say my intense anerobic an durance work of three sets of twenty seconds on hundred i cold rest maybe you get over ambitious and you do eight sets in which case you are extremely sore certain forms of magnesium in particular magnesium maleate m a l a t e have been shown to be useful for removing or reducing the amount of delayed on set muscle soreness that form of magnesium as distinctly different than the sorts of magnesium that are good for getting us into sleep things magnesium three inmate by alienate and then there's this whole a thing about beat a powder and beat juices and things that increased nytrococh side and allow for more vast dilation and therefor delivery of blood to muscle and durians and other tissues for long bouts of endurance work some people beat juice and the related compounds that increase argentine and canvas dilation some people do not some people do not feel good a when they take those some people also do not feel good when they take data alanine because it can give them this feeling of kind of a each e creep be call crawlers under the skin kind of the nayasin phenomenon the nayasin flush some people do not mind that or some people do not esperance that when it comes toe supplementation there is a lot of variety but magnesium mallet am has been shown to reduce soreness or sometimes that is good cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness things that sort but in general we focussed mainly today on behavioral tools you will notice that all of the tools are accessible without the need for a lots of equipment side in shay you need a rowers you need a kettle bell though those will work am and i hope i was able to illustrate for you that endurance is not just one thing it is not just the ability to go for long bouts of exercise of different kinds that there is also this mental component because of the way that neurons work and also that there are these different forms of endurance of muscular endurance that where you gan a fail cause of the muscles and muscle energy utilization and the nerves that enervate those muscles locally not because of a failure to bring in oxygen or blood whereas long duration effort its can be more about it being below your view to mass and your ability to be efficient for long bouts of more than twelve minutes of exercise one set as they say of twelve minutes to may be several hours a i should just mention with long duration type work it you and even imagine raking in the yard or mowing lawn opening on how big that lawn is i with yous to have a job when i was a kid mowing lawns in the it'll tell you a we did not have many neighbors with very big lawns but a the a few of em felt huge cause they were really convoluted if you are pushing that more and these were the old fashion movers not electric mess it is work that is also of the sort that we call long duration en durance work high intensity training will happen to yet other fuel forces and mechanisms as we learn to day if you are

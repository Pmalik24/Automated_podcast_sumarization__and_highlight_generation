former star baseball pitch or trover bower releases damning details concerning sexual assault allegations against him dona trump has to man had not to attend his sigil fraud trial and a person apparently named tailor swift is reportedly dating another person apparently named traves celli ism been their of this is the banish parrot show to day show posed baexspressvepien thousands my liters of already securedtheir network day tod join them express pepiandicom flash men the me two movement was predicated on one truth and a lot of lies the one truth is that men sometimes really mistreat women and women do not report that is treatment out of fear of retaliation and that man's crimes against women have stand the generations and been really terrible and that men have not been sufficiently punished for this not as a class individually therefore lot of cases which men abuse women and tat does not go reported because women do not coming forward those allegations cause the say go through the lime light and and men get away with it all of that is true and it was particularly true in holliwood which is where the me two movement originally started because the casting couch is indeed a thing in holliwood and that leads to sexual exploitation this has been a thing allwaysins the beginnings of holliwood in fact on have stockpot holliwood an go all the way back throughout human history what you see is that men with power very often abuse women that was then surrounded with a bigger lie and the bigger lie was believe all women me to which was the idea that virtually all women had been abused at sompoint o other which is not true was then surrounded with an even bigger li which is that any accusation was tanned amount to a conviction any time a women said that show abused by a man we had to take this not only seriously which we should but we had to pretend that no further evidence was necessary or needed no woman would under any circumstances lie about something this for any level of game in fact there would be no level of game that would be concomitant to actually explain why a woman would make a false accusation now there is no other area of human life owe makes such a a claim it just does not exist where in in accusation is tanned amount to proof we tried to do it a little bit in the united states over the past ten twenty years with regard to racial allegations and turns out that that just in sendivises people to make false racial allegations this taw you end up with the just smalt story all the same thing is true with regard to a movement that is predicated on the idea the no matter what a women says it must be true regardless of what the evidence shows now there bee a lot of cases of me two stories blowing up in in people's faces me two stories that that aren't really me two stories being blown out of proportion for example as hes sorry or me two allegations thereabout a man acting rudely or badly but do not really amount to sexual assault sexual violence and and gain that that sort of conflation that flattening out of all human behavior is stupid and wrong but the worst case that i have ever seen just broke to day this is the case of trover bowers or trover bower is a is a baseball pitcher he is earn hundreds willies of dollars playing baseball he was signed by the else dodgers backing twenty twenty one with three ear contract worth a hundred million dollars and he had been the the man stay of the rotation and in all g it of twenty twenty one suddenly there a a there is an accusation that came out that he had actually abused woman and this turned in to a few more accusations of sexual abuse the accusations broke on tune thirtieth twenty twenty one the passing in a police department confirmed to newsoutlets according to wiccapedia that bower was under investigation for the alleged assault of a sanders woman in may the woman was granted a temporary to mesic restraining order on tune twenty eighth alleging she had met bower on aril twenty first and that she ad been physically and actually assaulted by him on two separate occasions she alleged that he had sodomized er without consent puncture in the face choked her to the points of unconsciousness on may sixteenth she went the emergency room at alverado hospital where after her injuries were examined she meet with several detective from the san dingo police department smell be an response placed bower on administrative leave on jury second and the dodgers removed merchandise from that teem store that had bowers name on it bower said he had sexual consent with the accuser and that his accuser centime a ten message requesting he inflict pain on her he is an id certain specific aspects of the allegations on august twentieth a temporary restraining order against power was removed after bower was determine not to actually pose threat to the woman safety the judge found the woman was u was not ambiguous about wanting rough see in the parties first encounter and wanting rougher sect in the second encounter another bower had honored t e woman's boundaries when she set them am mel be then extended his leave for the rest of the season while they finished their in investigation decoder and then february a twenty twenty two the all county district attorney's office announced they wouldn't bring any criminal charge against bower now that should have already there origin lie a thousand red flags of this point in terms of this case because a restraining for is really easy to get if a woman accuses a man of a level of abuse the notion the she would not get a restraining order in the fella justice system is absurd mean though those orders are not hard to come by when t when it comes to when it comes to lost angels jurist prudence she did not get it was actually rejected you know could burden o proof e have to prove providing or to get a restrain or it is really really small the judge an actual not restraining were at abatis then the ale prosecutor's office which is looking to put famous people behind bars at this is how you make her name as a d in lot angels i man i one summered as a as a intern over at the lost angels district attorney major crimes divisions y no lot of people over there the the the idea that people in that office i non in enoghlike if they could get a slew dead to rights they would do it instead they dropped all charges in march twenty twenty two bower then filed the defamation lost end against newsmen and the athletic and a form reporter for the athletic named molinight in that loss would you dropped the detail that the athletic had suggested not just suggested reported openly that this lady's skull had ben fractured when in fact they had medical evidence hat herscull had not been fracture they suggested that it might have ben fractured and they already knew that by by technical data it was it had not ben fractured and all the rest a wether none of this stopped the m el b which is deadly afraid of controversy from them suspending him they unjust extend is leave for the remainder of the entire season they ten went forward and end it up suspending him that lake the longest suspension in man be history they a pining with a two season suspension this to be an aril of twenty twenty two two season lake over o three hundred and forty two games then up being down created later a hundred ninety four games or something in a statement lead commissioner rob mandrils had than investigation conducted by the ample came to the conclusion that bower's conduct violated the policy and warranted suspension the domestic violence policy the mel be did not reveal these specific conduct triggering the suspension a if you are just t a casual watcher of this particular case and you had not paid attention to the fact note straining or was granted an an paid attention to the fact the the prosecutors drop the case what you oud get because the anal be suspension is this i probably is repeat sexual assaulter and possible rabid that that that is what you would have gotten from this and now bower place in gean because amply in in the smell be because the suspension in fact as it turns out he now has the receipt bower sued the lady she count er sud because this what you do and get sued you very often counter sooner to off set the damage isn't to get reverse discovery and all the rest and due and it turns out that he now has the receipts and the receipts are unbelievably damming of this woman's claims we gets that momentarily first a company is looking

former ellidoger's picture truer bower and the sand ago woman who first accused him of sexual assault triggering the investigation that led to an on precedent to suspension from emerge have settled that civil loss suits outside of court with no money exchange between the parties the oman accuse bower of sexually assaulting her during two encounters in the spring of twenty twenty one prompting the former si long la ward winter to be placed on administrative leave that chi li ho om as later denied a permanent restraining order in alley superior court the d s office to plain to fill criminal charges we say but m l b which has the authority to apply punishment outside the criminal justice system and spoke to other women who made similar accusations then handed bower a three hundred twenty four game suspension in aril twenty twenty two and independent arbiter shortened it to a hundred a ninety four games bower sued the women for defamation in aril twenty twenty to women counters for sexual battery four months later the woman apparently will receive three hundred thousand dollars an insurance policy proceeds that would sent ache trust accounts to her lawyer's office according to an email from hill's lawyers provided by representative with bower all the delegation ended up being settled the money actually and changing hands now trover bower has now come forward with the actual receipt an this stuff is unbelievable to understand how unbeliever will the suffrage you first have to understand the nature of the allegations these are pictures then the woman reveal the the original accuser reveal one who just settled that she revealed to the pass these were unrelated photographs showing the alleged injuries saying that in in her lawyer said the damage could not possibly part of a consensual encounter and said look at this picture no one absolutely known can consent to this logically or legally temper baker seem continues to try to abuse in all victim they need to stop now and shows her with black eyes ant shows her with a bruised face and other sin this is why many people immediately jump to the conclusion that trover baker was guilty because i mean in a logical level shower who consents to being punched in the face during during a sexual encounter whom haunts that well now treverbower has come forward with ten messages that were found during discovery and video those sound during discovery and my goodness my goodness here here is here's some of what trier baker had to said next victim star picture for the dodgers a tax lens hell send to a friend before she ever even met me what should i steal she asked another an reference to visiting my house for the first time the answer take his money how my that work ism going to this house wednsday she said i already have my hooks in how i roll than after the first time we met that worth is fifty one mill she said you better secure the bag was the response but but how was she on to do that need bad to choke me out she said being an absolute horrid of try to get in on is fifty one million read another ten that after the second time we met for pod's pictured job mix told her you got to get this bag it'll give you fifty thousand wine replied her e a sponsor are at one point do you feel a tiny bit guilty not really she replied since that her legally as approach me most but times about coming to a financial settlement but as i have done since day one i refuse to par even a single sent in august of twenty twenty one when the hills claims were heard in court and during those legal proceedings critical information was deliberately and unlawfully concealed from me and my legatine information this video which was taken by lenses hill herself the morning after she clam she was brutally attacked an emotionally aromatized an desperate to get away from me and now we have the meditator there can be no dispute it was taken mere minutes before she left my house on the morning of may sixteenth twenty twenty w to folks pop er in the this for those who cannot see the actual tape this is her in bed the next morning turn her not boxer sleeping on their did the bed and there is nothing wrong tho race nothing she limp shows viciously assaulted brutally assault ted she is taking if a video of herself smiling grinning in bed not a mark on er which would suggest that some time between when she left his house and then went to the hospital some one else did the damage to her that she then a mean theaters nurses ho er saying that they never seen anybody who been pulverized in the general area the way that she was somebody function there the the video i me and he is got to meditate they set now he can finally speak about all of this she could theoretically still sue him for a defamation if this were false there is no evidence that this is false i mean this is the take it this is wild and means is wild he continues may sixteenth twenty twenty one without my knowledge or consent of course in it he consider lying in bad next three on sleeping smirking get the camera without a care in the world or any marks on her face i the you paints a pretty clear picture of what actually happened the evening of fifteenth and why the idea was originally concealed from us after hearing the evidence available to her judged can gold sultan found that line hill have misled the court she found her claims to be materially misleading i she denied her request for domestic violence for straining order and she found that no sexual assault or nonconsentual conduct took place now some of you might not know about restraining what her hearings i know i did not but i have since learned that ta it is extremely rare for a request for a restraining for her to be denied because the standard of proof that you need to obtain one is extremely well pray about that i is o you can make about what you will the fact is i was never arrested i was never charged with t a crime and i won the only legal proving that took place without my side of the story even being heard and most importantly as at did from did one i never sexually assault of lends hill or any one else for that matter i soot her which prompted end at course me quite frankly regardless of the iucommin court i paid significantly more legalizes that sense hill could ever in case he continues long's legs wit the evidence there is astonishing actual text before she went over to his house before she knew him saying that he is worth wat of money and she was going to go after him and there other accusations that have now been made against her about as one in tune of this year in which an prison a woman according to the assocsiy and press accuse bower of sexual assault alleging n a loss who updated this week he held a life to her throat in choke proud until she passed out during a rape therefor pregnant but bow was never arrested er charged he is now counts ordure denying the allegations accusing the woman of taking the pregnancy in trying to extort money from him in the first place the player's agents see to statement this woman is unhinged he said she made several million dollar demansagainst bower over two years prompting him to viola criminal complaint against her andapparently bower did fix a criminal complaint in canary alleging that the woman was trying to extort him again this burin lies the problem with the entire mention movement there is no such ting as believe all women when women make accusations this end actually completely degrades the actual reality of sexual assault and rape and if a woman goes after a man this way she should pay whatever penalty shoos attempting to get from criminally is what she should receive if show a temp thing you get a ten year jail sentence for him for rape she should go o jo fortenurs because the this sort of tub has to stop o behalf of great victims and of behalf of people are being falsely accused it is disgusting and is vile and its gross and the fact these still of headlines now there treating trover bower as a disgraced person despite the fact that now this evidence has been revealed it is pretty damn telling it really really is now it'll get you sort of the interpersonal lessons here in just one moment first let us talk about living a healthy life style ism on the robalo means ism not really getting as many fruits and vegetables in normally would cause i got say the restaurants yer are unbelievable with that said the balance of nature fruits and pages that i reason everyday are more and more important their great way to assure getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day through balance of nature's advance could vacant process the vitamins minerals and fit neutrino of the fruits in venues are preserved to get that vital nutrition in every capsid balance of nature's a whole flat supplement with no additives fillers extracts synthetics pussies or adisugar the only thing in her capsule is pure fruits and veggies balance of nature sent to bunch of the product down to the studio for my team to try everybody loves them producer's act brought his balance of nature quit very capsids here to usually takes those daily have ben taking them as well their your i can head on over to balance of nature dot come use promacochul per for thirty five percent off your first order as a preferred customer that is balance of nature dot come promo cot should per for thirty five per cent off your first preferred order and again it is it is can be great for you it is can make a feel better go check mouthing out bounce of natured to come and at thirty five percent off that first preferred order o came they're a few societal lessons to be learned here is the first is believe a woman is nonsense it is garbage o kat you can believe some women credible women who have actual evidence we shall believe those people however this notion that in accusation is just ta conviction is ridiculous immoral and bad as tom or one number two this a lesson for you gentlemen stop having sex of grand women don't to it it is stupid this particularly true if you have not be a prominent person with lot of money i know we shouldn't have to say the sort of s up it this is the morality that our society has now created because here is the thing any society in which consent is the highest value is going to lead to the degradation of the sex act it just is i do not mean that consent is important it is it is necessary but not sufficient because sufficient would be commitment sufficient would be love sufficient would be long turn relationship ballad be the stuff that is sufficient necessary is one component of sufficient but it is not the entirety of course you need consent datslik a baseline for anything but the problemman toucan have consent at trover bower apparently did for all this according to a judge and it does not matter because it did not take place in the context of a committed relationship in any way and there is no way for trover bower protect himself against these sorts of accusations when you throw away traditional morality and you substituted if i a a culture of consent and consent is incredibly malleable people can remove it post fact this one of things that we have now learned in america sit i f women regrets a thing happening to her if she contends to seas just does not n the next morning that turns into a me two story now if that is the way that that were on to roll that means that the only real solution is go back to something that remotely resembles traditional morality we have a a peculiar society in which it is considered absolutely behavior beyond reproach should go to a man's house at three o'clock in the morning con sent to sex with him and the next morning divide he did not it that is considered absolutely morally meritorious where's if you are might pen any sillier here is the gel ism not going meet with a woman alone who is not my wife in a room with a closed door that is considered very bad very very terrible very sexes in fact because how dare he he cannot have a both ways as not the way any this works but this the society that we have created because when you get beyond traditional morality in the sexual realm there is no rule system that actually can be followed that it is capable of hemming in people's behavior again committed relationships and sex within them is the best insurance against this sort of suffer both men and women but it something that we is city have completely discarded in the name of sexual hedonism and again consent it turns out it is not the whole ball ax tit is part of the ball of accident it is an important part the ball acts wit there needs to be more if if you wish to guaranty that this has not happened to you again reminder do not pick up people on tinder and screw them this is not again you're nave b a bible believer to believe this all you have to believes in intense of structures and as particularly true if you are very rich and very memos i member a few years back henry cavil suggested that dating was really really difficult because again he is very very rich and he is very very famous and he suggested that he could not just go out grand on women or go home with grand women because what could happen next and he is right about that in in the name of caution famous men should definitely be very careful about this sort of behavior because the notion again that they are not womenwho are out there targeting them is ridiculous this is a particular case in point as far as i ell be as far as other institutions there needs to be a standard that is set with regard to these institutions which is that unless there is a criminal conviction in these cases in accusation cannot be tank amount to landing somebody is career it cannot be we have criminal procedures for these sorts of things allegations can not remove hundreds of millions of dollarsfom a person's bottom line i hopetever hours is living hall that all be over thus i really hope it does because truth this cannot be the standard our con social media to this ran now to rustle bran maybe allegations are true if they are true the police are on it in written they are looking for women to testify they are looking for women to come forward with actual evidence if it turns out to be true retell should go to jail but if it is not the fact that you to be demonetizing him over allegations alone how exactly what sort of standard is that that harryspost to rebut any of that the answers you cannot that is exactly the standard that the far left would on these issues is that an accusation can destroy anybody's career enlist ism lucky ism an orthodox chi have we married since the time i was twenty the n have yours old now virgin and all my marriage ism ism not vulnerable to the sorts of charges but that is the whole problem any one can be vulnerable to the sorts of charges he is all it takes is an accusation it does not have to be real it does not have to be substantiated nothing and that is scary is all living hell and should be to men and women and it should also by the way be deeply insulting to come who have actually been sexually assaulted in sexually harm by men o we meanwhile donate trump is showing up in sort y shod up in court yesterday in manhagats that momentarily first reave a lot on our scattuals especially as parents right now soccer practice science fairs prepping four o the holidays goodness is he a a big thing offyour plate you put great meat your plate with good ranchers now again good ranchers makes amazing amazing cuts of stake they really do i man they got me a core stick one time in credible stake you care about what your family eats sodas good ranchers that is we they spent years building relationships of local farms to force thrust one hundred per cent america beef chicken pork and now wild caught sea food as well the best of the can an sea now can get conveniently deliver yeurador right now they're offering two years of free ground beef to any one who subscribes that is a four hundred eighty dollar value that is two years o free

today use my cot ben for twenty i kickoff and free ground brat for two years remember subscribed to any box to lock in your price on america best meat for two whole years as well that is good ranchers tot come to day use my cot ben for five under bucks an saving subscribed to good ranchers america meats delivered o case donate trump yesterday went to sort in manhattan according to the e your times he deed toward from the campaign trail on money to attend the opening of the civil trial in the we orca turn generals fraud case against him as his political teamed seeks to turn the spectacle in to a rally cry for supporters now trump has not been in the headlines for least a couple of leagues about his legal prevails every time he is it boosts him in the ratings which presumably is why he showed up in manhattan aftershock in manhattan again this is the bazar politics o the moment trumpwright now is trying to head off at the pass any possible consolidation of the rest of the twenty twenty four field his team his are to come on sad that they one nicks any possible future debates inside their publican party even hough he is not taking place cause he doesn't want any attention on any other candidate also he is now showing up in cord was a campaign ploy now two things as always can be to ones one donate trump is being absolutely railroaded in this near case he really is no one was damaged no one was damage in new york the lenders are not suing him the people who did business with him are to suing him the state of new york is not even alleging that they have losses because of him instead the state f new york is alleging that he engaged n a pattern of fraudulent behavior that damage no one and there is and they are grabbing his business is new york and taking control of them to the tone of two hundred fifty million dollars in liability baste on no damages which is crazy again if let us say that you and i going to a mortgage arrangement and i say to you listen i say my houses we twice what it's work an you kinin know that is true but you also know that ism good for my at and you also now that its good be in business with me see give me alone now you are not damaged ism not damage is that bad behave sure it is that is that frautulan behavior i mean according to low new york i be frautulan behavior is tat something the stake can punish who is the victim how many crimes does the state punish the are there truly victim less in the sense that everybody involved those exactly what is going on and it is a regular part of the business and if it is that the they go after people it cannot be that they only goeftor trump for this show me some precedent of how often this last is used in the absence of any damages even a ledge but that that is all true the other thing that estrus the dona's from his using this for political purposes every time he goes to court he knows that the america public at least on the right side of the isle rallies to his defense because we all see that to be ask and the way that the right rallies his defense is not by contributing to his legal fund instead the way that the right right rallies to is defenses by saying he should be the hominy which you get is a very weird form of rallying to his defense as i can believe two things one that he is being railroaded and too this does not make him stronger as a candidate against forbid because my chief priority is not using my vote as as some sort of loyalty pledge tan oral trump much forward he is using my votes to d feet jobidens when ism looking at is who is most likely to beat bison a drum and that involves making biding the issue because bison is the issue bison is not even alive he has terrible policies he will talk about of the fall out from some those policies and moment if we are time out trials frumps legal issues or not talking about as have sat a thousand times job in any case true showed up his in epic also shut up he was join by several of his political aids including wall mouth his cot defended in the federal case accusing him of mishandling classified at documents here is it dona trump talking about that taught i men he he says the clear aloud that then guff love bout trump is that his absolute transparent in every way here o us saying the apart out loud that that he is basically there for the bolls and i do not thin a pee to u is tiring i going is stand or if i worn leaving in all the palls or if i worst running i would have any i these case is i would be seen you this morning ut it'll been a lot of new be guns is a horrible thing ti happening to or tin try and wen got in in strain to way we no in i we o to i in me listen to this man and i tin most people gan people getting it i in thin the bones getting in eras every time the give me a takin i in i go up in the balls an that never happen be works ut this is is disgrace and you go vain is an turning genera because he is turning off everybody from coming in you know in o is take o we in the outlaw business unis is or plan new york he is right out all this by the way and it is also true that he is am that he is correct about the fact that if he were not re publican candidate again theywoud have left i gloomy he all these real estate years at their accusing him of false fine if he is been a real estate magnate in new york since he was doing more an laconic sulking main the the this is a amcerdainty and then trump continues he says this see just a continuation of the greatest witch hunt again not wrong this is a e o i o see o a is i a o o e o e o i o we e any a on on n on tiny a on eta a a is to very en oo o wrong a is ti o e gan t e went wnoani thin about e use this to en e go o we o one o a to i o o she cam back an i o n oo back a gan true again and this is wan we a i can i i than ye again all very true all that is true it is also true that democrats our itching to talk about the stuff literally all the time it is what they wish to talk about all the time and donate trump talking about it is not particularly beneficial to republicans in general and this is this the big robin here it also happens to be then other legal cases things are probablygan yet worse for trump not better according to signal the sultan county district attorney's offices now issue dispend to former new york police commissioner burn derrick to testify in the first to later this month in the case stemming from elections to version plots in georgia according to his lawyer car's lawyer is demanding the his clime be granted immunity and exchange for testifying pointing out the prosecutors indited indicated in theinnictment that kick was a coconspurator in the case he is not named in theindentment but he is consider to conspirator number five basically the idea here is that baric would be granted immunity in return for a testifying against donate trump is one to big promise the trump has a and this why the ego case in gorge is dangerous for trump is when you rap in a bunch of other people surrounding trump and then one having to be paying their legal bills than the temptation is going to be to cut a deal with the futon count o prosecutors get immunity and then testify against trump his leaving aside the document's case in flora all these legal issues are going to stack up against trump and trump championing them in the primaries to elevate him to the nomination if if he thinks yo can be able o turn off that spigot not talk about the stuff in the general that is wrong an this is going to be a chief issue in the general election bandit may be the only thing i can say bite because biding is struggling out there and that this it o between this and and trump continuing to to yo do what he can to alien ate urban women i does you have a path against byshuryis pay against bide me is bison is deeply unpopular her a lot of people might not show up for bide mean they just do not join very much and because a lot people know we all known our bones he is not going to sure out a second warm and comely hers will be precedent if jobidon is reelected all that may be true butt seems to me that if you can bat on a horse that is not week then that now be better it seems to me that if you're going to bet on a candidate you do not want a bat that the other gits con a fall down on the job your a bat on somebody who can beat him when he is at his strongest and right now ism not sure that that is what republicans are doing el over the week en for example donate trump spent the week en a dropping lines mocking pall policy nancy policy's husband at the californium grope main no his a ain to have to gest laughs inside a room e s joking but also is it the kind of stuff that is going to drive independence and as for risen women back into his came i i do not see how together we will ta on the use letting lies lose are perverse are or debowrin the a the ta i on up la a will stand up the crazy any ploy won san francisco how is your husband going bathe b a cheesy get building h waling up aldermen those as e was around our house which obviously din over good yob in i do not now poppulotest to with anything that that sort stuff gets played n ads and the entire biding case is going to be the tunnels from as in a various character that icon be the entire case for his reflect nothing about your biding nothing at his god president nothing that is all it is going to be and and the fact that that that trump it is he cannot make an affirmative case that actually draws people back to him peeling and he people levee love i en out word about those people worry about people who do not love him are they going to turn out in boat for him or the very least stay home and not vote for biding an that that is a risky play now is it possible that that could work out form sure because again jobidneits a terrible president will get to that in just one second the medical establishment has been disregarding the

can loose the jobitmal will somebody don to be wrong but robin's pussies continued fail when it comes to you crane they they keep wondering why it is that america supwhart is bleeding away from you crane they are bunch of reasons the number on reason is there is no offeramp here e as it presented no offrambutyou have suggested you will not present an offal hell you gets have suggested the bid an administration is as long as it takes with as mufti s it takes and you will not demand any sort of endpoint you you have no clue what winning even looks and turns out theamerican pool are not up for that you not else there not up for they're not up for pouring tons of money into the corruption rattle of the you cranial government it is one thing to pay for weaponry to repel a russia invasion it is one thing to give them old weaponry to take out russia troops to great russia military capacity and prevent rut china strongest ally from becoming stronger it is worth it to tot shade china from invading titan by pointing out that there will be repercussions for doing however when america are not up for it it spending billions of dollars rebuilding you crank an economy when that is a really corrupt place in let's plenty this out in the united states there is a laws ale the formcrup practices act if i go down to panama and i decide i want to build a hotel and any demands a bribe for me to build that hotel and i pay that bribe i will be prosecuted in the united states to america for having done that even if bringing jobs and economic growth to panama if however i am the federal government of the united states i to side to for billions of dollars into a corruption rattle in you crane then apparently that is totally vine if you do it on a personal level then you will go to jail if you do it is the federal government then not only s to find it is praiseworthy well now there is a let communication from the by n administration talking about corruption in you crane which ben a longstanding prom over there quote biding administration officials politico are far more worried about corruption an you crane than they publicly admit a confidential you a strategy document obtain n by political suggests the sensitive but in classified version of the long term gust plan they'd ow numerous steps washington is taking to help key but proud out malfeasant and otherwise reforming a ray of you craniansectors it stresses the corruption could cause western lies to abandon you cranes fight against cassia's invasion and that key that cannot put off the autograft effort perceptions of high level corruption the confidential version of the document says could under in the cranial public and form leader's confidence in the for time government they confidential version is about three times as long as the non confidential version the administration wants to press crane's autograph not least because it yest dollars are at stake they say there is some honest conversations happening behind the scenes but again this they are a lot of complaints over here about why as you crane not been more forthcoming about about firing people for graft apparently he has fired several top defense officials in a recent crack down on its supposed graft we will see if that is true or not and what what this does speak to is the fact that there is no long from static stray in crane the public part of the trade says d of garcazation particularly the energy in miningsectores the quartenent to building back abetter you crane one indicator of success the confidential merchant states is the cranial government embraces meaningful reforms the centralizing control of the energy sector wit can i i can i think of a cranial energy sector business that was being investigated for corruption and that was being presided over by a vice president whose only brisk drama ya came to mind turns out corruption you crane really bad you know who's deeply involves in corruption crane hunter bite you know who at was job jo was doing his v p at the time and who presiding over you crane policy all this is a little awkward wanting out corruption you crane does not just mean that support for the crane war goes down it also means pointing out that jobidnson was involved deeply in it failure on that front failure on the economic front failure on e e crane war front and also failure on the border front calf local governor of new york even she is out there now admitting pretty publicly the the borer is wide open well we want them to to have the limit om who can come across the border it is two open right now o people coming from all over the world are finding their way through simply thing may meed a phylum and the majority of them seem bending up an the strength that new york and that is the real problem for new york city one hundred and twenty five thousand newly arrived an nails i mean when even the governor of new york is calling you out that a serious problem for the about administration meanwhile crime continues to spiral out of control in america major cities and washington b s henry quasar who is a democratic congress person from texts was carjack to day in philadelphia which is dominated by left wing d a lady crater a journalist an josh cruder was shot seven times in his home in south philadelphia no rest had ben made no weapon was found he had recently written articles for wide variety of sources an due and apparently in writingabout that he talked about how the city of philadelphia was not being too easy on criminality it is its terrible and its awful in this his what happens when a city is too easy on criminality meanwhile on the federal front obomicar has been a giant fail jobidens chief achievement as vice president of the united states the big find ideology bean to fat has ben a complete failure good pa by making mac cartel over the washington post titled obomicar has been unable to save to money on u us help are quote given the high cost of the ushelfcar system into natural to assume there must be some easy way to make sizable cut after all in twenty twenty two the was spent sixteen point six per cent of g t p on help are the next highest spender germany spent twelve point seven per cent as the affordable carat took shape almost fifteen years ago it is architect started looking for savings in earnest all these years later we still haven't found the magic money p to this is notecase people are not trying a bmomicar contain a lot of elements that we expected to realize significant cost savings preventive care it was hoped could catch conditions early an forestall emergency expensive expensive emergency from visits doctors and hospitals can be paid to keep patients healthy rather than form expensive procedures there be a government board the could rigorously assess treatments fore cost effectiveness but instead the savings just give not materialized at all infant the called c m m i the sent for medical and medicate invasion would run which was supposed to run pilot projects to reduce costs instead and it a costing government five point for billion dollars expected to cost another one point rebellion dollars by twenty thirty prevent them cost turn out to cost more than its are because doctors may need to treat a lot of miner conditions to prevent one major serious health crisis expanding the number of insures of insured turns out to make emergency room visits rise not fall because newly insure people do not worry about the cost it increase his demand just you'd imagine if you look at any supply demand curve there are ways to save money but there to make people wait longer for taste of treatment again as have said for years and years for debate there is three elements of healthcare there is a portability there is universality and there is quality and you can only have to other three cannot have althorn that n in bright now the lie that boxcars can provide all three it was indeed elf basically everything democrats of touched on poly has turned to craft the democrats are rule vulnerable meanwhile re publicans again finding ways to pull the feet from the jaws of victory really is kind of an amazing thing in the twenty twenty to election cycles all about re publicans having all the momentsmen some how blowing all of it by nominating head cases that ex's a genius move well now democrats are blowing themselves up in congress hemal woman is making a fool of himself on every possible angle is the guy who decided to pull a fire alarm the other day in order forestall a vote on the continuing resolution then pretend that he thought the firemen as can open the door as the baboon be joked an next he is a going pull a firearm think that hes flushing his yearn an understand how that that works here is governor bathe going after small woman what is really interesting this is a former principle he knows what a fire alar her this is a mar that has got and yell that members and it has behave or it has been use e come but what is interesting if it really was just an accident when the capital place came to energy you why would you lawyer up right away her why why would not is tat all my guys mad o wit stake here why would you let it go on her hemal woman has now made another bourbon gan congressajus filled with clowns it is a clown show over there is basically a clown car the only question is how he can fit many clowns in the small space but hemal woman his people are now suggesting that i republicans are notes for asking about a quote i believe congressmen bowmen when he says this was an accident is this suggested response from bowman's office to questions about the incident republicans need to instead folks their energy on the nosy members of their party before anything else that is what hemal woman press secretary sent to all house democratic offices genius is happening her in these people are absolute geniuses gemalboman then had toe issue a tweet to crying his own office not i just become aware than our message in guidance there is in appropriate use of the terminate without my consent i condemn the use of the termnazi out of its precise definition it is important to specify the termnaza first members of the not party and neonates man that back he is he is good at is he is just these these left wingers there such geniuses there amazing at this probably republican should have a fight over the speakership i think the would be beneficial a this point when i say that i being as cynical as it is possible to be yesterday radiates who has been ripping on mac earthy for quit a while to to the floor to formerly move ahead with a vote to almsman earthy as speaker known as a motion to vacate he here he was yesterday explaining that he was going to a issue a motion vacate let me gat the start to extend job bison spending and job bison's policy priorities the speaker of the house have away to job bison the money for you crane that job bison want it is going to be difficult for my republican friends to keep calling president began feeble shall he continues to take speaker ma party's lunch money in every negotiation it is just and because of this because of maccarthy's supposed failings in not prying more saving spending out of out of gabion hesshould have his speakership challenges is going machetes there is on one promatcate acted to scuttle a betters he are two weeks ago that is better scowerdf involved in eight per cent discretionary cut in spending and out have ivy worst security provisions and said he settled that until last minute mac earthy cut a deal in which there is a clean see our absent you crane funding what exact what is the point of this on even understand what what a you what you seeking to achieve who is going to replace him see how the usual cast of characters andibigs from arizona saying that he cannot remain speaker and all the rester they have no one else in the wings waiting to do anything there over two hundred republicans in the house already do not support getting rid ma carting this just can be another humiliating vote take over and over and over if it actually gets past the motions to table which is going to be issued i assumed to stop gates is motion to suspend no bob good i he he was asked about mac farther speaker the representative from virgin who is allied with a with gates very often and he just kept ditching the question what your thoughts are are you going to support mandates of effort to remove by farther speaker could that play out this week well i win's just say that he what we saw happen yesterday was a rede a pass failure by republican leadership and frankly that is what anywhere was about what i most fake about that conjanywhere going to speaker contest is that we could not do what we dine the last ten fifth your republicans had majority which was to pass man your spending dell bills with a predominant majority o democrat but and that is what happened yesterday you want am ow well i was constant about him as figure as it's well record all that dor jane wary because of the fail yo past this is a repeat of those failures i guess were butt i guess i guess yous have made up your mind yet or e what what it better critic o governor earth for some time now why not say you are liking arms with backdates and you are right to customs speaker what is is it about personalities individuals this is about doing whats right by the country an gat no answer there because there is no plan there is no plan running headlong into walls is not a plans again whichever party stopped being moronic and insane first is going to win the next selection or maybe no one's gentlemen ever as that all then be insane endmeronic that is that is just on continue to be also a time for some things i in the some things that i hate things at that i today again i am over here in israel people very often ask me for you know hell your israel what is good israel book excellent book by gin i a rick iceman call that none shall make them afraid it slip biographies of eight people who been involved in the modern state of israel they range from theatre hurts to blind whitesmen the first president of the state of israel to men ow come began it is it is really good that the are really interesting burgraves you will learn things she did not know about all of these people even if you happen to be familiar with some the history if you do not know the history is a really good sort of way to examine is rally history and what is been happening over here again work the read and none shall make them afraid i a time for a thing that i hate why do people care about tailor swift an traves else an man i just do not understand this is eating up my twitterfeet every instrgrandposts about tailor swift an and traves else and i do not understand why ism supposed to care i do not i mean tailor swift is famous for literally writing a song about how she has a giant list of men that she has dated this is another person enlist to men that she is dating and there it con i no married i man i hate to break it to you they are not going to and if ism wrong of my then i will send them a recap bake boucaflowers of the wedding but far she dated a thousand men and she is married none of them and the reason for that is because the prospect of single free and clear tailor dating men is very lucrative you know happens when she gets married she loses money an are intensive laden society has i basically decided that women who settled down and have a happy marriage are less valuable at least when it comes to pop culture than women who data lot and maybe that is because there is the lure of well she is it maybe she will date you next she is not in a date you brow not can t happen what do you care and as far as the sort of will she is with a football player and it is the all america couple it is it is a singer and a football player and wow are not first of all the fact that the anofellows falling for this its cone to be superman when she dumps him and then she turns out to be u a basketbalphand or something that is going t that is can be mazes but also the fact that we are all suppose to pin are hopes for the romantic future on on tailor swift and traves else seems perverse to me ow no why in the world any one would would warm their idea of romance a round tailor swift who again is dated even from lie jag villain haul to john mayor two the ate remember back street boys some members about i ironist the story is in any case entire piece in the washington posted a tailor swift to traves kelly and a mono culture yearning for romance tragus is not quite right kellswift is not much better traveler is a

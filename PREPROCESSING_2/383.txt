welcome to the suberin lad guest series where i and an expert guest is a science in science pace to s i ma your supermen and om our professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day's episode is the third in the six episode series on fitness exercise and performance to day's episode is all about endurance and fat loss that is the specific proton calls required to achieve the four different kinds of endurance and how to maximize fat loss doctor and to yalopan gray to be back to day we are going to talk about endurance and ism very interested in this conversation because i many other people strive to get a certain amount of cartvascular work in each week maybe a long issjog may be a swim rite the body et camera but when i think about the word endurance the idea that almost immediately comes to mind is about doing something for a long period of time repeatedly but i have a feeling that there are other ways to trigger this adaptation that we call the endurance adaptation ism excited to learn about that ism also excite to learn about the fuel systems in the body that allow for endurance an other modes of repeated activity oh in order to keep things off it let you to frame the conversation by telling us what is endurance and are there indeed a large variety of ways to induce what we call this endurance adaptation sure the where want start actually here is is calling back to some the things we talked about our previous conversations which are really people h exercise for three reasons number want you want ta feel better number two you want ta look a certain way and he user three you want to beagle to do that for a long time rights you need the way that we say sports is little good feel good plague i want some sort of functionality to build a perform a certain way whatever that is for you you want to be able look a certain way that whatever that matters for you n the you want ta be to do that for a long time the it come to endurance we have a bunch of miss mere here which is the same thing with the strength training of resistance exercise side were we wanted to dispel the with that i lift waits only because i i want to gain muscle or play a sport and i want to do cardie because i want to either loose fat or for long health see and just we smash that with from the strength ring side i want u smash from the endurance training side there are many other reasons that you want to perform endurance training regardless of your goal right whether it is longevity whether toes performance or whether it is ascetics and were to i want ta cover all those reasons a exactly what to do a protocols of course and why those things are working that way in general though the quick answer is really endurance comes down to two independent factors factor number one is fatigue management an in factor number two is fueling and that is all tit really comes down to all the different types of training are going to reach a limitation which are either again your ability to deal with some sort of fatigue an that is generally a fatigue signal the other one is managing some sort of restriction of energy and put and a lot the boiler here is a lot of times people think it is a fueling issue and really it is a fatigue management vision or the opposite and to have a complete health spectrum regardless of whether your high performance they i typically deal with or general public you need to be able to do both man are fatigue as well as understand feel store that is really what were on to get into today fantastic i cannot wait before we die then ism going to ask you what i often ask people who are expert in their respective fields which is is there any non obvious tool or mechanism or total end mechanism that can allow people to access better endurance you when i thing about training for endurance again i thing about trying to run longer and longer each week or swim further and further and on but i do wonder whether not there are other forms of training that can amplify the endurance adaptation that i or most be will not perhaps do not think of as endurance short the what on answer this is if we look back and think about how we have answer that question with power and strength and force production it is really about how much can you produce maximize once what you are asking now is how can i repeat that same quality of performance if that is the case en durance really comes down to your ability to maintain proper mechanics that is going that the biggest way we can an increase your endurance exponentially very quickly is mechanical and this is starting with breathing and we need to be breathing properly we need to have proper poster and positions and then we need to be moving well efficiency is going to trump force always for endurance the other side of the equation is not that you can have a little bit of leaks in your mechanics and still squat well or jump high and be fine because you not have to suffer those consequences repeatedly right that is going to drain you over time a the quickest way to improvenurance is to and prove mechanics and mechanical thing out go after first is your breathing techniques your patten your entire approach as well as your posture and then from there the third one would be your movement technic is it possible to describe the best way to breathe when doing endurance training or is it far more complex than that and if it is far more complex than that than certainly we can get into it during to day's episode yet it is both of those i will give you quick answer though a lot off times you can cold of hit machine cot which is nasal breaking there there is plenty times when you do not want a raise breather do not need to near o death but just again is that he one tool that is a for ta a pretty general answer if you can do that a lot o times that will fix breathe mechanics just by the fault and we can may be talk about why that is later but that would be my sort of w one sentence pull point answer immediately have how to get my positions the second one would be simply looking at your posture wrist whether you are hon o bake or your a doing a lift or your running if you are literally a hunched over and your ribs or touching your fever or getting closer and closer a tends to happen on a bike or an assault thing somebody have seen recently this morning i was on the assault bike a doing a a sprint a and i asked and doctor gallant to a critique my form and anything else wan to critique that i could improve and he did comment on my rather sea shaped posture correct ism encourage me to a be more upright which i should proxy do now as well and he also cute me to the fact that during one minute sprint there is something that is quoting magic that happens rat about the forty second mark and i use that as a am as a milestone a to look for in indeed something does happen at the forty second into one minute sprint where all a sending it does seem to get much easier for reason that understand may be can it calls that but it certainly had nothing d with my posture my posture needs improvement yet you will yet am breathing mechanics and bring strategies a people tend to be overreaching early on and is is can lead to problems later having a more strategic breathing pattern i an approach it is again a very quick solution i know that we are going to die very deep into the mechanisms of energy a metabolism and endurance to day but as long as we are in a discussion about these a brief or tidbits of how to improve endurance are there any other ways to improve endurance that are of relatively short time investment even if they require a lot of a energy short the classic paradise re to find here is steady state long duration poset up against what a lot of folks will nowt call higher intensity interval training specifically and there is a lot of is conceptions here the quick answer s you need to be doing both and there is probably munch to stuff in between that you should be practicing if you honestly want a maximize those three factories we talked about at the beginning you need to be training across his full spectrum just i told you to train across the full spectrum of your lifting we want to be doing the same thing here are there independent special factors that can happen with the shorter time length her intense of absolutely there is also magic that happens on the other end of that spectrum it is very important that people do not just choose one side because what tends to happen is people either go with a o man to do thirty or forty five minutes of steady state stuff that is it or ism going o to the opposite which i may leave that stuff on a table not do it cause i only want to do high intents the intervals cause i can get it down in five minutes there is magic on both sides the equation we want to get into all that but just to answer your question directly there is a whole bunch o of things you can do am in under one minute that are convenient to do and there is a a wonderful set of papers ism out of a couple l laboratories in canada that that champion this idea that is called exercise snacks there is a bunch three a series of studies have been done here that are really interesting and that the have looked at a couple of things that are noteworthy one of em is a twenty second bout of all out work and this is actually done in workers an an office and what they have them do his run up stairs i believe it was about sixty steps is is what it took them something along the order of twenty seconds exactly and they repeated that ism about once every four hours really is you go to work you get you put you coffee your back down whatever you run up a flight upstairs twenty seconds later than you are a back to work at lunch and before you go home you so reputed there i and if you repeat that that is mostly times a week you going to do that i think they in whole the interventions it was three times a week for six weeks eighteen total times you did that and what you will see is ism a a noticeable improvement is statistically significant improvements an carry respiratory fitness specifically veal to macks as well as a number of cognitive benefits work productivity et camera that can happen an as little as twenty seconds you do not have to go to the him you do not have to show or you none have to do anything that just find the stairs i run up and down i a few times now you may have noticed ism you actually sort of caught me yesterday i did that right here right i have sit i and we he little bit of break i was feeling and energy all i ran up the stairs three or four times felt a lot better that can actually also help there an another study wit they looked at that following a giant high guy seems index meal and what they saw and they took insolent measures and and a whole bunch o a ism other biological markers associated that you want to be payatention with the high guy seems index meal and they looked at those immediately an hour or three hours six hours is upmost and it was very clear that same intervention was able to improve postman yet lost control insolent an a whole both to other factors ism in addition that if you are that sort of type who is wile ism in an office all day may be also how ta giant a high li seems cannot meal not the best approach but a little bit o mitigation there can just be running up a flight of stairs or doing something that for s little as twenty seconds there is a lot of magic and power in maximum exertion if one does not have access to a flight of stairs at work could they do jumping jacks absolute i mean you could do anything you really wanted am it is not the mode of exercise that matters here it is simply the exertion i you get up is as her as you can you could do herpes you cold do any number of things ism you cut sprint down your road down the hallway back and fourth i the mode is is just a somethngthat was easy for the scientist to control a ex number of steps people could do it you r to fall hurt yourself things that just to remind me it is once every four hours one minute a all as sac o twenty seconds use me a twenty seconds of e sensibly all out exertion yet while remaining safe not going fast up the stairs are doing coma racons a they to down the stairs up the stairs place a ask later do not count lest was they count if there a you are nous here if you're moving a if you are not remaining on the same the steps a infected in i port recently i saw somebody walking against the the the conveyer yet while talking on the phone while waiting for their flight to take off the its genius right it lot a l awkward ears yes but it's i have looked arguer and every airport have been inform the last fifteen years for these exactor since doing wild stuff that now will nothing's more awkward than not being able to walk to the end of the terminal simplycaus one is not familiar with walking that far carrying a couple of suit cases say yet that is a the other fit test nova six case carrier yet in the report i love this once every four hours twenty seconds wo may be once when arriving to work once four hours in and then four hours i must be a private work somewhere young e it plusterminest two hours now one thing actually really ant to make clear because you are audience is incredible i they tended to be really excited about these protocols they follow them exactly as written that is not exactly you science works it does not necessarily half to be every four hours is not half three three times at ate isn't half to be twenty seconds they literally built that protocol because it was truth trying terruplicate a realize scenario maybe u in an office building you are generally there for eight hours let us see if you did one every sort of i if you want to do it four times we great if you can do it only ten seconds amazing you are probably going to get the same benefits those not the details to panted to do the detail to pay attention to is every often multiple times a day try to get your horrid up really quickly does not require sweating as require anything else there's no warm up associated with it ism again you need a minute break and between meetings are whatever and you can spent up them i do this all the time in my house when your you have those days when you are in seven straight ours assumes et camera you can get out of twenty seconds i run to my garage which is over there i hop on the the air bike and i will just smash out thirty seconds as fast i can and walk right back gan love it yet a men a start yet just also you can just put one those things which i do also just put on in your office and hop over it of the the whole entire thing now literally takes twenty three seconds before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is also separate from doctor any gasping teaching and research rolls at castrate fullerton it is however part of our desire and effort to brings yourocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme we would to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is momentous momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality the youburmen lab podcast is proud to be partnering with momentous for several important reasons first of all as i mention their supplements are of extremely high quality second of all their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you are going to de up a supplementation protocol you are going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regiment for your goals in addition momentous supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the hubermnlapod cast listeners reside outside the united states if you to try the various supplements mention on the hubermanlabpodcast in particular supplements for forgot health for sleep optimization for focus as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery you can go to livemomentous spelled o u best that livmomentous doctor slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a program tat lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real time feed back on your blood locos using a continuous glucose monitor many people are aware that their blood sugar that is their blood glucose level is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body most people do not know however how different foods and for an activities including exercise or different temperature environments impact their blood locos levels and yet bloodlucos is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things i firstarted using levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods exercise and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood locos levels and have learned a tremendous amount from using levels it is taught me when best to eat what best to eat when best to exercise how best to exercise and how to modulate my entire schadual from work to exercise and even my sleep if your interest in learning more about levels in trying at continuous glucose monster yourself go to levels dot link slash supermen that is levels dot link slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by elements element is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium in potassium to optimize cellar functioning for mental and physical performance most people realize that hydration is key we need to ingest in out fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our sells and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios now of course people with prehipretension and my pretension need to be careful about their sodium take but what a lot of people do not realize is that if you drink coffin if you exercise and in particular if your falling o very clean diet that is not a lot of process foods which of course is a good thing chances are you are not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science backed ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one gram of sodium two hundred milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium and no sugar if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element dot come slash supermen to get a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elm went doctor slash he mermen to claim a free sample pack tell me about endurance what is endurance how do i get more endurance and how does it work when we think about endurance i would to open up the conversation to include more things than people generally do when they here the word endurant if we just think about what you typically ask your body to do or would to ask your body to do and we just walk through them it is going t be things this number when i want o have energy throughout the day that is actually form of endurance great i don't want to have these calls and fatigue and i want o feel fantastic as i move throughout my activities of daily living whatever those may be work exercise enjoinment nonpaying attention focus all that stop great that is one thing another thing you will want t ask your body to do is i want to be able to repeat some small effort in a muscle group and not and feel great about that this is what we generally call must ulnar endurance this is something i want to be able to lock up those ten flights of steps and my quads are not burning at the end of it right or it is even gives me energy another thing you will want ask your body to do is to be able to perform a tremendous amount of work for a longer period time something in the realm of you twenty to eighty seconds this could be something if you are surfing an you have got a paddle extremely hard for a minute to get on on topic wave or you aunt it you have got you are outriding your bike and you need bell to get up a hill in its very steep hill the is opening to take maximum efforts for some small amount of time an then you get back up there we tend to call that maximum aerobe capacity the maximount to work you can perform at a high rate for some amount a second to that maybe a minute past that is your ability to repeat and afford a kind that for something five to fifteen minutes and this is the example would be on a mile right some some intervale that which is a longer distance right that is going to be you maximum a robin capacity another thing yourecnt want your body to do is you call sustain position this is you want to beagle to sit in your chair at work and have perfect post your for twenty thirty forty minute right you ant to bel to stand and lying at a grocery store for fifteen minutes and not have a break down in post you on to be able to maintain position when you are writing your bike you are not collapsing you are doing any of these activities and you do not get hurt or lose efficiency simply because you could not sustain basic positions and what ever those shapes and position seem to be and then the last one is a a maximum distance you we not to beagle to go for a longer hike or hove just a long day at dizzy land for whatever it need to be and feel great at the end of it right the goal with all of these things is not can you just do them but can you do them and then you feel good afterward solder back in a right position where they give you energy you feel good about it and it is not to something you had to do in you regretted and you felt doubtful those the factors i think about when some one says i want better endurance is i n a w all backwards as ow can wen you sand durance what you mean and that is generally the things have come across as if you can handle all of those things you are going to feel your in fantastic shape you arguing to feel your recoveries going to be excellent and your physical performance in the him or an any this working activities you do will be enhanced given what you told us a obit earlier that endurance really reflects fatigue management and energy production how do each and both of those things relate to endurance at a mechanistic level yo really what ism mask is what is fatigue management and what is energy production in order to do that it is important that we understand all f those functional capacities that i just talked about they all have different points of failure in order to then work backwards and say well how do i optimize my performance an all those categories we need to go through each one a figure will we a i failing some of them are gong o be failing because of fatigue management and some of them will be family because of energy production issues if we walk through a little bit of how we make energy and how we handle fatigue then we got have a better understand of exactly what to do for each one these categories if you feel one them in particular is worse for you are lagging behind or if in general you just wan to improve all of them all right now on to make a little bit of a ninety degree turn here ism high to do with strategy the t i promise and ow wont ask a very simple question how do you lose weight i was taught that the calories in calories out thermodynamics of energy utilization governs most everything that is if ism investing less colonic energy than i burn then ism going to lose weight and if ism arresting exactly as much as i burn o maintain wait and if ism just more than i burn then it'll gainsaid sure that is the approach you would take what ism asking really is how ire you actually physically losing the weight my understanding is that we have different fuel sources in the body glycogen which is started muscle and liver body fat which is bored in mainly white anapest issue and which is subcutaneous an around our organs intravisoral fat and that we can also use proline as a fuel and than as i recall there is also a phosphor creating system and i think you are going to tell me that each of these systems is tapped in to on different time skills and perhaps according to different levels of exertion and ism certain that what i just said is not exhaustive but fully it is most or entirely correct pretty correct what is give got to do with thatloss at some points body fat stories adipose ataposites fat sells are going to start liberating fat as a fuel source and the stimulus for that ism assuming is going to be that other fuel source s are either pleaded or that the energy metabolic systems of the body i do not less he decide because they do not have their own consciousness or at are a or flisignor is our signalling in a way that registers that a body fat would be the optimal fuel source given how long or intent vendor intensely a given activity has been performed skate we have some sun to clean up there but we are still not really answer in the question how am i actually losing that body fat ah how is actually leaving the body correct a minerstanding is that it leaves the body through respiration a now we have some interesting things to talk about how am i actually losing fat the a respiration what the hell is out even me how is something that occupied this physical space on the side of me leaving my body through my mouth and that is the very clear answer there right which i ism sure you are chewed up to when you take a breath in you are generally breathing in oxygen o to some other things but will a stick toxin when you exhale you are breathing out seal to the difference between those two is that carbon molecule well one of the things that is important understand here is all of your carl hydrates which is tho that word itself is a carbon that has been hydrated it does a carbon molecule attached to a water molecule it is a simple chain of carbons your fat molecules are also change of carbon all of metabolism really in terms of energy production is simply trying to figure out a way to break those carbon bonds as a result we get energy from that we use that energy to create or molecule called a t p which is the central source of energy for any living being i that carbon is then floating around our free form which is bad news internally we have got to figure out a way to get that carbon out of our system all of energy promotion all o fatigue management really comes down to this corgis you have how are we handling carbon and how are we moving around the body and what we do is we do this sneaky things to another question i to ask people is why do we breathe well for two reasons a to bring oxygen into the system into offload carbon i oxide but the neural trigger for breathing is when carbondoxide it is a threshold level in the set of neurons in the brainstorm and elsewhere a activate the phrenic nerve of the gas reflects or commination of things and we in had or in had right a reduction of oxygen in take generally does not stimulate ventilation unless you are at altitude then that sort of changes right in general it is an elevation in seal to that is constimulate bringing of the only reason you bring in o too for the most pard is to get rid of the seal to oxygen is it a feel source it is not a way n is works to sing with fire by the way you have to have oxygen present for fire to going if house quest oxygen the fire will go out right that is to half of a how those fire extinguisher's work but we think then that means onion is the fuel it is not the fuel it is something entirely different it is a necessary or is a product that is necessary for the metabolic and process to actually occur right wee were kind of dancing around an idea here which is this carbon cycle of life what happens in plants is they generally will breathe in the opposite and breathe out the posit of human a plant will breathe in so to and exhale o to right this is why we have to have a certain amount of these things and ally in forests and trees an self to maintain this o to see to balance in our atmosphere we do the opposite we have this wonderful circle of life we breathe in o to breathe out seal to they do the opposite well what happens is because cargo hydrates are long chains of carbon and fats are as well general when we think about fats by the way it is important understand that structure a little bi if we think about tryclisterides it is a three carbon backbone chain of glider also one to three and horizontally running off of each one of those our fatty acid chains rat we form this structure that looks an e right the letter e three in the back and in three chains coming off of it each of those chains are called fatyacids in each of those fatyacids or a length of carbon right a number of carbons strung together however many carbons are there determines which type of fatyacid it is right isosteric acid can aulic any different number of things it is also what determines whether not is a moon saturated or pollen saturated is if am carbon requires the special thing call a double bond if there is a double bond across every carbon carbon tan their awfully saturated in your grate if there is any that are not double bonded and in fact an example if there is one that does not have a double bond that is now called mono unsaturated if there are many it is called pollen natural the is prison cons to all these thingsright in either case we are still talking long carbon chains what a plant will do is bring in carbon and then it has this wonderful ability to use energy from the sun called photo synthesis and it can take those carbons that it inhale and use the energy from the sun to form a bond now in our prior discussion when we are a going over hypertrophy we talked about the energy required to go through procaine synthesis that is because forming a new atom a new blond between dams often times takes energy in this cases it does the same thing happens here if a plant does not have oxygen or does not have carbon oxide in the air it has no fuel that was and think about it is that is what it eats in was to get nitrogen from the ground in the soil us we need o get nitrogen from our protein but fuel lies in ease to get carbon oxide then it needs sun to give it energy that i can actually form that bond right that is what it is getting its fuel from right if we think about a a classic a plant to produce the plant that produces either a starch or a fruit here is what happens it inhale that carbon in in it starts packing it away now in a quit vegetable what it does is it stores those things together and if we store that thing an we grow fruit o the bottom of it we tend to call those things stares right it is going to then take the carbon that is packed weight in its quit and send it up the tree and it is going actually do that by breaking it down into a smaller form of carbohydrate that we tend often call things sucrose an glucose it will ship that up the tree it will go off to the leaves and it will converted into the fruit and it is can eventually transform that stuff into smaller carbon things called fruits and if we think about the fruit are the sugar in fruit it is often in the form of fruits or sucrose or a combination in sometimes glucose we have these smaller carbon six carbon chains generally in the form of glucose that our being made from this larger storage of carbohydrates that we call starch right it is pack together your body does the exact same thing if it is a potato and it has a whole bunch of glucose packed away we call it starch if it is in your quadrate and we pack about a whole bunch of glucose away we now call it lichen if it is in your blood as that six carbon chain we call it glucose if it is in the tree and in the fruit we call it fruits right those are different molecules but that is effectively the same thing happy and the biology a the camistis is almost identical it just runs in the reverse order and that is why again at tubers and potatoes and stuff ten to be starches and fruits tend to be locos fruits sucks we have this wonderful circle of light the plants can survive on just breathing in the so to and then getting energy from the sun we do not have that ability at least to my knowledge to run through photo syntheses the only way we can get carbon into our system is tot actually in jest carbon which means we have to eat the starch the fruit the animal some other form of stored carbon to get that indoor system we then pack that away we put the carbohydrates as you mentioned earlier either in our liver our blood or in our muscles we put the fat generally in adipose tissue will put a little bit in muscle cells as in fromusclect reckless rides and en the proline will use as structure rant do different thing we do not to use protein as material our fuel it is it is better use o structure and what we have to do then is if all the sudden we realize that storage is getting too much in our body no the words were gaining too much weight we have to figure out how to get the carbons out of our body and that is metabolism right any time we are trying to break a carbon bonds though we can get energy to make a t p that is going a release the carbon out of our tissue and the blood we have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon molecule to makes so to we can hail it and put it back into the at other it is a beautiful description of the circle of life and energy utilization in the human body i have to ask the question that ism sure many people are wondering about which is if indeed we exhale these carbons and as it relates to fat loss that is the way that we lose fat if we are in a sumecoloric state for instance has it ever been explored as to wether or increasing the duration or intensity of exhales can accelerate fat loss ism a tailor the logical extension of what you described and here ism actually interested a equally in whether not the answer is yes as well as whether it could be no because i could imagine if the answer is yes well then there some interesting photo calls to emerge from that but that if it is no it will reveal to us some important bottle necks about metabolism and energegalization you ever seen those magicians who show up and a they can tell your mob's name or something that before you cops sic an sort of oh i don a pat the id me not to take us down a deep dive tension but i once went to the magic castle in loss evangelists and i was one the people called up front and a in an incredible magician a named an i think his name was one mind or something a i think that is right had me right my name on a card in a sharp been i ripped up the card i ripped it up i put it in my pocket and at the end of the ten or fifteen minute bowed of him doing a bunch of other tricks he asked me to look in my right shoe and under my foot in my right shoe was that card intact yes and it was no longer in my pocket and i swear my life i was not a a collaborator with the and to this day it is still gives me chills because it but i do not know how magic ye right magic well the reason i say that is have given that little speak that just gave you that countless times of my glasses and i was say ninepin for somtof the time as soon as i stop the very first question is kind list do a bunch of exhales loose fat which is wonderful cause i was really helping youwould do that and you ruled right into my trap you landed perfectly silent i look a a a magician ore here i feer i should look in my right shoe wright no i ask the question because it is it is the logical extension of what you laid out but i no biology to be on both a diabolical and critic but also exquisite in the way that things are arranged and you do not get something for nothing there are no free passes in physiology that is the same no free passes on the answer to question is yes along a hundred per cent yes in fact that is the only way to go about it you have two options you can invest less carbon or you can expel more carbon people always say color is in colors out it is really carbon an carbon out that is that is what a carry is right calories a mount of energy we get per breaking carbon bond it is really less in less more out less in is verily obvious whether that comes in any formant by the way this it is exactly why the percentage of your intake coming from fats or car dehydrate it such it does not really matter that much if you look at fat loss clinical trials you gets made have covered this wand lane was in here ism sure this is something he talks about a lot it does not matter is it is irrelevant because it is not about that there is nothing magic in those things they are different thy have differed physiologic responses everything is different right no out but in general it is simply about carbon an tie turns out fat has a lot more carbons parole then carnal hydrates do there is more calories parole and there if you the physical amount a fat needs to come in is smaller amount physical mount o carbohydrates hes coming i will codein is larger about but you can play any number of very high care lo fat what matters total calories your a get it is not the only thing that matters put y on om stand r some percentages in the way can g fat loss works fantastic high fat low car dehydrate why why why the all the things work because it is it about that it is about totaling take of carbon tolexvill absolutely can you lose fat by simply exhaling more in fact that is exactly what you did this morning when i hopped on the ear dine bike when you did anything right the question is can you think of a scenario in which you could have a bunch of increase rates of exaltation that helps an fallows sure anything of a lot of things to stimulate increase rates of stolen exhalation one thing could be simply going righting the versions can i literally do some breath portal calls where i force exile and lose fat and answers yes but what happens what happens if you do hi pereventilation training well my lave studies sickly cypeereventilation as one of our many a deliberate proven calls and one of the most prominent things that one observes is that levels of a adrenalin increase very quickly extremely quick people feel jittery anxious tress and unless they are consciously trying to anchor they are thinking about what that means and the benefits that to persisting typically they abort the sickle hyper ventilation photo call really quickly within seconds it you will feel tingling setting all kinds of things you are my pereventilating right and we could we a tocanauseum about how that changes everything from drawn to focus the whole bunch of things unfortunately a strategy of sitting around just exhaling more than you in had tactically helps you lose more fat but it is not going the last very on then the question is well how do i get no situation or scenario in which i can increase my rate of expiration where ism not on to pass out ism not going an all bring hypocapnean i procaine issues any idea of a situation in which you would have an enhance rate of expiation without wearing about passing out ta steady state exercise or notes ready state exercise lifting weights intervals moderate training repeated any of these things they all work equally for fat loss because all they are doing is increasing respirationary they are saying increase demand for energy increased exaltation that is the trick here and when you quite these things to that they have equal success in fat loss it does not matter theoretically where are you are getting it from and when we get into this idea of l whole of the best training strategies for fat loss it does not matter which one of these tactics you pick as long as you maintain consistent inherent over time because o this exact fact it does not matter if you are burning quoting quote fat in the exercise cession or if your burning care hydrates in the exercise session it is totally irrelevant to your net fat loss over time and now there is some significant misconceptions there avouch what i just talk and i would ut love to come back and walk through that more detail but that is the main take message here it will not matter what is coming in and it will not matter what is coming out because in either case it is the same rate of oxygen in and see to out that is the key metric and hopefully this helps a lot of people have some relief because there man you are tied up on what is the exact photo call for training for optimizing fat loss what is the exact nutritional intervention i need for fat loss and yen you wonder why all these different diets can work of actively and wonder why all these different training policies in o surely somebody who lost to munch weight in the only thing they did is they just started running there was no advance broke they just part a runningandthey ran five miles every day that works and then tomes of people who tried that n did lows anything and lot's people who went to i went to cardocabox in class lost was all i distorted doing intervals on my why why mysteriously you do all these things work there thermos have something had some spicy sense have to has to be going off in your brain were there has to be something mining these things and what is linking it is simply carbon exchange put yourself in a position in which you are exhaling more than you and in haling without passing out the other problem is if you were to simply do a breathing protocol will the rate of exhalation would go up after that you would correct and go in the ops at direction that is the problem is your net carbon the output over the course they is not i change unless you increase the demand for energy and that is how you get that negative state along these lines of exhaling carbons as the rout for fat loss it makes me wonder whether or not increasing one capacity is possible promising the answers yes yo and whet or not increasing one capacity is a good goal in route to enhancing fat lost essentially what i mask is if you can off load more see to the cate carbon is cur exhale are you a more efficient fat lost machine it is a wonderful thought and the answer would be now not something you worry about because if you were to a sal more carbon than actually needed now we are in a state of inefficiency your burning way more energy than needed to do your activity the hart has a metric called cardiac output this is in sciences we apbrevi this is cue for some odd reasons is either seel or cue and cardiac output is tartrate multiplied by stroke volume s company beat terminate your having as well as how much blood's coming out of it cardiac output is actually very specific to energy beats if you try to work around that it is just going to adjust itself what i mean by this is if you were able to increase your stroke volumes the amount of blood coming out per pomp you would automatically adjust to reduce your tartrate that you keep cardiac output exact to energetic demands your sort of pushing one in this of the spectrum but your body will pull the other one back to keep you at that exact same neutral all i if you look at if you think about party of scar adaptations to endurance training an any type of interns training a common thing people will understand is resting heartrahte and what that number is is just how many beasts terminate your having hen your sitting hare doing nothing a very positive adaptation is a lowering of that resting rate over time ism as general numbers what you will here is people will say things a a normal resting tartrate is between sixty to eighty beasts fermented and if any of the things have talked about i with the individuals i work with i do not work with anybody with disease just to de clarify that t i do not do anything with disease management treatment anything it is always about people who are in a good spot who want a optimize or get the next level whether this is professional athletes trying to to pay for physical performance or a the folks on our rapid health optimization programmed that feel good against not diseased off and a want o feelincredible one of the metrics were en to pay attention to is is resting hartwright it hears what happens as you improve your endurance your resting heartwright will go down if i see somebody over seventy beast for minute a unless something is going on you are not physically fit regardless of whether not that is jonquil within the normal of values i wont to see everybody some sixty beats percent or clothes right ism that does not a difficult thing to really get to for most people if you train a lot regardless of how you train intervals steady say does not matter that resting earthlight will come down but since energy demands at rest have not really changed cardiac couples states is same what happens is stroke volume does up literally likely trained your quadrastepts on the legistanto machine do get stronger you can produce more force for contraction the heart will do the exact same thing and as you are able to get more of the blood out of your heart per pump the heart realizes i do not need to pump is often that is the compensatory adaptation which is saying hay look i do not need to beat sixty times a minute i now need to be fifty five times a minute because ism getting the same amount of blood out per pump chill and this is why your resting tartrate goes down your resting stroke volume goes up but your cardiac output is identical that is not a good metric of fitness it is going to stay the same card allot will only a just per energetic changes i energy requirements in the acutemom right how much do i need go which is going to be determined by ventilation right how much air my bringing in an putting out that is going to sermon cardiac out put and that is on to determine workout if you were to do a sub maximal exercise ten when you are unfit when you are fit or when you're fit to where you are superfix at sub man you can to see the same thing cardiac carpet will be identical and you are li damn nothing happened but you are not realizing is your heart rate at that same work load is now lower and that is sufficiency because your stroke volume is higher where it gets people tripped up is that man because you may not see a much of a change at man ism becauseyou will not relieve you do not really seen increase in maxim hearty with fitness that is not a thing it hat maxim hart rate is not a good proxy for fit a unfit bring that ism stroke volume will get limited eventually by filling capacity of your heart i man has to have much time to fill up with blood before can contractagain an squeeze the blood out and when you have a heart rate if two hundred batsmen it that just does not leave much time to fill and it will not really push you pass that ism do not worry about tryingthe increase or maxima tartrate it is not necessarily good thing and will not really change but your cardiac call will because stroke volume will be hire but that does not necessarily mean that i should avoid training that gets me up toward maxima harry correct oh you should absolutely do it it that is what that was my assumption i to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens it lentic greens is a vitamin mineral robotic and adapted in drink design to help you meet all of your foundation

green stock calm slash supermen to claim the special offer getting back to energy production o metabolism we got the is different modes of moving energy but making and breaking energy bonds in the body moving energy into different tissues and out of different issues and indeed out of body through exculpation how do each of these different modes of energy utilization relate to different modes of movement and exercise now in my mind ism starting to draw a bridge between o cay when i walk for sixty minutes if ism talking in breathing a but more ay be a burning lite more fat after all speeches is a a modified exile a and main if ism sprinting ism breathing differently and if ism a doing a thirty minute moderate could nonsuit modern a jog breathing differently you have beautifully illustrate this bridge between energy production utilization and carbondoxide off flowed through exclamation warders some of the specifics about energyilization according to different modes of exercise and if we could better define modes of exercise or the out types of exercise that rigor specific adaptations i think this where the the bridge will move from being a a mere line to a real structure ye absolutely i one a lay one more foundational piece and then it is going to be much easier to understand the limitations i put on some of these training protocols as well as the lack of lamentations issue's realyreally important the way i want o start this is we have this this foundation now of of carbon and an basic energy production that is not to say there is no difference there is and that difference is important but maybe we can answer the question from earlier which is actually with something you asked me this morning we were exercising li training fasted just training fasted unhands falls and the logic is sound if i do not have any fuel then i should be burning more fat they're far i should be losing more fat it is sound it is not true is is great idea it is one of these classic things in science and exercise all at physiology were sounds good turns out us not it is actually a a pretty gross misunderstanding of metabolism it is not the pick on that topic i don't re the care about that topic but it is a it is a common question it also gives me an opportunity to just tell you more about metabolism here is what happens you are breathing in o to in breathing out we to however the ratio to that is what we call the either or we are respetorn exchange ration army respiratory question and ism not a differentiate those too there not the same thing but were n gossip pass a for now as you begin to increase exercise intensity the percentage of o to to see o to rises in the favor of sea to you start breathing out way more seal to than you are breathing and to to and if we are to look at that number what is the relationship echoes up at rest most people have a a a of a value that we would similarly call something zero point six and that is again the relationship between aught to ins to maybe peril point seven if you were to go for a walk that increases slightly because you are now expiring seal to at a higher rate now you have moved up to say point ate is something that one of the ways that we mark somebody of achieving an actual feel to acts on a test is if that value exceeds one point one now any of you who are paying attention or thinking ill wait a minute how to hell can a ratio between two things ever get past one well that is because you are getting the place or yore actually floating more seal too than is actually necessary and this is what actually causes an explains a thing that people to call epoch which is excess exercise post oxygen consumption this is another way to think about it the only reason your breathing is to bring in oxygen when o load sealed to right if ism no longer exercising why am i still breathingother words once you stop the demand or the need for eat for energy you should stop ventilating but you do not right that is because in the case of low intensity exercise the second you stop you are right back down a resting ventilation no problem because you were able to match the need for energy with the a load of waste one to one during that exercise when you start creeping up the intensity you cannot do that you have to basely start stealing a little bit of fuel here even though you are done exercising you are still ventilating because you have to pay that back and pay that back by that i specifically mean you have to bring in oxygen cause you have a whole bunch of ways hats been accumulating in your tissue that you have got to deal with and it'll walk you do with that wast is it is a particular molecule a lot of people have herd f but grossly misunderstand you got build handle it the reason that you said thing and continued ventilate is because you are now trying to pay back that excess post exercise oxygen debt that is that oxygen de were specifically talking about right that being said as we start cruising up that a accustarts going up up up up up up up and if we get to one you are one point all your you are in a you are hurting you are not on a preyed spot right i et you are hurting you are in a pretty good spot yea window into doctor any capon's mind a you really one to be subject it in is a is laboratory your massacists warm to candy's lab e absolutely all right the idea that i will lose more fat by being in an exercise situation that is burning more fat it seems to make sense but it is a massive failure to understand the metabolism it is the exact same explanation to i exercising fasted does not matter the exercising fast it issue under normal circumstances is irrelevant because you ha v plenty of fuel in the system even when you haven't eaten breakfast that morning now if you are talking extended fasting over multiple days this is a difference in area if muscle again liver age and blood glucose are at sufficient levels then you absolutely have enough energy to perform almost any type of exercise that most people are doing no maybe if your rob in your smile twenty to day is a different story but the vast majority of us have plenty of fuel sitting around we are not going to burn more into fat ism just because we did not eat breakfast that morning that this does not make energetic sense we have a lot of back up supplies your never out the trick here is this is there is there is a concept here we call cross over consent as we are starting to move up exercise intensity we start burning a higher percentage of our fuel from care hydrates and a lower percentage of our fuel coming from fat ism sleeping that is the highest percentage of your fuel that will be coming from fat of any activity you could ever do if the theory that ism in a stay at a lower intensity to burn more fat was true the optimal fat burning strategy would then be to sleep that does not make sense of course it does not why would then going at a slightly elevated rate somehow all the sudden magically make you lose fat it does not actually make sense when you think aby that we are lie oh yet there is no way it is a percentage trick it is a difference between absolute and relative this is what this confusion is yes as you start doing lower intended exercise whether you are faster now not it is it is your relevant but lower intend the exercise a greater percentage of your fuel is coming from fat however you are total fuel expenditure is very low that whole total carbon balance is not really being shifted much as you start exercising at a very high intensity you actually start getting a higher percentage of your full from carbohydrate a lower percentage from fat in fact at rest about the highest you can get in most people is about sixty percent of your fuel from fat as you are sleeping you might be seventy percent but you will never be in a position ever no matter what sort of thing you have heard an internet you will never be in a situation where fat is your only fuel source the highest of probably ever seen is levity percent ism you should probably beat about that is that is a kind of a good number to think ism honesty but people will who understand a little bit about mates table ism to be dangerous but not enough we will we will throw out these terms fat adapted in fat adapted is a real thing but is a massive misunderstanding often times right it is this idea thinking i can get in a spot where ism maximizing fat burning maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise and maximizing fat loss over time are not the same thing at all right that is the confusion if you enhance fat oxidation and exercise that does not enhance fat loss be say right this is the lot of the confusion as happening right as we start moving up we can never get in a position where we are using fat only as a fuel again at best yoga seventy per cent fat thirty per cent car behydre for lot of reasons we properties on hat time to get into however the opposite is possible when you get into true high intensity exercise you will be basically one hundred per cent car dehydrate and were per cent fat right that is is very pass wit that in fact is one point out that is hat arch one point one is actually because your ventilation got high you actually exceed o that number even though you are at a hundred per cent a hydra this is what people came up the idea than is wool i soft ant to burn cars i woe to loose fat my response that is always oke grate make sense burning fat losing fat burning cars is losing what then the youthen your liver shrunk the goitomen what did you lose that where to come from it is all coming as carbon do not worry about where it came from for your fuel it just has to come out as carbon it therefore differences in exercise efficiency for performance with our professional athletes of course but if the only go here is atlas it does not matter where you get it from the last bridge we have to connect here is e vitamin if i only burned car hydrate how did i actually lose that fat there was that there was that love handle sitting on the side of me how do that come out of me by never burned that from our fuel what your failing to understand is there is a balance came that happens here if you are to do a bunch of high intensity exercise training and you burned only must look a gin and blood gloom goes and maybe even you did it for long you burn some liver a get the body understands that it is expel the lot of energy from that side of the equation it is going to do a couple of things now it is very difficult to go through this fancy situation where you convert car dehydrates in to fat and back and forth that is actually fairly hard what is easier to do with something you said earlier is actually just bias energetics to a different fuel source in that scenario where your down really low in your car behold i car dehydrate stores any car dehydrates you bring in a going to go to storage and since your not energy expenditure is something that your body regulates lot any fat that you than bring in is going to be utilized as a fuel source because it knows it does not need it any more that is in access that is how you actually use fat as a fuel because you have burned down car dehydrate storage as ism hearing this a a couple of things come to my first of all thank you for that incredibly important description of what is otherwise a very confusing landscape from most people one of the keep once i took away and i just one say from the outset this is not exhaustive by any stretch is that burning fat dos not equal losing fat from the body correct and then burning fat has to be divided into burning of body fat stores and we need to distinguish that from burning of dietary fat that is brought in oftentimes people do not disambiguate those correct i and have also understanding that reducing one's body carbohydrate stores muscle likagin liverglakagen et camera occurs during high intensity exercise yet calls otherways but that is one very efficient way to tap into those stores which makes me wonder an this one these things the does it lead to a protocol makes me wonder whether r not doing high intensity lit is a weight training for forty five to sixty minutes seventy five minutes of strength training power training hyperon retraining which we have covered in an episode about those topics and then doing some steady state cardiovascular exercise is there any benefit to that arrangement that would quoting quote enhance body fat loss from the body throw very picky now because unlike the idea that training fasted would shift the best towards fat loss which it does not you have told us under those conditions muscled likagin and maybeven liverglikagen is going to be pleaded but simply can i enhance body fat loss by doing some cardie after a bout of weight training if you equate for total energy expenditure in will not matter now you did bring up a very important point that i wont clarify if you look at the exercise modalities that we laid out in our previous a conversations we talked about nine different adaptations one was skill and in speed power strength hypertrophy muscular endurance aero capacity aroma capacity and longdration turns now speed power and skill development have almost no benefit for fat loss because remember those are low weight a lot of rest and low volume they are not really really going to be helpful you can make a little bit of a case for strength a little bit but the total energy expenditure for strange training even if its ant hour if it is truly straight training it is fairly low because the repetitions are in the one to three range it is exact it is not to for total work if you are trying to develop a protocol that sort of optimizes fat loss which you want do you we close an my opinion is do a combination of something in the hypertrophy slash muscular endurance strength training round o miso a six to thirty repetitions something an resistance training great deplete muscle a gin may even a bit of liver linkage may be a little bit depending on if your doing it for long time but probably not a noticeable amount o case to an hour o of a hyprtore type training if coif you are training hard with low reseals and you related an hour you would for sure get there but most people do not cause i the reason my i crave large bolls a road merlin rise after i do wag draining yet flattish muscled lineage total right am then you may be do a limit of very high intensitygue maxim hart right well overevealed two acts a hard as you can for twenty thirty forty five sixty seconds something that with some re cover a lot of re cover and repeated and that is going to a great job of replenishing muscle age right if you do that long enough you will get the liver but again most people don't as is really really hard to go that hard liver is for a last later sort ye basic mechanics here which which we actually getting as are third segment here is a energy production comes from e local exercising muscle first and foremost from phosphor creeping and care hydrate stores inion again an we store in a muscle call it age right that is us your first sign at light of defense if you need glucose outside of that you can a strut pulling it from the blood but one of the things your body regulates a handful of things over almost everything blood p h blood glucose blood pressure an electro concentrations it really does not want a muscle those things at all it will change almost anything else in the body to keep those things standard eyes right you generally because you need all those things for your brain to work and your brain will stop working right if you lose good pressure molt go up there p h changes you cant run metabolism electrolighes change you cannot think and glucose is a primary feel sorts for the brain it is on o bear problem right if that number starts to come beyond because you are racing glucose out o the blood your liver is gong to then kick gan it is gone a break down it is again to put glucose and of blood to keep the blood number the level in fact one of the tings you will see it is blood glucose contractions rise during he per sides they do not fall in fact they rise a as an anticipate state if you train a lot your good cops will trike going up before you start moving it knows its coming right you you can play that game you can rob peter to pay pal for a long time and tell your liver runs out and that is what actually is a bonk and arms a long duration and durian stunt your tracking many many many miles several hours typically we say oh it is got to be over two hours ism before your liver starts to become a real problem or it has to be tremendously intents because those reasons you have to burn through just a lot of energy before your liver stars to get to a problem you can continue to train when your muscle again levels are low in fact i people sake o do to election a muscle but it is at it is generally is homer you are going us have tremendous signals of fatigue when that number gets lower than seventy five per cent be betting to their muscles are getting heavy your your probably still seventy five per cent full ism a lot of folks will milk quit around the fifty per cent the highest have ever seen is ninety five per cent true to election and that is in extremely high level cross country speeds and their deltoid it is very very low some very towns through runners will get fairly low in their clods but the vast majority of folks by the time you are fifty per cent to pleaded you are got quiet it is going to be really really challenging ism you are never really going to get that low it is a bit of a protect give mechanism right but when your liver gets low you are on to be shut down and ass the case of i ye verbena a marathon andyou have seen people run twenty five and a half miles and that it is bunk they going to baby dearest walking stands in thin the collapse and you how you mentally we you ran twenty six miles andyou cannot run the last point an and mentally weak it is if your liver is done it is on a stop you cause there is no more back to preserves muscle you can get away with you could push through it liver will not let you go any farther i find this fastening because it makes me wonder whether or not the liver being to pleated sends a neural signal to the brain o at slow here the brain must register some signal i would to be a live to morrow thank you whatever is happening right now am stopping is going to be safer than continuing and that stop signal am is it is one that i think a lot of people including myself or are intrigue by because we always think that it is a relate to will power but the brain needs to preserve itself and as the master computer i mean there are ways to go into kind of automatontype i yet a not thinking just doing tip a behavior you have override switches right and you can play those cards and you can get better at learning and be being less sensitive to that switch that is exactly what happen you first our training right you to to realize all my goons to retire than you really t look pick totally fine er and this is them pick pick pick your person who is made sangs this buts your really only ten per cento plated or thirty per cent or forty per cent r some all operating forty per cental i could do of course any those things are true because it is a little bit of an override ism you have just gotten very sensitive to being a small per center to pleaded and you have learned o camp tired and there is a long way to go past that but once you get past that and you slip that override switch a lot i you just you are going to break quickly because you have you basely learned ignore that signal and problems can happen really quickly after that and that is even experience and turn snatching if you hit that level you are going to be hitting the concrete next that is it pretence they are problem i want to make sure i understand a concept that you refer to earlier correctly because have a feeling that i do not and that is this issue of how the body access is body fat stores when in a sub colonic stay and ism doing mainly in burning exercise what i heard you say and please correct me where ism undoubtedly wrong what i heard you say was that o cay i go in to the him and i start lifting weights ism burning muscle leakage mostly local to the muscles that amusing and then i start pulling glycogen from the blood stream maybe there is some body fat stores that or noble is probably not dipping in to my liver leakage o get he complete the work out maybe i even hop on the airline by can do will sprint ye gopher jog maybe i e immediately afterward maybe i do not eat for a few hours afterwards but across the day i invest fewer calories then i burn is it the case that body fat is mobilized in order to replace the glakagen that my sub cleric intake was insufficient to provide in other words because i did not eat enough to fill the lineage in stores in i using body fat converted into glakagen to fill those stores right and if is that a case where ism no longer exhaling carbons in order to burn body thought t rather ism purposing body fat into muscle have i turned fat into muscle in that case ye ism ism rally glad a you ask us because i did a very poor job on that last point talking about earlier ism realizing playing back o my head teas is was many feelgood questions you cannot turn fat into muscle can you turn muscle into fat no ism glad you said that because when i was in college yet our i do not want it out that person the physiology teacher seem to think still at that point o that one could lift way to get muscular but then it would eventually turn into body feather that i that myths i think largely been dispelled i heard that many times as ha kid i heard it many times in college i heard it i here many times in hour undergraduate students from other faculty and sat no ththeare not the same structures they are very different let mime ratio out an answering this better you were really really really clubs ye if you were to do that type of exercise we have burned a lot of musslook age how is it ism losing stored fat that is really the clues the question and it does not even actually matter if you then went ahead and invested extra a carbohydrates or fat post exercise that is not really thing you had on a coupling things no er one this is all on the assumption that total cleric an take is still lo right you have a total need below towery red i also won a flag calories in calories out is not the only thing that matters this is a very complex than calories and is incredibly complicated calories out is even more complicated cam we just maybe another a series we can spend on that alone i do not do not go nuts about that you have to be hydrochloric one way or the other if you burn a much a musslook like age and your hyper cleric you are still going to at fat if you burn a munch musslook age and your hypo cleric you are going to lose fat t think about this way you are in a negative carry stake where are those calories going to come from are you going to reduce your muscle lineage storage permanently no no are you a r reduce your glycogen virgin you liver no you ant to reduce bluglicos no no way right where is that extra energy coming from it is coming from your stored fat it is your back up reserve energy system i the way that i want o fly this eyes people tend to think about it is carbohydrates verses fat that is not is it is more a chain more a bicycle where there is a front were and a back here you turn one gear it turns the other one these our complimentary systems they are not and or systems right you are your turning one and when we go through carbohydrate metabolism i may be here in a second you will understand why you have to have an anerobic anaerobic opponent to that there is absolutely no way to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen that hat's to happen the only way to engage in fatmetabolism is erotic anoxiden there is no anaerobic opponent to it there is a fundamental difference there the your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible at is the primary fuel source for a reason your fat is not meant to be flexible it is not meant to be unlimited that is the basic point you want flexibility over here and an unlimited capacity her there now ism safe garden against any energetic need we i need to runt up a hill for safety cool carbohydrates er there i need to then run for seventeen hours cool fat is there we want both these systems i you want to be able to have great energy throughout the day you want a slow drip coming from fat you do not want up and down up and down ho great up and down blossom you want to be able to think very quickly get hyprofocus boom carbohydrates lamplight up right get it into the brain get thinking better they thinking clearly lasso we want all these not just rectrocize purposes but for activities of daily living we want a optimal system here and when people o use the terms fat adapted they are generally hijacking that an thinking tacit used to be a thing we set all the time and all my undergraduate classes for years and that idea of metabolic flexibility is using potable fuel sources andoptimale times not maximizing fat usage they the people of call of to that term a meltable inflexibility to be odea therefore learn he to maxima catering that is not what that term means that term means maximizing your ability use whatever feels optimal in that time now i grant you most people are not fantastic it using fatal o fuel source relative to the other direction but nonetheless t that e the goldstandar here should be maximizing both right finally answering your question if were to burn aboutsamuso lineage how am i losing that fat well the flour investing in that hydrochloric stay is going to say hay look we have a lot of muscle aging we have to replenish any carbohydrate that comes in needs to be bad toward storage it is got to go in to those tissue any fat that comes in or does not even come in but any fat that were using for fuel needs to be utilized for activity and that is here the colonic expenditure from fat comes in your basely saying your general physiology the energy for that started coming from fat and the energy that is coming in from care hydrate needs to be simply stored and you see is your respiratory caution changes right there are car is going is going off and in the exercise moment it is shot way up for carbohydrates and shot weigh down for fat as the copentistory response it goes the other direction because your body saying we are low on care hydrates do not use them for fuel unless we absolutely hast your write use them for storage get our fuel from the fat side the equation and what you are generally going to say is oh ism burning more fat to sitting around after things that and that is not even taking into the equation the epoch part which is is it is not actually is large as people think it is it is fairly small but it is it adds up sort of overtime ism does that playing a a bit better about how you lose fat when you actually only burn cares for exercise if you explained it beautifully you talked about epoch the post exercise oxygen consumption yet nothing that significant in terms of energilization even though to day we are talking about endurance in different forms of endurance i do have to ask whether or not people consider the elevation in basil metabolism that occurs when there is more muscle around you because muscle is such a metabolically demanding tissue if is there a straightforward is equation if one adds one pound of of uhlan muscle tissue to their body even if it is distributed across multiple muscle groups does that wait to a a colonic need of ex number of calories per day and is that because of the muscle protein synthesis means of that muscle or it is glikagen storage needs were both if you do not have enough muscle you start to have problems with fat losses it is difficult challenge if you have enough muscle and you are list trying to get extremely large if you fear of of mice twenty four in your fifteen percent body fat adding more muscles not really in a daylight in equation and here is why muscle is more metabolically active at rest than fat but fat is none an ert fat is still going to burn a small number of calories muscle burns more but it is not nearly what people think it is ism a muscle guy ism a muscle physiologist i would love to get people to have more muscle for any excuse i can it is not honest to say that though ism you are talking about when i was in undergrad doit we would say numbers fifty cancels per day propound is what you can look at i if you put on a a pound o muscles spread across the body your base metabolic rate would go up by run fifty calories ism per did i think that numbers gross exaggerated it is probably attend of that six to ten allies maybe i it is it is her to no exactly what that number is but the more recent estimates are something that now on one hand you could say all my gosh that is not even meaning full thither hand you could say that supermeaningful is this depends on time woman you want o put that outright f you're to put on five pounds of muscle and your mazes a metabolic rate when a thirty or forty calories a day well over the course of a thousand days the that actually hours up you eye slices any way you want now maybe that number summer between i do not really know is not a feel i pay that much attention to candidly because i it is not metric finalize epoch were it is we used to really harp on it and now a sortiwhow may be we exaggerated that honestly just a bit but to me does not change the equation much because if you do not have enough muscle is a describe there other consequences that are on to make fat loss hart and you need to have sufficient muscle if the additional cleric expenditure is the cart great if it is something else i do not really care ism just at enough evidence that you need to have it or i should say there is enough evidence that it will really help you in your path u maybe a feu calories here there is not really the thing especially if you understand a normal food item anything you pick is going to be probably a couple of hundred calories one bad food choice o day well out kick almost any amount of coverage you got on a adding muscle mast to you you you really stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime if you are worried about how many calories you are getting from mating muscle u flosses can be about regulating that carbon and take above and beyond anything else it'd to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood endianeh to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health rolls have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turn health and well being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood tasting and a us out there however is that you get information back about serious levels of lipids and hormones a metabolic factors et camera but you do not know what to do with that information inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what your hippie oil numbers are of course but then also what sorts of behavior old dews and dots what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you to try inside tracker you can visit inside tracker do calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off s have heard about this concept of metabolic flexibility mentioned a few times frankly you breathe first person whose ever explained it to me in a clear and concise way how do i know if i am metabolic flexible and how do i increase my metabolic flexible city sore there is no specific standard which is actually good thing and if you have a level of specificity that you want or need metabolically then you do not actually want to be in this mealeground an example would be if you are a performing in a type of exercise or an athlete who performs an a sport that is likelylically dominated you do not want to be optimal matamocly flexible you do not want to be superon't to fat adapted you want to be bias towards the energy going use the same could be true for the other and the spectrum in those particular cases it is not optime to be equally effective because there are no free passes in physiology it a your energy producing systems we will regulator down regulate accordingly you will actually limit your ability to say maximally utilized carbohydrates a fuel if you are trying to regulate your ability to use that's a feel and this is there is a saturation point outside that sector most people to sashay i want a feel great throughout the day to we will do much different things haw couple things here is a lot of biological markers you can take ism there is also tot some some practical takes now none of these markers by themselves are any sign w you want to dos probably a couple of them and then say l cate this is may be a clue again it is really point empire not a single one of these tests that ism about to walk you through automatically means you cannot years that as a fuel or the other case which is may be your poor using carbohydrate is o field this claimers aside i well all will get into a couple of them should we think about these as informative and useful but not diagnostic exactly a we call this data inspired or data led and not data driven i number one you want to think about just over all functionality do you have a reasonable regulation of your energy throughout the day now many things could be going indites which is why these are not specific diagnostics but i as a basic measure we talked about blood locos levels ism you do not a lot people say again you want that to be something between eighty and ninety a milligrams prodessolater is the blood cluck s level and and if young look at the the cut off points for what determines to be prediabetic an type to diabetic et camera ism what i can actually recommend and this is there is lo o a since your actually that i talk e thru but lot of this is my personal preference am i generally want people to be at eighty five or lower and that is because of a couple of things number one am there is actually some papers that showed any every single point increase above eighty five increases your likelihood of developing type you dibedies by about six percent o gat great technically while may be ninety or ninety five even up to hundred or in the cotidal normal values that is one clue against not definitive by itself does it mean anything you need to really pay attention o what increasing by six percent actually means but it is a data point ere ism looking at if i actually then see symptomatology and we run you through me some question airs asked a your feeling throughout the day and we see in controlled energy bout her lot energy than get really really tired in swings another date a point an we may past a few these things together that may give me some clues that being said again this a lot of this rhetoric is used to then scared people of of carbohydrates and that is i want to be as clear as possible that is not not truly a the only thing people should care aboutready can be a thing i can also be unrelated there are reasons you could have blood clucks concentrations at this level or every swings that are unrelated to car hydrangestion at all right one test you can a run in addition to that if you begin to get boodglocos measured you can look at some markers we talked butter richer a t an a l t we talked about i you can kind a look at that a a tidal t ratio before you can actually o the inverse which is look at a t an a s t the can normal to value there you can look at is point eight i actually to see it lower than that and that alone is as been actually associated with bloodlucos dis regulation and if you see multiply science again we are looking for patterns and patterns and patterns an both in our case a bile markers symptomatology and performance and now you if if all three o those things are lining out you may have an issue performance wise a couple of little test you can run i really you have some sort of standard work out you do in hopefully it is it is pretty objective an other words a i run the same fifteen minute loop every morning for my cardie o carat how long does it take you to run that loup you could pick whatever distance it does not really matter what is your heart rat during that thing and then what is your perceived exertion now you should be able to do that fasted with very little drop in performance if you can do that an that tells me you are fairly good at using a fates feelsource if however the one day you go to do your standard work out and you feel awful fasting that may be another clue that perhaps you are not very good at dining in that system if you recovery afterwards a trims of hartregt recovery is very long may be another clue that you have a poor utilization a fates of feelsource the inverse can also be true if i give you something in the neighborhood of fifty or grahams of carbohydrate and thirty minutes later your face is falling off the table that is a good sign that you are n the posit you are call very very very poor utilizing carbohydrate as a fuel and the reason i bring that up is that is equally a problem we send we we hear people a lot may commons m man i have to say away from cars i c rash really hard if i do them that as what that actually means is you are very poor at utilizing carborhydratesis feel you are getting a your very your sensitivity is way off we should be able to have cargo hydrate and a reasonable dosage fifty grams and not fall asleep thirty minutes later or a halve to unto canine am that is a sign in our opinion this is again now just my practical brain telling you is ism that is a sign of of dysfunction i we we should be able to have plenty of carbohydrates for the day if we choose to if we want to for any reason ism now of course if you are to throw a hundred and fifty or two hundred grams of carbohydrate in your belly you are probably in to take a little bit of an energy hit i after that but we should be able to have a reasonable dosage and not a it'll hae to fall asleep afterwards what is one way that people can enhance their urination of carbohydrates i for exercise at the reasask as i think i fall into that category yet ism i do consume some complex corrhydrates and fruit post resistance training and that tends to be when ism hungrier war them but typically unless ism have just done some resistance training i keep must my daytime meals relatively low carbon hydrate and then in the evening i prefer slightly less proline and more carbon hydrate because it has this effect of sedating me a little bit yet and i sleep well and i know this runs against what everyone was taught a which is to not carborhyders lo e but i it because then it tend to wake up in the morning with at least as far as i can tell my linkage in stores not the silly topped off but but certainly filled yet i and ism able to train fasted in the morning and my favorite rework out is i consist of water and caffeine an electro lights may be some supplementation is well but i i love training fasted there is actually a number of things i one little steady thing you through there as actually the use of canine that is another sign of if you have to have fine to do your faster training that is generally azoth of sign you not very get a using feel i use affine prior to resistance training work out if generally i do not need it for any kind of carry askclaren yet i g in list say that it does not means bad it is is another clue this o a you should be able to do this without having o half caffeine to execute it now using caffeine to get a better result is is sort of different as an urgageti ate ism we you actually use a lot of high carbohydrate meals of the the day a lot of times for our at tit to a cutting wight or trying to redueswy it is a fantastic way to hand of lot of things and that idea that if you eat cares late at night that it'll increase fast that is all is old and well destroyed scientifically that that that is not a concern i we either is the much data showing in fact it dos much data on eating timing is i is a generally poorly understood about when you can eat in what you can e eating in the morning ai proceeding at night a la lot of we ye hard there it is no in maybe we just save that for sort of another dace as work to get really far down that is what are we can ta yet but yes i think our you an is to cover that an an episode on nutrition i ugegrat which is in this series the a the only thing that attitude is at here about injection carbohydrate late at night i should just say bat a at least in my case ism eating majority of my carbohydrate unless i train resistance trained early in the day in which get said i post resistance training i in the last meal of the day but for me that is not really late at night that last meal i somewhere between six thirty and seven thirty p m just three or hours or something like have a for to sleep around and ten thirty or ye it is not midnight a bowls of poster have we done that too but am yet tie can it is not i think that people will be very interested i myself concluded in how meal time in relates tall of this b i e it is haulers prove fat it's action had din you prove carbidisiontes hammer both thou really quickly i and a handling fat a utilization is as simple as doing a little bit of work in a either are fat and jested state any time you unjust a new truant prior to training you are going to buy us towards that neutral it which is almost the we are talking about either if you want a guarantee you burn more fat eat more fat prior o work out now you are going to lose fat but what your what your fatally signaling is we have an over abundance of this fuel preferentially target this fuel now the downside is that may actually hinder your performance i that is typically only concern for people at a very high level a fat is a slower fuel source i you are relying u more upon that your top end is going to come down a little bet and you would not want a use that strategy prior to race if it is a carbohydrate dependent race it ism the fact we act you see long trmadaptations i would suggests at the aims responsible for carbohydrate matablisn will down regulate and you get worse at that i not not a grate strategy the ism carbohydrate the jobs it right if you have carbohydrate prior exercise origin a buy as more towards that a handful of things you can do if you are total color can take is a simply managed that is going to take care of lot of these problems an appropriate eating strategy the types of food the combinations of food i all those things are going to make your post carbohydrate in jesting bunk i little things can go away there is a little bit of physiology that has to be i correct end for it is a little bit in one hand you can go very deep were right the real answer of how we would do this is if we see salary that were can i do a whole set of analysis we are it to got full labs right probably extensive blood pan all yearn solve a stool even and we are going to figure out where is that locals deregulation coming from lot of people think all it is a matabolet missed it might be and also might jibe it flag that something else is happening in the body we love actually work backwards a lot to dry to figure out exactly why that is occurring it may be simple as oh your eating a lot of your car to hydrates without any fiber or proxy and we know that that is important because those will actually blunt that the glyceric indexes the rising blood to it could be simple thing of dislike o your combination of food is doing it is not the total amount it may be something again more indigenous the actual system it could be i a horror is so it could be a breathing issue that could be a number of thing the way to get better at it is to simply train it and specificity's can here if you want to get better at a managing your blood glucose throughout the day you not feeling those things it could be a fuel issue but it could be a number of other things and it is hard to go into all of them with within our time constrain ism the practical tool that i would say here is if you want to get better at managing energy throughout the day make sure that number wan your proving stabilize makes young sure number too you are ingesting your food in the right combinations ideally with some fiber and or some proline or both that alone will help stabilize a low the problems then you need to train it high intensity you want to get better t using carbohydrates of fuel train it to hie intensity and have car dehydrates right before the work out i we will do that a lot if a if a if if we see folks who are i cant o walk you do the test of identifying if you are not very good using fates of fuel the tastier not being good at using car a hydrate is to fuel is both that eating that is i talked about as well as performance if you are a very very very slow starter it is just i really hard to get going that generally indicates you might been a situation the you are not very good using carbides as fuel we are going to practise that we are going to have a are car to hydrate are exercise car hydra meal hey were going to higher intensity stop not the point of making you sick and digestive issues all that but but we want to get better at using carbides as a fuel faster you want to get better t doing the opposite than you do that oposistattery you either again using fat price the work out going your pike performance is gong to go down a little bit but your get your investing in adaptation rights is not about that work out i s about whats can happen six eight ten weeks or not in vest is rayontothink about t or you could bring in some fasted training and want o really make sure i clarify when were talk about another ism not at all against fast to training it is not it works its this is not required for fat loss it is not required for fat adaptation it is a great option if you want i what i was hoping to d it that conversation and maybe did not articulate that well is to not restrict people but it is to open you up and at least you have a lot of options if you to do fast at cardie amazing it is great if you hate it you do not have to you can reach the same perform and goals the same physicals without ever doing it if you love long duration steady state stuff it is great if you hate it there are other options her intensity stuff again for just talking about fatless i i hope now that that is a little clearer in terms of the sampling nutrition if you her care great you for that these areal great you have options and you do not have to fret much over oh my gash i have to do this thing in certain way and i basely hate it you do have to worry about it hit those concepts and you will be fine a few minutes to go you mention that if we ingest to given makeronutreen that then the body will preferentially use that feel source you just carhydred will use that feel source is it always the case that the body uses the invested mackranutreant prior to using lichen if to imagine ins using both timing if i were to have some carbohydrate before an doing any kind of training the muscle still burn lichen right or do they have some way to register the amount of circulating carbohydrate the would allow or available carbohydrate in the form of food stuffs a that would allow them to not happen to their own muscle fiber stores of lichen right the way we derive energy for exercise or basicmanents a little bit about cycler physiology you have got a couple of organic structures o you to attention if the first one is the newel's that is hold your doing the second one is a metal conure and the everything outside that you've got all the other organ that do bunch of things amazons for preaching synthesis et camera camera it no when you want to produce energy for exercise any time you hear the word anerobic you automatically understand we are meaning without oxygen are it great that all happens in the coda plasm the tidal plasm is that space that is not the motor conduit not the newel's it is the space in between everything else is is jelly substance of sands there anerobic withabolism happens there every single a robin metabolic process happens in the mite condo are why is that born if i go to create cellular energy and i need it the fastest possible ism going to go for gospel creating because it is stored directly in the tidal possum the stoeciomtrees one to one there which means for every mole of posh creation i burn i can crate one eh t p it is one to one it is incredibly fast but it is very limited because think about it how much of that could i possibly store in the small size of the cell that is it if i need energy past that point now all start using muscle listen because that is all stored in the tidal plasm it is right there the stop ciometryes not one to one at the lo but higher probably four to one for every molecule of an inpour burn your going to get something four yes some small number of high t papa that which is great but again you are running into a storage problem how much can i possibly store inside a muscle it is very very fast much more effective than fostercretin but there if i then want two metabolizes any form of fat or if i want to complete the metabolization of care hydrates i have to start transferring into the mite conure now i start getting whole hosts of high t p a if you ere to fully run through this thing which it'll talk about a second ism call the t c a cycle a recycled you will get now something twenty eight or thirty or thirty five tan a opening eighty proper i the energetic output is much higher guess here is exactly what happens can i'men' walkout through this in the form of cargo hydrate that it'll come backwards and go through i fat remember cargo hydrate it is one carbon molecule that has been hydrated it is one to one the actual i chemistry here it is see high two o one carbon two eight one up glucose is a six carbon chain the chemistry heres see six high twelve o six six carbons six waters very impact's carbahydre i you can imagine if you are watching on the video hero you will you will see my fingers going not till try to make sure i explain itoyou all just la saying in easy fashion you have got this chain of six carbons as in front you and the very first septimataboliss you snap that thing and a half rights you break into two separate three carbon chains right now in doing that you got a little bit of energy could you broke that one bond but not a remedies amount this is called by calluses licks being the split being you split age up got a little bit energy of that i you formed this three cared carbon chain called pyruvator piruvicacid there is differences there but do not don't commends general audience friends i i got a to i give this communicate this to everybody do you got little to that now you cannot do much past that besides rip one more carbon off of each of those three carbon chains have got two three carbon chains i be careful how i do this with my finger i do not flip you off errand a second but i burn one more off of each i get a little bit o energy and now that little two carbon chain i have two two carry chains this are called at still noway are t amazing i have now completed antarctic my crisis have got really nothing left i can do here a made a little but high t p you wait a minute i have now treed two carbons because an mi start with six i spit of the apart i did not at two three carbon chains i burned one each have got two three proton carbons i half to now do something with them my body will not let me go through that pat that last process unless have got a plan for that free carbon as i cannot break it an half amazing here is what is going to happen if i have those three carbon molecules and i do not have anywhere i can put that carbon you are not going to go tough that process it is going to stop it you are gest our building ut private now at the same time you are breaking a t p for fuel that is called i t p hydrolysis and you have water that comes in you have an endencine and three phosphate as sites called eh t p venison try phosphate one to three you break one of those phosphates off there you go there your energy sand i have a free for floating in organic phosphate and a denying die phosphate too over there amazing that actually results because you use water for it results any free floating hydrogen ion a just have to trust me hydrogen a t well any idea what a free floating hydrogen is i it is gone the sit gets is i was ganstascan increase activity that is what to she any one has ever measured p h what you really measuring is the the the amount of hydrogen potential hydrogen that is a p is right honer presenter there is too definitions of p h but you get us one of the two is this are you no tell me this is related to the the the burn we are going to get close right have got a bunch of free floating you got the phosphates which are actually problem to am probably moreen problem in people realize and that hydrogen what are you going to do with that hydrogen but one thing you can do as actually ship but over to private and bond it there we have a special name for that little molecule when you have private nu have hydrogen attached to it down n it is called ah hydrogen provide lactate lactate lack to acid this is that whole system right gan ism skipping some sea steps making a little bit of mistakes ere intentionally folks unmake this sister what happens when you start running a bunch of anerobic chassis you start seeing mass of rises in lactate cool not lack pagans it right right that is why we see associations between a lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue but the lactates actually not causing the fatigue the lactate is actually sparing you from having it much a free floating skit it is also can be then used directly back in the muscle because as soon as you bring in enough oxygen and you can take that hydrogen back off of it you have now turn o right back into pyruvante you can run it though this whole cycle as fuel that ism about to do you can actually actual ship at out of the exercising muscle and ship it into a non exercising muscle and then go backwards and make glucose what actually liberates hydrogen from from lactate you chemically yes or what what liberates what we what are the stimuli the can take hydrogen off the private to and and then in other words to reduce lactate and free up that hydrooxyen availability in fact one of the major places that you ship hydrogen to a one of major places the you ship lack they to your heart because its is well we collect the ultimate solar fiber and it is has a ton of freely available mitochondria wench have a ton of access to oxygen can actually then go to it form water they s you we can be used to form water and now we have a place the sort thehydrogen on it right go as a result of anerobic closes we have made a little bit of e t p we have created a lot o waste and we do not have any word to go it these en products when you do anything of a higher intensity and it says i need energy fast you are gong to go to this system first right right past big t p because it is the pastis place togannity but you are not gin to get much of it and you got a deal with the waste products to right back to the guinea of our conversation and durance is about two things energy production and waste management and wright ere fatigue buffering this is it right how well can you handle the elevations in hydrogen right drop in p h and how on what you a do these products if you want to fully metabolize a carbohydrate you then half to take some to something with those privates or those sat does which are going to do if oxygen is available you will take those things and ship them into the mite cornea they have to go through some walls and some other things that but they are going to get inside there once there in there that two carbon as time runs to this entire cycle that we call the recycle that is this really interesting place that is where o b six and ataman people are that is where that whole stuff says to kick and all your evite ins base we run that entire circle i and you g to start off the top you have a much of funstuff going on but as the part of that circle you can o pull off some some o hydrogen ions young send they to its call the elector on transport chain after you can to get ton of e t p to and as a result about half way through the turn you can to pull off one carbon and about half way thought other but almost thither we t finishing to all off the second carbon you e to take the second at utilcoa run that entire thing same through as well and what we did is we started off with a six carbon glucose chain we split an half we call those private made little bit energy cause we broke that one bond of those two carbons that are in the middle go those two three carbon molecules we pulled one carbon off of each wee brought in we are we move those in the mitochondria wee brought one off we took a breath brought in some oxygen on o that great took out two seal to exams we ran the ask still cop through the crew cycle one two carbons per turn coming out a seal two we had six carbons total en we started and we exited with zero carbons now we have fully metabolized a molecule of cargo hydra that required an anerobic start and a robin finish if you do not have a lot of mite chondrite large mark cadre high functioning motor conduit you are going to limit your enrol per romance because you are going to get the on to run that door full very very quickly you cannot go pass it because hydrogen would build up way too fast and one of things that we know is both temperature and p h run ends ism function they are gong to stop you only be all the run through in fact that eh t p hydrolysis face even if i gave you a whole infinite supply of e t p if i put enough ascot in terry would stop working because the h t p h ends i needed to split will not be able to run in highly said a environment or at a hot environment at some point perhaps to day perhaps in a future discussion but still not too far from now we could talk about the real of temperature a in the i impiruvated from in terms of its regulation muscle contraction but i wont to make sure i understood something correctly you mention these least a too parallel feel systems i one is essentially anerobic right and the other is erotic you said the at if we cannot pull enough we cannot break enough bonds than we limit our anerobic capacity correct i would have thought given that a the might a condylar the sight for essentially for aerobic metabolism yet that we would be limiting our erotic capacity as well perhaps you could justclarify for me how these two things are divide it were is there not a clean division is not not in either no effect i get i think it is better to think of these things rather as to separate pair of things as one big cycle they are one gear turning the next being compromised in one will compromise the other that i should say reminds me of what you said early which is the the fiscal gear ans analogy that works a right if you if you short circuit one badly that the chain cannot move that is the fantastic case am indeed they they are running in parallel but they are intern dependent yet well there actually not even running in parallel because there actually fumbling to the same pinpoint right which is if if you are going to come from the anerobic hollies rout or even a come from the fat rote which all talk about a second they are both going to be limited in the mite contra hen that things full it does not matter you cannot run either system right it is more of a again if you are running the bite gears it does not really matter if the back ones larger or smaller because if either one is limited your tests cause there running on the same system you can you can den sneak a little bit here and there but but not much you also really nicely highlighted how lack this thing that we think of as ha the a limiting factor the burn it gets in the way and the thing we need to stop and buffer in all all sorts of things or it is actually really a fuel it is i its tremendously effect of fuel es it is a strongly preferred yell actually the is is inter is ice very classic case of association correlation for us cause t they the original acting that this critical history on lactam but it was originally found i think in germany pardon my history there some somewhere in rope and hunted stags on the things is a sort of realizes if we if we we harvest at a stag in a reinstate when it did not no we were there verses if we chaste it and it was ran down that these lack say concentrations were significantly higher and in the latter situation therefore lack take started immediately getting this association between high fatigue points and it is easy to measure if your to do any sort of lack a test any sort of metabolic test you will see as fatigue increases lack my will also increase the assumption there was then all my gosh it is the cause now we know again it is not the thing at it's in large part trying to buffer the negative consequences of a tphydralysis and and some other thing it is certainly playing a part in that roll but it is not the for driver it is also why you do not need to worry about doing things to quit on quote reduce lactate the muscle after exercise or to clear lactate or any those things you may still want to do those activities but not for that reason lactates fine your action on use it and again the neighboring exercise muscle fibers in the same muscle another muscle you can send it actually to the to the liver and i can actual go through laconic genesis and i can actually replenish liver agon just as it feel force or you send harder any number of sources you can also is sort of put in circulation put a back in the muscle and once enough action is there you can dislike a right back into either glucose or k age it is totally fine it is obviously clear though once that number gets very very high other things are going to be happening that i becoming a lot of hurt and this is your managing waste right is really an issue of managing what am i going to do with all this extra carbon what am i going to do with all this secure in erratic phosphate and and some other nasty by products but that is the thing you have to deal with i lev or you to teach me how different ratios of fuel sources are used depending on how long i happen to be exercising for example if i do a very short bound of exercise yet typically that is correlated with a higher intensity output m i suppose i could jog for one minute but here ism thinking about sprinting for one minute or less which fuels are used is that mainly driven by fat stores by carbohydrate stores is it driven by dietary fat preferentially or carbide that have ingested if indeed have ingested this reproaching for that matter and then is we transition to exercise tit goes a a bit longer anywhere from three to f give minutes how do those ratios change and as we transition to longer duration what most people think of is endurance exercise but long duration output of twenty minutes or more leading clothe way up to full marathon how does that change the ratio of fuel sources that are used and i be particularly interested in distinguishing between carbohydrate fat and preaching that is invested coming from food sort sis or carbohydrate fat and praying that are coming from store sites within the body look a great let us start at zero seconds and run all the way through marathon and well won flag the distinctions where they start changing as soon as you wan us create muscle contraction of power the very first source of energy is fossil creating that is on o power you for zero to maybe say high to fifteen twenty seconds of maximal exertion and that is in coming from the muscle fibers himself yet that is actually stored in the was call the tidal plasm this is the little area space in the muscle fiber i that is sot likely this jelly substance and it is nice because one molecule of phosphate creating gives you one molecule of a t p it is not a big energy output but it is very fast because it is stored right there in the local exercising muscle right now if you need energy pass that point say ten or fifteen seconds up to maybe a couple of minutes this is now you cant have to transition because you an burn through that phosphate creating this can be out your a have to move to now carbohydrate metalballism this is what we call anerobic li collusion there is two phases of li callous now glycollusus itself means glucose burning i just means where using carbohydrate as a fuel source initially when we start off this cascade i which is going to take us again for a a couple of minutes i carbohydrate utilization comes first from the exercising muscles whits very similar to fossil creating that way if you start running low on it you can actually tart pulling blood glucose and if blood glucose gets slow you will of us our getting lichen from the liver to keep that up and we have sort of carver that conversation i little bit chemistry here just give me a little bit of room hereto now remember a carbohydrate is a carbon molecule that has been hydrated one carbon attached to one water and rummer waters h to most of the time re talking about glucose it is in the six carbon chain six carbons attached to six water molecules right great when i go to split this up through anerobic like callus it works a little bit this you got this six carbon chain the first step is to snap that thing and half your in to make two three carbon chains now we broke one bondright there we got a little bit of energy but not a tremendous amount ism at the end of anerobic crisis you begin a net something three or four eh t p more than you get from the poser triple is quadruple but still not very much there is another major downside that is coming in a second to the system the upside is its fast now why do not actually one adaptation we get to training in this style is you will increase your builtyto store plicae in your muscle which is great right we can actually by up see you admeasure the amount the store and a training adaptation is some your able to sustain this system long or perhaps ninety seconds into your interval training you get a fatigue point and now you maybe can a send that to a hundred a hundred fifteen seconds simply because your storing work a get in the muscle before we have to en then go into the blood and get a n formilicos that is great we have got the six carbon molecule and we split this and half we got that little but at eh t p and now we are in this little tricky position because this three carbon molecule as what we call prove piruvicacit and again chemistry folks ism skipping some steps coming and intentually makes the mistake sera making sure the entire world listening regardless of where they common can can follow me here k do not burn me on the details right you have got to pirate the problem is you can no longer do anything with that li call this is is over you have got to make a choice right in order to make something out of those three carbonmolecules you have got to ship them to the to conure as we said that is the only place of erotic metabolism right we cannot do pubic metabolism anywhere else until we enter the math condoes any time we cross that barrier we know we have automatics which from anerobic to a robin but here is the problem if you were to take one more carbon off that three carbon private you half the now do something with that carbon waste a before when we split the six carbon chain we did not actually leave any carbon's free floating we just split a to molecular out when we go to split from prove and make it into this two carbonmolecull call oussitue copy or seal copy now we have got a free floating carbon we half to evestratic you that because that is going to increase the acidity level any denim in our body that works to create fuel is very p h sensitive right if this the if p h gets off either high or low these enzyme cannot work and that is really really important because even if i we to give you a direct injection of eh t p prefer that is that energy currency it is the only way we can actually form energy i b guess member to clarify any time we are using phosphocretn or glue comes or fat which will get to a second we are not actually getting energy for exercise by breaking those down we are getting energy that we can use to then make e t p we break that high t p down that was actually powering muscle contraction ism you can go back to our previous episode or we would you though the detail of the muscle contraction but that is hereafter e in the case of private if we split that off we have got to deal with that and the only way in the best way we can deal with that is oxygen remember we are gin to breathe o to that o to can combine with that free floating carbon make sea to or an hail that thing out that is our waste management strategy but that has to happen in the mitocondre remember if we are using oxygen at has to be in the mitocondre if we have the ability to ship piruvete into the mite condign or golden but what happens if we do not why do we not well if we do not have enough mind cornea or a mite conure or too small or the too far away or we do not have sufficient oxygen availability why do not we have sufficient onion of inability because we created the private too fast and the demand in the to conduit is exceeded by the build up of pyruvee and now we are having this giant backlog and this thing fills up fast we have a couple of strategies here well when you are going through high t p and your splitting its called a be hydrolysis in of doing that remember eight pes a what identify molecule and then the the part is tryphosphae one two three which means you have three phosphates attached the end when you break that phosphate off that is where you get genergenes on ow you have an energetic phosphate and an a do it sent i phosphate too that process requires waters called pydralisis as result of that you then have a free floating hydrogen and as you well know that is acid right that is potential hydrogen that is what that means and you have increase the acidity in the muscle by breaking up all this eh t p and oh we are we're building up acid we have building up piruvete we would know of nowhere to go with it and we cannot cleave off a carbon because now when is going exacerbate the acid increase what we can do is we can take those hydrogen that were building up and store them on the piruvete a private that is holding an extraacid has a special name and we call that lactate i that is why we see this build up of backdate one of the down sides of anerobic i cases is and incredibly irate of waste production now lactates is not the cause of fatigue fact if you think a little bit more carefully about what i just said it is actually stopping you it is what we called a acid buffer you can actual use it for avouch everything you can ship it to a neighboring muscle fiber and the same muscle that is not working you can ship it to the liveryship at the heart an a munch of other places and then you can actual just work backwards if you ship it to for example the heart and it is got a bunch o mite conure that are free you can bringing the oxygen attack it to that hydrogen make water and now you rite back to pyruvete you put too piruvit back together and now you just make mucus you can actually store in the liver an this is a process call laconic genesis to this fancy thin called the cuorycycle which is what the the the the proper cyclohere is you can use it as at very potent feel sorts of fact exact it is a tremendously valuable feel source ism bowleg for exercise but for cognition an an a bunch of other things last ate in fact this is why a if you have seen e the research about are a exam testing exercise you will see a notice be increase in examscores if you do a twenty men about of exercise prior to take the examine is largely in part probably because of things elevations in at day how intense of exercise a would be most beneficial i do not know that exact answer i just know that a generally any form of exercises good but if you were to reach a a reasonably high narrate your probignees a in fact there is an acute and chronic adaptation here folks hat exercise have have better memory memory retention score an salaam camera but then also doing it prior to that exam i makeup y recovered and rest in back down a strip but you will gently perform better previous guest on the humeri land gasses the was a s colly professor an our scientists an also been of collegeofarts and sciences at new york universal ware you windy says ski is in religious about daily morning exercise ye specifically for this purpose of enhancing learning and memory and has a lot of really beautiful data i consider one of the real pioneers in this space if people want to learn more they can look to that episode or wind's work an we contra to link to couple of the papers but this is fantastic and that it is incredibly clear i thing for the first time i understanding what what lactate is really doing and its dispelling a lot of miss that i think i in a lot of other people arrive to the discussion about lactam with what happens when the bowed of exercise extends longer amazing if we want to continue pass that point we have to have some sort of strategy to get through it right were stock were out aghast we have to then ship into the mind chantry and now working to enter what is called a robin the callthisis and this this going to take us anywhere from again say that ninety seconds of all out work up to really twenty thirty minutes in fact it really will take us to unlimited if you look at a highly competitive marathon runner even those that are running say you are two hour marathon those folks are burning up to eighty per cent carbhidrae it it is a it is not a fat burning thing and the reason is fat metabolism is wait too slow it provides a lot of energy but it is incredibly slow if you are trying to run a four and a half or men at mile repeated twenty six times you have to be moving fast are they investing carbydry as a feel source during the race unless you are ontic you do not know they will not really tell you these resort of trade secrets it would be i would say fairly rarer to not have something and there is all bunch o different strategies if you are ta go really long some of the a cycling were the races will be several hours then you actually might go to some fat as feel forces i know a lot of cyclists are using ketones somethings that now but traditionally most endurance folks in a as heavily towards car by hydrate a now in one respect you are not going to run on a car b hydrates until you are many hours in these folks are are you unique case but the average individual who is doing an hour hour and a half card even you are not going to be limited by your car by hydrate stores you gan to be just fine you man be limited by some other things which will maybe sort o break down here a second but you are gin to be finger ism a topless folks will take car hydrate though very specific riles you want a you do want to be careful though of investing too many fast car dehydrates prier to your exercise bout i we have actually have this little thing that called the insolent glucose double among and what that means is when you an jest car a hydrates immediately your blue locos goes up and that depending on the type of car hydrate things that with the same thing happens with exercise and what happens is insolent wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood at the same time muscle wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood and we have this giant bullet of carbohydrate come in and then all sudden our blood sugar crashes and if you are going to be doing your your first half marathon or something that and you are in those giant canals with us now hundred people waiting to go in your standing for forty five minutes you may or may not want a slug down three or four bananas an a bale and and honey and think think you probably do not need that ism now not every one experiences this double army but it has been shown in literature to happen to some people you wanted just be little bit careful ism an easy way to combat that is just practise exactly what your going to doing your race in your training it is the the simplest advice ever but you would be stunned how many people do things during the race of they faction never done to training i suggest people do exactly what you describe also for any kind of cone of testing lorslefor a big exam is not the time to discover whether not you can handle twice is much express were taken new tropic for the first time word ah or change anything ism if if indeed the thesquare on that exams is meaningful to you you keep keep things regular t recapial we have done here is we started off in the side alas and with this glucose molecule that is six carbons we took that thing we split and a half we call that thing anerobic hollows we made a little bit of energy but not much we take those three carbon molecules we shipped them into the mid conjure we take each one of those we clear off one carbon each those carbons we take a breath in we attached them to oxygen we hail them get rid of that energy we are now fully into a robin houses each one those two carbon molecules we run through the crept cycle each round the crebcycl burns one to carbons we go one to one too and now we have gone from six carbon molecule all the way down to zero we used the hydrogen that we pulled off of that crept cycle run to go to the electron transport chain from there we made a whole bunch of e t p and we have now fully metabolized one molecule of car a hydrate and at the en product of all of it is simply e t p water and sea to beautiful and leads me to the conclusion that most everything is really about utilization with carbons and exhaling so to is that how i should thing about book ending what you just described this is why we started off the conversation with the circle of life this is really a carbon game this is why we call a chemistry with carbon or panic chemistry that is what this whole thing is about any leaving being has to run through metabolism it is all a carbon game any lambing being hasty t p this is all just a big fancy game a how do i make a t p and handle the ways remember and durance is all about waste management fatigue resistance the same thing an energy production we are playing a game here the whole game bring an energy use it mitigate waste products in thinking about aerobic exercise or long duration exercise in the case anything longer than five minutes for that matter five meets all the way up to an altramarathon the breathing associated with endurance exercise the heart beating which of horses assoil with the breathing invite verse it is really all about bringing oxygen into the system that then allows those carbons to be used and within the might of camera specifically and then carbondioxide to be exiled as we work through the carbons of the sort of a beads on a string is that right unless you are moving incredibly fast for a very long time and we are talking probably north of ninety minutes an durance is really not a game of making sure i have enough feel it is simply managing the waste production and that is exactly what we described you need to bring in the oxygen you can handle the carbon that is building up as a result of both the aerobic anerobic crisis that is our game here if we start talk in met in durance events longer than that now we do have to start worrying about running out of muscle age running out of liver linkage et camera or if we are at that two our mark of son were moving very very very fast but anything south of that is just managed carbon build up and we do that best through oxyenutilization or getting more efficient d having a higher capacity for our anerobic side we can do that by having either more lineage in our muscle to that last longer or building better as buffering systems and there is a whole line of supplementation that are specifically asked buffers as ha whole line of training as a whole line of breathing to manage us that we have a lot of strategies where we can maxim as en durance all we have to do as go back to the earlier part of our talk which is figure out what is the actual limiting step and then train according to that or do your strategy your nutrition and your supplementation that defeats that limiting factor for an example if you are trying to maximize your performance in this twenty second maximal burst and your strategy for that was to make sure your molsiplakage in is saturated it is probably not an a helpaton cause you are not going to be limited by total fuel you are going to be limited by durability to buferacid however storing for age your muscle in preparation for a marathon is a tremendously effective strategy because that will become a limiting factor what we can do actually next if you its we can just walk through these and look at the individual limitations where the failure point happens and the that effectively will outline your strategy for improving them you taught us about carbohydrate utilization as a fuel force what about fat and what about proline great it'll start with proline because it is easy it is generally at best going to represent ten per cent of your energy outlet now that will grow over time in terms of if you did a several hour bout of exercise when you started doing it you might be using five percent of energy from protein n a micro to ten or and that happens because you start running low and muscle a get you start running low on liver age you start then having to pull energy from another place as those numbers go down you will see and increased up tick of energy from fat as well as proline having said that it is not a tremendous fuel source it is only a robin it has to be oxidized those are the same thing when i say oxidized you use oxygen to burn something to to make a fun ism it is not significant contributor to energy in that regard and unless you are talking alter marathons or longer and it is also not something that can enhance performance and we do not really to talk much more about it than that in terms o fat as a fuel source now here is e fundamental difference while carbohydrate starts aerobically and finishes aerobically in the metal century you are using mostly the carbohydrate in the exercising muscle tissue eventually can pull from blood than you can pull from teliverwith fat you have a tiny amount stored in the muscle intramuscular triclastrises but the overwhelming majority of fuel you get from fat come systemically into now we have a fundamental as we actually lately have a time problem i can get energy from carbohydrates faster because it is directly there if i go to pullet from fat have got a pullet from the rest the body which is why somebody who loses fat loses it from their entire body despite the fact that they may be only exercising a couple of parts think about a runner someone who lost a lot a fat running you do not see them just lose fa t their legs it comes from their face and their neck and everywhere why because what you are going to do is pull fat from the anti our system you are going to break it down through a process called lye policies which is means you break it own from the stored form ism you put it in the blood as that glitter all back one which is that three carbon backbone in the individual fatiacids it is on a float through the good as the sevenstep system here abut we will skip it for now it is going o have to get then up take an end of the muscle in the muscle then has to get taken up and run into the mite conduit now that backbone that three carbon glister all backbone is actually on a function almost exactly the three carbon prove just get it in the mite conduit cleave off one carbon run it is autocue bombing mutable exact same thing super easy to metabolize small enough to go through the mite conduit membrane the fat as change o become a problem if you have a chain that is longer ism then are eight or carbons at has to act to go through a special transporter on the sell wall to get in and that is going to be limited by a thing called carnations and you are probably familiar with that as a supplement you have may have talked about at these a lot of places at make it ism that is going to be limiting factor if it is a smaller what we call a short chain or even a medium chain drive the ride which a lot of folks have heard of m c t that is we are talking about that can actually go directly through cause it is small enough to pass through and you can use it immediately as an resource in either case the way that you finally metabolizes a fatyacid is it process where you would go through and tut off two carbons at a time why would you cut off too because you are trying to make that two carbon acitocoese you can run through that cried cycle again because you are cutting off two carbons at a time we have a special name for that oxidation process it is called data oxidation that is exactly why we call it bateoxidation two barons an you cut it off to make that acitocoe you can notice the oxidation pathway the elector on transport pathway is identical whether you are talking about the carbohydrates or the fat in fact it does not even matter mortal our point if wore talking about simply fatless it really just is about running that elector on transportchaing whether it came for ma carbohydrate original sours or a fat original source it ends up in the mini conure as basically exact same thing it then ends the end o metabolism as the same thing remember the final end point of carbohydrate metabolism is water a t p and coo to do you want to guess the final in point of fatmatabolism it is water e t p and c o to practical applications here if you want to maximize fatless what type of training as best it really does not matter if you enjoy longer steady states o fantastic if you enjoy intervals a making if you would to do a commination that is my personal preference that is great too you have a ton of options pick what you think is a combination of challenging not all exercise should be easy but you actually enjoy somewhat or you are willing to accept an anything you absolute hate do not do it sometimes is very very very difficult to do high intensity train you have to really be interested in doing it if not an ins up turning into moderate intensity training you sort just check the box and it does not work that well if you are just checking the box if your men mentally i do not have it in me to day to get to a high heart rattan and throw up an last of cool but you can misuse some moderate stuadystaystuff that is a when great if you are all gosh more than ten straight minutes and ism word and you are all maybe also i do not have forty five minutes i got to get this done at eight minutes great goodish my intend intervals either option will be equal effective as you mentioned earlier exercise is useful for aesthetic changes functionality and for lunchevity but when thinking about exercise specifically for fat loss i do have to ask this question i often here from people that they prefer one type of exercise forces another forsake of fat loss because certain forms of exercise make them very hungry ism wondering whether not there's any relationship between the intensity or type of exercise and the a hunger stimulus now i do not have this prom is basically everything makes me hungry i and yet ism also a fasting for part of the day yet ism one of those pseudo intermittent faster what would i mean by that i just i you you between eleven m and eight p m naturally or a i ism not religious about it but but i do not do it for any other reason except that that tends to be when ism hungry and exercise outside of that ism in the morning typically in any case is there a way that people can determine what type of exercise might be better worse for them based on its appetite stimulating or inhibiting of facts because i also here that you some people will go for a long run and then they are go not go not hungry for several hours afterward or is that have anything to do with which fuels are being like during different forms of exercise that is i cult really a question i do not know the the mechanisms i could explain that answer what i can tell you is your the same comment for physical activity an other words people say man if i do this type of training then i just am exhausted and i lay around the rest the day my total cleric expenditure is actually compromise as an aggregate because ism down ism the data would suggest in general that does not happen most of the time we do not see a reduction if physical activity ism with either high intensity or steady stay training in fact you generally see i equal if not increased it was conte the non exercising party or day ism in addition to the was a metamatgrate is got to yo was you do not see to be rope now hunger is a little bit of a different thing the answer here is i soft think we have time to actually do justice on this perhaps best to to not get into this one yet the don't we punt this down the road to our discussion about nutrition hetpecipically and and were back to its a will your market for that om meanwhile it sounds if one is thinking purely in terms of a burning calories it and getting the health benefits of exercise to critical or debris it to create fat loss it does not matter whether not they burn those calories using a form of exercise that realizes predominantly on carbohydrate fat were preaching crew its not that it does not matter it is the either one will work because when we say things that it is it does not e they're actually identical there are some slight differences and maybe those differences are imported for some people and not others o i say is either one is a bible strategy great what about preaching is a fuel as an actual feel so you limit gone ournalogy imagine that you are you were with me a few weeks go in southern montane and we are out in the wilderness for a week eh and it is cold out there you needed to make a fire and if i said look you can pick any of these things there are there some wood over there we brought some newspaper and the we bought a match and we need a crate a fire refuse that fire to energy and heat up o it i said great the very first place you would probably start to make that fire is the match you the match and any match eh and the light immediately but its problyganty last five to twenty seconds i no before i burns out that is phosphor creating real fats tell burns out if you were smart you would take that match and penlight the newspaper on fire right now if you were to burn a whole newspaper it is more energy then you get to the match but you still in o atone was into take a few minutes some number of minutes before an entirely pe burns of a fie i do not now right the penny ten which type a newspaper as i guess right amazing that is carbohydrate right if you were really smart you would use that said then light o piece of wood on fire and wood if you have been the wilderness it out last hours days it is really quite unlimited you are phosphor creating storage is very limited small like age is a lot higher us you can store in mostly monitored in other places you have more but not a lot fat is unlimited the average person if you were on to say seventy keys up hundred and seventy pounds or and you are moderately lame maybe fifteen per cent body fat nothing crazy you probably have enough stored fat to create enough energies to survive for more than thirty days right this would literally be if you invested zero calories you have a enough fuel in your stored fat to keep you alive for certainly thirty days you would feel good all those things but energetically basically fat will never ever be your limiting factored performance we start talked about what limits my performance in this arias you can just white fat off the list it will never be your limiting actor to any type of endurance performs you simply have we too much the only problem with fat is is just to slow have got a mobilize it have got a get in the blood move it that whole thingtooslow if i want go faster i will never be able to fully utilize fat which is why we talked about earlier you will never see a situation in which somebody is a hundred per cent burning fates of fuel and no per cent carbohydrate it is always going to be too slow highest you will get may be seventy per cent propene in this equation is none of that now you may notice how do you make paper buts firers mine with water it you gets pressed to get's be compressed ye ye it is made from wood how do you make a much it is made from wood what is cargo hydrate a chain of carbon what is fat a chain o carbon these are similar molecules right there meant to give you prose in colons it is very difficult to just light a log on fire without a lot of working out to burn burn burn burn burn these are complimentary systems that are really close to the same thing propene is none of those things propene is more a piece of metal if you are out in the woods with me and we were trying to make a fire and year haycock have found some old a railroad over there let us throw that on there i would probably look at you lectures now technically can you melt metal sure but you are going to burn a lot of energy to try to get a little bit back out of the metal and now you have also cost yourself a very very valuable structure proline is a fuel source for exercise or eatables is is an incredibly poor choice your body will do it again may be five to ten per cent but you now you are burning a very valuable supply in a situation in which you do not know where there is ever going to be any more remember proline is fairly transient it isn't you are not very good storing it you can store a ton of cargo hydrate and an unlimited literally amount of fat you just really need a disregard thinking about protein as a fuel source your body does not want to do it you are not good at it you can go through a process of gluconeogenesis from propene make locos from it is just very poor you are not going to get much out of the exchange and you have burned your supply of metal which is going be very difficult a it is a very high commodity in the woods sir the wilderness to have something metal for people that consume very low cargo hydrate or s your carbon hydrate diets a they pulling more energy from muscle which i imagine is a conversion of the mendacity into ready carbontrins ye i mean in this particular case whence you have reach a a certain level of adaptation you have just got an extremely good at generating glue of from other fashions right you can by us heavily towards fadadaptation the downside is and we have seen this born in literature you are going to perform slower if you do not care about maximizing performance especially over something where it is a maximal effort for a few minutes or something then may be you're not concerned and than that ebsllygrate especially for people just do not exercise then hat get very little concerning here but if your interest in your performance in you are wondering why you dislike slugging it down what you have done is you have down regulated the ability little the enosis responsible for that entire anerobic li calls is portion they get down regular which means here is not as much around any more and you get really bad and slow using carbide's as if you will for is a very poor strategy for people on n anerobic a sport or who that type of activity cant you do not care no problem i if you do not accuse at all than you really have no prove there which is actually why a high fat low car dehydrate nutrition strategy for people who do not do much physical activity is probably vertwemen it is very effective tit is a really get strategy for weight management for energy stabilization throughout the day and the research would very much support that in my observation i would agree have tried locarborhydrate diets of severely limiting or completely limiting carbohydrate and after about two or three days i feel pretty lousy but mostly because i want to train very intense lie in the gem in addition to doing longer runs i tend to do all of those things across the week a but have also observed and in fact no several people that lovely very low carbohydrate a a see to keetoganic type diet they are not doing keeper bandits for mental health's reasons person a but indeed those people tend to do very limited exercise or they tend to do a lot of long endurance but low intensity long endurance these are the i walk to get my exercise types and they do indeed walk a lot and some of them merge to ism control their wight very readily and that die for that reason a when we had langnoron on the podcast he am pointed out quite aptly that in order to lose weight you have to restrict something other worse time or a mackronutrance et camera to arrive at that ism subcloric threshold ism get below that it is a submantenance threshold i guess one the things i want to point out is this should be received as again not aid this is better or worse this is is you now have a tine of option whatever personal preference other factors you get to craft is strategy of performance esthetics and health based on your personal preferences at this point it'd to go back to our classic list of nine adaptations that exercise can induce the first for of course being largely largely unrelated to days conversation but that were covered in the episode that we did on strength speed and per just remind people the in adaptations our number one skilling technique to speed three power which is speed times force for strength and five hypertrophy to day we are talking about the remaining adaptations on that list starting with muscular endurance followed by anerobic capacity followed by maximal aerobic output and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise if we could start with muscular endurance this would be a number six on the list of nine adaptations muscular endurance how do i build muscular endurance why should i build muscular endurance and just to remind me what fuel sources our predominating when ism training for muscular endurance great remember muscular endurance is something that is going to be generally in a local muscle it is not a party of aster or systemic issue and it tends to be something in the neighborhood of say five to maybe even unto fifty repetitions this is the class example gave heres how many pushups can you do in a rule most people are to land somewhere that range it just said how many situps can you do in amend how many pull ups how long can you hang on a bar a is a dead hang things that that is must endurance muscular endurance is not a mile run or a marithonanam that e how long can i stand without breaking posture this is muscular endurance a plank o wants it a great yes love all these things i cave now the reason i took you on that big long the cabalism during is i could help you understand exactly how train this fact or any these factors with a more comprehensive understanding was happening meaning thinking back tho the cabalism if ism gong o ask my triceps to do fifty push ups in a row what is going to be my limiting factor am i going to run out of fat no chance am i going to run out of agent no chance that is a way to few of repetitions you have a lot left there what is going be to thing that stops me from getting fifty one repetitions either you arguing to have too high of a p we rise too much acid build u or you are rung to have a problem clearing the wast really this is two factors dealing with acid build up and getting acid out of the muscle tissue and end to circulation cause you have plenty of ability to handle that small amount of acid build up in your entire body it is us you cannot handle it in that tiny spot now i pick the triceps for a very specific reason you are going to deal with more pain when you use a large muscle group your quads yer gluten than you are with a small muscegroup for example nobody ever threw up after army but a lot of people throw up after leg day why is that look at the total amount of waste that your dumping in your system when you have quadrupled or tears the muscle size small muscle groups are only really going to be challenged in that localariat large ones will dump much waste in the system that you will want avoid that as quickly are possible and that's one f the reasons why you throw up after hard exercise great the reason laughing because i do not think have ever thrown up a from a way training session and it is making me wonder if have ever trained that hard i received a or obtain the progress that i wanted to generally over time not every week every work out every month a but certainly over the thirty pussies that i way training have achieved the the results i want i have however vomited after a long run when i did not hydrate well a you re if i drank too much water sir oh sir too much water yet you will you will get that out quick i just a one o be click use i thinks of you are getting the picture that if they are not vomiting theater they are leg work out that they are not training according to at your standards again by the way i doctor and gallant runs experiments in's lady's recruiting subjects i also notice my gradual students ans right i natant sorry to interrupt a but i theft it was the necessary interruption muscular endurance there is plenty of fuel plenty of fuel you manage acid build up and you all seeing to get that fuel you that's can to be a caplarization issue the way that we can think about this is capillaries surround your muscle and the whole point of them is that blood can come into them they hit this caplarization that actually slows the diffusion made of blood down and you can exchange nutrients in and get waste products out and then we get things back in a circulation the more of those you have the better you are at dispersing any of these waste product built up whether it seal to or the acid the adaptation you precooking for here is an increasing capitalization potentially as slight increase in male candid but the time is too fast right we are going to be able to d to do these fifty repetitions an say under a minute or something that getting the mobilization in the minor contra getting fuel that way who so it is not really going to get our performance you what a strategies to increase acid buffering ability and then capitalization on the calpliatization side you simply needed train at that ability you go close to failure and practice that often that alone will increase increase blood flow to that local aria which will gate take you though your process of increasing calpitization easy peace specificity just to briefly interrupt i find it remarkable though not surprise in giving how amazing the human body is that simply by doing some movement repeat like walls or a a or pushups or dips for that matter rep elderly over and over and over until you reach that failure point yet there were that quaking point in the case of a wall sit that provides a stimulus for more capillaries to be built into the system literally the the production in ore the the trafficking of endothelia sells which make up the capillaries and allow baby more little pipes to feed the system with oxygen and remove waste products it is irrigation right imaging out a giant fielding had two big pipes trying down the outside well in fact if you want to make sure water gets even the disperse crossing airfield you will have a bunch of off shooting little pipes and the more those you have the more coverage you get do we know what the the specific signal is that says hey i failed at this we need more capillaries act you do not know what that is i could i would speculate its a combination of a acidity as well as carbonioxcide and probably some nitrocoxside stuff happening there but i act my do not know ism guessing nobody knows for sure because we still do not know for instance what the exact signal is for hypertrophy it is kind of an amazing situation we know the requirements for getting thee silly want debut we still do not know what the specific signal is in any event what ism hearing is building more capillaries is great for enhancing muscular endurance and the way to get more capillaries into those muscles is to train for muscular endurance by getting close to failure or to some point where you simply cannot continue for whatever reason could you give us an example of what a reasonable training protocol might be in terms of the classic galloping lists now eh exercise choice maybe a few options order volume and frequency great what shall we be doing how often shall we be doing it and yon for since she do waits to failure than push ups to failure i given that this is a local process ism guessing that if i do push up to failure ism not get increase the number of carries in my legs very much correct you nailed it exercise choice is high precision here pick the muscle group and the exact sequencing and movement pattern you want hug precision this is the thing if you want in it better to plank hold a plank a new more push ups to more pushups you can do some other stuff that is complimentary but really this is a high precision game do the exact same thing for exercise choose very similar gain terms of exercise order i space this dove tails with volume ye can i combine training let us a waits for my quads and rein o near by muscle groups and then do push ups to failure a and then also do some sort of a pulling exercise to failure yet absolutely again pick the exercises you want the moving patents you want to do and do them the order almost does not matter with the one cannot with larger muss groups particularly again moltipull lag activities that will induce a small amount of systemic fatigue and s if you i guess theoretically wanted a maxim is your push up number and you did a whole bunch of say splitsquaps and you just did those an and you you you did lunges for a mile or something that you might actually slightly compromise you might not but you might slifelly compromise your ability to do as many pullups in real or hold a bent over over something that if you really cared about that level ism then you may be want to do the thing that is most important first in general my recommendation those to do the bigger muscle group first how many sets and how often should one perform training for muscular endurance and when now the lovely part here as we have moved down the spectrum past hypertrophy you do not need a lot of load here in fact the load only needs to be at or slightly above what you want to move if you want to get better at moving fifty per cent of your wonder at man you do not really need to train much more than fifty maybe fifty five or sixty per cent of your one er a man because if you go higher than that the repetition counts going to fall and you are no longer going o be training muscle end durance you just need to stay right around that number that you want a work on again if the target is doing more pullups and assuming that you have the strength to do it you check that box you simply need to practice the repetition range that you want to be in that is all it takes you can repeat that a number of times but because remember the volume is fairly low the load is very very low you can act you repeat these quite frequently s you will not get extremely sore for must endurance relative to traditional hypertry straining because the load is very very likes you can do these more frequently if you would more frequently such as you can do a three or four times a week easy if you would you do not necessarily need to three days a week per muscle group is probably fine here ism if you wanted to do more sets on a given day and do less days that would be find if you ante do two days a week and you say wanted to do let us say you could do twenty five push ups and the goal is to get to thirty pushups just as an example you might say o key ism going to do sets of seventeen i am to do three sets o that i do that three days week that is going to build up quite a bit or you could say look ism in to do set easily to failure ism recover and do one or two sets that say eighty per cent and it'll do that twice a week that is going to push the pacteporto when you can have a lot of i gains from that and again this is not about hypertupy this is about muscular endurance r i do want to emphasize and bean please correct me if ism ism talking out of line here do want emphasize it beau we mention pullups you if you cannot get twenty five pullups then and you are doing ten you are training for hyperform you are not training for muscular endurance tethered there is a big cross over here any time we are talking pass fifteen raps were technically in hyperchiry and muscular undergo it here is a commostake i do not want to get bulky ism ism mi to go lighter in do more rats and then people grow and then you bandit still right in the middle of hypertry ran rat they tribuwere all my gods overtime i lift awaits i blow up i go lighter i do more raps on it u still right in he parties they would last shall be much better off training very very heavy in the one to three reprints being they get really strong and they would not grow much exactly tell me if this is a reasonable pro to call for what ism going to call the typical person in my mind the typical person somebody who hopefully is doing resistance training hitting that ten sets permuscele group per week minimum yet to maintain or build strength and hypertrophy but is also doing some long duration training that will talk about an i bit maybe throwing in the high intend work out here or there some sprints maybe some plimattricks some skill base training they dong a bunch of different things yet to be all what i would call all around fit yet they're not training for any specific event or trying to maximizes any one of the nine adaptations to the exclusion the others that person decide of after am they do their longer run they are going to do a man time a plank to maturation they arguing to walls to maturation and they do push up some alteration and then also do that same work out before they do their higintensy interval training some other point during the week and then maybe even do it again am on their a called rest day just a real quack five minutes adore and in doing build more calories into the relevant muscle groups and build their muscular endurance yet without eating into their over all recovery too much too much yes again the nice part about this is they do not hammer you too much you are not going to get tremendously sore if you keep the load light the only which i make theirs i would probably do them after you are interval rather than before you can make sure you keep quality there an your not compromise by a local muster an derange when your actually trying to get a more systemic fatigue with something a hirinpencity interval trying that would work fantastic the only other variable we have not it on heros progression and this is very simple try to add a rep or to per week that is really i after after if you are up to twenty two this week today at twenty three next week or for wallets in planksthat would be at it at time time and if and if you run into a wall there just the same concepts we talked about with trying the iperthry back it down the more in the eighty or eighty five per cent range and accumulate a lot more practice that is can t help a lot with capitulation as well as ask i offerings you can continue to give yourself signals for deregulation ism of the processes needed for that and it is not always pushing you to the end and you are just we do not want always go to failure of strength we do not always go to failure with hinters onerous either same thing would be happening here what about anerobic capacity how should people train for anerobic capacity what exactly are they training for meaning what is the structural or seller adaptation or adaptations that r occurring that allow for increases an anerobic capacity and why are increases an anerobic capacity good for us even if we are a quoting quit insurance athlete or we are a recreational a exerciser who is not interested in building more muscle speed or things that i typically associate with anerobic capacity yea this is really really fun remember aerobe capacity is the total amount of work you can do for something seconds to a few minutes this is extremely high levels of fatigue the highest you are really going to see and by fatigue here i mean acid build up my products not fatigue is in densely on o one do this any mores if we just think about the energetic for second man adieu say let let take a really easy example of people have done that thing where you a you will go to the track and you spent the straightaways and you walk the corners member that sort of think you a tobotons thirty on thirty off things this this is what were talking about i in this kind of aerobe capacity ere now here is what gong to happen is fat going to be your limiting now we are have already made that clear right what about carbohydrates well if it is a single bout or a two or three bouts probe not but if you are doing this for a long time saving and go thirty on thirty off for twenty rounds you may act you start reaching a point of running on must divided it in any those cases o you are going to be running in to an acid problem if you were to continue to do this multiped repetitions in addition to running on muscle age you are also must tart running into oxygen transportation problems because you are building up a lot of by products you got it continue you will act cruise into a robin colitis this is exactly why the community that i have worked a lot with a professional fighters very highlable boxers world champions you have see fighters it is a five minute round that you are going to do five times is for world champing tiffight to get one minute breaking between imagine going thirty on thirty off for five minutes getting one minute break an doing that five times even know the individual bouts are thirty seconds long the entire thing last long it is primarily aerobic you have to have both capacities a get really high aerobic you also have to have a lot of aerobic going on you haw are you going to start running in to limitations because of hart rate stroke volume and then even potentially ventilation the need for oxygen to be able to come in in clear the carbon i tolly out of the system becomes a problem because not only are you having much build up for such a long time you are also using mouthful muscle groups now this is a very importdistinction must go endurance tends to be localize nap this is not why if you are doing at these intervals your hon anal bike your sprinting up behind you're grappling with somebody you have a lot of muscles being vole bhitweens all that ways is being dumped into the central par you half to clear and ism by clear i now mean not out of the muscle i mean out of the body you are ability to bring an utilize oxygen is going to be a major limitation yourebily to handles what do you do well specificity winds practise the exact thing you are talking about if you want to get better at spending the straightaways and walk in the corners do that you cannot always do it though we've going to run in limitation this is when backing off to a lower intensity it is going to give you a lot of benefits we know very clearly if you want to improve party of asker fitness high intensity modern intensity allow intensity or effective and you actually probably one do a little bit of all of hem this is why none of our riders whatever just do high intensity training there is going to be some moderate ism we tend to call this cardiac output training i you can think of this as anywhere between zone to to zone four if you zones i do not use them personally am just going to intentionally interrupt you because this issue of zones has come up a few times i want to make sure everybody's on the same page you also mention that you do not necessarily favor the zone nomen cloture but for those not familiar zone one to three four we up to five is a of a back to the envelope a type verbiage you have some people and is more precisely followed by for other people meaning for me a zone one is simply walking a easy walking zone too would be for anybody the pace or intensity of exercise that one could perform while still maintaining a conversation but just barely meaning if you were to push any harder then it would be difficult to hold that conversation then you be in zone three and then zone three for five as i understand them are little bit vague a but maybe you could give us a a sense of the breathing patterns associate with each of the zones that people could a nap to those a when we discuss zone one through five a and as i say all this i certainly am tip my hat to all of those people out there who to measure percent maximum hart rate om they to use tartrate monitors on the using any number of different devices i sometimes use those devices but in general i tend not to and i use my breathing as a rough guide of which zone i am in before we go back to specific protocols for anaerobic capacity tell me how you think about down one through five and how people might be able to assess whether or not there in iron one two three or four were five great on five is that absolute top thing and we can flag ourselves there i liked how you flagged one in to the distinction between three for an five ism unless concerned with either i we will do some her rate stuff but not to identify what zonate ism the fact is the distinction between those zones is basely just made up right not that it is fate but is no ration all there it is a obit perceived effort you wait letting the you ho are you at a hundred percent output or seven er set it when you are at zero and when your at a hundred in that moment but the difference between sixty and seventy is anybody's guess o we use or the relevant right why is a matter from sixty or seventy is here actually different there is not it tit does not really matter in that regard ism if you are very highly trained particularly cyclist rings that then and you can control lot of circumstances those things start to make a lot more sense i between you are an open environment the ethics i deal with it is is not in o it is not in a matt of that much ism the way that i approach this is and i will use this word intentually stolen de erectly from bran my ken and his company shift adapt ism they use what is called a beer system and i absolute love it islet w be using for a long time with trying with your permission o on a take a right now thank you brandy give me the permission to born bran's a good friend of of ours and i do think the breathing your system is a terrific way to think about the zones and to get in good sense of what on one happens to be yet great ism the first gear is your ability to simply breathe in and out through your nose at a set caters basically regardless of how hard your working can you restrict your breathing to a two to three second and had and then i too to three second exhale and this is really clever actually because a lot of folks will jump immediately into an overreaching straits men to be ventilating more than you need which actually sends that aureate up higher then i need to be which kick you higher and to carbohydrate mutilation if you're supposed to be in caruncle on one you are trying to be efficient not fast using more carbohydrates than you need is not beneficial here ism you are walking for the day you are out on a longer high c ugly enjoying the you should not be trying to ramp up carbhydremtablas and it should be efficient a as this would be it getting to an argument with somebody while on a long walk you all exhausted afterwards your it overreaching yes totally right my you should beagle to breathe at a specific tens and generally people are a doing that more frequently than big than than y i on to rather gear too is inhaling and exhaling at whatever rate you need to be but still naval only it is a force right whatever you need to do but your mouth as close the entire time you've shifted higher up you are burning more and more car be hydrate as a feel source i but you are still able to control that an restricted i nasal breathing now gear three and for which of our final ones there no gear five gear a three in for is a subtle striction actually dontymen care about the difference there i basely used gear one too and then that is for but you are base you talking about either a nose to mouth strategy or straight up mouthmouth y breathing in through the nose out through the mouth if you can control that way you n know the opposite actually right can you breathe in and out though your knows but the classic one people do is into the nose out of the mouth again i death nan care about this distinction i basely jump from to to for a brine may do differently i do not actually know i for is just mouth mouth right and this is the case in most sporting applications you areca be breathing because the nose is restricted right there is only much space and as we talked about earlier the consequences of not having enough oxygen in or seal to exculpation if you are restricting that this is going to be problematic in your actual competition please go to the mouth if you need to wright we practise a lot trying to stay navel only for as long as possible i but that is going to have eventually happen when you are doing your high intents an intervals and you are really going as hard as you can you are got a have to go your mouth in let your an absolute free carbide and you can say in your know but that is nock con a hap an right most people cannot get past say seventy or eighty percent i well breathing thou your know ism i know something we get higher but that is the general distinction we pay much more attention to those particular gears than we do heart rates on and disown five would be just pure mouth breathing all it run run your your life the gear systems just wonderful there is no fifth gear got it the gear for would again be mouthmouth breathing as much in as you cannot breathing as much as y can you got it and i appreciate your description of of the gear system and how it am roughly relates to thrones we have been talking about of am am reminded if any one wants to experience the relationship between breathing in the off floating of carbon oxide and your ability to exert effort in anything a game that a friend of mine sometimes likes to play when we walker jog and talk as he will say let us just hold our breath now until we hit that piling or that a life hardstand on the beach and within seconds you ashy construct a panic as also becomes very hard to coordinate your action after a little while again be really careful with this but but it we will teach you in a moment in a very real world way how important it is to be able to off load carmndoxid because your ye probably not running out of oxygen at those lower intensity is no u you are simply building up carbon oxide and that gas reflects screaming to go off in your actively suppressing it yep the interesting test here is your seal to tolerance ism on banyan's webs go directly there you can there is a body to ow to run this test and then you can put in your numbers and it will tell you a sort of exactly what to do as result of it but the seel to tolerance us is a test of exactly but you just mention you should be fairly tolerant and there was non reactive you can be responsive but non reactive to elevations and seal to you should see them an feel them but you should be choosing how you respond rather than and reaction i there are interesting date of looking at things out of the blue panic attacks you can actually notice those in blood the arises and seal two up to forty five minutes prior to the event a happening there are signal's happening in your body ism that you may be sensitive or not sensitive to the more intone you can get with that the better your life is going to be i and even if were specifically just talking about exercise performance it is okay for seal to arise it is going to rise it is a b product of anerobic aero metabolism it is a by product of carbohydrate and fatmatablas as we have established it is going to get there you are going to feel that however if you immediately going to a panic because of a small increase in seal to this is a prop returning to anerobic capacity this morning we were training not together i count keep up with your work out but i but in the same a general space and i did my once a week maximum heart rate a one minute sprint on the assault by sometimes it'll do more minutes a meaning i will do i one minute than take some last into another minute after some rest but i decided do that one minute with you there i could learn from you and indeed i have to assume that that was largely within the anerobic capacity a realm the first thirty seconds or were tangible would we more and more painful there is a quit signal going off in my head you said there is real magic that occurs around second forty and indeed somewhere found second forty for whatever reason it seemed easier but at the one minute mark you s happystoppies i was really at at least what felt to me a one under percent output is that a good protocol for building up anerobic capacity keeping in mind what you said before which is that specificity a precision as you raised it am is important that is if i want to train a interrupt capacity for sprinting i probably should have been sprinting liking i was i was on why assault bike and on how many of those one minute all out spring or thirty i can all out sprints on t on the bike could in should wane perform per work out and per week marching through exercise choice yet must do a order volume frequency and progression yet choice of exercises train for what you want to improve is that right not necessary in this particular case if you have a specific yes of course do it ism exercise choice a couple of things you wanted look for you want a pick something that you feel extremely confident in the movement with because you are going to forget your brain very quickly here because you are going to going to our pain cave gape if you are not comfortable running do not go run here you are never big to get the spot wen you you get with if you are not comfortable of every time you you go on a rower your low back hits the next day do not do it if you are not comfortable using catlebell swing is that you the point do not do an exercise your not comfort with you also secondarily want to be careful cautious of heavy eccentric lots because you are going to be doing a lot of repetitions on a high intensity this is where i love in assault bias why a rower is great swimming is amazing running up hill generally more favorable than running on a normal ground especially re not runner do not run down hi that is the lofty centric load i do not love things box jumps here right because again a lot of eccentric loading if suppose you can jump up land in the booster down but now you are you are again you are do me thingsare going your mind i do not in ta slip and fall in mu smash my shin in the box what happens if i m do many perils pick something that is safer where you can really folks on your breathing in your posture and the performance it that is exercise choice and and within that if there is some specific thing you want o get better at go ahead do it one how many different movements meaning should i do the assault by and then on some form of safe executable overhead pressing is hard it is little harder to imagine am in rob capacity for the upper body unless you have access to a sheer or one of these am what the things call the climbed machines see at the first climber a verse climber that is the one of the rush climber you tell how often i do that one a ah is a greats great piece of each crime yous for wetting how many how many how many exercises and in what order is it going to be two or three exercise since you are involving a lot of muscle groups to m that is you really distinction generally these are going to be total bodymovements you can do something a sheer if you want a really isolate your upper body great love that you can do lower body isolation cycling might improvise i invade you can use waits here you can do some barbell movements and and self that there is not my favorite choices for most people to any complex city things going on ah i generally going to pick total body movements a pushing a sled dragging a sled sprinting up hill swimming these things that argon o be good ism seen now why the assault by an such a powerful tool because you are using your arms with some degree of resistance but not a lot of eccentric lowed plus legs some resistance not a lot of eccentric lowed and yet one can go cubicle all out for thirty sixty seconds yet and t in the consequences of a technical break down are mental you are is more your can acting have a worse performance rather than an injury rat that there is just a wonderful invention a because of that where other things the con sequences say if you are going to be doing a barbell or catabell activity the consequences of making a tackling mistake you might actually get in acute injury right there they are just a lit bit higher in the risks seal how many sets or sometimes refer to his repeats yet how many thirty to sixty second all out sprints again does not have to be running sprinting but all out effort you be the better way to phrase it should i perform let us say per week and then decide whether not we can divide those up across multiple work outs or whether notes better to do them h the same work o yet if you are staying with the same exercise for all of your workouts slow o bit different answer than if you are if you are modifying them say you gin to do this three times a week and you do an price one day you n do some hill sprints another day and you can do some swimming another day for they of example ism going to say same movement because i think most people are going to be most comfortable with one or two types of movements unless they are really coordinated or an excellent ally i think most people can probably find a hill that they could run up and a an aerdineor assault by a rower things o that sort yet you are gun a have a pro an con here the pro of doing less sets if you can actually train much closer to truly one hundred per cent the downside is volumes low a major mistake people make here is they will do something i it'll do twenty seconds on ten seconds off how will do that for forty rounds you are not really actually going that hard of twenty second a key in fact if you look at the literature in all the boy and all the positive benefits of high intents in your training that assumes you are actually hitting very close to one hundred per cent if you are sliding down and again moderate training stuff you start to actually being a spot where you are not getting the total his in stuff be you aren't doing it long enough to get the low in stuff either and being up in this you burn some calories you probably still enhanced final condrabout dentist is me little about a civilization but you did not really justify only doing three rounds that is were the problem comes in in terms of a couple of protocols it'll give you how many sets per week it is it is really hard to give a number unlike the strength train stuff were it was easy to convince himself on ma typical thing you will see is a minimumbilf tends to be something four rounds per day three times per week that is a lot my once a week all out effort of sprinting on the assault by the called ermine bike for sixty seconds one to three rounds of that might be doing something useful for me but i should probably be doing that two or three times a week if you are on to get to a man hart right id general to say give me a minimum of one day a week those better days per week how many rounds whatever it takes you to get to that maxim harried i in your case you did one minute o get good if you are going to extend past a minute or two one round might be enouhso for example i if you want to die do something where ism going a run a mile as fast as it can that is all you need to do for the day you do not need to do multiple you can do mile re pieces if you would but that is really really challenging i know we have extended the time ration here but i want to go there to show you the time do me matters you if you doing something a twenty second burst you are going to need more rounds if you doing something longer multiple minutes you do not need as many rounds to get there i in addition if you are really reaching at this i ninety seconds of of hell wen do it is just going to do a lot more damage this is am not damaging than bad but is in likes a at to recover here we need more recovery time from thaw a twenty second burst does not really challenge you challenge you in that twenty second she but youould be recovered and fine a three minute thing he's going a hurt nit is can a hurt for many many many minutes after that and you're going to still see may be some perform a secondments then next day depending on what your recovery stuff looks ism a couple of things to pay play with a be something this if you want to try a classic thirty seconds on thirty seconds off protocol the literature ill show a minimum of four rounds of that probably three days a week thirty second it is all out thirty seconds rest is one round repeat that four times at least once a week at least two would be better right right if you want to go something a lot longer n that you might be able to get away with one i but generally two days week of this is better if you start actually pushing pass three to four days a week unto five or six you may actual be causing some problems there is is just a little bit of excess fatigue this cannot happen there that youyoue may you must stay away from in fact u you can we a lot of anderican logical problems and some other sleep issues on some other things ticking and we will talk about more of those things as later but ism that is a number to get with if you want to try something more a twenty second first i act you would recon mend giving yourself more rest you can actually do a higher rest then work ratio most people tend to thing of this is doing one to one twenty seconds on twenty seconds off or lower i love doing twenty seconds on forty seconds off the quality of that twenty seconds becomes extraordinarily high and it is also possible to now get six to eight rounds sos ism hearing this ism going to wager a an offer i to you and if you say o k i then to to those listening this son's what you are tolling me about the relationship between intensity and quality and the need for sufficient duration of this anerobic work how is five to six minutes per week of all out work that s pretty good what that means for me is i would do three all out one minute sprint on one work out separated by a minute or two maybe more and i would do that two or three times per week just trying to hit that five or six minute per week threshold yet actually think i one of the a martin cabala is the scientist a canada ago amazing work who's done a lot of the the research on high intensional stop rag ad i think the number he actually throughout there some of hits original research was comparing six total minutes of work to upwards of a hundred eighty minutes of work throughout the entire week and i an one of the classic studies was looking at veal to man improvements and he saw equal if not greater improvements of real to mats with that i think actually name of his book might be this six minute work out or something and you may have nail that directly on the head a purely by lock but actually by also may be on a never s we her ropy fact that ye well and also by inference from what you ware saying y enough you gang to do this twenty seconds on forty seconds off ad you doing more rounds or one minute all out its the way ism going to think about this if it is to came with you is for five to six minutes a week i am sprinting for my life correct but ism sprinting for my life with good form in whatever movement i happen to be doing and i can do all of that in one work out but ism separating out bouts of twenty seconds all the way up to one minute ye by the necessary last in order to recover my breathing get back to pure nail breathing may be known one's own early totally and then headed again if you can do t one minute thing you do i actually generally encourage one to three minutes of rest before you do the next round and probably up the four to six rounds that would be your six men at number there now the cavy out there is we do not worry about hartraht recovery we worry about exactly what you mentioned which is naval only recovery once you can get back to that if yourself another thirty seconds or and he you are ready to go for round to is where gets fun because i can imagine challenging myself to get on the assault by for one minute of kind of worm up very low intensity each morning and then sprint for a minute and then head coffin to my daily routine no of that if you are going to do that though you need to give me three minutes a navel only breathing before you go back to work we need to downcerly to that and therefore people in my life that would love for me to engage in more naval breathings as will have me speaking less i no problem chances are ism going to use the two or three work outs per week of one minute all out may we'll try the shorter never to call can i give you one for portaled a dryer please if you have a even uses on any equipment but i learned this from him another mutual friend canny can this is a great little it is a little test little a little game you can play with yourself and the only way to play this game is you are going to lose which is really really lovely you can do this in any durst d you can do this for any duration of time but two minutes is a good number case you have to do this ins tome were you can no distance this can be running ism cycling the the are bike is what i us the first two minutes you are going to cover as much distance as you can possibly cover in two minutes and you are going to note that let us say you covered four hundred meters o cate great you are going two rest for two minutes amazing that next round you are now going to go for distance you are going to cover the exact same won a distance you covered in round one which in this example as four hundred meters and it does not matter how long it takes you it may take you two minutes in five seconds two minutes in ten seconds cause you are little bit fatigue from round one round three your cannot come back and do that exact same time do main that you did around to if it took you two minutes in five seconds and round two now round three is going the last two minutes and five seconds and you want to see if you can cover a greater distance four hundred and five meters for hundred ten meters then you did around one and the beauty of this little protocol six minutes total of work right but if you slack in one of the rounds you just make the next round harder is there any rest between rounds yet two minutes always two minutes rest you not have to but this s mud be my recommendation can my cane came up with us i i do not know if he came out with it he tot me well thank we both no can an he is an incredibly nice and incredibly skilled trainer i i met call it the sugar cane yet great because it sounds really painful and if yo go bout too hard round one you are in such big trouble round to but if you go too easy round one you are going to get absolute obliterated and round three it is it take a wonderful thing and you can pick that number as a sanitation an then is try to improve that a little bit per week progression is the last part of this whole thing that we have not got to yet before yo move on ism and in the way you want to progress all of these things is you can time stamp again how much work you can do and then is try to do a slightly hire amount of work five per cent or every week or you can add a round which is really nice way ism e in the in the research ism studies that o ben done there can to do things week one you will do three rounds we two you will do four rounds see three you go five rounds so at a round until you get up to say six or seven or eight rounds at the end of the protocol that is a really nice way to go about it or you can cap the rounds and just try to get more work done in that same about a time meaning going more intensely correct get fond get further distance in your thirty seconds or your forty five seconds or whatever ism i wanting courage people you go as low as twenty seconds that is going alive to go very very very fast that is going to actually challenge that phosphicretiong piece a little bit i want on courage people also go as high as ninety seconds the honest way the way that i will do it not that it is about me but just as an example of something you could do i do something in the fifteen to twenty second burst range and i will generally hedge towards a two to one rest to work ratio saw i probegain a rest forty to sixty seconds that is sure to that is to make sure that twenty second burst is extremely high quality to ism also gong to do something in the third to fifty second range gape i might go one to one work restrain the quality of those thirty seconds is gingko come down but the acid buffering is going to be extraordinarily challenge ill also will do that with a triple or quadruple rest range again thirty seconds on maybe two minutes off now i will not be able to i will not be working on my ability to handle i the waste product build up there but it'll be working on my ability to produce more force over that time which is another sail said and then all the way up to say what you do a minute seventy seconds and you can go one to one there or up to three to one ism you can be working a lite bit of is differencing but that is exactly how we hit both sizes of this equation working on dealing with waste as well as actually working on bringing in neutrino and getting that system all of it more affect ism you call set that up across your week and just it can be something day one is that twenty second burst window day two is that maybe sixty second window and ten day three is may be one all out effort and we are done there let us talk about the specific protocols and adaptations related to maximum erotic output or maximum moronic capacity is at sometimes called sore now removing past that couple of minute range in to the an five to fifteen men a range but at a maximum intensity it is the hides you can go from there we are not talking about tour last category of long duration here well the beautiful part is we have worry explain the lot of it cause it is very similar that we just talked about with anteropcapacity a it is primarily going to be a problem of dealing with waste products especially at the end it is not enough total distance to be running out of muscle like in though it may start to creep down a little bit fats not can be in issue but certainly more oxygen transportation is cane in issue we are just hedging a little bit more towards that side of the equation towards the end of that work out no doubt about it clearing out waste products his going to be a huge issue but really oxygen demand delivery starting to take more of a prominent role because we have had more time to clear waste and if we are not good at that were to be failing earlier than we need the train for that needs to be a little bit at that exacting a class i thing here is a one mile that is right this s on a last for most people somewhere between five and ten minutes you are sort of right in this window i if you just want ta practice that once a week we are done here right exercise choice same thing we talked about right pick and exercise your comfortable with that you can actually do and you can progressively increase in terms of the intensity ism you not can to you have to stop and change your exercise and i can avenge round a circuit is not great here because you got a put one implement down pick up another one you wight to be doing something where there is little not a second of offswitch similar exercise choice principles we just covered if you on become a real savage and you want do repeats here you can i in durance folks will do that a lot one while repeats eight hundred mi your repeats things that or ism not sure with the swimming nuisance equivalence would be but swimmers we do this constantly but you do not need to this is really hard its pretty hard in the system it is very good for you one to twice a week of hitting this i think you been a really really good spot ism frequency we sort of discovered we covered exercise choice volume ye distorted nailed and intensity is basically running you up to the top there now because you can only do that often you want o at in another forty or per cent of your time being lower intensity support work for that this is something probably less tan eighty five percent of your heart rage but higher than quotncotizown to youegot to be working here this is not i could have a conversation pace this is higher than that it is in between conversation pace and the pace i need to be at to run my fastest mile of ever done that is that middle ground and you need to train that thatyou can continue to work i capitalization and actin transportation but you are not burning down the house getting all we up to hundred hundred plusterscent of your veal to man could i use a a a crude version of this were i say of ism going to exercise for ten minutes me go as fast as i safely can and every week ism going to measure how far i travel yet was that ten minutes love it probably not on the same day that ism doing the interlay capacity work probably not if your probably cade to you after a strength training or hyportovy work out as long as it din train legs you could it is probably an a compromised recover is the way i would if you region to do a session this i would probably do it on its own day unless you wanted to do something speed or power then you could roll right to this and have no problem maybe a strength ta a hypritury day ism not sure i you do there because a again especially be did any sort of lord by t exercise toucan be compromised here but remember these ten to be full body movements even if you did arms that day your arms an be is and you do not want a fail this because of local muscular failure id's a now on my work cut out for me i me to be doing five to six minutes r week of all out work divided into sixty twenty sixty second bouts with sufficient rest and ism going to give myself ten minutes a week of in my case you will probably be running as fast as i can a i do enjoy running and i can do it safely maybe up hill and see how far i go yet if you want to combine the to so yo saying hey ism bought in and i want to do both of these sames they are similar but they have independent benefits ism convinced how would i build these in the same week ism maybe do one of each that still gets you at qotuncle two days per week were were git ti can a hot maxim her right we are to check that box of one day can be a shorter length interval repeat one an the other one can simply be a five to fifteen minute maximum work and you are done long duration insurance exercise the stereo typical insurance exercise our how far how long how faster how slow should o rather a should i go and here ism can venture that exercise choice is one that we could click off even at this point in the discussion because obviously it ascot to be something that i can do for a long while without getting injured over you injuries there is a little bit a tell do we coactulou thrown here one of the things i love to do for long duration endurance for people do not love running cycling a swimming as you can do the really cool work out any number of things where you can put a little circuit together as long as there is not a lot of down time between one circuit of the next time you can actually do as something as simple as maybe you are going to do farmers carries and you will do that for say three minutes and you will set those down you you will go straight in to a plank for a minute and you will pick that up andyou go straight in to may be body weight squats for two minutesthand you go straight in to another exercise and you suit you can sort of road take things around maybe you can do even some shadow boxing stop or some jump to you can do different him tactics movements and body weight movements and you can run that thing through and you can base cut get the exact same thing accomplished and not feel your doing o my gosh this mine numbing type of training if it feels that to you another a can do that after you've simplify even more we have done this that can cans him plenty of times where you just maybeven pick three machines a in no of i ago ten minutes on the rower and i go ten minutes on the tread tell on ism go ten minutes on the bike you can actually knock a thirty minute quotuncle steadystake session out in and not feel those promise if those things happens you an actually have a lot of in there we will do a lot of times with our fighters we will do things put a very low load ism talking sob fifty per we of your man on a barbell and you can a squad and you can do no maybe a minute you can a put that down another you can to go over and do fifty percent of a bench rest u to put that down you can o go over and do fifty per cent of a of a charlock and you can go over into another one and you can actually run tho this entire thing you do not hit that many reps and any individual movement the load is very very light and you can keep tartrate was steady state in do fifteen or twenty or thirty different exercises and sector a fairly fun and engaging to do in it is a titbit more specific than trying to give a two hundred and seventy five pound and a fell player to run for thirty minutes which is not can be good ism just chuckling because i love to run out doors ah and have enjoyed runs an an my travels and if i find it to be a great way to see different places at i moving through space but there are weather conditions and times when that is not adoptions to what you described is a terrific alternative i have to assume that the specific adaptation that is occurring here is related to the fat burning system and again that does not angrily mean fat loss graver all but fat burning system and yet i do have a question which is can you build invented microcaplary systems into the muscles o by doing this long deration cardiac yet absolute can in fact trepanning on which paper you more than the other papers a you maybe find evidence that this is a superior method then anything else a steady state endurance is very important i used to not it is much there is is much evidence now that suggests it is probably a really good thing for basic everybody maybe for some individuals it is not in all year of their training but if if you are not a highly about they to have a very specific goal that is right in front you it is probably best to do at least twenty minutes as a minimum maybe thirty minutes of some steady state exercise once a week for basely any training goal outside of again a couple of really specific scenarios the happening ism the other thing that kind kicks in here that we have not really talked about is now or actually reaching of position where fatigue of the inner castles starts to play diaphramic fatigue stars to run in indication we forget generally breathing is a contraction to open up the lungs to change pressure the air will flow in and then the exhalation is passive right its s a muscles been stretch to got back is resting when you get to a maximum heartbeat inhalation and exhalation become active s your squeezing hard and open up in your squeezing to contract the blow air out you are going to get fatigued that system right over time you have contract to contracted open up if that system stars to get fatigue you start running into failure here you practise that and this is when all kinds of things be thing drills to just simply training in this fashion ism there is all kinds of exercise devices for your lungs and when we say that that is what worthy talking about the muscular sure around belongs needs to not fatigue that is the only other mistook component i wanted to throwing here if we are not talking about out sit about firing which in this particular case is not a probing the time domain is long and slow earth we have plenty of time to use fat as a feel we also plenty of time to use anaerobic and aerobic calls us and clear out waste products we do not really see p we being a problem with this type of exercise you may start running low on liver a get if you are going a very long time must like on may it our getting low but not really these for huge issues you are going to run in to maybe little bit to stroke volume issue but and intend he is not high enough to become a problem you are more likely to break down mostly or breathing mechanics than really anything else unless again that duration really gets generally pass two hours for most people those are the things after going to limit us how to we improve it when we train we went through the exercise choices you all soon to make sure your training you are innercostles we need be training our diagram in some fashion again it can be the exercise itself can be your normal training the thing you need to be careful of here and this is aptly true for all the things we just talked about when we think about fatigue and we think about failure of endurance we really need to pay attention to technical break down that is always the marker we look for when we when we go through ourself with our athletes and they furuncle fail are they finish that is generally because we saw a mass of technical break down you are done you are over there not always the case during all your round the train but this is something to really pay attention to if you are on not in your forty second sin and all sudden posture servants for hunching over i may stop the test i may stop the training sike no will we decided failure was as when you lost your technique to some sufficient level i you want to pay attention to that too because that is going to determine your ability to perform well as well as maintain efficiency which is a really big propeller tell me if the protocallm about to describe would be a reasonable one for people to incorporate sixty to a hundred and twenty minutes of londration work per week one way to rompish that that i often use is to heat out for a wait vested height it is not a heavy weight test may be think it is eight or ten pounds when these thinner ones and if people do not have access to that you you back pack with the items in it i mean it can be i s my wen ha external old you can dis be your body get great and and do some weighting at it it fast enough clip that breathing harder than i would be if i scan a shuffled along i might stop here there drink some water no big deal but i can carry on a conversation if i need to it is an his own to is but probably pushing a little bit harder than that for that duration yet not a lot of a deep soreness occurring after this may be a little bit of achy ness in some stabilization muscles that were used tat may not be used to much especially f have been sitting a lot during the week ism can reminds me of how much have been sitting et a but doing that all in one long afternoon ism to truly on a week and or doing to shorter sections throughout the went make forty five minute in forty five minutes and then working up the progression to longer longer duration seems that would be something that most people ism should be able to do et and that it would weave in well with any resistance training or the but in a robin and a rob out put capacity work that we talked about just a moment ago great that is a fine version to do it if you want to go shorter and bring up the intensity a little bit you want to keep it more to the thirty to sixty minute range and go and closer and to the i cannot have a conversation right now but that ism not at a blistering heartraht ism then you could probably get that something done in a smaller time window if that was a consideration if you wanted to blend all three of these together you have a lot of wiggerom right you could do something order if we are talking about this type of training you could do this first and then finish with either one of the higher intensity stuff we talked about you be roped into the same thing if could be it is own independent day could be your sort of act give recovery a tends to be fairly restorative as you alluded to a little bit there it is not that be good deal to dis on your q uncle offal if you are those if you are that type of person who even on your off to you have to do something physical this is fine right ism if you wanted to do it on a lifting day specially if it is a power of strength they it is probably fine if you wanted to do it before the work out or after it either way you are probably o cake probably best to do after if the primary gold is one of the strength ring but ofpatione if it is not if this is a prime regal do it first amazing if you wanted to do it in the combination with the other info stuff you could do it fine that you could do it before or you could do it afterwards i actually have no problem doing afterwards because that in effect especially if you say naval only during this training we will help the down regulation go and you could finish that fairly well down regulated actually it is kind of a nice way to get thoroughly warmed up go really really hard and then give it a nice twenty to thirty minute so back down and by the time you have finished maybe even on a three minute walk nice slow navel for second in hail for second in maybe five we you play with anther's little bit then maybe yo don't you need to do the down regulation eating after you will be my good spot you w didn't want a do this before do your intervals finish your intervals throw up lay on the ground sweat all over the him floor get up and go back to work that is probing on our bestiality as people are hearing this all they may be thinking while this is a lot of work to do but have been keeping track of the mat here some sure som the author are as well and we really talking about ten minutes of the of running or sprinting on the by career once a week ere tug about six minutes or of the much higher intensity but short bouts dividing do rounds of twenty twenty seconds to a minute with with rest in between and then some longer duration work out of thirty minutes minimum but may be as much as an hour even two hours which in total does not really equate to that much time especially if one can access these things right out their front door or at home and as we point out you do not need any specialized equipment to do that oh and i forgot the am a muscular endurance we that was not trying to cheat there that some muscular endurance thrown in as well that brings me to a question which is if ism doing my training for muscular endurance each week for anerobic capacity and for maximummorobic output and long duration and given that all of that and take roughly two hours for the typical person total for the entire week which i would argue is going to give you back much life only early in terms of lunchevity or likely and earning back yours of your life productivity be name offsetting all sorts of a metabolic issues and us enhancing your sleep and and improving mood and their much data much data pointing to all those positive benefits if i do all of these things and ism fairly consistent about them in my going to be metabolically flexible an my going to have a well developed fat burning carbohydrate burning system and will i be essentially fit i mean this is not leaving aside issues of strength and hypurchaforouar covered in in the previous episode will i be fit i mean to my mind a the ability to sprint very fast if one needs to the ability go longer duration if one needs to and the ability do something in between as well as you'll a hold a box overhead if necessary ism well in stalling a shell or something li don mes of the realities of life am and to me represent real functional world fitness if that is the case is there anything that we want to add to this programmer would you consider that of fairly comprehensive in complete endurance training system if we remember the target which is i want to have energy i want a look a certain way and you out arable to do that for the duration of your life for a very long life this style of training were you incorporate allow those areas of endurance gives you all the necessary adaptations one would need to excuse all of those things remember fat loss or wait management is not best done with any individual style o protocol if you do a little bit of all three the you have checked that fat loss box you do not need to go on do anything separate for it you have done all the things then to coveresthetics from that seethe equation rim you have done the things to both an handsmio century to enhance blood flow increase oxygenation and manage fatigue and waste development be energies there fatigue is that ism not going to get tired or have to quit or stop or set down doing any the activities i won at the same time if you look at the literature on mortality one of these strongest predictors of how long you are going to live is your veal to acts we've set up a senaraon which you are going to get all three of those primary gulls by doing a combination of this training you are not going to miss any plausible adaptation from endurance training and you should be set for regardless of your goal incredible and as i understand totally compatible with strength and hypertrophy training provided that your goal is to also be strong and also selectively hypertrophy or generally hypertrophy your muscles or maintain your muscles for many people that are listening to this ism guessing that they have an interest in building more endurance but not just the ability go further but the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed and to do with better form and to breathe better and to feel better before during it after for those folks maybe you could spell out a program that combines these different elements of endurance and does in a way that informs how for instance the higher intensity short duration prince would be expected to improve their longer duration work and how perhaps their longer duration work om can progress if they are careful to include i someplanks in some wallets and and things of that sort i ask this question specifically because i have to believe that while they are probably a some folks out there their looking to maximize their plank from week to week to week typically it seems that people fall into these categories of either want and get stronger and get bigger muscles to varying degrees or to get better at endurance or to get bettered everything over all right now it'd really you just focus on what you think is a nice contour of a program for the person that wants to get better at endurance but do it with more speed more stability adjust feel a strong endurance runner cycler swimmer or whatever happened to be their endurance event o get great we tisgif an example maybe you on a run your first half marathon something that i i may be done a couple times forget you have want get better at that time i would probably put somewhere the eihbrhoods sixty to seventy per cent of your in a mileage in the moderate intensity disown case you need to accumulate mileage and you need to beagle to handle what we call the tissue tolerance in this case your feet need to be able to handle thirteen miles of pounding does not matter how much high heart rate training you do or your fat deliverability none of that matters if your feet are blown up by mile eight the cate in addition we talked about how even training in that seventy to eighty five per cent heart rate down is quite effective at oxygen delivery fat utilization capitulation et camera you are going to get a lot of direct endurance benefits from that work you are also going to be working on what is honesty going to be one of your limiting factors which is the tissue tolerance in that pounding can in addition you need to be efficient with your technique and you need a lot of repetitions for motor still development you oaaspeen most your time there it is easy to recover from its not extremely a demanding in challenging also that leaves you in another thirty or forty per cent of training i would spend ten per cent of that in that twenty second burst area you can a drive of fatigue extremely high and you can really maximize your recover from a waste production a right great i would spend the remaining amount of time either on a little bit of actually maximum speed stuff that could actually be in the twenty second first if your really trying to go as fast as you can at the beginning of that exercise and then the rest of it i would spend in that other zone which is more of the five fifteen minutes but you are problem an a want o repeat those and this is when things eight under meter run rest for double the time and then repeat that two or three times you actually need that in this scenario because your gun o pul need to be able to be running for two must be piton to half marathoner may be round two hours or something that and you want a little bit of what we call repeated endurance riant be able to handle that higher for rate come back down do it again at the same time that is actually how you bump your mileage instead of having this do more of these long duration distance runs you can still get may be five or six miles dinner to day if you in to do one mile repeat or whatever number your looking at for a lot of people that is kind of how i would structure it am that is you ones is very similar to what we laid out in the previous conversation which is getting this idea that more than fifty per cent should be easily practice a little bit a work at the very top and the spectra but not too much then a little to work at the other end and you should mean o good spot a major mistake one would make here is only doing the long duration steady state stuff and this sort of saying ism get a run five mile this was week in than do six miles next week and seven at said at might work for you is i think we have enough evidence at this point both in this scientific round as well as most of the coaches i think in this space would agree with me is that is e suboptimostra tiny it could work but we can do better in terms of the structure of a program this i realize it those structures very tremendously different coach is and every basin therein programs argon to say ow you should run money through fridge with week ends off for every other day but in terms of this seventy per cent om thirty per cent divide worth seventy per cent is going toward the specific event you are doing the kind of work that you are going to do during the specific event that you are most interested in cultivating or inproveincar and the remaining thirty per cent coming from other sorts of a supporting a work how should one thing about distributing that other thirty per cent should it be all gear towards maximizing recovery for the seventy per cent or in other words ism could i do all that thirty per cent work on one day i probably was put into two days i that is the i of it is if you are thinking man coach wants me to train six days a week my seeds will tight i can pull off fortified oh cake great what i might say is two of those days are just your your temple my this what a dunno wold call us a temple training ism kind of in that space remind us wit temple training is the is in feed eighty per end effort ran reelect running at probably the same stride length and and rate that you can run your race at may be little but lower but something similar your practicing skill you are crying mile age andyu're getting a little you are getting work and for sure work but it is not absolutely fastest you can spent man's also not conversation this would be the what before we refer to as the ten minutes of of fast running what ten minutes of fast ruin it this is lower intensity got it this is a this is work accumulation got it this is practised i then one of the days a week i would probably enter in that twenty second thirty second burst for a little bit of speed there and then one of the other days as when i would do that true high intensity as hard as i can for hitting o veal to mac something that that is probably how i break up if i had four days a week if you had five you can may be add in another day readout more of that a volume accumulation practice work but that is that is a pretty to split this is the point in the episode where i say thank you ever much you provided an enormous amount of incredibly interesting clear information that is also actionable i do feel as if i far better understand endurance in its many forms and even the cellar under winnings of that and even subseller under winnings of what endurance adaptations are and how to foster those through specific protocols things that not only i can do tomorrow with it i will do tomorrow and where i hit my pain points it'll understand what is happening and the adaptation that ism triggering when my legs are burning or ism sucking prayer through my mouth or i can calmly move along just through naval breathing i will now know what is happy sing in my body and the specific adaptations that ism triggering then you also highly something that is widely important and i never heard it phrased as clearly as you did to day which is that it really does not matter how one seeks out to achieve that loss provided certain criteria met even while certain forms of exercise happen to fat stores more than others and you beautifully illustrated the relationship between energilization and breathing and the fact that we literally exhale fat to some extent course once again thank you thank you and thank you i know ism not alone in on recognizing this information as incredibly interesting and actionable and indeed i do plan to put it into actions i hope i many of our illustners will as well yet again the pleasure is actually all mine and a i actually really appreciate the fact that you let me go far in a metabolism i pigsty is in human by on organics any time i can go many hours in a metabolism i get very excited and i do not typically get that leash i in this sargasso appreciate that i know you understand your organs will love that hopefully oh the they will love it and i think that they will especially love it because they understand that if one can rapper head round even just as small fraction of the mechanisms that underlie given photo can it gives both termed is depth and meaning to that protocol and makes it much more flexible for people that can really think about what is happening as their engaging an given protocol and know exactly what they can expect in terms of results great we have been on a bit of a journey here wee covered a lot ground with speed development and strength and i pertly and now we walk through an probably several hours here of of endurance what i would love to do next is to just give you and mort straightforward not as much background not as much metabolism none of the mechanisms right into protocols for someone who says look i want to hit those marks you keep talking about i wan look good on a feel good i want to do that across my life seen how would i build all these things into a protocol that actually covers may be the entire year and how would i would be able to repeat that year after year i almost have this ever green sustainable year long pearitization structure that covers all the know i need to if i want everything we have talked about in these nine adaptations in this short series how would love to do that our next conversation if your learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our you to channel that is a terrific zero

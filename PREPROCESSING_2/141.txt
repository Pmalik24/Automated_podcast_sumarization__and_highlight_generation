because boy have i got an election for you because that is essential with this election is now going tore as sunconme election about the issues it may not even be an election about the economy if jobidon is not eedhenominy if he survives to actually be the nominee linen now he is not looking great and if don't trump on the other side is the hominy its just going o be democrats accusing republicans of being lawbreakers an republicans causing democrats o being lawbreakers because here is the deal jobidon's squeaky clean ism above board image whatever image existed for those who aren't watching closely o last thirty years of robin's political career that image is now crumbling and that is a massive problem for him as i said yesterday whatever mud you throw dona trump has no fact the man is made of mud when you throw mud at jobidon it has ha significant of fact on his poll numbers and his worst nightmare is now coming true because all of the hunter bison stuff is now breaking wide out into the open to understand exactly what is happening here you have to begin with jobidon's claims for the past several years here is montage of jordan explaining his relationship two hunter bison's business is him sang over and over and over and over again that they never talked about businesses he never knew about businesses he knew nothing nothing he know nothing here here is jobidon explaining this for years on end an you ever spoken tor son about a omer vein info if fairing have never spoken my one meets inn what is your understanding of what your son was doing porn extraordinary about i do not know what he was doing i know who was on the board i found out who as on the board after his on board and that was it and there is nobody a lot of time is not there

this is lies in fact when con fronted about hunter bison's business activities jobidentes get very very angry and that by the way is what they call the tell when join gets very very angry when gets very in a huff about a thing it is likely because he did the thing yours peter dicey asking began question and bid in being a querulous old man i grip o i a o i er i e investing m indign ere ani proof wish be asking e in we he on on or the force ring cumidater force a van r haven after we er a in sh i inn a to in i i in a o i a to and i using so power and every almoner the orpresetin i to try o the ton e er smear me i everybody look a and everybody's look add tremors open there a e i quiet ye and this unit of fat has in whenever jobidon gets false angry that than he have whites himself up in to actual rage it is because he probably did the things well even archer who was hunter bidet's business partner for a significant period of time when tens of millions of dollars removing through various different accounts associated with hunter bid he testified in front o congress yesterday and names homer who is the chairman of the house committee on oversight accountability put together a statement following a four our transcribed interview with thecommittee and here is what he says quod even archer's testimony today confirms hoiden like to the america people when he said he had no knowledge about has sons business dealingston was not involved jobidon was the brand his son sold around the world to enrich the baton family when jobidon was vice president of the united states he joined hunter widen for dinner with his for business associates in person or by speakerphone over twenty times when berm's owner was facing pressure from the crank in prosecutor investigating the company for corruption archer testified that seriema executives asked hunter to call d c after a seriema board meeting in jury by the way that masher's very closely with the whistle blower account to the f bi the the confidential human source accounts to the f bi that suggested that the head of seriema had said that he had paid money to job and hunter in order to get victor spoke in the prosecution new train fired said he would stope looking into seriema now by the way it could be that the head of seriema said that because hunter had told him that and that hunter did actually achieved that but it does not matter because the bottom line is that job was deeply involved at least to the extent that he knew what was going on with pretty much all of this comers as why do jobidon like to theamerican people about his family's business dealings and his involvement begs the question what else he is hiding from the america people the house committee on overset an accountability will continue to follow the brain's money trail and interview witness is to determined whether fora actors targeted the bisons present bide is compromised and corrupt in our national security is threatened here are the my always one even archer testified that the value of adding hunter biding to brims board was the brand and confirmed that then vice president hoiden was the brand net by the way hunter is openly said this hunter was asked why we getting paid tons of money to be an berizma's worrisics my last name is widen archer ad fitted that seriema would have gone out of business if the brand had not been attached to it he believe that enter bison being on the board and the bison brand contributed to berizma's launch activity he bewouldhav be intimidated to mast with seriema legally because the baton brand he testified in remember of twenty fifteen my collins lachevsky owner of brim and a deem porcharsky and executive seriema place constant fresher on hunter widen to help to get help from d c regarding you cranial prosper victor showing choking was in investigating berrysmat for corruption hunter alone with s love cheeky an pocharsky called d c to discuss the matter bison's lochewsky and parky stepped away to make the call this raise the concerns that hunter was in violation of the foreign actions registration a limit clearly he was it is be sealed out this the guy was working on a foreign bored on america policy to benefit a foreign company i me there is hes textbook far violations even archer testified that hunter don put then vice present en jobidon on the speakerphone during business meetings over twenty times apparently archer testified the join was put on the phone to all the brand thosephone calls in eluded a dinner in parts with the french energy company and in china with jonathan lee the c o b char archer a knowledge then is present an bison had calf with jonathan lee c o b char in aching then is resin an bidnyevn wrote a letter of recommendation for college for lee's

kafir malady in washington to s aline bacteria russia oligarch was the widow of the form mayor of mascot attended tho dinner notably the bide administrations public sanctions lest for russia oligarchs does not contain battering and there is more there as weight to in just one at moment all this is very bad new for join because you head the clips of him a knew nothing bout the business has it was not involved the business says whatever hunter was doing as well hunter he was on the phone he was on the phone for all of this sort of stuff and of course jo openly bragged bout getting victor scholar fired which just happen o urge with exactly what his son was lobby in for his son wanted victor shoran fired and then bid brag about getting victor shoran fire now he is making the cars that everybody wanted victor shoran fired to choking was corrupt it welcome to you crane i mean seriously to every one in you crane his corrupt when comes to the government emery's known this for decades but only choking was worthy of jobidon calling of and threatening to withdraw billion dollars in aid from e crane unless they pulled victor showing here was bin bragging about it i reneergon over can

hours at e asap wear six hours in the prosecutes not fire in get the money o son om of all a fire a it prudent place someone who was sole i get by the way it f you do not think that jobidon is the kind of pathological lie who would have the gall to tell a story about how he was rooting out corruption while being corrupt mama latching jobidon for thirty five years cajobidon is exactly that kind of person the is a my who shamelessly lied about every element of his career for the first fifteen years of his career much get to drop out of the presidential rays for being a platerist and for lying about is college record and for lying about everything else cordon is the kind of person who lies about the circumstances of his former pikestaff in a car crash by by openly lawn about the other person involved in the car crash sun getting for years that the got was driving drunk and essentially ruining his life toxin is a very bad person ka jobidon is not in above board honest fellow and if

estate company with ties to first on hunter n receive more than one hundred million dollars from a russia billionaire for property investment to cross the united states taking back and decade they have to cashinjections into rose to realty came from wait for it plan bat serena one of rush's wealthiest women the widow of the former mayor of mascot in close ally of moscocktirent ladies gotten according to sources one just happens to be being with everybody who could possibly help out o son heard how that works super duper weird the white house is now responding to all of these allegations and he saying a there is nothing here an nothing is so notice how the got posts they they started off moving another ais mollyhammin way the females points out they have now ben kicked into the ocean man there the in the middle of deep sea right now an the next to that sunken titanic a according to the white house quote it appears the house re publicans own much type witness to day testified he had never heard of pressing an by n discussing business with his son are his sons associates or doing anything wrong or doing anything wrong o key i'llexplain to saying why this is ridiculous house republicans keep promising bombshell evidence to support the ridiculous attacks against the president but time after time that keep failing to produce any in fact even their own witnesses appear to be debunking their allegations instead of continuing to waste time in resources on this evidence free wild goose chase house re publican should drop these units and work with the presidents on the issues that actually impact of case here is the reason this is insanely stupid the claim of the white house is that because haven archer testified that jobidins did not openly discuss every aspect of business with the people that hunter would get job on the phone with that means that job was not involved in thebusiness that is the stupidest thing have ever heard in my life if your influence paddling the entire operation is based on plausible deny ability it can openly influence fettle in it job on the phoneishas million what is ha time get victor shokgiv kinnigamise on light no in i hundreds of thousands dollars and o an of piers you think he is going to say that or is the conversation going to got something that hunter walks in the room say want eighty three grand man and it'll get daddy on fun no i got my dad were conversations we will not do it over the funks where not totally stupid he will do i we attack on what is hat is more on but we will not do it what we will not doing ya what wat well have come and what you need to get on you will gets on and as proof that me am i dad er tight let me get i on the phone right now click here is the phone job is o i how is the weather over there in in in you can that is how the stuff works obviously believe of not these slim u read that democrats are relying upon here to protect to jobidon is the idea t when job bison gets on the phone during business meetings with hunter is that job actually just likes discussing weather with people rapidly the that actually what this is that job rapidly a louse hunter to call him with just random on the be another the you talk about the weather just happens all the time and sure it me he doesn't was russia oligarchs who give a hundred million dollars to different firms with which hunter bid associate sure he does wit verismo and sure does it with wide varieties o foreign companies including chines companies and sure he writes letters for the had of those companies kids seen do cot he does not all of those things mes all of that just because do likes talking about the weather now i know much you talking about the weather it'll telly this i do not radically call people or tick calls from people to talk about the weather it is not a thing i do if if somebody calls me on a business phone call and his talking bout that they are not talking about the weather obviously the whole point is i can get my daddy the vice present of the united states on the phone at any moment dad is that you ah hunters me m rathe click see and him mi down on the pone at any time we will solve the problem for you that is how the come and then magically it turns out that some of the promise actually get solved victor showing the god goes away and then jobidin brags bout how he is an anti corruption fighter well his son is bagging hundreds of thousands up dollars promising that that is exactly not you happen is that just a giant coincidence by the way that is really what we are being asked to believe that is all coincides where as to believe that hunter went on the board of seriema promising access to jobidon and promising that the biding last name would she seriema and the he promise everybody apperizma that you would work ism getting scholar fired and that just coincidentally his daddy got chosen fired that is were no relation chines waves operation nobody knows who is talking to whom ism me sure that phone calls inner but but no ne no that is that is wore being ask to believe and demo cats are saying the if you ask questions about this that is because you are the problem you are pouncing you are cup actually there is nothing to see here there is absorb nothing to see here now a for five won years of stupid jabber from democrats bat how there is a smoking gun that theythat gladder gotten and dona trumpery working together and thy were rigging the election in behalf of tong from he using textbook because donate true really needed ladder potent in pit on face that there is all corrupt and the smoking on was around the corner and turn out all that was wise a tor five year's that we are being told bi the ye satin exact people there is nothing to see here no one believes this no one believes this and it is impossible to look at the just position of hunters business activities and now what hunter's bus again this is not the first hunter biding business apartment to say this tony bobylinsky to the exacting thing tony bobylinsky said years ago that join was stopping by business meetings and hang in all with people he said this again hunter tacit his own water saying he pays dads bills i do not no what you need others than an actual bank account wire showing money moving from hunts or two job heres thing he is long have to do that because i n works with your parents if i got to dnnerwith my parents i just pay for dinner out war money my parents bank account to pay for dinner if hunter wants to pay jobs expenses ho to pay jobs expenses we the money does not actually have to that is the beauty of being a member of a family the we family corruption is common by the way thee to more of this in just one second because what your

promacod ben to get started o cay again whatyour be asked to believe its the domes crap imaginable and naturally democrats are trotting out when people talk about the double standard here it is really quite insane remember dona trump was impeached the first time is he schemes is impeach the first time by the house over a phone call with the president of you crane of loafers lens telling him that he might withhold military aid if they did not dig up dirt on hunter bison meanwhile the accusation here which appears to be fairly well founded is that job bison openly threatened you crane that you withdraw one billion dollars in aid unless they fire a prosecutor who just happen to be looking into the into his son's company that is the it is amazing and the same people who prosecuted impeachment one against tromp those exaccient people are now rushing two jobidon's defense which just shows you the politics it is a game of mum it is a game of pirisonship purely and simply it is either wrong in bookcases parents wrong an neither case but is really amazing stuff to represent of can dolman again he is one the impeachment prosecutors watch watch out are these goalposts moves he is now says it is a preposterous premise you say that job should not be talking with hunters business associates why is that preposterous you's the vice president of the united state should not he be above board and clean as the drives know ait the is thin tat e never talk at about is tots thorny talk of bother we ever b he ta eye tat is never others cocker i i i do not know what his comment is and if we are on it why do not i do not think that is what he said he never said that he has never spoken to anyone he said that he had nothing to we it with hunter bison's business dealings if he says hello to some one on that he sees his son with what is he supposed to say hi son o no nocking ta say hello to the other people at the table or the other people on the phone it is kind of a preposterous premise to think that a father should not say hello to people that the son are at dinner with the son is at dinner with and that is literally all the evidences no that is not all the evidence is the evidence is that hunter call adding on phone twenty times with different business pardners the evidence is that job wrote letters recommendation for people with whom hunter bide was in business the evidence is that job stopped by dinners an sat down and talked to people that is what influence peddling is they are asking you to be a more on there they believe your stupid that is all it is were it is very obvious they believe that ting just gas you into thing nothing untoward happened here when every indicators that something on toward happened here wet tumor on this in just one second first hiring

prosecutors he says to preposterous premise you say that yo should not be talk with hunter's business associates the afterjoe has spent years saying he knew nothing about the business is that he never literally nothing they he not not her anything they keep moving the oppose and then dangolman emphasizes that sure hunter put john speakerphone but they were just talking about the weather an asking you to be such a more on here they we just stigma he is easy real sweaty here because it turns out that this not defense they are just talking about the weather it is impossible to describe what a weak defense this is if you were prosecuting let say a relocate against the off ya and a low level hit man told you i talk routinely with the head of the off ya it'll get him on the phone and i would use him as lad i walk into a bar into a bar and i would i would take to the bar tender i need you to give it give me tan gran roman o shut down you a you do not believe that am connected guy listen to this picks up the phone calls them ambos moblaskoes is it soothe outsider as the raining outside they are talking about the weather is that a conversation about the weather or s that not a conversation that is not a conversation about the weather that is showing that the influence peddling is in operation that is the entire purpose but here is can dolman o well probably the ore just walking about the weather probably didn't really just wanted to know how the weather was over in reeve scan permed thing that the speaker on conversations they do not thin concerning o you because there is not the its about business they just see like e rest clear that it was clear ta that it was part of the daily conversations that hunter by then had with his father am and i was and and sounds most of the time a now present by them dudeen no tho the people he was at dinner he was just asked to say hallo and he would talk about the wat the way you described it several times they asked over and over and over he described but the weather was how i how what is going on on gourmand he it the witness was very very consistent that none of those conversations ever had to do with any business dealings or transactions of course they did not because the minute you say the business you're now in clear violation of federal waw of course a again let them you less you this you parents it you been to business dinner correct your parent some times call you during the business dinner this happens to me all the done ism very close to my parents sometimes they call me on the phone sometimes i do not pick up because ism in themidle of he business dinner and sometimes if i feel a urgent i do pick up and you know what i do i see excuse me folks and i get up and i go outside to talk to my parents because it is not relevant to the rest of the con vernation that my dads on the phone he like to is the stupidest fence have ever heard the defenses that do you do that your your parent calls you to business angelic him you my dads on the phone i pun you on speaker you's wants to say halo and talk about the wether had tat hows the dog doing do you do that have you ever done that why would you do such a thing lama said under what circumstances would you do this thing there is only one reason because you want everybody at the table to know about the relationship that you have with your dad because it is relevant in some way to e generalized conversation that is happening at the table it is an influence paddling operation clearly openly everyone knows it hey be nownisince toningaboutlinsky he's knownicsons foster about e laptop and now there studiously trying to avoid the consequences of this democrats have now moved to the next step of the defense because this is not going to last the next step of the fences there is no proof that hunter ever did anything the benefited job there is no proof and not only that we was you shows sup looking probably we should not look at any of the here's we wouldn't look at any of the bank account records we should not tried up peersoning corporate bales we shouldn't try to figure out exactly how the money moved we shouldn't even look at who paid job's expenses because job has reported way more wealth than his income would actually suggest at there is at the is several million explain dollars into bison's wealth then no one knows where came from and it is kind of weird here is democrats now claiming we do not need to know we soft need know it is all it is probably fine uses it is probably above board and totally find here were are democrats saying there is no evidence job ever benefited for any of this he not hen ut it was all clinking he never ben if by the way it is in fact a benefit when your children benefit from this i just just a point this out job would not have to directly benefit in order for this to be bribery if there have somebody said to job hunter is getting paid a lot of money he is gain made a lot of money in order to a sieve acts can you help acts happen and your public official he does not need to see money hit his own bank account to benefit him as a parent i care very much about my children i soon that job cares very much about hunter and who pays hunter's bills for his crack presumably that money was either coming from job or for some one else in the family or crimsons some outside oligarch an we k o for a fact that business associates of job an paying hunters businessbils his legal bills then being his crap paintings his garbage pain things they mut angle half a million dolled it is perfectly in line for jo bison to have outside force is paying his son and his son benefiting from that and that acting as a formal bribery if you are entire family benefits from the bribery and you are over here living your life but you are the one who's actually brokering the thing yah that still bribery locate does notnectualake to hit his bank account but that can o be the next offense will you can actually so a formal dollar being moved from this chines of s for into jobidon's personal bank account his the next line they are going to use far they have been not able to prove any adenine here a on doing house go pe members continue to trying link hunter's business dealings to the president though they have yet to produce an y con create evident how is porn to c ben y be e public's bell the the is e ti e are hunter by piss telic a the president himself t yet to by t an hard evidence the the present himself as ton e tin all owe of of evens i farther the go to me facts e teen us a i the to have the evidence or loran republicans an not tide the priseten o jo bean two profiteering from them the did not have he evidence had where is the evidence there is no evidence a any wrong dealing by president there is to a i zero evident hero evidence en to by t present is ta new you what is song was doing of get first all lot of evidence that he knew exactly what his son was doing literally we have a what is that message from hunter bison to a for oligarch in china saying my daddy is sitting next to me right at this moment according hangman probably they re are sitting there talk about the weather or something probably but by the way it is worth noting yuan animal to thousand twenty two jo bison agreed to pay son hunters legalese for his deal with the chines government controlled company e mills reveal the revelation ties the presidents even closer to hunters oversees business dealing and makes his previous clans you never discuss them with this son even less plausible job was able to pay those bills after earning millions of buck through his an his wife's companies after he left office as v p some o the way of cash came from their bookdeals an speaking engagements but the presidents financial filings reveal he declared almost seven million more dollars on his tact returns then he did on his government transparency reports some tat difference can be accounted for with salaries earned by the first lady jobidon and others some not required on his reports but that leaves five point to million dollars earned by jobs company not listed on his transparency y reports those are missing millions where did those come from first of all yourn't actually need to prove ho the money hit jobidon's bank account all you to proves that money hit hunter bison's bankacants that benefits jo quite obviously but where them money come from the owning care who is the media can a continued run interference apparently hearing a start by running interference you the been doing it the whole time there would see an and yesterday saying you know guys really ism not try this to bedel they ever talk business they were just talking about the weather that this is litter it is it is legitimately one the worst excuses for corruption have ever heard they were talking about the weather is this ones up there with killer listen saying why ked with a cloth yes they were talking about the weather because i routinely get my father on the phone during my business dealings to discuss the weather for no reason the gamins are it explaining that archer qualified an teethe top s the discussion on these for calls his niceties that boding an to tan even know who as i in on the other line with his son hunter and you a sorts in the room telling then an now that archer did not point the finger directly at any sort of the connection between jo bid and and his sones for hin business dealing to rather stay said that he was that yo harder not hm is telling the illusion of that access course really a stunning fellowmen back when you consider that republicans were willingness as as they break through that would link honterhis business dealings with his father instead business was apparently never discussed according to heaven archer see the somehow is the nothing happened they were just talking about the weather this is insane this is insane he was selling the illusion of access the illusion how is he what was the illusion the illusions that he had access to the president and to t the vice president and hoe was selling that illusion by having access to the vice president that is not an illusion that is called access if i say i here i teylhywhere have access to multiple senators have access to them let me call up ha senator right now and et him on the phone and ten i call the enter angel them on the phone that is not an illusion of access that's access illusion of access he calls his friend who his pretending to be hoiden and then his friend of son there o team then he hangs up that is the illusion of access actual access is when he is your father and you called him on the phones vice president of the united states and he is squiring you around on ariphore suits pick up bags of cash china and also is in charge of you cranial policy overseeing the prosecutor who is prosecuting your sons company that is not the illusion of access that is access clearly this is insane and and the media while clearly the bombshell blew up clearly son eyes can happy tokasovsin pretend that nothing is happening here something is happening here and here is the reason the this because jobidon he is really turning up the ism trestle old family man he is turn that crap up to eleven he is really turning that self up because the way that he is in the ongoing to defend all this here is can be the final defense the final fences is going to be yes of course i was allowing my son to sell access to me of course i knew about it of would you expect me not to he was a crack at it and i love my son and how to make sure that he is taking care of that is just what a nice family the my corruption was mandated by the fact that i love my family and jo bi an is really turning the stuff upright this is why he is now knowledge in grand children he never acknowledged until five seconds ago this is why he is doing interviews talking about what wonderful family man has he did not interview yesterday talking about his family life and mans is he look old and men he this is this is full the plenitude severe music for to five no up sir talking every day tour con every day he takes om while i does not extra call navy honor human but he acknowledge them over the week on a first i wonder why he would do that why would you do that did maybe he do that because otherwise it looks really cynical she turns out i looks really cynical if say ism a big family man i love all of my kids in my gran its except for that one that one

before go to daily wire dot come slash subscribe to become a number to day o can meanwhile hay all this makes jobidon very very very unable why not because it means that he is open to attack for re publicans that he certainly is but because the only way that jobidon winds is again with high voter turn out mobile and benefited from unprecedented voter turn out in twenty twenty the jump in voting numbers between twenty twenty and twenty sixteen is massive the total number of votes in twenty sixteen was something a hundred and twenty seven million voters a hundred and twenty right million voters hay the the total number in twenty twenty was something more a hundred and fifty five million voters which is a massive jump a hundred and twenty nine to a hundred and fifty five you are talking about the biggest jump in voter turn out in modern america history and the reason for that is because democrat's blue out the early voting at the changed all the rules sate remained in their ballast and meanwhile demo trumplwas out there telling his bakes not to do early voting for some odd reason that no one can quite comprehend but that massive bump in voter turn out is what boosted jobidon because of course don't trump one more votes than he one in twenty sixteen in twenty twenty but this huge expansion of the voter bass men the jobidon one well what is that mean means that join needs to replicate high voter turn out if he gets low voter turn out in twenty twenty four he is extremely vulnerable anthesis what the washington post is pointing out to day democrats are currently worried that black voters are not going to turn out on mass for jobidon they turned out on mass in twenty twenty in large part because the democrat's decided to make black lives matter the center piece of the campaign they decided that the black lives matter verge flood hubbub was going to b the the central pitch that they made equity in all things coming arris as vice present an we will put on the sort a black female justice and all of the sort of stuff and now turns out the one is corrupt old white politician and all the other cut told white politicians it is quite possible now that a lotic young black voters are just not con t turn up he are not barakabama you do not of the warm it is the same sort of thing with thriller canton black voters deign black voters were the margin of victory four berakamama in two thousand twelve there we the margin of loss for hilliriclint in twenty sixteen there breathe margin victory for jobidon in twenty twenty what is can happening them in twenty twenty four it is not about wether republicans win fifteen per son of black voter something the real question is how many black people are going to vote in swing states because they vote this proportionately democratic high voter turn out this hawbrakabamaan oho into thousand twelve for example e according to the washington post democrines are really worried about this they're worried about a potential drop next year in turn out among black voters the party's most loyal constituency there can turn stems from a ten percentage point to line in black voter turn out in masters mid terms compared with twentyeighteen a bigger drop than among almost any other racial a atone group according to a washington post analysis of the senses bureaus turn out survey s such warning signals were initially paper o over by other democrat successes in twenty twenty two because they picked up a seat in pennsylvania and warlock one reelection in georgia butt in key states georgia turn out in masters midterms was much lower among younger and mail black voters according to internal party analysis the drop and black turn out has become a focus for democratic leaders as the party re science to next years presidential contest n an't remember in gorge of the same year that radio warlock one his replace effort bran key one the lection running away in georgia those not clos election again stay arums it is quite possible that dona trump is able to benefit from lo voter turn out in places lake georgia bison's a lection in twenty twenty as the washington post points out hinged on narrow victories and states georgia wissconcin michigan and pennsylvania that former present in true one in twenty sixteen tdemocratackvis are cautioning the party cannot afford to let support from black voters slip well i mean that is that is correct and the should be world because hoiden is not exactly in attractive candidates two young people of any sort let alone young black voters who may not be all that interested n corrupt old white man who whose son was clearing a but load money avoiding jail while committing obvious crimes i get that that wisdom me a problem on my i robin's image is not with the media thin joined images man there is a photo that emerged from gabion in delftware your humor beach delftware a violating theprescriptions for avoiding skin cancer in rub of beach delftware and the media tried to play this is a big w for join ism just wondering how for those who can see the photo this is jobidon shirtless in a bathing suit staring out at somebody with a camera wearing sun class says in a backwards baseball cap it is not a good look it is nothing t a you want to see is this going to draw in the young voters by the bushel over here this thing this it wok e tee over here no the answer is rowan again yo physical attractiveness of candidates does it mater what did not for brakobama a you will recall the backing two thousand eight there is a famous photo o brokaba emerging shirt less from the ocean an the media going gaga over all of that doe that matter ye man that sort that sort of kind does matter which is wyjobidon being ate to credit elderly person who obviously involved in corruption schemes with hi son is not exactly a under turn out jogger i mean sin punching to jog or in crease voter turn out for democrats which is wither freaking out at this point you know knows this is dona trump it is also the reason mi dona trump is is at this point the most likely candidate to be the republican nominee the reason is because the man it the battering ram and republicans are thinking aboutuobide n the something without about killer which is is dona trump can to throw the kitchen sin o jobiton cause he has no limits it that the fun of watching dona trump primate off the top rope against jobidon again but this time actually directed against robin's corruption and directed in a more meticulous way perhaps is quite real is what the poles are trunk right now dona trump understands it again the man hasn't invade understanding of the id of the republican party and he here was yesterday going after jobitonso in twenty sixteen very famously branded killer canton as crooked hilleryeim who is worse hoiden killer canton well i took the name of crook it we got a beautiful killer now because he that one's over with and the word crooked was every broke i think was a very good word for by no his crooked he is a crooked you must corrupt president we have ever had and he is also the worst president we have ever had you looked what happened at afcanistin you look at what happened with inflation look at the economy look what is going on now he is the worst president we have ever had if dona trump could stick to this message whaler publicans believe this could be o winning message and again there's an element of fun to trump at does not exist for the other candies right now what the poles show is that dona trump is in a historically struck position to returns to the white house according to mean ens harry into he broke down the number is according to mediate behind the curing state of plate in the people presidential primary he said quote trump is not only in historically strung position from non in comet to win the republican nomination he is in a better position when the general than at any point during the twenty twenty cycle and an almost any going during the twenty sixteen cycle he says known an trumps current pulling position n the modern era has lost end open presidential primary that did not future n n current he is liny more than fifty per cents in the national primary poles more than all his competitors combined three prior candidates an open primarysal pulling in more than half the voting primary e tor rest in the second half of the calender year before election algor an bush into thousand and hell canton in twenty sixteen wanton also notes that trump is in pretty good shape in a general is as trump was up on bine by one point in the quenipiac pole a resolithin the martian of arab an nevertheless a remarkable achievement for the former president he says one trine warning sign for democrats was that pole because that pole is from pennsylvania the tun national pots and pennsylvania a looter turn out could actually stop jobidon from beating dona trump well republican voters art obviously trending toward dona trump at this point its in your times senna college pelican night yesterday and it shows that if the only two choices in the primary were trump or to mantis right now trump would wind sixty two to thirty one and you can see the break down here is henna fascinating when ask to is a strong leader that this by the way demonstrates that politics is now the art of the of affect it is performance art it is not natural policy beaus when it comes to policy there is no question the do mantis is a much stronger leader tan trump just in terms of what he is been able to get done in the state of florid firs what trump was able to get donnationally trump was hampered by his own executive branch clearly in a variety of ways ranging from the roots to touchy to the investigations into him by his own executive branch his own policies were forwarded every turn and we know all this right this gruff that trump himself complains about an drums of whoop a strong leader none the less sixty nine per cent of republicans say that trump is a strong leader firsts twenty two per cent of republicans too mantis is a stronger leader when it comes to who is more moral thirty six per cent say trump forty six per cents a to mantis people understand that decants is a significantly more moral person than trump is on a any civic basic level but then don't care fascinatingly enough when as to is more likeable forty five per cents of republican voters actually say to mantis compare to forty three per cent of republican voters who sate trump is not that they thing to trump is likeable it is not that they thing the trump is moral is that the thing trump is strong they think that trump is able to be trodden fifty eight to thirty i to to twenty eight they believe that done trump is better to beat jobidon which is ten fascinating when it comes to getting things done which clearly the answers to santoscy long for things on in flora than trump is got done nasally but doesn't attics about affect trump is winning sixty seven to twenty two in that same pole when as to is more fun an this a big one when as to is more fun fifty three per cent of republican say that dona trump is more fun only sixteen per cents say to mantis again a lot of this is affect a lot of this is the imagining of a twenty twenty four race in which frontal trump is throwing the kitchen sink at cordon and that is likely what we are going to secure dow trump knows this which is why he probably is not going to a participate in the debates at this point because why what he is thirty points up in the poles right now now again it is an open primary now it seems to me that he should debate because in an open primary it behaves republicans to be able to decide between candidates but trump put out on truth social last night let them debates can see who i might consider for vice president and it is it is it is sort of hard to see at this point how trump is is clawed down because this is really not about any of the other republican candidates being able to over trump trump trumpican have to fall in the poles nor if any of the other republicans to win what exactly could bring trump down in the poles certainly not policy there are other republicans fare attack i on policy onto mantis yesterday for example when after him about anchovy touchy he is right but does not matter there are the republicans cries cries you been going after trump is not affecting his numbers at all basically the only thing that could theoretically take trump down at this point is an outside indictment which is why try which by the way benefits trump beaks at that means that every time there is an indictment that comes down there is publican be another one this week he can say with possibility literally the only thing that can stop me at this point is democrats indicting me now i said before two things can be to at once he may be guilty facially of crimes miss handling of last i documents it can also be true that democrats have a very strong interest in inviting him to stop him trump beating in jobidon right that is a plausible argument i got one of things that i pointed out about rondissansis candy an again i think the sans is better candidate than trump i think that de cantus is a stronger governor than trumps a president i think he would are a better president than true have up in shy about any of this but the big problem for rondosantas is that trump sucks all of the air out of the room and not only that jobidon is running really really poorly at this point if join er running at forty nine forty one against trump then there would be case for to mantas but it is very hard fore publicans to make that case in favor of the mantas when there basically running even against mobile me as bisons just such an unbelievably we candidate speaking of these indictments dona trump come want yesterday and he suggested that done he is going to be indicted soon he e said on truth social i some an indictment from deranged blacksmith and his highly person gang of thugs pertaining to my peacefully in patriotically speech will be coming out any day now as yet another attempt to cover up all this bad news about bribe's plus an extortion coming from the biding camp this seems to be the way that they do it and now aslant is bracing for possible indictments according to the washington post for more than two years people here and across the country have washed and waited for clues that high profile georgia investigation into the the former present an trump an his allies broke the law in their attempts to overturn his twenty twenty lection lost in the take was winding to an end that speculation hidfever kitchen recent days with the instillation of orange security barriers near the man entrance of the futon county court house in down town at manta simultaneous with them setting up all that security was an appeal by dona trump to the court to basically rule out fallen county district turning fanny wills is investigation i judge full county superior court judge robot mac burned river saw that special granter investigation in this particular case basically slap downs on frumps legal efforts to stop all whatsits very likely the that case is going to go forward in the near future meanwhile madam shift continues to be out there treated as a credible source after lying for years about the russia trump stuff he says there could still be more charges against trumpet canary sex you prosecuted case as do you expect that they will come out if an anditemen before that or did they need that an order to make this true get case i et were all a bit blind here be costly haven't seen the body o at it once that the special council has but i would imagine at if the target letter what out if the having thusly in a postman a conversations that is mitis ready to indite i and he may just want a dot of in crosstie by bringing care a gan they may not expect to get a lot of toy oil information but he wants torture at least he knows if the other side called circa what would have to say i do not think it is necessary that i the infestation would was an till then i an as we son florid if the special council gets new information there can always be a superseding indie on these chancery six chargers ay again democrat's organ a after trumpeting an all that benefits trumpet pimerselp what's them in for the other candle's well as have said before there not can win this this race against trump by actually going up directly an trumpet is not possible he has too much strength inside their publican party which means they need to orient at the media ism a encouraging ronastansto can mane again he is the only viable competitors trumpet this point by the polling data there is no third place in this race right now if you got n york times liana collegepol the the same one the shows trump up by weeps and bounds over the rest the field it is got to sands it seventeen and everybody else at less than three percent really is to gangster boss for anybody who wants to mantis to overcome anybody t to be the not trump candidate which means there needs to be a consolidation the feel that is only going to happen if the mantis stepped into unfriendly territory the decants campaign is rolling out a bunch of proposals that roll down in economic policy speech did a lot a policy is beth on you no does not care about policy any one i hate to break it to every one in political sphere but here is the reality you care about policy i car abut policy the vast majority of voters do not care about policy they care out personality which is why dona trump began president of the united states sell s by the we we broccoboma became president of the united states without any sort of political experience in actually promoting policy before the gan president what is that mean it means that mantis is going to have to step into unfriendly territory and his con have to throw if you punches that is the only way he on to regain any sort of momentum in the race at this point o a time for a couple a thing i and then some things that i hate things i today yah i told you last week that i saw openheimer rest nrowlittoreview it because i had a forty three minute re view of baby which became the most viral thing on the internet for o a fret i an ta and here is my actual review of openheimer it is a brilliant film because christopher solan is just amazing chrisphernolen is the best living director there is not a question about this and tom how you turn a three our kopek about a a newcomer physicist into a block buster move that involves essentially one big explosion is kind of a master class you really is must ton a film making level the thing is beautiful toe watch the first hour is compelling it is it is the best sort of byopicabout science ever bi by a pretty long margin here the performances are universally fantastic there the tons of cameos by people here can recognize aside from killing murphy turns in a great performance obviously madman is terrific in this film it is a really really really good move what is fascinating bout from a sort of historical point of view is the way that the move it is done the move is is essentially two tracts what no one calls fission and fusion the the fission side is is performed by sober downy junior sober downy junior is om is playing the guy who is the head of the princeling physic's program who originally got openheimer to come over there and ti and who is essentially up for a position as as the head of the department of commerce under white is an our one point actually he was offered to be this real life story he was actually offer to be chief of staff for d white can hour louis stress louis stress new openheimer the move sort of implies that he was jealous of of openheimer and that is the reason why he was implacably opposed to openheimer the basic thrust of the openheimer story in thisitrun real life is that o bendier was a communist fellow traveller in the nineteen thirties there some good evidence that he was actively being used by the soviets in the early nineteen forty seven during the manhattan project inert for facilitate trains for of information there is a fairly famous letter from a soviet agents in the united states to loment feria who is the head of the k g b was not all the cage bet time of the c b om anta about abenheimer implying the opanheimer was in fact being used to funnel information to the soviet union or least hooking people up there is a lot of controversy about his movie ties the man was deeply imbedded with tons of communists all around him there were a bunch of people who actually were active soviets lies were present outlaw limos during this period basically the story of open heimerchast on a historical level is that he was granted a security clearenson or t help produce the boy there were serious security promise with him leading up to that n neverody was worried about it but they really had no choice because all the best nuclear scientists we are all in bad with communists including by the way albeninsteine albanhinstein quite famously was kind of a fan of linen he literally said about leninquot i honor linen as a man who completely sacrificed himself and devoted all his energy to the realization of social justice i do not considers methods practical that one thing is certain benefit pipet by the guardians and restorers of humanity and that that is what alien hinstein had to say about claimer linen summing a lot f these people were communist fellow travellers one reason for that is because most of rope at this plant was divided between sort of famous and communes a this dacoit happened in prewar germany is that there there is a divine between the communists in germany and the fasshusts in germany and the right coded wit the fashion or stop the communustray that is the story of the early nineteen thirties in late nineteen twenties in in germany and obviously the noises and up rising to power a lot o people oppose the notes then fall into the communist capbicaus the communists very often out would promise for of equality of man an brotherhood for a lot of jewfish expat tries who had been victimized on the bases of race they looked at communism which suggested equality on bases of all the stuff and that went that they were trending toward the communist camp is why in intellectual jewfish circles communism was very popular in the nineteen thirties and nineteen forties as sort of an anti rapists routine despite its evils a albenheimer is brought into loss almost their serious suspicions about his security even at the time he is given security clevis et the common after the war he becomes a big in ardent opponent of the development of the hydrogen bomb he speaks publicly about how the hydrogen bomsio not be evolopis talk lead to an arms race instead made be should sharetacnology with the ruffians and there be mutually sure destruction and then we will go weapons down and they are to ways to read that one is as abenhimers fans would read it which is that he was stunned by the power of the bomb they now he turns against the use of nuclear weapons and the possibility of nuclear weapons themselves right ism the destroyer of almanac and the the of the m quotes about a him being yo death the other read on this is that e use perfectly fine using the boy on we pan when the soviets wanted the boy to be used onto an but then as soon as the war is over he did not want the united states leaping way way way ahead of the ruffians in terms of nuclear technology and wont to stop redevelopment of hydrogen bob an it was these suspicions that led louis straws to testify to it to essentially organize a removal of openheimers security clearance in the early nineteen fifties themovi this sis plate a sort of macarthiite scare a everybody is it is it is overwrought it is red scare kind of stuff but again there is pretty good material suggesting that openheimer probably should not hadsecurity clearance in the aftermath of the war because he is given security clearance as an emergency measure but he was a serial an melic literally every woman he ever slept with the cup was communist all his friends were communists he he gave money to communist causes he was sited in a letter that is now been uncovered to lorentibaria as a person who as used as a fundament now make that is false make it is not true but is that enough questions to remove i scary clearance it for sure is the move plays it as though openheimer is clearly not in that camp and that the real reason that he sort of going through this process and respecting the process because he wants to do repentance for having created the newcleerbum the the real problem with the move is the time in which the move is made the entire premise of the move is that openheimer as created ta means for the world to destroy itself and he cannot actually deal with that and that is the entire plotting of the move and all the counter arguments to him mutually assured destruction we have to bomgapan because a million men will die on the beeches of japan if we do not the notion that we have to beat to soviets all the are treated as sort of bad concerns the problem is that history proved all of openheimer's critics basically right the reality es that nuclear power has been one the greatest achievements in the history of science maybe thegrates achievement in the history of science why not only because the development of newsletter energy which is a centrally endless an clean but also because the development of the nuclear boy itself has made war time death extraordinarily less of a of a mathematical issue meaning that let us take for mistake a quick example the number of america soldiers course killed in world war to was four hundred and five thousand four hundred five thousand america died in world were to a hundred and sixteen thousand america died in world war one the nuclear boy is developed and here are the casualty lists ora hear the deaths by war of the united states for every subsequent war thirty six thousand in the corban war an less than one third the total of world war one and less than one tenth the total of world ware to fifty eight thousand of the gnomes are bloody long wars by the way really bloody really long the annoy war s nineteen sixty three ninety ten vents twelve year war fifty eight thousand people dead again let us then one seven the number of people dead in world war to the person gulf for three hundred eighty two the arc operations four thousand six hundred the afghanistan operations two thousand four hundred and fifty six in the number of war time deaths on planned earth goes down dramatically in the after after the development of boy why because over no fight a proxy war those proctors better not escalate into anything that approaches nuclear exchange all of the sort some of e people are plates villains in the film and an i will not say that there played is outer villains the only person his played service in outright villain is strop by sober downy junior but all of his concerns abut openhimer are are correct openhimer was a wild egotists he was a womanizer he was a person who is deeply involved with himself and there is a pretty good argument to be made that his sort of narcissism led him to make some of the arguments that he was making there is a scene that sort of played for almost human is the villain in which openheimer n this areal story from america promethium the biography upon which the film is base there is a a scene in move where us at where openheimer goes to visit human and he is telling he does not on to do the hydrogen boy and that he is very concerned about the casualties and he says that he is s a disturbed but that he is the person who who created the boy and human looks at him and he says you did not drop it i dropped it nobody can remember you for dropping it the can remember you for the science the can remember me for dropping the boy hen hes to get this cry babe out of my office human was right human was rid he the fact is nobody remembers openheimer for being the it a drop the mom was he did not drop the boy and this is sort of the the out common the move that is that sort of weird that the move seems to suggest that the scientists have some sort of special viewpoints into humanity because they developed the science that the politicians are sort of venal and corroded another have all these worldly concerns but the scientists are operating on sort of spiritual plain the cult of scientific expertise probably went out of fashion with openheimer and it is a good thing that it did because the reality is that just because a scientists is created science is nothing they know jack leap about politics or about human nature again albedeize tin must brilliant sciences soever lived was a fan of linen wisenheimer was a communist fellow traveller an that that the fact is that anchovy fancy does not know about human nature anchovy douche does not know what sort of decisions should be made to balance all the interest of human beings is why we elect politicians this why we do not have scientific god kings and the the there couple of messages that come away for the film that are sort if in conflict one is that it is can of bad that the scientists ouzo did not get to run things to the politicians were venal and all this but the other one is that the scientists are really kind of screwed up because there scrtuptjust all other human beings they are it a class apart from all other human beings they are not wiser or more brilliant except in the fields in which that wise er more brilliants which includes nuclear physics but does not in clue politics i indicate the fact that it takes on all of these issues and does in a blockbuster or fashion a three hour long move about issues politics science about the interplay of the two about communism verses freedom of speech and all that the fact you would that n three our figment is can make hundreds of millings calices testament to a while chronopher solan is capable of in terms of where this ranks among woman's films it is it is a different kind of solan film i loan's films that you think of a the dark night or interceder or inception of these vast sort of he is vast visual feasts that is not really what openheimer is is more along the lines of save there will be blood then it is along the lines of a his his prior work as i say it best scientific by a pickup er made in terms where i put it in sort of the join panther on it is can of strange to put in the solan pantheon because again is such a different type of film but ism i will say that i was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it is better than his last you film i i i wanted to love don firkins that a count of liked dun kick and i did not tenant i thought tenant was amass that this one is it is it is such a good it is a film will watch twice and that is sangalotbecauseits three hours long i cause that is the thing that i to day time for a quick thing that i hate hay of my friend matwalsh i he believes that he is now one the greatest of all arguments the argument over you f of he thinks that not only you aliens exist that they are here on this planet as ho as very obtetlin me yesterday when i said that this is stupid he is very mad and he had basically two main arguments in which he uncle destroyed me using fact an logic which dud have got that branded ism sorry it is copy righted over the library congress ready common a summat for for coperarty violation of course it'd then be wooing myself but that took in any case a mat says he has to arguments one is ism not even opens the possibility there are aliens on earth and two is there is actual proof that their bialies and are h lets your amount articulate these arguments as he does brilliantly being a lumber jackal all admitting the preconceive bus is a front admitting that he rules out the possibility that any alienee could a visited earth before looking at the evidence what is at enemies that there is no evidence at all that could possibly convince him what what credibility does this point of you have on this if you are saying from the begin and if i come to you i say have evidence that aliens is it'd earth have evidence than you say to me does mater what your evidence is i do not believe i already do not believe be look a that e when i show you the evidence and then you say yet that is not tor vincent when you were already committed to that response you were openly committed to that response before you look patience gates that is argument number one right is that i i no evidence could convince me that aliens on earth gets om i said but the bernaproof superrich subway that is a big claim that alien species are now active on earth that they are flying their little plans around on earth that they somehow conquered the distances of interstellar travel and then came to earth and according to witness testimony then morons crashed into a tree that is that is their bodies were available for for for us to peruse which is some pretty bad piloting but that that that is the claim hay should i be skeptical of that claim i you eat the more outlandish the claim the more evidence must be provided to support the claim if you were going to claim that a giant green monster the size of a do again emerge from it you are toilet and then proceed to burn down your local city and i said images some evidence of that you are well one time a guy took a shadow we photo on his made are i might be we that is a big claim in it is not supported by the evidence you have thus far present could you present with evidence that aliens bee you are sure in fact i think the averment sucks it pretty much everything it seems to me quite possible that if the evidence existed that not only would we know about it we would see a lot of it and would be pretty credible which brought us to mat second argue which is there is evidence how derry because again ism nothing that you could not show me evidence to convince me that alien life is is on earthen is zipping around or you could but i needn't awful lot of it now need be supercredible in their need there again they're several plausible explanations i say bet's take this logically for just a moment to destroy mat with facts and logic if i say to m there would bunch of dirty dishes in the kitchen i leave them in the sing a we i lean type hi left them the saying there is the bunch of dirty dishes in the kitchen saying my wife locks in i the morning shot why are all these dirty dishes in the sing and i say an alien put them there and she says well i do not believe you as it will look here is a photo a ism of a of an alien ship present went at present on earth and i cannot tell you whether an alien came in here i cannot ism just come to say that ism it is possible is it not it is possible and she is going to say it is possible also wash the dishes you bade amass because on the list of possibilities this one ranks rather low when i see some of the evidence that mat has an talk man a second the possibility that this is the alien life is tenth on the list of probabilities is it possible sure petty much anything is possible is it probable i think it best it is extraordinarily highly unlikely but here is mat explaining than nun no it is highly likely but with with with that you who i blank can you missive and there is not of most tons on enough time you havecomployer found out because the thing's traveling fast and yet in spite of those obstacles still we have hundreds ad hundreds and hundreds a photographs potage that we have seen since the fifties i mean there are compelling a you phophotofs back and the fifties that still have not been debunked people want to say that the hos as but many of them still people of t u experts hive been looking at them for that hates not been able to buxom am and what you expect you expect them if if you of us is not it i you expect that in ouzo back in the midtlent century when there was there is photographic penology men pelican is tot in that every once a while you would see a good photograph and then you expect that to day there would be a lot more he's exactly what was at ism here is the thing that is true for pretty much everything the records contemborainis records have got more plentiful because had better technology to document those things what he sayings that because we now have youknow more photos ore more things the things that we cannot explain that means aliens ism saying we cannot explain them i do not now there aliens in fact that thing its quite unlikely that they're aliens what he is saying is that w hen a magician makes a ball disappear the ball did disappear you do not see it maybe it slight of hand but the high probabilities he made the ball i spit now maybe he did maybe violated the laws of physics but how do i know that the magician did not naturally just violate laws pics be cut lo number one cause i think the was of physics are real and i number tubes i think it is much more likely that the magician is using slight of hand when man says they see objects in the sky that seem to defy the laws of physics first of all right away ism ne go skeptical why because i think the laws of physics are things that exist and they exist here on earth and that means that if something is defying the laws of physics it is more likely that my eyes are deceiving me than the the laws of physics are being violated i because here laws gay if if you tell me they you saw a cup floating in the middle of the air if i told you this right i walked in this morning its the cup floating in the middle of the air in are in our office and here a few possibilities one somebody has rigged the thing to look the cup is floating the middle the air and two it is defying the laws of physics which one do you think is more likely probably one rights you believe in the laws of physics when something comes into conflict with the laws of physics one or two things has to be through either you are now blaming the not only did aliens come to earth they also defy the laws of physics and are stupid enough to get caught on camera or alternatively it is an optical illusion and your cropland trick on you or the rate are is now functioning by the way i mean it'll take an example the indapenot samples just earlier this year talking about on identified aerial phenomenon in the united states they say some of these highly maneuverable you v of seem to defy physics researchers including those from the pentagons all woman anomaly resolution office say these you if those do not show the tell tell signs that normally appear when objects moving at such speeds experience friction with air the new study which remains to be previewed did not delve into more philosophical question such as prove of intelligent light forms another planets but from the you ape the observations the re searchers said the friction of u a with the surrounding air or water is expected you generate a bright optical fire ball ionization shell until implying radio signatures for an object observed to be moving in such fashion at high speeds scientists say ionization and associate a radio frequency signatures are expected as they move through the atmosphere in addition to the thermal shock and associated optical signatures but in reports of such highly maneuverable u a pes there are no signs of these signatures scientist speculate the lack of the signatures could be due to more mundane reasons including that human instruments may not be sensed enough to record these changes the lack of the signatures could imply inaccurate distance measurements for single she sensors without a range gate capability say researtures typical you a paintings are too far away to get a highly resolved image of the object and determination of the objects motion is limited by lack of range data this could be a censure induced optical lotion there breathe possibilities either there is indeed a ship violating of the laws of physics which are laws because they are real or it could be that the census data is now functioning if you stop on your scale this morning and it says that you are one hundred thousand pounds one of you things his happening either you are violating laws of biology because you is a human being cannot actually live being a hundred thousand pounds or you are scales mow functioning which onedoyou think is more likely again the a question of likelihoods mat it is not a question of foreshores because i do not know for sore i saying is that the evidence you are presenting me is going have to be better than a guy saw a shadowy image that a pure to defy the laws of physics probably it is aliens maybe it is demon says michael says by the way it is seven p m eastern if you wish to see me destroy matwalsh live to his own face check out back stage already

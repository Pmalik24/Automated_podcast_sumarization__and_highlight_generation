jobless done appoints avid wise special council in the hunter biding investigation and we examine why that a cover up republican candidates to sends on the estate fair as nomad trumpet swoops in for a visit and a blue collar man creates the viral song of the moment i went far of this is the venchparo so the benshpio showsponser by express pin protector on mine privacy to a rest we pandacams flash men it was only a matter of time until the true cover up of the cover up began in order to understand why the jo biding do ja just appointed avid wise special council in a case he was already investigating you have to understand the time line basically hoiden son hunter bine has been under investigation since twenty nineteen he is been under investigation for wide variety of tax offenses he was also under investigation for gun crimes well just a few weeks ago it turned out that a plea deal had been cut between avid wise as the you less a turning in charge of prosecuting an investigating the hunter biding case and hunter bison's legal team and that plea agreement was a sweetheart deal without a doubt the way the sweet heart deal work was this essentially he would get no time whatsoever for any of his tax crimes and he would also get no time you get diversion for his gun crimes but not only did the plea deal do that it also basically immunized him from all further criminal charges with regard to anything tax or funding related which of course is all the hunter widen trobidenstuf that is all of his foreign agent's registration act violations that is him going abroad ping up sax of cash and and questioning whether those crimes involved hoiden all of that would have just gone away and the done tried to bury this in the deal the do instead of putting this in the plea agreement with regard to the tax charges when they went to court instead they put it in diversion agreement with regard to the gun charges that i was not actually under the purview of the judge was providing over the tax charges but it would be left to the judge to actually en force that plea agreement none the less the judge caught oms o this the judges had hold up a second i do not understand are you guise basically wiping away all of his other crimes with this pleaagremnt or are you not and at that point the do which was in fact attempting to wipe away and cover up all of hunter biding to other crimes to the pleaagreement at that point they got call at their hands in the cookie tries to non know we were not trying to wipe way all these future crimes d when they said that hunter bisons megaton was well then we do not have a deal what d you think the deal was you thin he just con a plead out on the tax charges an the gun charges without wiping away all future prosecutions on similar charges the corruption with hoiden or the foreign agents registration act issues you the we are just con a sign our names on the dotted line for a aquas sweetheart deal no we want the whole thing otherwise were going to court and the do said well we were going to give you thewhole thing but then we cannot got caught giving you the whole thing and the entire arrangement blue the judge in that case o that head never seen any deal remotely that deal and all of this plead simultaneously with i ares whistle blowrgarry sharply testifying before congress that avid wise the special the ositorney in this particular case had not been granted special council status now why would that of matter shelf he been en special council status he would have bee allowed to prosecute under widen basely were ever hunter biding committed a iron he wold have been given enough in dependence to go after hunter widen however he believes he needed to go after hunter bid but according to merry sharply avid wife said that he had actually been denied by jobidins do jay special council status in the investigation of hunter widen in fact here is the virus whistleblower garryshaply testifying in open con grescional testimony that avid wife said he was denied special council status and that is when avid we in he october seventh twenty twenty to tad that the desk us turnips office at the will not allow charge there and than added that he would request special count he request the special council authority and was denied in that evening i even had him repeat that because i knew how important that that want i want to make she i understood it you were there and you remember crystal clear in your but not only do i remember crystal crystal clear but i documented it the e man this n exhibit in the housewares means committee testimony was when i returned home that evening i documented it in in that meal and t and a an exhibit you can look right on there faso sharply said he was actually prevent ted from pursuing any leads that involved hoiden including in infamous twenty seventeen he out from names silly a business associate of hunter bison which bore the subject mine expectations an outlined it provisional agreement for equity in the deal it the shiny s energy company that included the famous phrases now ten held by h for the big guy sharply says he want to investigate that in who is prevented from doing by avid wife and by the people were in charge of this investigation who were not given special council status now the do ja then said well we did not give special council status because he never asked for special councilsttus but of course that is not how special council status works yo don't walk in to the do pj's office and say i would special council status ye do not walk in a merit garland toil staylisson y here by request special council status your given special council status voluntarily by the do ja because they want to establish some form of independent from the actual in vestigationthat is going on this for example is why they give special council stats to jack smith in the down trump investigations they could at least claim that it was not merit garland and jobidin doing that they did not bother doing tooth hunter because they clearly wanted their finger still in the my with regard to hunter bide no can while all of this controversy led up to derrick garland over the over the week and on fridge announcing that avid wife would now be appoint the special council now understand the timing here is everything davit lies should vegan account appoint to special council hit they want a special council at the very beginning they rewound have had the full powers to go after hunter widen but he was not given that special council status he did not have the power to g after hunter widen then avid wife any time during the subsquin period could hae ben given that special council status and than he was not and then the under bison pleadsiol came through it n it blew up and then merry sharply testified and now it appeared that avid wife was going to be dragged and from congress to explain why he was not given special council status an who is get a half to actually testify in congress under both in danger of perjury hes en have to testify whither merit garland and t done had basically told him how to handle the case in order to forced all that merit garland in the done then gave him special council status and in doing they accomplished a couple of things one they back filled the special council status when it was basically too late and too they know essentially prevent congress from calling him in for questioning because anything he his question about now he can say his part of an on going investigation until he cannot concern it if he is asked out why he was again special council status before he can tell li have special council status now and i cannot really speak about what was happening before the is that is all part of a case that is now on going this is a cover up of a cover up understand the original crime was under bison an jobidon in doing whatever was they were doing we still do not know all the answers the be teethe obvious what was going on and then part too was the cover up which was appointed person who is not a special council to investigate that thing and have that person cut a sweet heardeal with hunter bison and the winhthatp blows up you get to cover u of the cover up which is now give that exacting person special council statuses willexplang us a second i probably is not even legal under the special council stay to actually give davdwi special council status at this point first a central banks in countries china into and australia by in transitioning to a

to do it he's doing here is merit garland a pointing it haven we special council disappointment con firms my commitment to provide mister nice all the resources he requests a turn general merit garland said avid we himself ask for special council status after leading the criminal probe into the presidents sun since twenty eighteen the appointment of mister nice been forces for the america people the departments committed man to both in good penitents and accountability and particularly sens o this matters case just a few minutes after this happen dog lawyers than ask the court in delftware where this entire pleeagreement blew up if they could withdraw the case against hunter widens that could refile the charges in washington be see in californium and conoquot do it the right way was the walsree journals solemn mankind points out this whole thing is a sham it is absurd according to mean jerkins he says to get fully wrist side up even by stone wo be a standards the department means not just to am a special council on the enter by n case an was to re turn to the status or of ordinary prosecutor jack smith the special council in the none trump case how can be a conflict to interest for department to throw the book of criminals who also to have new the president's political enemies it is not smith was only names a her a leak signaling to abidance dis pleasure with thedepartment for not being a gesso enough against mister trump the zeojia has every natural insensitive to throw the book at trump if it could not convince itself that had sufficient grounds this might be a problem but it is a corruption of the special council concept to believe to problem the special council regulation should some a mericarlands fridge announcement in the hunter biding cases bazar in a different way when examined against special council logic garlands had the hunter investigation will reach the stage or such an appointments appropriate bout what stage they wen through the entire investigation literally the whole investigation and then they try to cut a sweetheart real men a blew up at which stage was it not appropriate to axially make him a special council the answers this stage because as it turns out the special council its spoke to come from outside the government we're not suppose to just give in ordinary attorney working for the government special council status this way if we you saying that it is now reached a new stage is an absurdity as mean changing points out he says this would be the stage where irescollabraters publicly accrue accuse whites and his delta overseers o violating normal procedures go easier on hunter than they would on any other alleged offender is mister wise the special council now going to investigate mister wist the ordinary us to turkey's problematic handling of the case but how is this going to work exactly is mister wise going tost are noticing the accumulating evidence the jordan actively invented his sons access peddling scheme is even to follow up on charges by his own tires colleges his actions in the investigation retains hin by favoritism toward hunter the only reason they doing this to s he can refuse to test fight in front of the house committed recently this would conclude on earthing the allege receipt by multiple members of the began family of millings abuts from hunters international dealings now this s easily just away of shielding avid wises from the investigation of the original cover up by creating a new cover up this is what the head of the house overs committee names comer things as is about to connect to abide criminal activity and then they dump this on us we pure more evident an any one a get e potency in et regain et criminal a cavity by the by all and

spinning this ask now of runs being super on fair to hunter baton sere is democratic representative very coaly sang then you know normal people would be subjects this level of street are you kitting if a normal person bought e on claiming they were not as dramatics while they were dramatics and then a girl friend threw it in a trash can across the street from a school and then it dis appear red do yo to person would not be in jail if a person committed crimes to tunes of millions of dollars in activation do you think that would just go by the wayside and no one would care do you think there you know foreinagents registration act investigation of twenty million dollars an tearing families coffers because they're travelling around the world making promises on behalf presumably of the vice president of the united states tit is insanity here is carnally a lot people make a suctions bout people onion life giving a special deal win blank open this the opposite that the there an again no a no cortex cut at all there canthathey cannot have the book ton out in because nobody wants to be exceeded as showing favoritism an the justice system or in the police unfolding acts i think you are right i think i o hundred widens being subjected here to a level a a not only scrutiny by the countability that most mere mortals would not most mere mortals would not am died most mere mortals where crack attics who are addicted to hookers those people do not end up with millions in millions of dollars in their bank account because their last name is not bison its pretty obvious what is happening here my favorite defender here is dryer dreary those constantly talking out the two tracsisom of justice in the united states the systemic racism of the criminal justice system hell house is out their saying hunter is i may acts cant believe how how unfairly hundred is being treated in other words he is that he is being treated differently because he is jo bionic i what are we thislittle piece here the particular don charge that the fends around against jo died and this on the daily beast he drug us rain possession of a fire a is rarely brought as a standalone crime especially now that roughly offfift of the country is a canobistwith an inevitably significant overlap with the nations estimated eighty million gunners was one that think when the fends do bring the type of caste they come down hard but it is usually a tool they used to take down a tough to arrest criminals a militant white nationalists is lowest terrorists or an areal traffickers i think all the evidence that have seen far in this case is that jo is that hunter biding he could be terrible ta out n on never mat am is being treated worse then any one else would be where's that amid give question would you read say this about any white republican any what republican any white non jobidin son about that would youevry to ever say if anything remotely that about a rich white man getting off on these types of crimes ever

legal analyst the and rivals he has a a similar sort of take he says yet what to what to maze about this the special council now has independence you mean now he does not in understand why did not he have it before that would've been the question would it not what acted authority does not give to wises in what are the implications for hot about it himself the primary added authority is really independence the special council no longer will have to be a we over by the by the at tourney general the technically special council does have to report to the attorney general i ad anal way attorney general or he indicated that avid wist ad rout invest to get try power the real question this what inference can we draw from avid wise's request a to become special count an mean the inference is that he wants to cover up what is going on clearly clearly in to may even san an chaketapper now listen i think take obviously is a left leaning eye but he least attempts to be objected in his analysis it sometimes take and as some of the others unseen and actually question the special council ofpplaytment rightly the es attorney had made the decision to have it dishes diversion program in a is demeanor i but now it merits o special council t at does he know of stuff that should be in a special council investigation that was not in that pleadali ma maybe he does but then why do that plead the it is all right it is all very especial fasten remember we have heard already from avid wise about what the process was he has said i have the authority do all the toxin paints a crontraye to a my experience was but now this raise the lot of questions wherever happen on tuesdays a pass alluding to now does make me feel surprised about why now what is happening here remember he is still the best tourney in delftware but now the special council allows him to actual to go beyond his own jurisdiction you can look at either areas as well treason you have jack smart not tapping to confined to one particular juristical go beyond than hating in fountain forty and lappings an washington do see it does now go beyond that but at its core i wonder what the decision really came down to the special council statute says you can have this if you first look to thinker out does a matter actually warrant and investigation is it warranted he had concluded it did at your garland we as there a complicate interest tad play here i mean it is pretty mason when even seaman is guides this is this prettyweard meanwhile hunter bison's attorney baby loll was asked point blank if hunterbidons form business dealings would not anyway connect back you jobidon listen to the willy language or frmabulol but can you answer the question about whether are not your from what if your confident that this wont an anyway link back to the president what i know as what the evidence has revealed i mean that is what people should focus on it is not as if the started yesterday or a week it started for five years with many people in the united states including with the power of sepia's as mister weirs has had to look at every transaction that hunter was engaged in in any place in the world in which he was engaged and what did they come up with they came up with the decision that the only two charges to file were two misdemeanors at a gun diverted charge not any of the other things that the major right wing have been yelling from money laundering to foreign corruption to foreign agent none of that you notice what that was not that was not a full scale full frontal denial of relationship between jo and hunter's business you notice that was not wat they was aid there will not be any evidence that is cupboard i know the evidence is uncovered that thus far but where is the where is the full throated job and hunter were not in business together in any way she perform no money that hunter ever took in from a foreign worse was used to job's benefit nor was hunter bison ever associating job with the business of his foreign businesses none of that none of it there is the none of it in that particular statement instead there discount o play victim in fact yore is tabby loll saying thereby concern announce that from forces could influence reinvested how could from forces influence the investigation its job bison's do jay how could that happen in the answer is now there afraid that they got call wit their hand the cooky jar may be fairness might look that a little bit when you say forth were y referencing well what am referencing is and this is not a surprise secret right from the moment this arrangement and agreement has been announce and filed you have every mama right wing fanatical person yelling and screaming and saying it is not right and it is not fair and it is not just you have the former president trying to use hunter bison as a way to excuse his own conduct tat at some point that could pierce the noise could actually be noisy that it get in the way of the facts in the law well would not that be a tragedy would that be a tragedy if it turns out that dome t the giant ruble you have created with the help of jobidon's done actually started to cave in if some manshoul pop that bubble what a tragedy aloud me can would get in just one second to president trump whose responding to all of this first the kinship were a show supported by grand

nice i he put out a very weird statement tries ai avid nice was picked by the two democrat enters from delftware under blue slip he would not have been picked by me but i have a great idea why do not they used arranged jack smith he then continued nice has been investigating hunt for four years giving him the sweetheart deal of all sweet her deals but a brilliant trudge delftware saw through it all now i read the geode want o new judge in jurisdiction but to i with far stronger reasons than hunter and crooked jo mama well actually trump formally nominated wise for u s attorney for the district of delftware and i wise was sworn in while trump was president of the united states om that is not the best statement from true butt sufficed it to say that he is obviously correct that wise is a stage on behalf of the d o j at this point that all indicator's point to that and the fact that he's now basically escaped any sort of congressional scrutiny by being a points of special council is pretty obvious corruption well meanwhile president trumps presidential run continues his facing down presumably some sort of indictment that is going to come down either this week or next week according to the walls feral gorge s become ground zero for exhaustion over the legal drama surrounding tunnel trump and the get p debate of whether to stick with him in twenty twenty four georgia there are still signs that voters of tired of the twenty twenty election replace and of trump himself that kind of trump fatigue is pervasive in georgia according to republican stratajust which s the serious prom for him in general election bright now the possibility of another indictment looming is pretty obvious president trump but out of statement over the we gan going after the futon county d a fanny wills ha he went after pretty hard obviously he suggested that om sh is corrupt he suggested that sh is a driven by politics of course sh sh is this a partisan democrat but yow as these case is stack of it is going to provide a serious challenge to his ability to actively run a campaign according to bright part a come fanny wills has playing to bring multiple witness beforegranjury next week as part for investigation into president trump true wrote i hear that basis to futon county district attorney fond satin fanny wills who weekly presides of one of the deadliest communities in the united states with thousands of murders violent criminals and gangmumers coming the street to long on tried free and our tree with kingcups his using a potential indictment of me and other instant people as a campaign and con and funrasin con job all base on a perfect phone call is president challenging election fraud my duty and right this would be trumps fourth indictment in t past a five months and of course it would bleed into the presidential election trump was asked whether he be taken a predial in gorge and correctly he said a no way man not a thing that is going to happen i er any tine eel i a i ai i we i i i a a i i i e i i a i ai a i i i a a i a e ai a i i i an i e i i e a air i i a pound he that of course gan be trampoline a the we through the election the question is wether that is going to be a winning message in at general lection at something that republican voters gang a half to aside a tie when some friends over the weekend and we are all agreeing that the reason that republicans many of them love love love trump is because of course he is a hand grenade that was thrown into these sort of ten of vipers that is america politics but the question is what happens if that hand grenade becomes to dodge or what happens is starts to blow up in your hand that something republicans are going to half to decide to they think that trump is still more of a tool against the left that he is capable of victory in a general election or is he a can grenade that is going to blow up in their hand right now the pole suggest the republicans are very much on board with the idea that trump is still the best my two nominate the real clapolt ex pulling average has trump wrought riding very high at fifty four per cent has rondo mantis at fifteen per cent has e vacromasuamy at six pence at five daily at there everyone below that now the pulling on romasuammy is very weird as i careful disclosure ism ism friendly with the take for some friendly with many of these can that it is is the truth but the makes pulling is superweird because all of the online poles have him at seven eight nine ten eleven and all o the phone poles have went to which which suggests that the these these may not be the most reliable pulling statistics four the take because he is the only one he are seeing picking up support right now other than trump trump is actually on a bit of a hie right now in terms of his pulling numbers the mantis has declining the real geopolitics pulling average about twenty five per cent in aril they downs about fifteen per cent to day the bag in the roll clopolitix pulling average has picked up about three points it but it is really trump who sword during that same period trump one from about forty five per cent in no in the beaning of aril two fifty four per cent to day well that dynamic was clearly on display in be over the weekend it was the i was stayed fair which this giant huge fire that happens at every four years in i i believe it happens every year big obit e really you breaks into the open during primary season because everybody goes there hoping to win votes in the i carcass right now the pulling and i wat is significantly narrower than the pulling nationally the pulling and i shows that dona trump is still for shore in the lead but his lead over over the mantis is significantly smaller the last new you time antipole hat trumpet forty four and mantis at twenty which of course is still a big gap its twenty four point gap ut that twenty four point gaps is not of forty point gout say that is a a fairly significant difference well to cantus showed up and i intend in interview with i was governor it can renal to us to shut up at the eyes state fair and that heres with the tanto sad to say i believe if you have an opportunity a to do good things for your community or your country a that you eve that you ever responsibility to do that an to get that don and that is really i think you do i influence to me all the way up to the president and terms of what i looking to do with running for president ism not running to be somebody i running to do things on behalf of the country for the america people ay now obviously that that is an decline bathe big problem for to cantus is that in terms of who is a more exciting candidate who is the one who is going to suck all the air of the room there is no question the trump is a much more exciting candidate according to the washington post the crowd that ad crane to wash governor to senses flip port troops with i was governor suddenly looked toward the sexton train trumps plan was arriving they clapped in sheer we love trump some of hem had chanced earlier when trump got to the portent midday with the basis camp faraway resting in the hate he did not partaking the actual grilling he brought an outrage of support of law makers from the senses home state they posed for self san passed out magahats to a crowd the clog the fairs gran at condors trump was on before two in back cold actually that that kind f behavior could theoretically harm true in i caucus remember he did not when the iocaucasis the first time round it was actually ted crews who on the iwacawcis trump then did what he has become famous for doing he denied the ted crews had won the i caucus he suggested the ted crews had stolen it from ben carbon the ben carbon had dropped out and and and that he not formally dropped out a the us telling people he had dropped out that meant that he picked up then parson's votes and the should have going to trump an really trump one eyes and all of the rest true now theoretically could loose swap again bat an here is the footage of trumps plane arriving and again there is than the the man does have a a political magic to him and try to real to retell politics he istle there is a e trump plane hi be moron now what it would not all this mean well it actually turned into a bit a a a bit of a brawl a bunch of trump fans who ere being extraordinarily rude which again not super shocking we saw some this behavior in the twenty sixteen election as well the share trying to drown out the interview between kimerenalds and on to cantus a i got a say for lot of republican voters if they look at this they have to wonders this the sort of behavior that actually is going to win in nonmember of twenty twenty four i do not know that it is going to appeal to any people who are going o be swing bothers or suburban moms in twenty twenty four than we here was at kimerenalds forms trump fans the on the out there i down a ninth nine canty there i think you may be had of me can what a what where no what ani it we wan a let getbepery bedyappertedity here a cad so y that the question is to whether that is going to be an appeal is is an open one for his part the mantis went after trump because trump had been going after refolds he is cam panning well in i me naturally the e sans esteem seems fairly confident that there going to win i the truth is that in the republican primaries the mantis does not just been to win idea he us who swat and new samphire nus when both of those if he loses new hamster after winning i then trump is probably going to win in south caroling he really needs to start consolidating the feel very very early in this race but his doing the hard on the ground work the slogging work that is necessary here is the basis going after trump for attacking refolds other your in o a other re alley rabbi o he join of ran a r er a a no i a a a a a a a a a r her a o a a a r can a an an a in a you r a a a a a a a a a a e a n a are than a aura they meant obviously dizens his right about all this but this is really one the questions i again to go back to the hand grenade analogy the question is is the hand grenade effective or is the hand grenade not effective you if the idea was the trumplican a common an who is get a wreck the the wages the thing who is got wreck the status duo the question is what does that mean breakfast at is quit in arms of actual policy because the truth is that in terms of up ending democratic policy i sans is tat a help lot more hostage of floorer than trumped as president of the united states but if what we mean is that trump ticks off all the people we to latch ticked off there is no one better in politics probably in history then trump at that the question is whether that actually adds up to a policy win re publican voters into have to decide kind of what they want here do they want the best shot at winning independence they want the best shot at winning nationally they went by shobenan in places georgia and wisconsin in the arizona or they want the guide who is going a piss off the left the most because if they want the has can a piss off the left the most you are never going to better than trump trump ticks off the left better than literally any one in the history of humanity we care not just one second we will get to the latest on the economy because again dobidon remains an incredibly be candidate i focus on that because tit is important to recognize that if re publicans lose in twenty twenty four that is republicans own faults he i the it was publican fall they lost in twenty twenty the rung against a tottering old fool who could not leave his basemen and who is entire party was in horsing mass rioting in the streets as wells a giant national voted lowdown an somehow re publicans found away to lose e you can blame whoever you want for that but the fact is the republicans should run away withthot election they did not if they blow twenty twenty four ire not sure ho you blame then they blew twenty eighteen they be twenty twenty the blue twenty twenty two if they blow twenty twenty four it some point can somebody be behold responsible for blowing all that orbs just onto be pointing wite finger again that's more on the suggest one second first if you most america you might be struggling to make ends meat by the

he just went on a fourteen beach vacation and he came back my four days and now he went back to the beach because he is no longer with us he is no longer sentient and he was asked apparently about the rising deal and hi while he is on the beach and he said no comment and then he headed home s a slow clap for very very carrying deeply compassionate president of the united states meanwhile we now have more starts about how much families or paying than they did two years ago according to see an and business of all places there typical america household spent seven hundred and nine more dollars in jury than they did two years ago by the same exact goods in services according to goodies that is the give increase mass of increase there is seven hundred dollars a month for the same goods and services the send that over the course of the year in thing eighty four hundred dollars that your spending more this or than you were two years ago those are huge numbers because remember whenever abidance as well were has bourne they're coming down into wot but hero the increase in inflation is coming down every most except for last month when it did not but it was coming down every month but that just means that your adding in elation on top of inflation it is saying the you spend a thousand dollars last month on your credicard and this month spent nine hundred dollars you brought it down by a hundred dollars i mean that is true but you'll had a nine hundred dollars to your debt which is what join has ben doing with regard to in relation marsandy the chief a cnemis o goodies set high in elation of the gastrulas years has done a lot of economic damage most of that increase in household spending is driven by housing cost which oaf surge he added that families are so spending more at the grocery store on buying maintaining in insuring vehicles and on recreational services cable paychecks have not grown by nearly as much as the cost of living it is li keep saying that gravity is going to drag the economy back down whilst your journal has an entire piece non america credit rating according to spencer take up at writing for the waster journal investors had historically paid a steep penalty to hunker down in supersede short from government securities for example a hundred buts invested in three month treasury bills in nineteen twenty eight grunts only two thousand one hundred forty one book by the end of last year while became forty six grand invested medium great cornered bonds and awaking six hundred twenty for gran if invested in stocks according to data from and why you finance professor casual demerdemer darn especially the ears following the financial crisis anything short herm in safe paid next to nothing but the federal deserves fighting against in elation is amplified the risk alive an unthinkable fiscal crisis made possible by decades of washington is function that means that people are actually spending a bunch of money to get into short from government securities which pays you almost nothing that is o free out people are cash might be came although they we called certificates of confiscation the inflationary nineteen seventies longer from treasuries have ben the go to asset in times of crisis the ten years note yield is literally the rest free are used to value all other securities but the governments pile of debt has now swelled following the war on terror the global financial crisis alcove nineteen pens epic low intfrestrates and fed on buying mass the strain interest cost were recently no higher than in the early nineteen nineties but the treasury barely sees the opportunity to lock in those rock bottom rase by issuing more long our notes and bonds and now it is too at long from bunch of fore cast say you just that held by the public will surpassed g p this fiscal year interest on the that will equal three quarters of discretionary non defense spending by twenty thirty one it will be as large that right interest on our national that will be the same as all discretionary non defense spending in the america budget by twenty thirty one om we are in serious trouble actually that forecast is probably to optimistic the smiling a the swelling pile of debt means minor changes in assumptions t now have huge consequences about three quarters of treasuries must be rolled over within five years compound interest has a quick has a way of quickly making a bad situation worse what your washing basically is that america that promise snow balling and it is going to get worse and worse and worse and drvidon has exascurbted that problem what exactly to democrats after a li upon here well the caroling their good governments what their gunnerolion is trying to scare the america people into believing the democracy itself is about to collapse is what comely derris is saying is why canary sixth as at the center of everything that democrats do here is coma hers over the week gan worlsmost on talents of politician making her case the democracy is at stake of course what is it tin you have was your mindgreate agma i on give me rink i think everything as it stay right democracy is intact it is strengthens the people it are tests and fights for fundamental freedoms individual rights it is a it is a fighter order against cars its strengthens on the other hand nailed o democracy incredibly fragile it will only be as strong as our ringers to fight r man when you pile on truisms that way man that is bad politic in that from coma she is truly awful of us u truly truly awful of this but she also does declare herself a to miles that is exciting a roe model to dumb people everywhere here is comma arris but the thing about bin a room people watch what you do to we if it was up with what you say what she does is nothing it is nothing she does nothing for a living but in the end theresall they have the can a trying scare america about the republican party and the truth is far it is worked in republicans can say that it has not but it absolutely has since twenty sixteen when ontrumpl as elected ever since then the case democrats made is the crazy has to stop and then they point at a bunch of republican candidates range men hernial walker in georgia to blame masters in arizona to dug mastering and pennsylvania and voters go an and they listen to it and it turns out the republicans should stop banging their head against a brick wall perhaps the best way to run against somebody supremely unpalatable jobidon supremely irritating commelhrris is to run somebody whose actually somewhat palatable because the truth is a republicans cannot get excited to vote against it jobidon and come arris i do not know what business republicans have getting into a a boring boot mean just because jobidon is an incredibly boring elderly fellow does not mean you should not be excited to vote against him and get him out of office but i suppose that if i all politics just becomes a battle of personality then n we are in a race to the bottom from here until the end of time probably now dark thoughts here on money but the reality is that em crater in credibly mutable and if jobidon and commlaharis cannot be beat i in i honest to god do not understand what republicans are doing for living remember a couple of years go i spoke at a house republican summit this before twenty twenty two and i said to them if you lest do not take back the house every one of you should be fired because it is a target rich environment this is a target rich environment if republicans cannot actually a chief victory against jobidon and compel arris i do not know what they do for a living or why we should continue to support them in any way she performed ism sorry but blaming everybody else for losing is not going to putt it marry time for some things i at then some things that i hate last week i suggested the carrylake would be a bad candidate for senate in arizona and i hope by that because she lost to a wet rag in city hobs however she did have herself when we moment and i well over the woken i she was asked about whether there in factory enters she was milking a cow at the time and a hernia response which what a you for the new a time you mother's only two genders right there is only to genders an they know that nil i challenge the new york times for porter and the washington postrporter to try to milk a cow and then try to milk a bowl and see how that goes of we i laughed i get other things that i there is a song that as gone completely viral by a virgin country sing liver anchovy who is a former factory worker he's apparently really really down on his lock and he was ask t play song at sort of a local events and the song that he played is one that he calls rich men north of richmond which of course is reference to the people who occupy wwashington to we and this then this thing has gone unbelievably my coming millions and millions of views there is who towns adman o a o workman of or a o are an a a a o an good a a o a o e e o oo o o a o voodoo oo o one ooeooa oo o a o a an oak nay this song obviously has hit a nerve with people because it is i think the cry of a lot of people in the united states who are just trying to work a job and make their way in life and feel their too many people who have their hand in their pocket particularly he least in the federal government who believed that their money should go to other people one of the some of the lyrics in the song our lord we got folks in the street and got nothing to eat and the best milking welfare well god for five foot three or three hundred pounds tace ought not pay for bag of judge rounds fair enough far enough suppose ted vino explaining that things were not good for lot of people in some respects of one of those people and wast a midnights getting high getting drunk at sort on to point my wife for even things i did care care about did not mean anything to me any more this is not doctor chilli but i found outlet in this music i start uploading a couple of songs he said the universal thing i sees no matter how much effort the working class puts into whatever it is they are doingthey cannot quite get ahead because the dollars not worth enough they being over tax i wont be a voice for those people and not just them bat humans in general as longs your above the very got a fighting chance ism this thing has again gone incredibly viral he says that he is not a wright winger he says that this is pretty much dead center he said because he is more isolationist in terms of foreign policy but that he talks about last part of the song to side rates mental health depression he says there is no reason why the short a stuff should be happening in this country ism john rich friends to the daily wire of course he is offer to produce liver's album and i the idiots getting all sorts of traction obviously and and it should is it is talent guy look a time for a quick thing that i hate already i do not know why ti's mean keeps to playing rather seller to say things about snow white that are likely to alienate pretty much to anybody who would ever one watch this movie they are making a live version of of snow white the live action version of snow wite which is really stupid since the original is of course i come classic reaches egger who is playing so diversity because we we cannot do snow white me more because obviously that be races national must remain a black prince has forever but snow white cannot be a white prince hays even if her literal name is snow white because she has skin as white as snow that is literally the lying in the move in it ism sorry i i did not make it up that is just what the very talk is it is it is not called any other color it is called snow white that is literally what it is called in any case reaches egger also feels the necessity apparently just crap on the with and crap on the original move over the weak end here she was explaining that the prince in snow white is actually head guy i mean them the original carton can by nineteen thirty seven and very evidently there a big boy e on her lo story i with the go who literally stalk otherwhere were though he did not do that with time a o prince are a different kind of we have a different approach to what ism sure a lot of people will assumes the love story just because me case guy an the move ante burn of great did i it those of those things that i ben everyone can have there main about what a cote going to be but is really not about the love story at all which is really really wonderful it is wonderful lovey superb guys it is superb and the prince he is a creepy stalker did that you brolly did not s if you watch the move you will remember snow white literally standing able a well and singing a song where she says that she wishes for the one i love to fighting me today that is literallythelyric you may remember it from the original move but apparently the prince than responding to that by finishing her song whishes what happens that means to creepy stalker now that is that it hm better honesty would not better if he just left her to be dead that's better women shoos show there she is unshod on the buyer rite messing there with lass over her she is pretty well preserves he should at just left her alone they she would been dead randan ever one happy right i mean not happy cause she been dead but but still he is a creepy rate stalker and you'd been better if she had bitten in the apple and died and then she never of gotten kiss and then should be dead elsewould be dead also sleeping beauty should still be dead in fact there is a bunch of princesses who would still be dead if we just abided by me too because it turns out that even when a woman is in love with a man and even when they want to be together the worst thing that could possibly happen is for him to kiss her well she is dead to wake her up from being dead that is the worst thing you cut do in a it i mean obviously the best thing probably the prince held a come along u to a buried mean that that that ad ben the best thing is to bury her alive quasi that would been tat in the best thing but at least this incant be about love mean honest a god what is tiny doing what are they doing they are high on their own supply it is insane what dor thy think the market for this is quite the parent only ism desperate to bring my child to a move that is not about snow white but is in fact about herself empowered woman that is atomic blond but for children let's do that is geniuses already well the rest of the show continues it right night i conornimis it we'll be getting into the man baggage ore not a member become member use could sir check out for two

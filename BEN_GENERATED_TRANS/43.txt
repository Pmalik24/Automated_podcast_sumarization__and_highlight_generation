OFC CONGRESS ARE CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO EVERYTHING THIT'S HAPPENING AT THESE MEDICAL SCHOOLS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH REGARD TO SURGERY AND WE KNOW THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF TE ICEBERG BY THE WAY THET THE THE PREVALENCE OF DIVERSITY EQUITY ANT INCLUSION IN EVERY ASPECT OF AMERICAN LIFE INCLUDING THE MOST CRITICAL ASPECTS WERE THE ONLY TING YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOU KNOW THE COMPETENCE OF THE PERSON AS OPPOSED TO THATR LIFE EXPERIENCES OR THE COLOR OF THERSKIN WE KNOW THAT WE'VE UNCOVERED JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG SO WE NOW HAVE A TIP LINE IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK INTO PLEASE SEND IT OUR WAY A SAP PUT MY NAME IN THE SUBJECT LINE OR GETS MY TEEM IMMEDIATELY TIPS DOT DAILY WIRE DOD COM WE'LL GET OUR INVESTIGATED HIM ON THAT IMMEDIATELY TIPS DOT DAILY WIRE DOD COM I GAN NOW ON TO THE BIG NEWS OF THE DAYS THE BIG NEWS OF THE DAY IS THAT MITCH MC CONALL HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IN THE FALL HE IS GOING TO STEP DOWN FROM HIS POSITION AS G OP LEADER THAT WILL BE PRESUMABLY BEFORE THE ELECTION MC CONALL ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION IN THE WELL OF THE SENATE AND HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TE SHRE CAN C T  M SHA WIS YOU M AR ALEGE TO WE NOT RECALL E AN CLLEGE SUSHBURGEARG PROGGE BUT WHAT A WAGE OS AR TO RPRECU COLLGE I YOU KNOW ORGE CAN TO BELONG FO LAGE U CHOP SHO SHA RE CORTED  MISTRO CROGAR AR COLLEGE TE SHUR THOS WILL BE MALA CHAR URGE REPUBLEC O REER R SAR I GAS SO THE QUESTION OF COURSE IS WHO REPLACES HIM BUT THE BLOW BACK ON THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY ON THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO ARE SHOUTING ABOUT THE EVILS OF MITCHMC CONALL NOW MITCH MC CONALL IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE MOCTIVE ELLIAN POLITICAL OPERATORS OF MY LIFETIME I DON'T LIKE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HE PASSED BUT TO PRETEND THE MICH MC CONALL WAS NOT IN EFFECTIVE OPERATOR IS JUST FALSE THE REASON THAT THERE IS A SIX THREE REPUBLICAN APPOINTED MAJORITY ON THE SUPREME PORT OF THE UNITED STATES IS MITCHMC CONALL ITS NOT DONALL TRUMP IT'S MITCH MC CONALLBECAUSE MITCH MC CONALL IS THE PERSON WE ACTIVELY SAID WE WILL NOT ALLOW MERIT GARLAND TO BE APPOINTED TO THE COURT ND THE OF COURSE FROM COT ELECTED ISN'T TOR DEPRIVED TRUMP OF ALL THE CREDIT FROM GETS A LOT OF THE CREDIT BUT IT WAS MITCH MC CONAL WHO MADE THE DECISION THAT HE WAS GOING TO WHOL LED OPEN THAT SEET UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION AND IT WAS MITCH MAC CONALL WHO MADE THE DECISION THAT HE WAS GOING TO HOLD DEMOCRATS FEET TO THE FIRE TO THEIR OL TO THEIR OWN RULES IT WAS DEMOCRATS WHO IN TWENTY THIRTEEN DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO YUSE THE NEWCLEAR OPTION TO RAM THROUGH BEROCCOBAMA'S JUDICIAL NOMINES AND IT WAS MITCH MC CONALL WARNING THEM IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IF YOU DO THIS IT 'LL COME RIGHT BACK AROUND AND I'LL HIT YOU HE WAS RIGHT HERE'S A YOUNGER MATCH MAC CONALL TWHENTY THIRTEEN TMAJORITY LATOR PROMAL THE PROMAL OVER AND OVER AGAIR THAT HE WOULDN'T RIGHT THE RULE FOR THE SENATE AT AR TO TRAN AN A BO AGAIN TAT YOUT A OTHER PREER TAT YOU O OUT OE REGRE TAN NOT E O EOTHE TA AL YOU REGRETE ANYO AR ETTE A LOT TEEETE HE SO MITCH MC CONALL WAS INCREDIBLY COMPETENT AT HIS JOB AND AGAIN THIS THIS DOES GO TO WHAT JOBS ARE IN THE SENATE WHAT THEY ARE IN THE HOUSE THEREAS BEEN THIS MISTAKEN ASSUMPTION THAT THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER OR THE HOUSE SPEAKER IS THE PERSON WHO SETS THE REPUBLICAN A GENDA THAT THAT PERSON IS A SPOKES PERSON FOR CONSERVATISM AN THAT IF THEY DON'T HOLD TRUE TO CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLE IN EVERY SINGLE THING THAT THEY DO WITHOUT COMPROMISE THAN THEY ARE SOMEHOW BETRAYING THE CAUSE THAT IS NOT THE JOB OF THE HOUSE SPEAKER OR THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER THAT IS GENERALLY TH JOB OF A PRESIDETE MEGT BE THE JOB OF THE HEAD OF THE R N SE BUT THE THE POINT OF THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER OR THE THE HOUSESPEAKER OR THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER ANYBODY WHO'S ANA POSITION TO ACTUALLY COUNT VOTES THAT SHE HAVE SEVERAL JOBS SO MICH MC CONALLS JOB THAT HE WAS VERY COMPETET AT WAS ACTUALLY TRANK TO PICK PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THE SENATE BECAUSE HE CONTROLLED HOW MONEY'S WERE DISPERSED TO VARIOUS SENATORIAL CANDIDATES AND MITCH MC CONALL IT TURNS OUT WAS MUCH BETTER AT ITE THEN DONAL TRUMP WAS JUST AS A IS A POINT OF FACT MITCH MAC CONALL LED REPUBLICANS TO A VERY VERY SIZABLE SENATE MAJORITY AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE ELECTION CYCLES SELECTION OF PRIMARY CANDIDATES THAT WHEN AGAINST WETMANTCH MC CONALL WAS RECOMMENDING DID NOT AND WELL FOR REPUBLICANS THAT WAS JOB ONE OF THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER JOB TWO OF THE SENT MAJORITY LEADERS TO RAISE LOT OF MONEY WHICH MITCH MC CONNALLDOD AND JOB THREE WHICH IS REALLY JOB ONE IS TO DECIDE THE  RULES AND PROCEEDURES BY WHICH LEGISLATION MOVES THROUGH THE SENATE AND PICK EXACTLY HOW THAT LEGISLATION GETS MADE THAT MEANS COUNTING VOTES IT MEANS BACK SCRATCHING IT MEANS UGLY POLITICS UNDERSIDE THE THE SEAMY SIDE OF POLITICS THE SU THAT NOBODY LIKES TO NOBODY WANTS TO SEE IF YOU ARE A POPULAR SENATE MAJORITY LEADER IT IS LIKELY BECAUE YOU ARE BAD AT THE JOB AND MEANIT THE GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE POPULAR SENATE MAJORITY LEADERS ARE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE TO MAKE THE'S NOT GUELLIAN DECITIONS LEGITIMATELY ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S HOW THE SAUSAGE GETS MADE AND THE SAUSAGE GETTING MADE IS REALLY UGLY BUT YOU'VE A JOYS  THE SAUSAGE GET MADE OR IT DOESN'T GET MADE AND THE REASON THAT'S RELEVANT IS BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO REPLACING MICH MC CONAL THE QUESTION BECOMES WHO EXACTLY IS GOING TO REPLACE HIM IS IT GOING TO BE SOMEBODY WHO CONSIDERS THEMSELF A PHILOSOPHICAL PURIST ORIS GON O BE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO MAKE THE SAUSAGE BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT PHILOSOPHICAL PURISM ENDS WITH MINORITY STATUS IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES JUST AS IT IS VERY LIKELY AT THIS POINT THAT PHILOSOPHICAL PURISM IN THE HOUSE MAKE MAY LEAD TO A REPUBLICAN MINORITY IN THE HOUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT AMERICANS JUST WANT THE SAUSAGE THEY DON'T WANT A SEE HOW IT GETS MADE THERRE VERY NOT INTERESTED IN THE MOTGUV ALIOMANIPULATIONS THEY JUST WANT THE THING DONE  AND THAT'S TRUE OF ANY JOB THAT WE DELEGATE POWER TO IN OUR LIVES IT YOU DON'T CARE HOW THE PLUMBER FIXIS THE DRAIN UUSE CARE THAT THE DRAIN GETS FIXED AND IF HE COMES TO YOU AND HE'S LIKE BUT I AM PRINT ON A PRINCIPLED MATTER I AM NOT FIXING THE DRAIN IN THIS PARTICULAR I DIDN'T HIRE YOU TO DO THAT I HURRYEDYOU'O FIX THE DRAIN AND WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE SENATE IS THERE FOR WE CAN HAVE ARGUMENTS WE DO ALL DAY LONG ON THE SHOW ABOUT WHAT LEGISLATION IS GOOD SHOULD YOU VOTE FOR IT SHOULD YOU NOT BUT IF YOU NEGLECT THE PART OF THE JOB THAT IS THE CORE OF THE JOB COUNTING VOTES MANIPULATIONS BACK SCRATCHING THE UGLY PART OF POLITICS THEN WHY OU GAN END UP WITH IS SOMEBODY WHO SAYS PRETTY WORDS AND DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE THINGS YOU NED THEM TO ACHIEVE AND THEN GET YOUR PARTY BOOTED FROM MAJORITY STATUS IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES PURISM IS A WONDERFULLY EASY WAY OF APPEALING TO THE PUBLIC WITHOUT ACTUALLY BENEFITING YOUR PARTY IN ANY SERIOUS WAY LONG TERM AGAIN THAT'S NOT TO WHOLD PEOPLE' FEATS TOF FIRE THE S AR JOB RE WE'RE OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT IN THE END IT'S THE VOTERS WHO ARE GOING TO VOTE THESE PEOPLE IN AND IT'S THE JOB OF PEOPLE LIKE ME TO BE PURISTS IN ORDER TO SUGGEST WHAT I THINK IS THE PRINCIPLE AND THEN TO EXPLAIN HOW FAR OUR POLITICIANS ARE STRAYING FROM THE PRINCIPAL BUT IT IS IN FACT THE JOB OF PEOPLE LIKE MITCH MAC CONAL TO TRID TO GET THE MOST OF THE LOAT THAT THEY CAN AND MITCH MAC CONALL I THINK OVER ALL GOT A LOT OF THAT LOAF AND AGAIN THAT IS WITH MEEBING VERY CRITICAL OF HIS SDANC IS ON THINGS LIKE EMIGRATION AND THE BORDER IF MITCH MAC CONALL IS REPLACED WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS FAR LESS INTERESTED IN MAKING THE SAUSAGE OR WHO IS GOING TO REFUSE TO MAKE THE SAUSAGE AT ALL IN THE NAME OF POLITICAL PURISM THEN REPUBLICANS WILL JUSTHEN UP WITH NO POWER THAT'S THE REALITY YOU CAN LIKE IT OE CAN DISLIKE BUT THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE REALITY SO THERE ARE THREE CANDIDATES WHOR LARGELY SEEN AS THE POSSIBLE LEADERS RIGHT NOW TO REPLACE MAC CONNALL ONE IS THE SENATE MINORITY WITH JOHN THON WHO IS FROM SOUTH TO COTA HE IS SORT OF ON THE THE SENSOR LEFT OF THE RE PUBLICAN CAUCUS JOHN THOONE IT IF YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE HIS HERITAGE ACTION SCORE SO HERITAGE ACTION SCORSE ARE OURE SORT OF A A DECENT PROXY MESSR FOR HOW CONSERVATVE A MEMBER VOTES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE BHE MOST CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE PEOPLE GET VERY HIGH HERITAGE SCORES WE PEOPEOPLE LIKE SENATORCRUS R CENTR CRUSE HAS AN EIGHTY NINE PER SENT HERITAGE ACTION SCORE SENATOR RAN PAUL HAS A NINETY SIX PER CENT HERITAGE ACTION SCORE HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE SUSAN COLLONS SUSAN COLLONS HAS A HERITIGE ACT ION SCORE OF TEN PER CENT BE WHICH MAKE SENTS REA THAT THE'RE TRYING TO GRAD PEOPLE ON THAT SPECTRUM SO MACH MC CONALL FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH HAD A HERITAGE ACTION SCORE ABOUT FORTY THREE PER CENT SPECT KIN OF LIKE HALF WAY IN TH MIDLE OF THEREPUBLICAN CAUCAS AND THE REALITY IS THAT'S NOT LIKE THE WORST PLACE FOR THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER TO BE BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO UNIFI YOUR CAUCAS I NO ITES AN UN COMFORTABLE POLITICAL TRUTH THAT EVERY PARTY IS A SPECTRUM OF USE AND THAT IT IS THE JOB OF THE MAJORITY LEADER IN THE SENATE AND E HOUSE SPEAKER TACTUALLY COBBLE TOGETHER THAT COALITION IN ORDER TO MOVE THINGS THAT HE WANT MOVED AND GET MOST OF THE LOAF OR AGAIN YOU CAN SIT THERE NEW NOTHING MC CONALL SAT CENNA DEAD SENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY POSITIONALLY SPEAKING SAY IS LIKE A FORTY THREE PER CENT HERITAGE ACTION SCORE MC CONALL'S HERITAGE ACTION SCORE OVER HIS LIFETIME IS FIFTY NINE PER CENT THE AVERAGE SENT REPUBLICAN HAS A HERTAGE ACTION SCORE SIXTY FIVE PER CENT SO HE'S REALLY DEAD SENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCAS THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD THEORETICALLY REPLACE HIM AND IND THIS OF THE PROBEM WITH WITH SOMEBODY LET THATE'S BEEN RANPALLIS BEEN SUGGESTED FOR EXAMPLE AS A POSSIBLE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER ALMOST IN POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW HE GETS THE JOB ALSO IN POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW HE COBLES TOGETHER RA CPOLISH NOW IT MAY BE THAT SENATOR PAUL SAYS I DON'T WANT PUT MAKE THE SAUSAGE THERE IS A PRINCIPALE DARGUMENT FOR NOT MAKING THE SAUSAGE JUST TO ENDS WITH REPUBLICANS AND MINORITY'S TOHEADIS AGAIN I TEND TO AGREE WITH WITH A LOT OF THAT FROM RANPAUL OR FROM SENATOR CREWS THAT THE JOB OF THE SENATE IS NOT TO PASS LEGISLATION THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TEN TO DISAGREE WITH THAT OVERALL AND THE DON'T TEND TOE LIKE CONGRESS IS WHERE THE SAUSAGE DOESN'T GET MADE IN ANY CASE THE THREE CANDIDATES WHOARE UP FOR THE FOR THE JOB ARE  SENATOR THON SENATOR THOON HAS A HERIAGE LIFETIME ACTION SCORE OF LIKE SIXTY TWO PER CENT AGAIN THE AVERAGE SENAT REPUBLICAN IS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE PER CENTS O AGAIN HE'S SORT OF DEAD SENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCAS HE'S BEING PER TRADE AS A WILD LEFTIST SENATOR THOON WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT TRUE THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S AT ODDS WITH DONALD TRUMP TRUM TOOK A SWIPE AT HIM IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO SUGGESTING HE WAS GOINGTO TRY TO PRIMARY THOONE CASTHOON WASN'T SUFFICIENTLY SUPPORT AB OF HIM IN TWENTY TWENTY AND DIDN' GO ALONG WIT THE ELECTION STOLEN KIND OF STUFF IN THEN TRUMP GOT HALF HARTED ABOUT IT AND IN THOON ONE HIS REELECT IN A WALK SO THERE THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON SORT OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THEREPUBLICAN PARTY WHO DON'T LIKE THOONE BECUSE THEY THINK HE'S TO MODERATE THAT HE FOLLOWS DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF MC CONAL THE THING ABOUT THOON IS THAT HE DOES HAVE A LOT OF TRAINING AMD HE WORKED UNDER MACONALL FOR YEARS IN HOW TO MAKE THE SAUSAGE JOHN MORASSO IS ANOTHER POSSIBLICANDIDATE HES SIGNIFICANTLY OLDER THAN JOHN THOON HE IS THE  SENATEUOPE CONFERENCE SHARE FROM WYOMING HE HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP HE 'S ACTUAL THE SENATE SENTR IS THE SECOND SENATOR IN AMERICA TO INDORSE TRUMP HAS A HERITAGE LIFETIME ACTION SCORE OF SEVENTY TO PER CENT SO HE'S SLIGHTLY MORE CONSERVATIVE THEN THE OVERALL REPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE SO FROM A CONSERVATIVE PRORSPECTIVE BRASSO MIGHT BE YOUR GUY A BORASSO SEEMS LIKE SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS HOW THE SAUSAGE IS MADE AND ALSO HAPPENS TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE OVERALL THEN MC CONALL AND HAS A WORM RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP SO HE SEEMS LIKE THE OBVIOUS PICK THE OLING DOWNSIDE IS HES SEVENTY ONE YEARS OLD NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT IN MODERN AMERICAN POLITICSTHT MAKES YOU SPRING CHICKEN BUT STILL HE'S SEVENY ONE YEARS OLD SENTOR JOHN CORNAN HAS BEEN  SUGGESTED FROM TEXAS AGAIN HE HEIS E NOT AT QUITE AS AS MUCH AT ODDS WITH TRUMP AS THE JOHN THOON IS THERE'S BEEN DIS CONTENT WITH CORNAN BECAUSES CORNAN HAS SUPPORTED SOME OF THE MORE BY PARTISIN PACKAGES IN THE PAST HEHAS A HERDAGE ACTION LIKE TIMESCORE OF SIXTY FOUR PER CENT AGAIN MOST OF THSE PEOPLE ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SENATE REPUBLICAN AVERAGE THEY THE CALLS FOR YOU KNOW THAT THE THE SUGGESTION SO MADGATES SAYS ALL WWE WE WANT A BIG VICTORY BECAUSE MC CONAL STUPPING OT MC CALL'S EIHTY TWO YEARS OLD AND WHO'S HAVING FREEZES AND WE PLATED IT ON THE SHOW HE LITTLELYE FREEZE UP FOR MINUTES AT A TIME MEAN IT IS KIND OF AMAZING WHEN YOU THING ABOUT THE FACT AN ANCYPLOSY'S EIGHTY TWO YEARS OLD AND SHE SAID I DON'T WANT TO BE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER ANY MORE I'M TOO OLD AND THEN YOU HAVE MICH MC CONAL WHO'S EIGHTY TWO YEARS ELISIC I DON'T WANT TO BE HE SENTITE GEO PEELIATER ANY MORE I'M TOO OLD AND THEN YOU HAVE JOBIDON WHO'S LIKE I'M GOING JUST PIN HE'S BEN BE EIGHTY TWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE IS ANAUGURATED IF HE WINS NEXT JANUARY AND HE'LL BE STARTING HIS SECON TRUMP WHICH MEANS FOR MORE YEARS OF THAT THAT SHOWS HOW OUT A TOUCHHE IS IS THIS LIKELY TO BE A TRANSFORMADOFE MOMENT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WELL DEPENDS ON WHO IS PICKED THERE PUBLICAN PARTY DOES HAVE A CHOICE THAT CAN PICK SOMEBODY WHO IS COMPETENTS AT THE JOB OF SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND GETS MOST OF THE LOAV WHEN RE PUBLICANS HAVE MAJORITY AND MAKES SMAR PECISIONS AND DOES THE JOB AND AGAIN THE JOB IS NOT TO BE A PERSON WHO JUST SAYS THINGS IS TO ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE PICK GOOD SENATE CANDIDATES THAT MEANS PICKING PURPLE CANDIDATES AND PURPLE STATES BY THE WAY WHICH GAN DOESN'T PLEASE THE BASE ALL THE TIME OR HE CON PICT SOMEBODY WH'S A PURIST GET'S VERY LITTLE DONE AND YOU ENT UP INTE MINORITY THOST OF THE CHOICES BEFORE PUBLICANS OM INTERESTING SEE WHICH WAY IT REPUBLICANS GO KAY ALL OF THIS IS SORT OF FASCINATING WITH HE BACK TROP OF TRUMP SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH REGARD TO THE SENATE RACE TO REPLACE MC CONALL IS THAT TRUMP HAS BEEN IN VOKED A LOT AND WHAT YOU SEE FROM PEOPLE'S LIKE ALL I'M ERE SO GLAD WE GOT RID OF MC CONALL BECAUSE NOW WE CAN PUT SOMEBODY WHO'S MORE TRUMPY IN PLACE AND ONE OF THE BIG MYSTERIES ABOUT DONAL TRUMP IS WHAT IS MORE TRUMPY WHAT D'ES THAT WHAT IS TAT EVEN MEAN THE'S BEEN A QUESTION ABOUT DONAL TRUMPSINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE MORE TRUMPY SO I'VE ALWAYS SUGGESTED THAT THERRAR SORT OF TWO SIDES OF TRUMP THAT WE HAVE TO ASSESS AND WE EVE TO ASSESS THEM SEPARATELY BEAUSE THEY ACTUALLY DO NOT QUARRELAY ONE IS RETORICAL TRUMP AND ONE IS POLICY TRUMP AND WHAT YOU SEE WITH RAT APOLICY TRUMP IS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO CRAFT A TRUMP IS UM AROUND WHAT IS ACTUALLY JUST A SET OF POLITICAL IM PULSES BY TRUMP THAT AR GENERALLY MODERATED BY HIS STAFF SO WHAT YOU SAW IS FORT OUT YOUSE THE ISOLATIONISTS CLAIM THAT TRUMP IS AN ISOLATIONIST HE IS NOT THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SUGGEST IN HIS ACTUAL POLICY RECORD THAT HE IS AN ISOLATIONIST FOR EXAMPLE THERE PEOPLE WHO SUGGEST THE DONALL TRUMP IS SUPERSOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE THERE'S NOTHING IN HIS POLISHY RECORD TO SUGGEST THE DONAL TRUMP IS SUPER SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE AND SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY WE GOT RID O MC CONALL THAT THAT CUCK MODERATE AND NOW ORE GING TO GO MORE TRUMP SINGLE KAY BUT WHAT ARE BE TALKING ABOUT IN TRUMS OF POLICY WHAT IS I RETORICAL TRUMP THE DIFFERENS HE MAC CONALL AND TRUMP IS MUCH MORE RATORICAL THAN IT IS POLICY ORIENTED AND THIS IS TROUPE FOR TRUMP AND LMIDNERALLY EVERYBODY ELSE TRUMPS RHETORIC IS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BOX HE'S A STAND UP COMMEDIAN WHO RAN FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND ONE  AND HE'S GREAT AT IT RADMINE'S HILARIAS HE'S ENTERTAINING AY ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TRUP RETORICAL TRUMP IS NOT POLICY TRUMP WHICH IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS FOLKS WHY DONALD TRUMP HAS A REALLY GOOD SHOT OF WINNING REELECT WHY BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WERE DONALD TRUMP IS POSITIONALLY IF YOU PUT ASIDE THE RETORIC IF HE PUTSIDE THE CRAZY IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS POSITIONALLY HE IS SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE OF AMERICAN POLITIC THAN JOBIDON IS IF AMERICAN POLITICS TRADITIONALLY SPEAKING HAS BEEN RUN TO THE EXTREMES DURING THE PRIMARY RUN TO THE CENTER DURING THE GENERAL DONALD TRUMP ALMOST PERFECTLY FULFILS THAT INCEPT HE ACTUALLY HASN'T BEEN RUNNING TO THE RIGHT IN THE PRIMARY HE'S RAN AS HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAS SO MUCH FATH AMONG THE REPUBLICAN ELECTRATE THAT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO SAY HOREDICAL THINGS THAT NO OTHER CANDIDATE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH SO GOING IN TO THE GENERAL AS JOBIDON MOVES TO HIS EXTREME LEFT IN THS BEEN NIGHTED AT TENT  TO GARNER THE LOVE IF HIS RADICAL BASES TO WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY HE'S ABANDONING THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAYING FIELD N THE REALITY IS THEN TERMS OF POLICY ASIDE FROM BORTERPOLICY WHICH THE MAJOR ISTINCTION DONALD TRUMP AND MITR MC CONAL LOOK VERY VERY SIMILAR AND IN FACT THERE AREAS WHERE DONAL TRUMP IS TO THE LEFT OF MITRMC CONALL PARTICULARLY ON PROLIFISSUES THE REASON THAT MATTERS IS IF YOU'RE LOOKING ELECTORALLY THE REASON AGAIN DONALD TRUMP HAS A VERY GOOD SHOT OF WINNING A REELECT IS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT FOLLOW THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY ORTHODOXY ONE OF THE GREAT IRONIES S THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORR CLAIMING WE NED UN CUT PURE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT GRAD A TRUMP AND WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT IS THAT WE WANT TO GO LIKE FULL PROL LIFE FULL SO CON FULL ISOLATIONIST THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT HE DOES WHAT HE ACTUALLY IS IS THE MODERATE IN THIS RACE OF THE DIRTY SECRET DIRTY SECRET IS WHEN IT COMES TO INDEPENDENCE DONALD TRUMP IS MUCH CLOSER POSITIONALLY TO INDEPENDENCE THEN JOBIDON IS AN IT'S ALL AFFECT SO MUCH OF THIS IS AFFECT IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS VERY MILITANT IN HIS AFFECT BEN TRUMPS OF WHERE HE IS ON THE POSITIONS THAT DUDE IS A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD RO PUBLICAN RON IS SY MIDDLE OF THE ROAD OUT TI THAN ON POLICY AGAIN LEAVING ASIDE THE BORDER WHERE HE IS QUITE CONSERVATIVE DONALD TRUMP IN MANY WAYS IS CLOSER TO SUSAN COLLINS THAN HE IS TO RANPAUL AND THAT IS NOT A RIP ON HIM THT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION ABOUT REALITY IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS AGAIN WHY I THINK THAT AS A GENERAL ELECT CANDIDATE HE'S A PURING MUCH STRONGER THAN I THINK PEOPLE FHOUGHT HE WOULD IF IT LS PUT THIS WAY IF HE HAD RON TO SANS HIS POSITION AND HIS OWN AND HIS OWN DISPOSITION IF YHEET IF HE MURART RONTOSANTIS ON A BORTION RIGHT PRO LIFE ALL THE WAY TO BIRTH AND AND FRUM INCEPTION IF HE MIRRORED THAT POSITION AND HE HAD THE AFFECT HE WOULD NOT BE A VIABLE GENERAL ELECT CANDIDATE BUT HE DOESN'T SO RIGHT NOW ONE TO GO THROUGH THE POSITIONS OF DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE EARE ON TO SHOW YOU IS THAT BECAUSE JOBIDON ABANDON THE MIDDLE DONALD TRUMP IS ABOUT TO SEEZE IT IS IT THE BIGGEST STORY IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS THAT NO ONE IS COVERING IS THAT POSITIONALLY SPEAKING JOBIDON ABANDONING IN DEPENDENCE HAS LED TO A HUGE SWA THE PEOPLE IN MIDDLETAKEL LOOK A DONAL TRUMP BY THE WAY YOU CAN SEE THIS HAPPENING BROADLY RIT IN CORT OF IN SORT OF MORE CELEBRITY CIRCLES A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO CERTAINLY ARE NOT ON THE RIGHT SUDDENLY TAKIN A SECOND LOOK AT TRUMP AND GOING I'D VOTE FOR THAT KEY IT JOE ROGEN IS NOT A RIGHT WINGER JO ROGEN WE'LL LIKELY VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP OVER JOBIDON THAT'S JUST A REALITY I KNOW JOE THAT'S THIT'S VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND YTHING HE SAID AT PUBLICLY YOU ON MUSK WE'LL VOTE FOR TRUMP OVER JOBIDON YOU ON MUSK IS NOT A RIGHT WINGER I KNOW YE ON MOSKOHEH LIKE THE THIS IS TRUE FOR A HUGE SWATH OF PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES MODERATE LEFT AND YOULON ONCE TREATED OUT THIS VERY FAMOUS MEM OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT THE PERSON ON THE  BASICALLY IS IT N EX IT'S AN EX ACCESS AND ORIGINALLY THE EX ACISS SHOWS PERSON ON THE RIGHT HERE ANDTHE PERSON LEFT HERE ANDTHE PERSON THEMINALE HERE AND THEN IT SHOWS THE PERSON ON THE LEFT MOVING WAIY THE HELL OUT HERE WHICH MEANS THAT THE PERSON THEMIDDLE IS NOW CLOSER TO THE PERSON ON THE RIGHT RELATIVELY SPEAKING CAY THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED IN AMERICAN POLITICS DONALD TRUMP'S POSITIONS RIGHT NOW ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE POSITIONS O BIL CLINTON IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO DONALD TRUMP IRONICALLY LOOKS MORE LIKE A NEW DEAL DEMOCRAT CIRCUN NINETEEN FORTY THEN JOBIDON DOES JOBINE LOOKS LIKE A WOKESTER WHO GOES TO COLUMBIA IT'S AMAZING A CASE SO LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE NUMBERS SO I TOOK A LOOK AT THE LATEST HARVARD HERISPOLL WHICH EXAMINED WHAT WERE THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT AMERICANS THINK ARE FACING THEM THE NUMBER ON ISSUE IS INFLATION JOBIDON IS UNDER WATER BY EIGHTEEN POINTS ON INFLATION HAS THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TA ROVAL IN FIFTY FIVE PER CENT  DISAPPROVAL AND THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT THAT IS BECAUSE JOBDON'S POSITION ON INFLATION HAS BEEN I'M GOING TO SPEND MORE MONEY AND MORE MONEY AND MORE MONEY AND DON'T WORY ABOUT THE INFLATION IT'S FINE AND DONAL TRUMP'S POSITION HAS BEEN YOU SHOULDN'T SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY IT'S BAD TO SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY AND YOU SHOULDN'T INFLATE THE CURRENCY SO FOR EXAMPLE JURE WAS JOBIDON THIS IS EARLY ON IN HIS ADMINISTRATION THS IS JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SAYING THAT INFLATION IS TRANSITORY WELSO THAAS AR ECONOMY HAS COMPORARY A ESUES FROM PRICON CREASONS SOME FOLKS OF RS WORS THAT THIS COULD BE A SIGN OF PERSISTEN FLATION TE FEST GON OUR VIEW OR EXPERTS POLY THE THAT IS SHOWS THAT MOST OF THE PRICIN CRESES WE AN ARE WERE EXPECTED AND  EXPECTED TO BE TEMPERARY REALITY AS YOU CAN'T FLIP FOR GLOBA A CONOMIC LIGHT AAN NOT EXPECT JUS TO HAPPEN THAT WAS JOBIDON'S PERSPECT FOUN INFLATION IS THAT SOUND CLOSE TO MIDDLE O YOU OR DOES DONAL TRUMP SOUND CLOSER TOTHE MIDDLELIS IS FROM DECEMBER OF LAST YERE UNDER MY LADYTION INFLATION WISS NOT EXISTENT WE HAD GASSILY THAT ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY SEVEN ERS  BINOMIC E COED BINAMICS FROM HELL THE AVERAGE MONTHLY MORGAGE PAYMENT IS GON FROM ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SIX DOLLARS UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION TO THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THORTY TWO DOLLARS TO DAY BUT YOU CAN'T GET THE MONEY SO IT DOESN'T MATTER DOES IT MATTER AGAIN WHAT HE SAYING HERE IS QUITE MODERATE IT'S PARTICULRY MODERAT BECAUSE HIS I WON'T CREATE MASS INFLATION ALSO I'M NOCK ONCUT YOR ENTITLEMENTS O TRUMP HAS TAKEN THE MODERTE POSITION ON ENTITLEMENTS SO IS CLOSER THE MIDDLE THERE JOBIDON OR DONAL TRUMP TAKE HIM MIGRATION JOBIDON IS CURENTLY TWENTY THREE POINTS UNDER WATER ON IMIGRATION THIRTY FOUR PERCENTS APPROVAL FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT DISAPPROVAL AN TWELVE PERSENT OF AMERICAN SAY THIS IS THEIR TOPISSUE BY THE WAY MAKING ITE THE THIRD BIGGEST ISSUE AFTER THE ECONOMY AND INFLATION AND THOSE ARE CAN  THE SAME ISSUE SO HERE IS ALAHONDRA MAYORCUS FEBRUARY ELEVENT SAYING THAT THE BY DEMINISTRATION BEARS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BORDER IN ITS ALL REPUBLICAN'S FAULT DOS HE LIKE A MODERATE POSITION TO YOU OR S EEM LIKE A VERY LEFT WING POSITION TO YOU NO DOUBT THERE IS GREDLOCK ON CONGRESS BUT DO YOU BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER WHAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS CALLED A CRISIS IT CERTAINLY IS A CRISIS AND WELL WE DON'T BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR  A BROKEN SYSTEM IN WAR DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT WITHIN THAT BROKEN SYSTEM BUT FUNDAMENTALLY FUNDAMENTALLY CONGRESS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CON FICS IT  NO ONE BELIEVE THAT NO ONE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A VERY LEFT WING  POSITION AND BY THE WAY THE LEFT WING POSITION ON EMIGRATION IS BEING ARTICULATED ALL THE TIME OBVY SOON COMES TO PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS WHAT HAPPENS WITH OTHER POLITICIONS INPACTS HOW PEOPLE THINK OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND YUU NEVER RANDUM SENAT CANDIDATE I MISSOURI A FACT TOE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PANNG ON WHAT HE SAYS YESTERDAY THE MAYOR OF ATHENS GEORGIA WAS ASKED ABOUT THE MURDER OF A YOUNG WOMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA CAMPAS IN ATHENS AND INSTEAD OF BLAMING THE OPEN BORDER BECAUSE AN LEGAL IMIGRANT KILL THIS WOMAN THE MAYOR OF ATHENS TRIED TO BLAME TRUMP THIS IS NOT GOING TO HUNT WHELL TWENTY NINETEEN WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE DYNAMIC WE ARE LIVING IN IN THE LATE TEENS IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPEAKING IN THE MES VILE TERMS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE FOREIGN BORN AND YOU HAD THAT NEW TAN MA TASS A SI IN PLACE AS LIKE SHARIS UM THAT'S INSANE SOC THAT IT'S CHARLOTT'S VILL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LEGAL IMIGRANT KILLING IN AMERICAN WOMAN NO BUT PEOPLE PROBABLY PERCEIVE THAT TO BE THE POSITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THAT SEEM MORE MODERATE OR THIS TRUMPSY MORE MODERATE THIS JANUARY OF THIS YEAR TALKING ABOUT THE UPEN BORDER I TICTRY CANNOT COME SOON ENOUGH UNDER CROOKEG JO BINO CONTRY IS DY A COUNTRY IS DY A BORDERS OPENN GISING IT'S  I GISI WON LETTING DRUGS FIVE AN MILLIONS OF FVE MILLIONS OF A LIGA ALIANS FOR IN TO OUR COUNTRY LIKE WE'V NEVER SEEN BEFORE NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED TO OUR COUNTRY BEFORE LEFT THIS PERCEIVE THIS AS EXTREME RHETORIC BECAUE A GAIN OF TRUMP T AFFEC HE IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE MEDIUM POSITION AND MOGRATION THAN JOBIDON IS OR SAN JOBS IN THE ECONOMY SO JOBIDN TO PROVEAL ON TROPS IN THE ECONOMIES FIVE POINTS UNDERWATER FORTY THREE PER CENT OF PROVE FORTY EIGHT PER CENT DISAPPROVE ALS ABOCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE GALLOPED OPOLL THEY FOUND FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO DO TOO MANY THINGS THAT SHOULD BE LEFT TO INDIVIDUALS AN BUSINESS IS JUST FORTY THREE PER CENT BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO MORE TO SOLVE OUR CONTRY'S PROBLEMS WHICH MEANS DONNAL TRUMP IS CLOSER TO THE MEDIUN VOTER THAN JOBIDON IS WHICH WILL WOULDNO PLAY TWO CLIPSERE ONE IS OF JOBIDON TOWNTING BI NOMICS AND ONE

STATED POSITION OF THE BI DEMINISTRATION THEY TOOK A THIRTY ONE PER CENT E POSITION EVERY SIN GLE ISSUE JOBIDON AND HIS TEAM HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE HE THIRTY PER CENT POSITION WHICH IS INSANE THAT IS INSANE POLITICS HERE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE JOHN CARRY CARMD A AR RAN CN SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO FASE OUT FOSSIL FIELDS GOOD LUCK WITH THAT DED NOW REMEMBER WHAT IY JUST SAID THE SCIENCE SAYSE WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE AMISSIONS DOESN'T PRESCRIBE SOME PARTICULAR DISCIPLINE THAT HAS TO BE DON SIS REDUCTHE AMISSIOS SO WE BELY THAT THAT MEANS SUCH OU GOD A REDUCE THE ADMISSIONS AND YOU ACTUALLY GOING

AMERICANS LIKE A CHEAP GASS IT TURNS OUT SO WE HAD COME TOGETHER WEE GOING TO JIL TAY BE JIL RIGHT AWAY EYCEN GAN THAT IS THE MOTER POSITION HABI NATIONALL SECURITY JOBIDAN SIX POINTS UNDER WATER FORTY TWO O FORTY EIGHT NOW THE LEFT WILL SEGGESTS THE REASON THAT JOBIDNS UNDER WATERS CAUSE HE NOT LEFT WING ENOUGH THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT TRUE THE REASON THAT JOBIDNIS UNDER WATER IS BECAUSE HE HAS A VAGUANT CONCEPT OF HAL FORGN POLICY OUGHT TO WORK HE SPEAKS IN PLATITUDES WITH NO ACTUAL AND POINTS AND THEN HE COMMITS AMERICAN RESOURCES TO THOSE PLATITUDES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOUEMEMBER OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE JOBIDEN MADE A SPEECH ABOUT IT WAS MOST BE ABOUT ISRAEL WHICH HA JUST BEEN HIT WITH THE WORST TERR ATTACK IN ITS EXISTENCE AND INSTEAD HE DECIDES TO LINK TAT TOGETHER WITH YOU CRANE AND

ON THE RIGHT THAT IS BECAUSE THE LEFT WENT CRAZY ON EDUCATION JOBIDON HAS AN APPROVAL RATING THAT IS PLUS TOO BUT THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S FORTY THREE FORTY ONE AT IS A VERY LOW APPROVAL RATING ON EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRATS TYPICALLY THE WAY THAT YOU GAUGE EDUCATIONAL APPROVAL IS HOW MUCH MONEY WILLING US MEN JOBIDN SPEND AELOT OF MONEY ON THE STUFF THE PR ROBLEM IS HE IS ALSO A WOKESTER SO FOR EXAMPLE HERE WAS JOBIDON TALKING ABOUT THE EVIL BOOK BANDS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA THOSE BOOK BANS BY THE WAY MOST AMERICANS UNDERSTAND OUR THINGS LIKE GENDERA QUEER BEING LEFT IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES FOR EIGHT YEAR OLDS TO FIND AND LOOK AT THE PORN INSIDE JOBIDONT DEFENDING THE SORT OF STOP IS NOT A GOOD LOOK IN THE EDUCATIONAL SPHERE WE CAN'T FULLY PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEIN RATICAISE TO HAT WIS BUT WE

TIS COMPRICATIOSTIDIVERSITYS BEIN ATTACT AS I SAID EE WE ONE OF MOST TE FIRST CONTRASON HIS TO THE WORLD TIVERSITS A STRENT OF OUR NASI ECORNIS ON OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND MOST PEOPLE SEE RIGHT THROUGH THAT PLATITUDE WHAT THEY SEE IS JOBIDON BACKING CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND GENDERA THEORY IN THE CLASSROOM WHICH IS WHI WENT OWN FROM SIZE AND MADE TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT 'S UENT CUT FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS TEACHING SE ARTY MOST AMERICANS AGREE WITH US THIS IS A MIDDLBLE OF THE ROAD POSITION CONTRARY TO WHAT THE LUGS TO ME TO  TELL YOU THIS A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD POSITION NO ONE WANTS THEIRE KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL WHERE THEY LEARN THAT THEY ARE INFERIOR BECAUSE THEY ARE WHITE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY BEAR HIS STORIC GUILT BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE T CHOOL THAT'S WI H GRRATHEOR WEAT MEANWHILE BY THE WAY ON CRIME AGAIN THIS A MAJOR ISSUE FROR MOST AMERICANS JOBIDON HAS INPROVALRATIG OF THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT FIFTY PER CENT TO SPPRET WY BECAUSE JOBIDONS PERSPECTIVE ON CRIME HAS BEEN DEEPLY IMBEDDED IN THIS CRITICAL RACE THEORY EQUITY NONSENSE THE IDEA BEING THAT IF A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF BLACK PEOPLE AND UP IN PRISON FOR CRIME THAT IS NOT BEAUE IT DIS PROPORTION NUMBER BLACKL ARE COMMITTING CRIMES IS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS SYSTEMICALLY RACIS WHICH MEANS YOU'VE TO CRACK DOWN ON POLICE DEPARTMENTS FOR THEIR SUPPOSEDLY SYSTEMIC RACISM HERE WAS JOBIDON RIGHT OFF THE BAT GANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SIGNING AN ORDER ON RACIAL EQUITYS TO FIGHT SYSTEMIC RACISM AN THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS OUR SOUL BE TROUBLED AS LONG AS THE STEMIC RACISM AS ALLOWED TO PERSIST WE CAN'T ELIMINATIES NOT TO BE OVERNIGHT WE CAN LIMINATED TE BUT I'S COROS THIS DESTRUCKTI AND IT'S COSTLY IT COST EVERY MERICA NOT JUST TO FELT THE STING OF RICIA INJUSTICE WEREN'T JUST LESSELEN WEARE NOT TIS AN NATION A MORROWING DEPRIVE BECAUSE OF SUSTENIGRATION WE'RE ALSO LESS PROSPEROUS WE'RE US SUCCESSFUL ESS SECURE TWE MUST CHANGE AND MOST GOING TO TAKE TOEN BUT I KNOW WE CAN DO IT AN IRE FIRMLY BELIEVE THE NATION IS READY TO CHANGE BUT GOVERNMENT HAS TO CHANGE AS WELL WNEE TON MAKE EQUITY ANJUSTISE PART OF WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY TO DAY TO MORROWIN ANNLGAR IF THAT YOU KNOW THIS THIS NONSENSE THESE SPEAKING RIGHT HERE COMES UP DIRECTLY AGAINST THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WANT CRIMINALS IN PRISON NOWN TRUM NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE SAYING HERE'S WETIO DO WE SHOULD EXECUTE DRUGGEALARS NOW THE LEGS YO MERE LIKE ALL MY GOT THAT'S TERRIBLE HOW COULD HE SAY SUCH A THING YOU'D ALMOST AMERICANS ARE TOTALLY FIND WITH AXICUN IND RUGULARS YOU KNOW WHY THERS A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY ARE DYING OF FENTINAL OVERNOSES AND A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE FENTINAEL IS POISON WERE WE'RE MAKING UT I IN APPISODE OF DIVIDED STATES O BIDING ON THIS RIGHT NOW AN THAT THE FACT IS THE MATTER IS THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE ARE DYING O FENINAL OVERTOS IS ARE NOT BUYING FENTINEL AND THEN INJECTING IT INTO THEMSELVES THEY ARE BUYING OTHER DRUGS LIKE AT AR ALL PILLS THATARE LEAST WITH FENTINEL WHEN TRUM SAYS GIVE DEALERS DEATH PENALTY I'M ON BOARD HERE AS TRUMP NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE YOU KNOW WHEN I CO THES PEOPLES SMART THE PRESSOISIS HE SAID HE WAS SPORT I'M SUPPOSE TO SAY THAT NOT INTELLIGENT PEOPLE PRESIDENTCIAITI CONTROLS ONE POINT FOR BEON PEOPLE WITH AN IRON HAND NO DA YONO ATE E DE  DET FENALTY FOR THE DRUG DEALERS THAT THA RI YOU WANT TO SO YO DRO PROP AFT TE INSTITUTE OF MEANING FOR THET FENALTY FOR DRUG I NOT WRONG ON ABORTION I ALL THE POSITIONS THAT WE'VE DISCUSS A FAR ONES THAT THEN MOST MAIN STREAME CONSERVERS AGREE WITH AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE MODERATE POSITIONS ON ABORTION DONAL TRUMP TISEGREES WITH MAIN STREAM CONSERVATIVES ON ABORTION AND YET HE IBBLE GET AWAY WITH IT THIS LIKE THE BEST EXAMPLE DONALD TRUM BEING THE GUY WHO SEIZING THEMIDDLE GROUND SO JOBIDON ACTUALLY BELIEVE OR NOT ON ABORTION HAS AN APPROVAL RATING THAT I'S FIVE PER CENT UNDER WATER THIRTY EIGHT TO FORTY THREE WHAT THE POLE SAY ABOUT WHAT AMERICANS ARE FINED WITH IN TERMS OF ABORTION RESTRICTIONS FORTY EIGHT PER CENT A PLURALITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT I SIXTEEN WEEK BAND ON ABORTION WHICH BY THE WAYS SUPERWATE AN MOST YUROPIAN COUNTRIES ARE TWELVE WEEGS BUT A SIXTEEN WEEK BAND N ABORTION ONLY THIRTY SIX PER CENT OURE POS TO A HE'S LEGISLATION THEY WUD BAND ABORTION SIXTEEN WEEKS AND BEYOND THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE POSITION THAT DONAL TRUMP IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING MEANWHILE JOBIDEN HAS TAKEN TH POSITION ABORTION UNTIL BIRTH FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS IN TWENTY NINETEEN YOU'LL RECALL THET JOBIDIN REVERSED HIMSELF HE 'D SPEND HIS ENTIRE CAREER SAYING TAXPARS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FUND ABORTION BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGRIEV WITH SOMEBODY ELSE GAYING IN ABORTION WHA HE PAYNG FOR IT THEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN UNDER PRESSURE ROM HIS LEFT LANG HE DENOUNCED THE HIGHE AMENDMENT WE NOW SEE SOMMANY REPUBLICAN GOVE DO NI NO CARE O MILLIONS OF THE MOST POREST E MOST VONDIBLE AMERICAS BY REFUS EVEN MEDICATEXPATION I CAN' JUSTIFI BEVIN MILLS OF WE WITHOUT ACESS OF TE CURITY E IN THE ABILITY TO CONSTITO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIT IF I BELIEVE HOL CARE AS ERIGHT AS I DO I CAN NO LONGER SUPPORTED AMEMER THE MAKES THAT RIGHT DEPENDEN ON SOMON  SO TAX PAYR FUNDED ABORTION UP UNTILL BIRTH HE'S THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY POSITION UNDER JOBIDEN MEANWHILE THE ACTUAL DONALD TROMPOSITION ON ABORTION DOES NOT MATCH WITH MY OWN YOU'LL RECALL THAT IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE DONAL TRUMP RIPPED INTO GOVERNOR RONDISANTE AND FLOODE FOR SIX WEEK ABORTION BAND SO HE HAS TAKENG THE ABSOLUTELY MILK TOST MIDDLE OF THE ROAD POSITION ON ABORTION PEOPLE PRINICISE NICKEY HAILEY FOR BEING MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ON ABORTION TRUMP IS JUST AS MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ON COMES TO PUBLIC POLICY HERE HE WAS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE RIPPING ON AN INACTUAL ABORTION BAN ON THESTANE OFLORIDA IF A FENERAL BAN MANDED ON YOUR DEASK IF YOU WERE REELECTED WOULD YOU SIGN IT AT FIFTEN YOU DOING ABOUT A COMPLETE BAN A BAN AT FIFTY WEALTH PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO THIN OF FIFTEEN WEEKS THAT SEEMS TO BE A NUMBER THA PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT DOW YOU FIND AT AT I WOULD I WOULD SIT DOWN WITH BOTH SIDES AND I NEGOTIATE SOMETHING AND WILL END UP WITH PIECE IN THAT ISSUE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTY TWO YEARS I'M NOT ONG TO SAY A WOOD OR A WOULDNT I MEAN TO SANK IS WULD INS WILLING TO SINE A FIVE WEEK AN SIX WEEK BENS SUPPORT THAT YOU HIN THAT LIF WHAT HE WONE IS A TERRIBLE THING IN A TERRIBLE MISTAKE BUT WE'LL COME UP WITH A NUMBER BUT AT THE SAME TIME DEMOCRATS WON'T BE ABLE TO GO OUT IN SIX MONTHS SEVEN MONTHS EIGHT MONTHS AT ALLOWIN A BORSION SO AGAIN HOW DO YOU DEMONIZE THAT POSITION AS RADICALLY RIGHT WINE TRUMP IS ACTUALLY TAKING ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS MOST POTENT ISSUES IN THE AFTER M F THE REPEAL OF ROVERSES WAIDE OR THE OVER TURNING OF ROVERS'S WEIGHT HE SEFTSUHE TAKIN INOFF THE TABLE FOR THEM BECAUSE HE IS A MOTERATE ON THE ISSUE ON FOREIGN POLICY BY THE WAY I KNOW THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BIG TRUMP FANS WHO THINK THAT HE WANTS TO CUT OFF A U RANE HE HAS NEVER SAID THAT HE'S NEVER ACTUALLY ARTICULATED THAT WHAT HE AS SAID IS THAT IN FACT HE'S ACTIOEU SAID THE OPSIT HE SAI HE WOULD INCREASE AD YU CRANE SUFFICIENT TO PRESSUR POUTENT TO COME TO THE TABLE AND MAKE A DEAL THE IFFERECSEEN HIM IN BIDN IS THAT HE WANTS POUTEN TO MAKE A DEAL WHERE IS BIDIN HIS PROVIDED NO OFFRAM IN OU CRANE AND AGAIN THAT IS THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD POSITION ACCORDING TO POLLING DATA IS FROM HARVARD HARRIS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF AMERICANS FAVOR INCREASING MILITARY AID TO U CRANE TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT FAVOR DECREASING MILITARY AID TWENTY NINE PER CENT FAVOR MAINTAINING MILITARY AID SO THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU CONSIDER MORE MILITARY AG U CRANE MAINTAINING MILITARY AID OR INCREASIN MILITARY AID BUT FIFTY THREE PER CENT OF AMERICANS OUR FAVORABLE ONATO IS SUPPOSED TO TWENTY TWO PERCENT UNFAVORABLE NOW AGAIN MANY O THE PEOPLEWHO ARE TRYING TO CRAFT A IN A SORT OF ISOLATION IS TO TRUMPISM IRE IGNORING HIS ACTUAL POSITIONS THAT HE'S TAKEN ON THESE ISSUES WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT HE WANTS MEMBERS OF NATIVE TO PAY THEIR FAIRSHARE HE IS NOT CALLING FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF NATO IN MANY WAYS HES GOING FOR NATO TO BE STRENGTHENED I KNOW THAT BEVERYS ATTEMPTING TO MISREAD HIS JOKE ABOUT I'M NT INVITE EVERYBODY TO HINVADNATVE COUNTRIES OF THET OTIT THAT'S A PRESSER TACTIC FOLKS HDOES NACTUAL MEAN THAT HE IS WONG TO TELL RUSSIA TO GO INVADE MOLDOVA IT WHENT WHEN WHEN JOBIDON SAYS AGAIN BIG WORDS BAT U CRANE PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE HIM HERE WAS JOBIDN IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE SAND WILL STAY AS LONGAS IT TAKES MOST AMERICANS ARE NOT INTUAWLL STAY AS LONGAS IT TAKES BECAUSE HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE WYING I COMMIT MENTS TO CRANE LONG TERM SECURITY LONG TERM SECURITY TOTER FUTURE GRASTION AFTER THIS WORE ANS IS IS A GOL AND WE'RE ADVANCING THIS GOL BY PROVIDING AND THE SUPPORT THE CRANE NEEDS NOW ON THE BATTLE FIELD AND HELPING TAN STRENGTHEN THAT THER MILITARY OVER THE LONG TURN THE FACT THAT THE MATTER IS THAT I BELIEVE WE'LL HAVE THE FUNDY NECESSARY TO SUPPORT YOUR RANE AS LONG AS IT TAKES AND I BELIEVE THAT A WEREO THAT THAT SUPPORT WILL BE REAL EVEN THOU THER YOU HEAR SOME VOICES TO DAY I CAPOFTLE HILL ABOUT WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT YOUR CRANE AND FOR HOW LONG WE SHU SPORT THE FACT THE MATTER IS I ASKED PEOPWLD PICTURE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE WERE NOT SUPPORTIN YOU CRANE DO WE THINK RUSSIA WOULD STOP IN CEENE DO YOU THINK THAT'S ALL THER WOULD BE HAPPEN I THINK NOT I THINK OF ASK MAJORITY OF MY COLLINGS EVEN A CRITICS I THINK THAT WOULD NOT BE THE CASE S OR IT TRUMSTAKES THAT THISAPPLATITUDES AND EMPTY WORDS AND UNCLEAR POLICY HERE IS TRUMP THIS IS LIKE LAST WEEK FOLKS IS IS NOT TWO YEARS AGO HERE IS NOW TRUMP LAST WEEK TALKING ABOUT YOU CRANE AND SOUNDING FERAL WY CONSERVATIVE ONY CRANE SO PUTENT IS NOT A FAIN OF MINE ACTUALLY YOU REMEMBER WHEN THEY IS TO SA ALL TRUP YOU THOUGH THEY HAD A BODY LANGUAGE PERSEDEN SEEIN ANFECT IS AND THEY HAD BEIN PUTIN TOGETHER AND THEY SAID TO THE EXPERT WHELL WHO'S THE DOMINANT FORCE AND THE EXPERTS TAIT AS YOU KNOW I'VE ANALYZED THAT AT SPED A LOUT OF TIME DOING IT AND I DON'T THINK IT GIT ALIKE THE ANSWER BUT PRESIDENT CHUMP IS THE DOMINANT FORCE SAID THAT AT AOA TRU I DONT OT  NOT ER WE BOT WALK ONE IN BUT I GOT ALONG GOD WITH HIM BUT HE DOES T'T ONE TO HAVE ME HE WONCE SEV BIDON BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO BE GIVEN EVERYTHING HE WANTS INCLUDING NOU CRANE THAT'S A GIFT HE'S GOT A GIFT HE'S GO TO HAVE HIS DREAM OF GETTING NEW CRANE BECAUSE OF BIDON THE WHOLE THING IS JUST CRAZY BITON HAS GIVEN HIM THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN THE LAST FIVE THAT HAS'T GIVEN RUSSIA ANYTHING IS A PRESIDENT KNOWN IS DONAL JA TRUMP YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T HAV TO GO OVER THE LIST BUT BIDON GIDONS ER TO GIVE EM YOU CRAIN THE WAYS LOOKIN TO ME ITS TERABO OKE THAT IS TRUMP OUTFLANKING BIDON FROM THE RIGHT ON NOU CRAIN THATS IM BING MORE HAWKISH THAN BIDON ON NOU CRAINE ON COMES TO ISRAEL SAME SORTDEAL SO JOE BIDON RIGHT NOW IS TAKING YOU MINORITY POSITION ON IS RONA HAMASS THE VASTMETOREY OF AMERICANS A EIGHTY TO PERCENT OF AMERICANS SUPPORT ISRAEL OFOR HAMSS IN FACT ACCORDING TO LATEST HARVARD HERISPOLE SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT HERE SHOULD ONLY BE A SEASE FIRE BETWEN ISRAEL AND HAMASS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES AND HAMASSES REMOVE FROM POWER BIDON IS TAKING THE POSITION THERE SHOULD BE AN UNCONDITIONAL SEAS FIRE OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HE IS PUSHING RIGHT NOW AND BIDON IS PRETIKING ISRAEL THAT IS NOT THE MAIN STREAM MODERATE MIDDLE OF THE ROPOSITION IN THE UNITED STATES IT IS NOT THANK GOD IS A GOOD COUNTRY HATE HERE IS HEREIS IT JO BIDON SAYING THIS THIS WEAKEND THAT ISRAEL IS RISKING ITS ON LEGITIMACY THIS IS NOT THE MDDLE OF THE ROB AMERICANS DO NOT AGREE WITH US YOU BELIEVE MAY BE THERE'S A FUTURE FOR A TWO STATE SOLUTION BUT FORAN SITTING IT DOES SEE LIKE THER DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE APPETITE FOR THAT RIGHT NOW YOU SEE WHAT IS BECAUSE AGAIN WE SEE THIS HORRIBLE EVERY DAY WE SEE THIS HORRIBLE IMAGES OUT OF GAZA AND IS THERE A PATH FOR IT IS THERY SAFE FUTURE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE THERE IS A PATH FOR WITH DIFFICULTY BHERE'S THE PATH FORRD LOOK FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE THE HOSTAGES BEING HELL MUST BE RELEASED AND THAV WE GOT UP ANY O PRINCIPAL AGREEMENT THER BE A CEASE FIRE WHILE THAT TAKES PLACE ROMADANT'S COMING UP IN AS MAN AN AGREEMENT BY THESE RALITS THAT THEY WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES DERING ROMADAN AS WELL IN ORDER TO GIVE US TIME TO GET ALL THE HOSTAGES OU THAT GIVES US TIME TO BEGIN TO MOVE IN DIRECTIONS THAT A LOT OF OUR COUNTRIES OF PREPARED TO MOVEMENT BUT BUT IT'S A PROCESS AND LOOK ISRAEL HAS HAD THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF VAST MAJORITY NATIONS IF IT KEEPS US UP WITHOUT THIS INCREDIBLY CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE AND BEN GAVER ANOTHERS MOST I'VE KNOWN EVERY MAJOR FON POLICY LEADER IN ISRAEL SINCE GO TO MA HEAR THE'RE GOING TO LOSE SUPPORT FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT IS NOT AN AMEANS WRONG ON AMERITS BUT THIS ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A WILD LEFT WINGED DEERBORN MICHIGAN POSITION THAT IS NOT THE MIDDLE OF THE ROPOSITION IN THE UNITED STATES YOU KNOW WHAT SOUNDS MORE REASONABLE DONALD TRUMP SAYING THAT YOU WILL STRIP STUDEN VESAS FROM FOREIGNERS WHO COME HERE AND HATE JEWS THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTYMENT WHIN MOST AMERICANS AND OF AGREEMENT THAT WE DON'T WANT FOREIGNERS HERE WHO DON'T LIKE JEWS IS A PRETTY IT IS SHOULD THAT BE CONTROVERSIAL I BE SHOCKED IF IT IS HERE IS DONAL TRUM UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WE WILL REVOKE THE STUDENT VIESES OF RATICAL ANTI AMERICAN AN ANTA SOMATIC FARS AT OUR COLLEGEIS SAN EERISAN WE WILL SEND THEM STRAIGHT BACK HOME THAT GO BACK HOME ENJOY YOUR LIFE THAT IS THE MIDDLE OF HOUPOSITION GET ALL OF THIS IST YOU SAY THAT THE ONLY ARGUMENT THET THE BIDE ADINISTRATION THE BINE CAMPAGN HAVE LEFT IS THE DONAL TRUMPS A BAD ORANGEMAN THAT'S AT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY POSITIONAL STRENGTHS THEY DON'T EVEN ON THE TRADITIONAL  DEMOCRATIC STRENGTHS LIKE ABORTION WHICH HAS BENEFITED THEM SINCE THE OVERTURNING OF ROVERS'S WAIGHT DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN THE BAT OUT OF THEIR HANDS BECAUSE HE IS MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ON THAT ISSUE EVERY OTHER ISSUE THE DEMOCRATES TO MOVED SO FAR THE LEFT THAT DONALD TRUMP OWNS THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAYING FIELD WHICH MEAN THAT DONALD TRUMP STRATEGY AT THIS POINT SHOULD JUST BE TO SAY THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER IF HE FOCUSIS IN ON HIS POSITIONS AND JOBIDONS FAILURES HE IS GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT IRONICALLY NOT BECAUSE TRUMPISIM INSOME WILD EXTREME MAGOV FORTH BUT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF POLITICALLY POSITIONALLY IS A MIDDLE TO LEFT REPUBLICAN THAT'S THE REALITY HE WANTS TO MAINTAIN IN PEDTLEMENTS HE WANT TO SIXTEEN WEEK ABORTION BAN HE IS SOMEONE INTERVENTIONIST ON FOREIGN POLICY MAY ALL THESE POSITIONS ARE THE MAINS TROM AMERICAN POSITIONS WHICH MEANS THAT POSITIONALLY JOBIDN HAS BOXED HIMSELF RIGHT OUT AND THERE'S ANOTHR PROBLEM FOR JOBIDON TOOE THE OTHER PROBLEM FOR JOBIDEN IS THAT PEOPLE PROCEED JOBIDN IS CORRUPT THAT SAME HARVARD HERRIS CAPS POLL SHOWS FIFTY PER

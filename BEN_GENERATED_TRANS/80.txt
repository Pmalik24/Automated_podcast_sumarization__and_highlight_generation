IS ADVANTAGE DONALD TRUMP TRUMP IS LEADING BY TWO POINT TWO PER CENT IN THE REAL CLAIR POLITICS PULLING AVERAGE IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT UNTIL YOU REALIZED THAT TRUMP TRAILED JOBIDEN IN THAT SAME AVERAGE ONELECTIONDAY TWOINT TWENTY BY SEVEN POINT TWO PER CENT HE ONLY LOST THE POPULAR VOTE BY FOUR POINT FIVE PER CENT A DIFFERENCE OF TWO POINT SEVEN PER CENT ORE THAT HILLERD CLINTON WAS LEADING IN THAT SAME AVERAGE BY THREE POINT TWO PER CENT ON ELECTIONS EIGHT TWENTY SIXTEEN AND ONLY WHON THE POPULAR VOTE BY TWO POINT ONE PER CENT A MISS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE PER CENT ANOTHER WARDS DONALD TRUMP ALMOST ALWAYS OUT DRAWS HIS REAL CLEAIR POLITICS POLLING AVERAGE NUMBER SO HE'S UP TWO POINT TWO THAT MEANS IS ACTUALLY UP MORE WHAT'S MORE JOBIDON IS TOTALLY STUFF AS POLITICAL SCIENTIST ROIT TO SHERIF WAS NOT A RIGHT WINGER WRIGHTES TO DAY IN THE WASHINGTON POST QUOTE IN HIS TWENTY TWENTY CAMPAIGN FOR THE NOMINATION THE LONG TIME FORMER SENATOR HAD A BETTER SENDS THAN OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES OF THE NORMAL SITY THAT VOTERS WERE LOOKING FOR AFTER MORE THAN SIX MONTHSOF A PANDEMIC ACCOMPANIED BY LOCK DOWNS AN ECONOMIC CRASH BUT THERE WAS A CATCH AFTER JOBIDON CLINCHED THE NOMINATION SAYS TO SHERIFF HE FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO INCORPORATE THE VIEWS OF THE PARTY'S LEFT INTO HIS CAMPAGN'S POLICY STANCES AND OUTLOOK NOW WITH THE NEXT CAMPAIGN ABOUTS BEGIN BIDON AND HIS PARTY ARE STRUGGLING IN OTHER WORDS JOBIDON WY TO HIS VOTERS HE CAMPAIGND IS MODERATE THE PRIMARIES HE CAPITALIZED ON THAT MODERATE IMAGE IN THE GENERAL AND THEN HE PUSH STEADILY TO HE LEFT AND THEN

THAT BASHION TRUMP IS GAN A SAVE HIM THAT'S PRESUMABLY WHY HE'S GOING TO GO ON A TRUMP BASHING TOUR BEGINNING THIS WEEK LABELLING DONAL TRUMP A RACIST AND A FASHIST ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATE A PRESS QUOTE PRESIDEN JOBIDON IS STARTING THE CAMPAIGN YEAR BY VOKING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR TSO MARK THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEADLY INSURRECTION AT T US CAPITAL AND VISITING THE SOUTH CAROLINA CHURCH WHERE WHITE GUNMAN MASSACRE BLACK PARISSIONERS SEEKING TO PER CENT IN THE STARKEST POSSIBLE TERMS IN ELECTION HE ARGUES COULD DETERMINE THE FATE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS BASILY GON O TURN JANUARY SIXTH INTO A NATIONAL HOLIDAY SO THAT EVERYBODY HASTRUM M MBER HOW HORIBLE JANUARY SIX DAY AFTER DAY AFTER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT AMERICA MUST FIGHT AN TRUMP CAN'T BE PRESENT BECAUSE OF JANUARY SEX THAN EH SON SATURDAY JOBINE IS GOIN TO TRAVEL N THEIR VALLEY FORGE PENNSYLVANIA WHOR GEORGE WASHINGTON AND THE CONTINENTAL ARMY SPENTY BLEAK WINTER NEARLY TWO HNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO PRESUMABLY TO TALK ABOUT SPENDING A BLEAK WINTER THIS YEAR BUT IT WILL SWING IN TO A WONDROUS SUMMER UNDER A SECOND JOBIAN TERM THERE HE'S APPARENTLY GOING TO TO CRY DONALD TRUMP FOR THE RIOT BY A MOB OF HIS SUPPORTERS WHO OVERRAN THE CAPITAL SAYS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS AN ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN THE TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SO VALLEY FORGE SPEECH TO TALK ABOUT JANUARY SEKES I HEAR WHAT GEORGE WASERINGTON THE GOING GOING A ON A TRUMPINSRE AI TWO DAYS LATER THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO VISIT MOTHER A MANUAL AMY CHURCH IN CHARLESTON ORE NINE PEOPLE ORE SHOTT AN KILDIN AN JUNE TWENTY FIFTEEN WHITE WHO PREMISIS ATTACKNAM MA NOTE THE DAN ON THAT JUNE TWENTY FIFTEEN BEROKAMOMAL WIS STILL PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STAKES AND THE IDEA HE IS GOING TO SUGGEST HERE IS THAT DONALD TRUMPS FOLLOWERS ARE THE KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO MURDER BLACK PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH THAT IS WHAT HE IS GOIN TO DO IS CAN TO BE DISGUSTING AND IT'S NOT CON TO BE ANYTHING QUITE SHOCKING FROM JOBIN GIVEN THE FACTS THAT IS THE SAME GOY WHO ONG SUGGESTED AT MIT ROMNY WAS A VICIOUS RACOUS TO ONE ED TO REINSLAVE BLACK PEOPLE JOBIDON'S KICKING OFF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SAYS THE ASSOCIATE PRESSED BY DELDING INTO SOME OF THE COUNTRIES DARKEST MOMENS RATHER THAN AN UP BEAT AFFIRMATION OF HIS RECORD IS MEANT TO CLARIFY FOR VOTERS WHAT HIS TEEN SEES US THE STAKES OF NOVMEMBER SELECTION DURING BOTH EVENTS HE WILL CHARACTERIZE HIS PREDECESSOR AS A SERIOUS THREATS TO THE NATION'S FOUNDING PRINCIPLES ARGUING THAT TRUMP WHO'S BUILT A COMMANDING EARLY LEAD IN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WILL SEEK TO UNDERMINE YOU US DEMOCRACY SHOULD HE WIN A SECOND TERM THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK AT ALL IT'S NOT CON TO WORK BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING EVERYBODY KNOWS TRUM EVERYTHING IS BAKED INTO THAT CAKE EVERYTHING THE EGG SHELLS HOWIT SIRS BABY PUT LIKE EVERYTHING IS IN THE CAKE ALREADY EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY THINK OF THE CAKE SOME PEOPLE OVE THE CAKE SOME PEOPLE HATE THE CAKE NOBODY HAS NO OPINION ON THE CAKE EVERYONE NOTES THAT TRUMPS TWENTY TWENTY POST ELECTION ACTIVITIES EVEN IF THEY DESPISE THEM AND THINK THEY'RE REALLY BAD DIDN'T ACTUALLY CHANGE THE OUTCOM OF THE UCTION JOBIDON AFTER ALL IS THEY PRESDENT AND HAS BEEN THE PRESIDENT SINCE JANUAR OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHAT'S MORE THE PITCH THAT TRUMP IS MORE RACIST THAN BYN THAN HE SOMS FOMSCRIPTO WHITE SU PREMISIST THAT PITCH DOES NOT WORK JUST DOESN'T JOBIDON IS THE DE E I PRESIDENT HE TALKS ABOUT EQUITY INFUSEING ALL F HIS POLICIES HE TALKS ABOUT IT ALL THE TME SO THIS IDEA THAT TRUMP IS MORE RACIALLY POLERIZING THAN BIDON E THAT'S O THE POLLS ARE SHOWING THE PITCH THAT TRUMP IS A FACHIST ISN'T ON WORK EITHER BECAUSE HA'S EVEN GEORGE WILL A TRUMP OPPONENT OF HIG ARDER POINTS OUT QUOT JO BIDON IS LIKE TRUMP AN AUTHORITARIAN RECITIVIST MOSTLY STIM EAD BY CARDS THAT'S FROM A PERSON WHO REALLY REALLY REALLY DISLIKES ONAL TRUMP JGEORGE WILL SAYS QUOT INSTANCES OF TRUMPS ANTY CONSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOR HAVE BEEN AMPLY REPORTED IN PLORED BIDONS LESS SO ALTHOUGH THEY FOR EXAMPLE THE EVICTION MORE TORIUM THE BACENE MANDATE THE CANSILATION OF STUDENT DEBT ANJUDICIAL REPROMANDS OF THEM HAVE BEEN FREQUE IN AND THEN JEORGE WELL POINTS OUT THAT JOBIDEN HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO OVERRUN THE FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT BY BASICALLY A TEMEPTING TOA POINT TOMMODY THAT PERSON BEING REJECTED BY THE CENTITE WAND THEN IM WAITING FOR SOME SORT OF BRAK IN THE ACTION TO REAPOINT THAT SAME EXACT PERSON MOST OF ALL JOBIDEN'S HOPE THAT HATRED FOR TRUMP WILL SUN HOW SAVE HIM THAT'S PREDICATED ON ANOTHER FALSE IDEA AND THAT IDEA IS THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL JOG REPUBLICAN TURN OUT BUT HE WILL REALLY REALLY REALLY JOG AT DEMOCRATIC TURN OUT AND THAT'S NO AN ARGUABLE PROPOSITION THE TRUTH IS THAT IN EVERY ELECTION SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN DEMOCRATIC TURN OUT HAS BEEN UP BECAUSE OF TRUMP BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLAT IN ANY OF THOSE EXCEPT FOR TWENTY TWENTY WHAT IF THE NORMAL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION POLITICS LOOK MORE LIK TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY WHAT IF THE ACTUAL MOR IS THAT TRUMP DOESN'T T ACTUALLY DRIVE TURN OUT IN A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR IN THE WAY THE JOBIDIN HOPES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AFTER ALL TURN OUT WAS WELL WITHIN HISTORICAL MORMSSTWEN TRUMP RAN AGAINST TILLERY WHEN IT COMES TO TURN OUT AS A PER CENTAGE ELIGIBLE VOTERS HERE ARE THE NUMBERS BY ELECTIONS THIS IS THE PER CENTAGE TURN OUT OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS SOEN TWO THOUSAND I FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE PER CENT VERY VERY LOW TWO THOUSAND FOUR SIXTY POINT ONE PER CENT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SIXTY TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT PER CENT TWENTY SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE POINT TWO PER CENT IT'S A SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR SOMEWHARE IN THE BALL PARK OF BETWEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND SIXTY TWO PER CENT TWENTY TWENTY SIXTY SIX POINT NINE  PER CENT THAT IS A MASSIVE INCREASE AND ALSO A MASSIVE OUTLIER AND JOBIDN ONE INCREDIBLY NARROWLY BASED ON THAT MASSIVE OUTLAYING INCREASE IN VOTER TURN OUT TWENTY TWENTY SAW A VOTER TURN OUT INCREASE OF TWENTY THREE MILLION VOTERS TO A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION TOTAL VEA TOTAL VOTERS THAT IS A POSED TO ONE HUNDREDAND THIRTY SEVEN MILLION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION IN TWENTY TWELVE SO DO WE REALLY THINK T AT THAT NUMBERS CAN REPLICATES WE THINK WENGIN A HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION TOTAL VOTERS AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS I CAN LOOK MORE LIKE A HUNDREDAND FORTY MILLION VOTERS AND IF THERE IS A TWENTY MILLION VOTE GAP BETWEEN SAY TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IN THE NEGATIVE DIRECTION TWENTY MILLION FUR PEOPLE VOTE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAND TWENTY TWENTY WHO DO WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO HURT IF THOSE VOTERS DISAPPEAR THOSE MARGINAL VOTERS  WE THINK THOSE MARGINAL VOTERS WERE TRUM VOTERS OR BIDON VOTERS THE ANSWER AND TWENTY TWENTY WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY BIDON VOTERS BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC TURN OUT MACHINE WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY BECAUSE JOBIDON RELIED HEAVILY ON AN ON THE GROUND OPERATION MENTS IN ADVANCE OF THE ELECTION TO GET PEOPLE VOTE ABSENTY BALLAT THE CHANGING RULES BECAUS OF COVID MENT THAT JOBIDEN'S ENTIRE TURN OUT OPERATION WAS PREDICATED ON NOT VOTING N ELECTION DAY THAT IS WHY YOU SAW THAT BLUE SHIFT HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF ELECTIONNITE BECAUSE ALL OF THE INPERSON VOTES GOT COUNTED AND DON AL TRUMPTED REALLY WELL THE IN PERSON VOTES AND THEN ALL THE MALAND BALLATS ARE TO BE COUNT IT AND THEN JOBIDON OVERTOOK TRUMP IND ALL F THESE VARY ES STATES BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE NUMBER OF MAILAND BALLATS IS WAY WAY WAY LOWER BECAUSE PEOPLE ARN'T STAYING HOME BECAUS O COVET OR VOTING FROM HOME BECAUSE OF COVIT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T SHOOT ITSELF DIRECTLY IN THE LEG BY SUGGESTING THE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT VOTE FROM HOME WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MATH CHANGES IN OTHER WORDS NONE OF THESE FRENS ARE GOOD FOR JOBIDON WHICH MEANS THE BIDON IF YOU WANTS TO WHEN RE ELECTION IS GOING TO ACTUALLY HAFS O YOU KNO DO A GOOD JOB THE ONLY THING THAT COULD SAVE HIM WOULD BE YOU KNOW GOOD THINGS HAPPENING IN AMERICA BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM THE BIGGEST PROM FOR JOBIDE HIS POLICIES PREVENT EXACTLY THAT HE HAS NOT MADE THE COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE VERY FEW PEOPLE FEEL TAT THE COUNTRY IS BETTER RUN NOW THN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TAT'S AN EASY PITCH FOR TRUM TO MAKE IF HE CAN STAND PITCH IF FROM JUS SAYS OVER AND OVER AND OVER IS YOUR LIFE BETTER NOW OR WAS A BETTER IN TWENTY NINETEEN VIRTUALLY EVERY ONE THINGS THAT LIFE WAS BETTER LESS CHAOTIC LESS INSANE IN TWENTY NINETEEN YS EVEN INCLUDING THE TWEETS AND JUST ONE SECOND WE'LL TALK ABOUT JOBIDONS BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY HIS OWN LEFT AND WHY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING HIS

INCREASE THESE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE PROCESSING APPARATUS IN ORDER TWI ALOW IN MORE PEOPLE ILEGALLY WHICH IS WHAT YOUR BIDE WANTS TO DO BUT YOUR BIDE WANTS BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS YOU HAVE A HOSE IT WITH THE PIGET THI S PIGET RIGHT NOW IS VERY NARROW AND SO IT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THI HUGE BACKLOG OF HE LEGAL EMIGRANTS WHO HAVE NOT YET BEEN PROCESS THERRE TWO WAYSTOS SOLVE HIS PROBLEM ONE IS TO TURN OFF THE HOSE S THAT YOU ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A GIANT PIPE LINE OF PEOPLE TRYING GET ACROSS THE BORDER LEGALLY THE OTHER WAY IS TO OPEN UP THE SPIGOT WHICH IS TO SAY ALOW WE LEGLUMBRANS TO PORN O THE COUNTRY TIS WHIT'S LATLY ALAHANDRO MAYORCAS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAN SECURITY HAD WHICH IS SUCH AN OR WELLIAN NOTION THAT HE IS THE EAD OF DEPARTMEN PHOMELAND SECURITY WHAT HOMELAND SECURITY HAS ALAHAN DHRO MARCAS BEEN PROVIDING LIKE AT ALL CURY LAS YESTERDAY EXPLAINING THE HAVE A BACKLOG OF THREE MILLIAN CASES VAK BACKLOG IS A POWERFUL EXAMPLE OF HOW BROKEN OR IMIGRATION SYSTEM IS AND FOR HOW LONG IT HAS BEEN BROKEN BECAUS THATK BACKLOG EXISTED WHEN I WAS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAN SECURITYON TO THOUSAN NINE IT PRECEDED ME THEN AND IT PRECED  ME NOW WIN MY TENURE AS TA SECRETARIY OF HOMELAN SECURITY THAT THREE MILLION CASE BACKLOC HAS BEEN BUILDING THREE YEARS IN YEARSIIN YEARS IT GOT MUCH MUCH WORSE WHEN YOU AS CITIZEN SHIP IN IMIGRATION SYSTEM US A IF SERVICES THE AGENCEDED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAN SECURITY THAT AD MINISTERS OURE LEGAL IMIGRATION SYSTEM WAS FIND THE ANTIALLY GUTTED DURING THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AGAIN WHAT HE WANTS TO DO IS INCREASE THE PROCITING POWER HE DOES NOT ACTUA ONE TO CUT OFF THE FLOE IF YOU WANT ILEGAL MIGRATION COULD STOP IN EA TO CUT OFF THE FLOE BUT THT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY BY AN IMINISTRATION IS UNWILLING TO DO ACCORING O POLITICO SENDANT NEGOTIATORS ARE TRYING TO LAND BY PARTIZAN AGREEMENT ON POLICY TO HELP STEM THE FLOW OF MIGRATION AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE NOW CONSIDERING IN PEACHING MAORCUS AS THEY SHOULD BECAUSE HE IS NOT DOING HIS JOB MN YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE GUILTY OF ANY SORT OF CRIME TO BE CORNCUOTE IMPEACH WE FOUND THAT OUTWHEN DEMOCRAT'S IMPEACHEDONAL TRUM TWICE WHILE LLEGING NO ACTUAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY DURELECTION OF DUTY WOULD BE A BIG ONE FOR ALHANDER MAORCAS WHO HAS NOT SECURED THE BORDER IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM IT IS HILARIUS THAT SO MAYORCAS WAS ASKED WHY EXACTLY D YOU THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN THIS MASSIVE OUTBREAK OF ILEGAAMIGRATIONALLY WAY HIGHER THAN IT WAS DURING TRUMP WAYHIRER THAN WAS DURING A BOMA WHYSE THAT HAPPENING SO HE BLAMES CLIMATE CHANGE IN POVERTY WHICH ORE SYSTEMAC PROBLEMS IN THE NORTHERN TRINGLE AND LATIN AMERICA GENERALLY HE HE BLAMES THAT WHICH IS WEARD SINCE CLIMATE CHANGE ACCORDING TO LEFTS HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR DECADES AND POVERTY HAS BEEN IN DEMAC TO THIS REGION FOR AGAIN DECADES SO WHY NOW THE ANSWER BY THE WAY IS THAT EULEGAL MIGRANS WILL TELLYOU THEMSELVES JOBIDNOUS PRESIDENT THE'S LOTS OF IDIO OF PEOPLE CHANCING JOBIDON'S NAE AS THEY HAD FOR THE BORDER HERE'S ALAHAN DER MARCAS TRYING TO BLAME THIS ON SYSTEMAC FACTORS BY LET WHEN POLITICIANS TEND TO BLANCORNUOTES ASTOMAC FACTORS LIKE THUS USUALLY THAT'S A WAY OF THEM AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE HOW EXACTLY IS ANYONE SUPPOSED TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE OR POVERTY TO BLAMING THE MOON A MAN THE MOON KEEPS MAKING THIS HAPPEN HOW TO WE STOP IT WE CAN'T HE GAMPBLO UP THE MOON WHEN POLTITIONS DO TAT RETEEN WHAT THEIR REALLY SAYING IS WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THE THING WE WE KNOW WE SHOULD DO INSTEDRAGES CANNO BLAME THESE INDEMIC FACTORS HERE WEGOP SO WE

CONVERSATION WE HAVE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMANTE CHAGE POVERTY INCREASING LEVEL OF THERITARIANISM THE VERY MANY CHALLENGES THAT ARE AT THE RUTE CAUSE OF THE DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SO QUESTION WHY DOES THE CHARED FOR LEGAL MIGRATION LOOK LIKE THIS KA WHY IS ITS SPIKE WHEN JOBIDEN BECOMES PRESIDENT NO ONE THE BY ADMINSTRATIONS WILN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN THE ANSWERS PERFICATLY OBVIOUS IT'S BECAUSE JOBIDON IS SOFT ON I LEGAL MIGRATION AND HIS PARTY IS SOFT ON I LEGAL MIGRATION AND AGAIN THERE IN HOCTO LEFT WING ECAUS THERE'S NO REASON FOR THIS DEMOCRATS ON THE BORDER UNDERSTAND THAT WEAVING THE BOR WIDE OPEN IS TOTALLY INSANE ITS SETTILYS THIS TAS TO BE AN IDEOLOGICAL THING TRULY BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT EVEN LEBER FIRST DEMOCRATS PEOPLE HAR FOR UNIONS FOR EXAMPLE IT USED TO BE THERE ARE VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO LEGAL MIGRATION MIGRAL LABOR GENERALLY BECASE THEY BELIEVE YOU WAS UNDERCUTTNG THE WAGE BASE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT NOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS

UNLAWFUL ALIENS INSTRUMENTS OF TERRORS AN AR COTS AND OTHER CONTRABAND SO ALL LAWFUL ENTRIES THAT WOULD BE NOW THE GOAL OF OPERATIONAL CONTROL IT WULD REQUIRE THAT THE  CA CIPRATERRY TO EN CORPORATE PHYSICAL BARRIERS IN FOR STRUCTURES AND TECNOLOGIES TO CHIEVE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AN OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE US MEXICAL BORDER IT ULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME BORDER POTROL AGENTS TO AT LEAST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BILART THAT GIVES THE LIE TO THE IDEA THAT THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO INCREASE BORD PATROL AGENTS THEY DO THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHOARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN PROCESSING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FORMS AS OPPOSED TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE BORDER CATCHING THE GODAWAYS IT WOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF YOU US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION ERAN MARINE OPERATIONS RESOURCES TO TRANSPORT NON CITIZENS WHO ILL NOT BE DETAINS INTO THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR IN OTHERS WO SHOULD BE SPENDING FEDERAL DOLLARS TO BUST PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY THE  C B P IT WULD REQUIRE THE US BORE POTROL TO PUT TOGETHER A STRACEGIC PLAN BAY SEND IN FORMATION PROVIDED BY BORDER COMMUNITYE STATE HOLDERS LIKE HOSPITALS FARMERS RANCHERS PROPERTY OWNERS VICTIMS OF CRIMES AND OTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LEGAL IMIGRATION LIN ALL THE SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY REASONABLE IT WOULD ALSO RESTRICT ACCESS FOR ASYLUM I WULD RAISE THE INITIAL SCREENING STANDARD SO NON CITIZEN WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THEY WERE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT SO ULTIMATELY QUALIFY FOR ASYLUM TO CONTINUED PRURSUING THEIR PROTECTION CLAM AND NOT BE JUST KICKED OUT WHICH AGAIN WHY IS THAT WILD SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO COME TO THE BORDER AND JURSATLESSAN I NED ASYLUM AND THE LIKE WHY ISA IRNO I JUST DO IK WELL MAYBE ISICAL ONE PRESSANT CHANS THIS PERSONEEDS ASYLUM PROBLISH HOUL RELEASE THEM INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES OR SHOULD BY WHAT WE CALL IT PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVINENCS FIFTY ONE PRCENT SHOT YATRIGAN GET ASI LUM NOW WE SAY O KAFIN OU ON'T COME IN MAKE OR SYLUM CLAIM WILL LET YAN BECAUSE THE CHANCE ARE PETTY GOOD OARE GIN TO RECEIVE ASYLUM THAT IS A SMART POLICY THE DEMOCRATS OPPOSE IT WOULD BAN THE VAST MAJORITY OF ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM REQUESTING PROTECTION AT YUSBORDER IF THEY TRAVEL TROUGH A THIRD COUNTRY ON ROUT TO THE UNITED STATES AND HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN DENIED ASYLUM THERE BY THE AY THE'S THE SAME PALISIN MEXICO HOLDS TO THE BASIC IDEA HERE WOULD BE THAT IF YOU COME UP TO THE USBORDER AND YOU DID NOT REQUEST ASYLUM IN MEXICO FIRST YOU NED TO GO BACK TO MEXICO AND REQUEST ASYLUM THERE AND THEN IF THEY DENY THAT THEN YOU CAN COME TO THE UNITED STATES IN REQUEST ASYLUM BUT E SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LIKE PICKANCHOS OF THE BEST CONTRY JUST BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST COUNTRY IF YOU ARE TRULY REQUESTING ASYLUM MEANIG YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID THE WORST POSSIBLE CENAREA THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU AUTOMATIC ACCESS TO THE UNITED STATES IT WOULD RESTRICT ASYLUM CLAIMS GENERALLY TO MIGRING TO A RIVE IN THE U US AND OFFICIAL PORT OF ENTRY SEE CANTLIC GO BETWEEN THE BORDER CROSSINGS CROSS THE RAILGROUND RUN IN TO THE UNITED STATES AN INCLEMASYLUM YES AT SHOULD GO TO A BORDER CROSSING IN ORDERF US TO PROCESS YOU NORMALLY I NONE OF THIS SEEMS WILDLY CRAZY IT WOULD ALSO EXPLICITLY AND THE EXISTING PRESUMPTION AGAINST DATTAINING A NON CITIZEN CHILD THE COMPANY BY FAMILY MAKING IT EASIER FOR FAMILIS WITH MINOR CHILDREN TO BE HELD IN DETENTION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY BIG PROB ONE BIG PROBEMS IS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HOLD TH E E CHILD INDETENTION FACILITIES WITH FAMILY WHICH LEADS TO SEPARATIONS AT THE BORER BETWEEN CHILDREN AND PARENTS WHICH HAS THEN BEEN USED IS A LEVER TO RELEASE THE PARENTS TO NOW IT SAYING OCEWELL YOU KNOWT HOWBATLEYS KEEP THE FAMILIES TOGETHER WHICH AGEN MAKES SOME SENDS ITD REQUIRED TE ACH UST TO ACTUALLY REESTABLISH FAMILY DETENTION REQUIRING PARENTS AND KID TO ENTER TOGETHER WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION TO BE HELD TOGETHER INEMOGRATION DETENTION AND THEN SAY THAT THISATISFIES THE FLORA SETLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT FLORA SETTLEMENT WAS AN AGREEMENT COME TO BY THE CLENTN ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY WITH REGARD TO SNON SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES AGAIN ALL OF THIS IS PERFECTLY NORMAL AND ACTR A VISIT THE STUFF THE YOUR BION ISOPPOSING THIS STUFF CHUCK SUMER SOPPOSING SO MUCH OPPOSING BY THE WAY THAT THEY WOULD RATHER KILL YOU CRANAY THAN PASSIT THE BILL WOULD CRIMINALIZE OVERSTAYING A

NOT GOING TO WIN THIS RACE ON THE BASIS OF PEOPLE LIKE HIM BETTER THAN TRUMP AS A PERSON IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THIS TIME IT IS SIMPLY NOT THE PRECEPTION OF JOBIDON IS TOO BAD IT'S BEEN STAGNANT AND TERRIBLE SINCE THE F GANNISTON WITH DR ALL PEOPLE WO NOT PERCEIVE HIM AS THE KINDLY ELDERLY GENTLEMEN ANY MORE THAT'S WHAT HE RAN NAS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND NO ONE THINKS FHIM THAT WAY THEY THINK OF HIM AS SOMEWHAT VENAL SOMEWHAT CORRUPT CROCHUDY SOMEWHAT SEE NILE AND FAIRLY RATICAL ON POLICY THAT'S THE ACTUAL PERCEPTION OF JOBIDON SOYS GIN AND EAT A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEURE WLE THE FEDSCAN DO ITS BAST THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBVIOUSLY AS HISTORICALLY BEEN I THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO JOG THE ECONOMY JUST BEFORE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AS COUS ALWAY BACKTO THE NIXIN ADMINISTRATION WELL ACCORDING S THE BALLSTRY JOURNAL FEDERAL RESERVE OFFICIALS THOUGHT THERE WERE DONE RAISING IN TRESTRATESWHEN THEY DECIDED LAST MONTH TOLD THEM STUDY THE MINUTES O THE MEETINGS IDN'T REVEAL A MEANING FULL DEBATE ABOUT WHEN TO START LOWERING RATES WHELL NEARLY ALL OFFICIALS ANTICIPATED POLICY RATES TOREVENTUALLY BELOWERD BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR THE WRITTEN ACCOUNT OF THEIR DECEMBER TWELVTH TAN THIRTEENTH MEETING RELEASED ON WEDNESDAY UNDERS SCORD HEIGHTENED UN CERTAINTY OVER HOW TO NAVIGATE THE NEXT INTERVAL OF MONITARY POLICY AFTER THE MOST RAPID INCREASE IN INTREST RATES IN FOUR DECADES 'S THERE REALLY NOT SURE HOW MUCH THEYARE GOING TO REDUCE THE RATES A GUARAN YOU THER GONT TRY TO REDUCE THE RATES THIS YEAR BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO START TO STAGNATE IN FACT WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THAT ACCORDING TO AXIOS STEADY JOB POSTINGS COOL ER HIRING AND LESS QUITTING AFTER A RECORD SHATTERING STRETCH AMERIC AS ONCE REMARKABLE LABOR MARKET HAS SETTLED INTO A MORE NORMAL GROOVE THE RESULT IS SUFFICIENTLY COOL DEMAN IN WON'T STOK IN FLATION BUT A STILRO BUST ENOUGH FOR WORKERS WHO WANT A JOB TO FIND ONE OTHER TINES POINT TO A CONTINUED COOL DOWN AS THE YEAR CAME TO A CLOSE HIRING EASED SLIGHTLY TO FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION THAT'S THREE UDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND FURE HIRES THAN IN OCTOBER THE NUMBER OF QUITS WHICH IS HEMMANY PEOPLE ARE QUITTING THEIR JOB TO FIND ANOTHER JOP IS DOWN THREE POINT FELT DOWN TO THREE POINT FIVEMILLION THE SOUNT A HUDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND THIS IS BACK DOWN TO BELOW DE SEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN THIS THIS IS JUST THE EGINNING ECAUSE AGAIN WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN AT THE VERY BESTRYN TO GET A SLOW RECOVERY FROM HERE ON IT AS CAN A LOOK LIKE OBOMA NUMBERS THIS IS WHY THEN YOUR TIMES REPORTS THAT AUTO SALES ARE EXPECTED TO SLOW AFTER TWENTY TWENTY THREE EDMONS EXPECTS THE INDUSTRY TO SELL FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN AT MILLION VEHICLES THIS YEAR THOT AMOUNT TO ONLY A MODEST INCREASE FROM THE FIFTEEN POINT FIVE AT MILLIONS SOLD LAST YEAR THAT IS WHEN SALES JUMPED TWELVE PER CENT THE CREDIT SITUATION IS NOT GRATE FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE ALL OF THE INTRESTRATESER UP AND THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE BUYING LESS FOR YEARS PEOPLE TOK ADVANTAGE IT ZERO PERCENT LONES TO BUY VEHICLES EVEN AS THE PRICES CLIME BUT SUCH DEALS OFFERED BY AUTOMACEERSTO MOVE INVENTORY HAVE NEARLY TISAPPEARED IN THE WAKE OF THE FEDS RATE HEIGHES AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE NEW VEHICLE SAILES WITH ZERI PER CENT FINANCING ECCOUNT IF FOR JUST TWO POINT THREE PER CENT OF ALL SALES ACCORDING TO EDMON'S MONTHLY PAYMENTS ARE NOW AT NEAR RECORD HIVES AND AGAIN YOU HAVE A NATIONAL DEBT THAT IS COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL SO ARE WE LIKELY TO GET A BOOMING ECONOMY THIS YEAR YOU MIGHT AVOID A TECHNICAL RECESSION WHT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE S AN IMBEDDED INFLATION THAT CONTINUES TO BE WAYHIGHER THAN WHEN JOBINE TOOK OFFICE AGAIN EVEN IF INFLATION STOPPED TO DAY PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU BUY ISABOUT TWENTY PER CENT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT WAS WHEN JOBION TOOK OFFICE A DOLLAR IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE NOW WHAT YOU BUY FOR DOLLAR NOW COST YOU ONE EIGHTEEN ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT STATISTIC SO THAT'S A BAD NUMBER FOR JOBINDE AIND AS THE ECONOMY COOLS JOBINAS EN FILL THE BRUNT OF THAT A AGAIN HE'S BEEN DEFYING ECONOMIC GRAVITY BUT NOT REALLY INFLATION WAS THE ECONOMIC GRAVITY WHEN THE INTRESTRATES GO UP THE ECONOMY COOLS DOWN EVERYINES EXPECTING IT ITS NORMAL WHA YOU' EXPECT IS THAT JEROME POWEL BEFORE THE ELECTION PROBABLY DROPS THE ANTRESTRATES TO TRY TO JOB THE ECONOMY A LITTLE BIT IS THAT CON BE TOO LITTLE TO LATE PROBABLY GIVEN THE EFFECT THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT AGAIN ALL THE STUFF IS INBEDDED TIT'S NOT AS THOUGH WHEN WE SATE IN FLATION GOES DOWN THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU ARE PAYING GOES DOWN DEFLATION HAS NOT YET SET IN DEFLATION WOULD BE THINGS ARE LESS EXPENSIVE TO DAY THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY EVEN BEST CASE IN ARYOR TALKING ABOUT IT CONTINUED IN FLATION RATE OF TWO PER CENT WHICH WIT THE FUDDELERS ARE AIMS FOR THAT'S ON TOP OF THE ALREA E EMBEDDED SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT INCREASE THAT YOU SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION MEANWHILE THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE SHOCKS TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM ARE VERY VERY REAL SHIPPING IN THE RED SEA CONTINUES TO BE A COMPLETE DISASTER AREA AND WHAT THE POINT IS HAVING A MULTI MULTI TENS BILLIONS OF DOLLAR MILITARY IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP HOO THE PIRATES FROM STOPPING SHIPPING THROUGH THE RED SEA JOBIDONS INTERNATIONAL POLICIES CAN HAVE SOME DRAMATIC IMPACKS ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMYG ONE O THE BIG FACTORS IN PRICE INFLATION OVER THE COURSE OF LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS BEEN SUPPLY CHANBOTTLE NECT LEFT OVER FROM COVE THAT HAS BEEN A VERY REAL PHENOMENON IN THE ECONOMIC WORLD WHAT THAT WA'S DRIVEN BY GLOBA PANDEMIC AND SHUT DOWN SON PARTICULAR COUNTRIES LABOR SHORTICHES ANDALL THE REST WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE AGAIN A BUNCH OF RAGTAG PIRATES OR SHUTTING DOWN IN ENTIRE SHIPPING METHODOLOGY THAT LOWERS CAST FOR THE ENTIRE GLOBE ON PROTDUCTS RANGING FROM OIL TO CLOTHING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SHIPPING GOES THROUGH THE RED SEA AND YET HERE WE ARE TO DAY WITH THE U S AND ITS ALIES HAVING GIVE THE HOOTHES WARNINGS TAY YOU KNOW THAT COULDN'T PREVENTED BY THE UNITED STATES TAKING A VERY ANTI ERON POSITION FROM THE GETGO UNDER JOBIDE DONALD TRUMP HAD BASICALLY OSTERCIZED ERON FROM TE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THE HOOTHIES WERE LISTED AS A OU S A OU US LABELED TERRAST GROUP JOBIDON DELISTED THEM JOBDON DECIDED TO GO HARD ON THE SOUTIES HARD ON THE ISRAILIES EASY ON THE ARANIANS AND THE RESULT IS THIS THE RESULTS IS CASS IN TH MIDELEAST TOS THE TURNS OUT THE CASS ACTOR IN TE MDELEAST IS ERON IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ERON IT IS NOT SALY ARABIA IT IS NOT ISRAEL SIC'S VERY BAZAR T TE BIDADMINISTRATION IS NOW HAVING TO BACK FILL ALL OF THAT AND THE PROBALEM IS THAT WHEN YOU MAKE THOSE SORTS OF MISTAKES IT IS VERY HARD TO CONTAIN THE PROBLEM ON THE OTHER END WHEN YOU OPEN THAT CAN THE CANAS NOW OPEN I'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CLOTHES THAT CAN AND THAT IS YU ENHAVE TO BLOW UP SOME CRAP AMONG THE HOOTHIES AT THE VERY LEAST WE NOW THAT THE CANAS BEN OPEND AGAINST ISRAEL BY ARAN WITH OR GORT TO COMMAS ANCISBALA THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY TAT THE ONLY WAY T TO CLOSE THAT CAN IS GOFTER CUSBALLAW WHICH IS ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE FOR THE BI ADMINISTRATION JOBIN'S REELECT THAT FORT REQUIRES THERE TO BE SOME LEVEL OF CALM IN THE MIDDLE EAST RE ESTABLISH WHAT THEY'RE HOPING IT'S TO CONDAIN THE ISRAEL COMMAS ISSUE TWO ISRAEL AND COMMAS THAT ISBALLAD DOES NOT COME IN THE ONLY WAY THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS IF THE UNITED STATES MAKES VERY VERY CLEAR DOCUSBALLAW THAT IF CUS BALA GETS INVOLVE TE UNITED STATES FINISHES CUSBAW THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT WOULD BE IN JOBITONS POLITICAL INTEREST BECAUSE IF THAT WAR OPENS UP THAT'S VERY BAVRAGOBITON POLITICALLY SPEAKING IS BAD FOR THE WORLD BY THE WAY YOU DON'T WANT THIS BROADENING INTO A LARGE WAR ISRAEL DOES NOT WANT THAT PROBABLY ARON DOES NOT WANT THAT BEAUSE IT STARTS TA BROADER INTO A LARGER WAR THEN THE ARONY AN MOSR PROBABLY NOT IN LEADERSHIP AT THE END OF THAT DAY BUT WITH THAT SED A LITTLE BUT A STRENGTH RIGHT NOW WOULD GO A LONG WAY ACCORDING TO THE WALSTRETURNAL VHE US BRITANING KEYALLIES ISSUE BUT OFFICIALS DESCRIBED AS A FINAL WARTHING TO THE HOOTHE YEMINY REBEL GROUP LEND STATES TO

AR MORE POPCORN COLONELS AN EVENTUALLY EVENTUALLY IF THIS CONTINUES SOME ONE IN THE ARANIUN GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO AUTHORIZE A STRIKE AGAINST AN AMERICAN TARGET AND  SINK IN AMERICAN SHIP OR SOMETHING AND THEN  AMERICA IS GOING TO PUMMEL THEM THERE'S ONE WAY TO STOP THAT WHICH IS STOP THE POPCORN COLONELS FROM POPPING AN YOU CAN'T STOP THEM FROM POPPING SIMPLY BY APPEALING TO THEM TO STOP YOU'RE

WELCOME TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THEREIS ONE RULE IN AMERICAN POLITICS EVERY ONE EVENTUALLY GETS WHAT THEY DESERVE USUALLY IN THE FUNNIEST POSSIBLE WAY I WANT TO SHOW YOU MY FAVORITE PICTURE OF ALL TIME THIS PICTURE IS FROM AFTER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION WHEN DONALD TRUMP HAD JUST ONE THE WHITE HOUSE IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PICTURES EVER PRIVE MY PITE PICTUREEVER IS A PICTURE OF DONALD TRUMP GIVING THE TRUMP FINGER TO THE CAMERAS HOLDING UP HIS FINGER HE'S TALKING THE MEDIA YAM AND NEXT TO HIM IS BAROCKO BAMA LOOKING LIKE HE WANTS TO DIE BECAUSE BAROKOBAMA HAD A PERCEPTION OF HIMSELF THAT PERCEPTION WAS THAT HE WAS A WORLD CHANGING CHARACTER WHO HAD CHANGED THE NATURE OF AMERICAN POLITICS FOR EVER THAT HE WAS GENTEEL IN ORDER A LINCONUSK FIGURE AND IN FACT REFLECTING BAROCKABO AS FEELING IS A BUST OF ABRAHAM LINCON IN THE CORNER OF THE PICTURE DOWN CAST LOOKING AT THE GROUND SOLEMNLY AS DONALD TRUMP HOLDS UP HIS FINGER TO THE CAMERA WHY DO I SHOW YOU THIS PICTURE BECAUSE BAROCKO BAMA GOT EXACTLY WHAT HE DESERVE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN HERE HE WAS THIS SUPPOSIT WORLD HISTORICAL FIGURE IS AMAZING ORDER GEN TEEL SNAZZI AND HERE WAS THIS SUPPOSED THIRD RATE REALLESS STATE MOGAL SLASH T V HOST WHO IS TAKING HIS SPOT A PERSON WHO'D SUGGESTED THT HE WAS BORN IN KINYA EVERY ONE GETS WHAT THEY DESERVE IN POLITIC ILLRECLIN GOT AT THAT YEAR AS WELL WHILE THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR EVERYONE IS GOING TO GET WHAT THEY DESERVE NOW THAT'S BOTH GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS TWENTY TWENTY THREE FELL LIKE THE YEAR OF THE SET UP AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS GOING TO BE THE YEAR OF THE PUNCH LINE OR A LOT MORE DARKLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE FELLIKE ALL THE DOMINOS HAVE NOW BEEN SET UP AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS GOING TO SEE ALL THE DOMINOS FALL WATCHING COVERAGE OF NEW YEARS EVE WHOS HARD NOT TO FEEL THAT ALL THE CURTAINS ARE ABOUT TO BE PULLED BACK THAT WE'VE BEEN PRAPPT BY THE WARM UP ACT THE MAIN SHOW IS ABOUT TO BEGIN NOW HOVERING OVER TWENTY TWNTY FOUR IS OF COURSE THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION AND WE CAN ALL FEEL THE TENSION BUILDING I UNDERSTAND ITS JANUARY SECOND I UNDERSTAND THE'RE ELEVEN MONTHS UNTIL THE ELECTION THEN MATTER WE CAN ALL FEEL THE TENTION BUILDING UP RIGHT AND LEFT NOW THE LEFT BELIEVES THAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST BEATABLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE THEY'RE ASKING FOR EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT THEY WANT TRUMP AND THEY COULD GET TRUMP GOOD AND HARD THEY BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO BEA TRUMP IS TWOFULD FIRST DULOGENIMIZE HIM AS A HUMAN BEING SAY THAT HE'S A FACHEST SAY THAT HE IS A THREAT DEMOCRACY AND SECOND USE THE ACTUAL FORCE OF LAW AGAINST HIM THE FIRST PART DE HUMANIZING TRUMP IS A HUMAN BEING SUGGESTING THAT EVERONE WHO DISAGREES WITH YOU IS PART OF AN EVIL A GENDA YOU COULD SEE THE ENTERTAINMENT CHERICTERS SWING INTO ACTION ON THE NIGHT OF NEW YEARS EVE HERE WERE THE MORONS OVER AT GREEN DAY SINGING THEIR TERRIBLE SONG AMERICAN IDIOT WHICH SOMEHOW IS CATEGARIZED HIS PIECE MUSIC I DON'T KNOW WHY AND THE LEAD SINGER FOR GREENDAY HAS RETENELY CHANGED THE LEARICS IN ORDER TO TARGET THE RIGHT HERE IS THE LEADSING OR GREENDAY CHANGING THERK ONCE AGAIN ON NO PAN OF A MAGAGENDA NOW NO ONE WAS REALLY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT GREENDAYE WAS PART OF THE MAGA AGENDA BUT THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE NOW UNTIL LUSHON TO GET READY TO BE ANNOYED BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE LEFT IS ALSO GOING YOU ATTEMPT TO USE ALL MECHANISMS OF LAW TO GO AFTER TRUMP THIS IS NOT JUST TRUE OF THE VARIOUS PROSECUTIONS TAT ARE TAKING PLACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN GEORGIA IN NEW YORK IN WASHINGTON BE SEE IN FLORIDA IT'S ALSO TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO DEALEGITIMIZATION OF INSTITUTIONS THAT COULD STOP THEM FROM GOING AFTER TRUMP LEGALLY SPEAKING SO OVER THE COURSE OF LAST WEEK AND A HALF IT TURNS OUT THAT IN MAIN THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO TAKE DONALD TRUMP OFF THE BALLOT IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO TOOK HIM OFF THE BALLA AND COLORADO SUGGESTING THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF INSURRECTION THAT IS GOING TO GO TOTHE SUPREME COURT THE SUPREME COURT IS THEN GOING TO HAVE TO DETERMAN WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE BALLAT SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME STATE OF FICIAL BELIEVES THAT HE HAS COMMITTED CUONN QORT INSURRECTION DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE'S NEVER BEEN CONVICTED OR EVEN CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF INSURRECTION A PART OF THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO DEALEGITIMIZE THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF BECAUSE THREE OF THE JUSTICE IS ON THE SUPREME CORT REPOINTED BY DONALD TRUMPIN WHOS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND NOW DEMOCRATS ARE SUGGESTING THAT BASICALLY EVERY JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT WHO TRUMP EITHER APPOINTED OR WHO WAS APPOINTED BY A REPUBLICAN OUGHT TO BE RECUSED FROM ANY CASE DEALING WITH TRUMPS ACCESS TO THE BALLOT SO THEREFORE IF TRUMP IS NOT REMOVE FROM THE BALLOT THE UPREME COURT IS ILLEGITIMATE HERE IS JAMY RASKIN DOING THIS ROUTINE THE CONGRESS POERSON FROM MARYLAN SHOULD ANY EPICASTITIS ECON SOUTH I TI TAUSUP WELL AN FINALLY THI SUPREME COURT HAS DEVELOPES WHAT THEY'RE DESCRIBING AS A CODODATHICS IT'S NOT BINDING IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ANYONE ELSE THAT COULDHAVE GONE TO FOR EXEMPL CIRCUIT COURT JUSTICE IS YOU COULD CON STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ON A PANAL BUT SO THEY'RE THEY'RE DECIDING FOR THEMSELVES AGAIN WHETHER THEARE INVIOLATION OF THE CODODATHICS BUT I THINK ANYBODY LOOKING AT THIS IN ANY KIND OF DISPASSIONATE REASONABLE WAY WOULD SAY IF YOUR WIFE WAS INVOLVED IN THE BIG LIE IN CLAIMING THAT DONAL TRUMPADACTIONALLY ONE THE PRESIDENTUA LACTION HAD BEEN AGITATING FOR THAT IN PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO JANUARY SECS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE PARTICIPATING  E SHO HE ABSOLUTE SHUD RECUSE HIMSELF THE QUESTION IS WHATAR WE DO IF HE DOESN'T SO WHAT'S THE GOAL OF WHAT RASCAN IS SAYING HERE IT'S TO DEALEGITIMIZE THE SUPREME COURT TO DEALAGETIMISE CLARENCE THOMAS SO THE LEFT IN PURSUIT OF GETTING DOAL TRUMP IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT IF YOU VOTE FOR NONAL TRUMP ITS BECAUSE YOU'RE FASHIONS AND ALSO THEY'RE GOING TO YUSE ALL THE MECHA MECHANISMS O LAW TO TARGET DONALD TRUMP WHICH SOUNDS IN AWFUL LOT LIKE TYRANNY S THE BREAKING ALL THE SYSTEMS MEANWHILE THE RIGHT BELIEVES THERE IS NO WAY THET DONALD TRUMP OR ANY ONE ELSE CAN LOSE TO JOBIDON HELL MANY PEOPLE ON THE RGHT BELIEVE THE DONALD TRUM NEVER LOST TO JOBIDON IN THE FIRST PLACE IN TWENTY TWENTY WEL THAT'S BEING REINFORCED BY JOBIDONS MYRIADS GRUBS AND CLEARLY FATING MENTAL STATES TO AGAIN NEW YEARS EVE ALL THE

NEW  YORK O PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STRAITS UNDER AMERICAN CROSS RED CROSS BLANKETS JUST INSANE IN SAY AGAIN THIS IS THE COST A POLICY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS CAN BE THE YEAR WHERE ALL OF IT BECOMES PERFECTLY CLEAR NOT JUST BY THE WAY WITH REGARD TO LEGAL MIGRATION THAT JUST ONE OF JOBIDAN'S BAD POLICY DECISIONS THAT IS COMING TO FRUITION RIGHT NOW ALSO WITH REGARD TO THE ECONOMY SO EVERYBODY IS ALREADY WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY AH WE'VE ESCAPED TO THE PROCESSION AL WE'VE ESCAPED A OPRESSION WELL ALL WE'VE DONE IS WE HAVE TURNED THE POSSIBILITY OF A BRIEF SHOCK IN THE ECONOMY TAT WOULDHAVE HITBOTTAM AND THEN SKY ROCKET TOD BACK UP BASICALLY INTO A LONG TERM STAGNATING CYCLE IT S EXACTLY WAT HAPPENE UNER THE ABOMIN ADMINISTRATION THOU ABOMINADMINISTRATION HAD THE SLOWEST RECOVERY FROM AN ECONOMIC CRASH IN AMERICAN HISTORY EXTREMELY SLOW RATES ECONOMIC STAGNATION AND VERY HIGRATES THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE FROM THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE GROWTH CURVE THAT HAS BEEN CREATED WAS CREATED OFF THE BACK OF IN FLATIONARY POLICIES IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING BUSINESS IS ARE STARTING TO INVEST AGAIN BUT THERE STARTING TO INVEST ON THE BASIS THAT THEY THINK THAT TE FEDERAL RESERVE IS GOING TO CUT THE INTRESST RATES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR MAKING FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF EASY MONEY POLICIES THT THEY THINK IS GOING TO SPUR CONSUMER SPENDING WHISH BY THE WAY COULD SPUR INFLATION AGAIN WHICH IS WHY THERE MAY BE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE MARKETS AND BUSINESS IS AND WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVEIS ACTURONGAN TO DO JEROM PAWEL NOSE THAT IF HE ECTUARLY LOWERS THE INTRESTRATES THERE'S GOOD SHOT THT INFLATION KICK SPACK IN ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF BUSINESS SPENDING INTO THAT ECONOMY WILLGET IN TO THAT IN JUST ONE MOMENT FIRST THEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE BRATE NORMALLY ION'T GET ALOTISLEEP I SLEPT PRETTY WELL WHY WIL I DN'T HAVE TO GET UP IN THE MORNING TO DO THE SHELL BUT THAT

IT'S THE BEST OFFOR GET US ON CAN A LAST LONG THAT HELIC SLEEP DOT COMSLESH BEEN WITH ELICS BETTER SLEEP STARTS RIGHT NOW GAYE SOT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE IGNORING IT'S HOW MUCH OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH STATISTICS ARE TIDE INTO GOVERNMENT SPENDING ELICE A FINLY HAS VERY GOOD PIECE OVER AT THE WALSTER JOURNAL AND HERE'S WHAT SHE SAYS SHE SAYS DRILL INTO THE NATIONS THREE POINT SEVEN PER CENTS ON IMPLOYMENT RATE YOU'LL FIND A GROWING WELFARE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BENEATH THESE SEEMINGLY STRONGLABOR MARKET GOVERNMENT SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND HEALTH GARE ACCOUNT FOR FIFTY SIX PER CENTS OF THE TWO POINT IGHT MILLION NET NEW JOBS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND FOR NEARLY ALL GAINS IN BLUE STATES LIKE NEW YORK AND ILLINOIS REMEMBER GOVERNMENT SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND HEALTH GARE HOSE ARE ALL  GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS YORK CITY IS SPENDING THREE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR DOLLARS TO DAY TO HOUSE AND FEED EVERY LEGAL EMIGRAN WHOS COMING IN MANY AND FORMELLY POSH HOTELS THE CITY HAS MADE ITSELF A WELFARE MAGNET THE HOMELESS POPULATION CONTINUES TO SWELL AS WELL SO MANY OF THE STATISTICSTHAT WE ARE SEEING AND FROMS OF G D P ARE JOGED BY THE AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING THAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW SPENDING ON MEDICATE HAS GONE UP IF LEGALE MIGRATION BY THE WAY IN THIS VIEW POINT ACTUALLY HELPS THE ECONOMY BECAUSE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO INCREASE G D P WHY YOU ASE YOU BRING PEOPLE IN YOU SPEND A LOT OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES ON THEM AND THEN YOU COUNT THAT ALL AS PART OF G T P GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS PART OF THE GROWS DOMESTIC PRODUCT STATISTIC THATEVERYBODY LOVES TO USE AS FONLY POINTS OUT PRESENENT BYDE MORNE A MINUTE BUT HE HAS RE PUBLICAN STATES TO THANK FOR THE INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVE JOBS IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY THE ADMINISTRATIONS BET IS GOVERNMENT SPENDNG ON WELFARE AND ENTITLEMENTS CAN CONTINUE TO POWER THE OSE LABOR MARKET EVEN AS JOB WIT A MANUFACTURING TACT RETEL ANOTHER INDUSTRY FLAGS BUT SOCIAL MAKE WORK PROJECTS DON'T IMPROVE AMERICAN LIVING STANDARDS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE DISCONNECTS YOU SEE SO MANY AMERICANS WHO ARE UNHAPPY WIT THE ECONOMY AND DEMOCRATS LOOK IN THEM IS TO WYS SO UNHAPPY WITHTHE ECONOMY LOOK AT ARE AN IMPLEMENT RATE LOOK THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GOD G T P STATISTICS QUARTER ON QUARTER IN THE ANSWERY IS SINCE JOBIDON TOOK OFFICE THE AMERICAN DOLLAR ONE DOLLAR WOULD BUY YOU THE SAME THING IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT WOILL COST YOU ALMOS TO BUCK TWENTY TO BUY YOU NOW THAT IS A REAL INCREASE IN HOW MUCH THINGS COST IT MEANS YOU NEED MORE MONEY IN ORDER TO BUY THE SAME EXACT THINGS AND ALL OF THOSE GROWTH STATISTICS THAT ARE BEING JOG BY GOVERNMENT SPENDING WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'SCON COME DO ON THE OTHER END IN THE FORM OF EITHER HIRE TAXES OR AUSTERITY PROGRAMS THETE ARE VENTULLY ONTO COME DO WE HAVE SHRILLIANS OF DOLLARS AND UN PAID FEDERAL LIABILITIES AT THIS POIN THIS COUNTRY THOSE BILLS WILL COME DO AS WELL THE DIS CONNECT IS BETWEEN THE STAFFS AND HOW PEOPLE FEEL AND PEOPLE ARE NOT WRONG TO FEEL THE WAY THAT THEY DO WHEN THINGS COST THIS MUCH MORE MONEY MEANWHILE UN NATIONAL SECURITY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS CERTAINLY THE YEAR THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO COME DO ONE OF THINGS HAS COME TO COME DO IS THE EMPTYING OUT OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY WE DON'T HAVE NOG FORECRUITS FOR THE AMERICAN MILITARY AND THE ENTIRE STYLE OF RECRUITING FOR TE AMERICAN MILITARY IS TOTALLY OFF WIF SPENT IN THE WRONG PLACES WHEN IT COMES TO THE AMERICAN MILITARY WE STILL HAVET MOST POWERFUL MILITARY FORCE ON PLAN EARTH WE STOLL OF THE BEST FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE BUSINESS WHEN IT COMES TOTHE AMERICAN MILITARY WE SHALL BE EXTRAORDINARILY PROUD OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY IT IS ALLSO TRUE THAT THE UNITED STATES MILITARY HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A V T I ON CLAVE BY A LOT OF THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP PARTICULARLY UNDER THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION WHERE THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON HOW DO WE BASICALLY USE THE AUSPECIES OF THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER PRESS FORD ARE LEFT WINGAGE ENDA THIS IS MADE CLEAR OVER THE COURSE OF LAST WEEK BY A TRANS LIEUTENANT COLONEL NAMED BR FRAM WHO NOW SAYS AT A FORTUNE INK EVENT DRESSED IN THE MILITARY UNIFORM OF A WOMAN THIS DEMAND  SAYS INCLUSION IS A NATIONAL SECURITY IMPERATIVE AS THIS IS WHERE WE ARE PUTTING OUR FOCUS ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY IMPERIV IMPERATIVE OF MAKING MEN WHO BELIEVE THE WOMEN FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DILUSIONAL INCLUSION IS A NATIONAL SECURITY IMPERATIVE WE FIGHT TO DAY AND WEARE NO FIGHT IN THE FUTURE FUSING BRAIN POWER AND IF THAT BRAIN WHOSE GIN A REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE FIGHT AND FACE WE FIGHT AND SIBER JUST HAPPENS TO BE IN A TRANSPODY YOU SHOULD WANT THEM ALL SERVING ALONGSIDE ME AND FOR YOUR ORGANIZATIONS IT'S THE SAME WAY THOSE PERSPECTIVES THAT WE GET FROM A DIVERSE TAT OF INDIVIDUALS IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT ON STAGE A LOT REGARDING THE SCIENCE BEHIND HIGH PERFORMING TEAMS WE NEED THOSE PERSPECTIVES BUT IT'S INCLUSION THAT ACTUALLY DRIVES THAT WE NEED MORE MEN WHO BELIEVE THEIR WOMEN IN THEAMERICAN MILITARIES SI THE DRONES WORK OR SOME SUCH AN ALL OF THIS IS CONNECTED TO A BROADER JOBIDE AN MILITARY POLICY WHICH IS A POLICY OF APPEASEMEN IN RETREAT IN MANY PLACES OR THE VERY LEAST A POLICY A VASCILLATION AND WAVERING SO MY FRIEND THE HISTORIAN NAL FERGUSON HE HAD A A FASCINATING THREAD AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT WERE AMERICA STANDS RIGHT NOW HE SAYS FUTURE HISTORIANS ARE GOING TO MARVEL AT ALL THIS ITWIL SEEM OBVIOUS BY TWENTY THIRTY THREE F NOT SOONER THAT THE PACKS A MERICANA AT THE IDEA OF AN AMERICAN I GEMANY DOMINATING THE GLOBE FACED A WELL COORDINATED CHALLENGE FROM CHINA RUSSIA A ROUN AN NORTH CREATE IN THE EARLY TWENTY TWENTIES THE FIRST MOVE AS THE INVASION OF YOU CRANE THE SECOND WAS THE WAR OF RAN'S PROXIES AGAINST ISRAEL THE THIRD WILL MOST LIKELY THE A CHINESE CHALLENGE TO AMERICAN PREMISSY IN THE INDO PACIFIC PERHAPS IFGUSIAN PINGSBOLD A BLOCKADE OF TIWAN IF IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOR OUCRANE'S POSITION BECOMES SO VULNERABLE THAT ITS FORCES MUST WITHDRAW FROM SOME CONTESTED TERRITORY THREE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES WILL FOLLOW FIRST MORE REFUGE HES WILL FLOW FROM YOU CRANED EUROPE SECOND PRIVET INVESTORS WILL TAKE THEIR MONEY OUT OF YOU CRANE AND THIRD EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS WILL HAVE TO GET A LOT MORE SERIES ABOUT THEIR OWN DEFENCE SPENDING WITH ALL THE OBVIOUS POLITICAL HEADACHES THAT IMPLIES FORNADO IS A HOLD AT THREE POINT FIVE PER CENT OF G D PON DEFENCE SPENDING WOULD REQUIRE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR NEARLY TWICE THE AMOUNT ALL COUNTRIES HAVE PLEDGED TU CRANE SINCE LAST YEAR THE PACK MARICONNA SEEMS TO BE ENDING THE FATE OF OU CRANE OF ISRAEL OF TIWAN HANGS INTHE BALLANCE I CAN'T SAY I AM SUPPLY SURPRISE HE SAYS TIAS ALWAYS VERY LIKELY THE OVEREACH OF THE GLOBAL WARON TERR WOULD BE REQUITED IN THE S WAY WIT THE RESURGEONTS OF ISOLATIONISM AND TAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE THE BI DMINISTRATION NOW THE REALIST FOREIGN POLICY THE DONALTRUNT PURSUID WAS NOT IN FACT IN APPEASEMENT ORIENTED FOREIGN POLICY THE IDEA THAT EUROPE SHOULD PAY ITS OWN WAY WHEN IT COMES TO MILITARY SPENDING AT THE UNITED STATES WOULD STILL BE A MUSCULAR PLAYER IN THE WORLD WAS NOT A BAT IDEA FROM DONAL TRUM THE IDE OF GETING RIDNATO ENTIRELY WAS A BAD IDEA BUT THE IDEA THEN NATO SHOULD AV TO BE PAID FOR BY MANY OF OUR ALLIES WAS OF COURSE ENTIRELY TRUE THEY WERELYING ON US FOR YEARS TO PAY THE FREIGHT WHEN IT CAME TO THEIR MILITARY SPENDING THE PROBLEM IS JOBIDON CAME INTO OFFICE AN HIS STRATEGY HAS BASICALLY BEEN TO SAY BROAD THANES THAT DON'T MATERIALIZED IN THE WAY THAT HE WOULD LIKE THEM TO SO FOR EXAMPLE THEU CRANE WAR JOBIDE NEVER MADE CLEAR WHAT THE EXACT INTEREST WAS IN TNEW CRANE WAR LET SAY THE JOBIDON THE VERY OUTSET ID TIDLIZEN THE INTEREST IN NEU CRANE IS NOT TOREVERSE THE GANES THE RUSSIA MADE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BECAUSE THOSE ARE NOT REVERSIBLE AT ITS POINT GIVIN THE STATE OF THE WAR THE THE PURPOSERE IS TO REPELL ANY FUTURE RUSSIAN INVASION OF YOU CRANE AND WE WILL PROVIDE MILITARYES SUPPORT NECESSARY TO DO THAT EVEN IN PERPETUITY WED BE WILLING TO DO THAT WRIGHT NOW THE BROADSCOL PERCEPTION RUSSIA WOULD BE THE RUSSIA IS LOSING THE WAR BECASE THEY DID THEY TRIED TO INVADE YOU CRANE THEY WAST IT DIDN'T WORK THE UNITED STATES THROUGH IT'S PROXY IN NEW CRANE WAS ABLE TO COMPLETELY DEGRADE THE RUSSIAN ABILITY TO MAKE LARGE SCALE WAR IN NEU CRANE THAT IS A VICTORY FOR THE UNITED STATES AND YET SOMEHOW IT IS TURNED INTO A LOSS WHY ITC AUS JOBID NEVER ANTICIPATED AND NEVER ARTICULATED WHAT EXACTLY HIS GOAL WAS INSTEAD HE BASELY SAID ZYLENSKY WILL ESTABLISH THE GOAL OVER IN NEUCRANE AND ZYLENKY'S GOAL IS NOT THE UNITED STATES IS GOAL ZYLENSKY'S GOAL IS REPELL RUSSIA FROM THE DON BASS REGION FROM CRIMEA AN YET PUSHE THEM OUT OF ALL OF THOSE AREAS BUT THAT WAS NEVER REALISTIC THAT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN NO MATTER HOW MUCH MILITARY AID AMERICA PROVIDES UNLESS THE UNITED STATES IS GILLING TO START SENDING OVER AVE SIXTEENS IF THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THERE'S NO WAY TO BREAK THE BLOCKHEAA THE STRANGLE HOLD THT RUSSA HASS ON THOSE AREAS AND SO RIGHT NOW LADMERPUTES WATING OUT JOBIDON IT BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE CORRECTLY SAD WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS HERE AND JOBIDEN IS NOT ARTICULATING A PLAN NOW PUTEN IS SIMPLY WATING IT OUT SO OVER THE CORSE LAST WEEK PUTEN SAID THAT THEY ARE GOING TO INCREASE THE STRIKE SONYU CRANE PUTEN'S BAT ALL THE WAY LONG HERE HAS BEEN VERY SIMPLE I'M AN OUTLAST THE UNITED STATES THE HISTORY OF RUSSIAN WAR MAKING IS EXPEND WAG TOO MUCH MATERIAL AND WAG TOO MANY MEN IN PURSUIT OF A MILITARY GOAL BECAUSE THE HISTORY OF RUSSIAN MILITARY CONQUEST SAYS WE DON'T REALLY CARE VERY MUCH BOUTER ON CITIZENS AND WE ARE WILLING TO THROW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AT A PROBLEM GOING AL THE WAY BACK TO WORLD WORE ONE THE RUSSIANS WERE PERFECTLY ONE TO SACRIFICE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CHARGING FRONT THE LEAT BLOCKED

DURING THE WORLD WOR TO AND TH UNITED STATES JETTED FAR AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE AND THEN WE LIVE FAT ON THE LAND AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WE UNDER CUT OUR OWN MORAL CREDIBILITY BY GETTING RID OF ALL THE INTERMEDIATE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS E GOT RID CHURCHES WE GOT RID FAMILIES AN WE DECIDED WE COULD BE ATOMISTIC INDIVIDUALS WHO DIDN'TYOU HAVE TO DEVELOPE THEIR OWN SKILLS BECAUSE WE ARE SO FAT AND WE ARE

GENERATIONS FOR GENERATIONS DON'T WORE T WILLALWAYS BEIBL PAY FOR LATER WHELL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MIGHT BE TE YEAR THAT WE PAY FOR IT IT MIGHT BE THE YEAR THAT WE PAY FOR IT AS WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO AY FOR TO TUMPOINT NOW MEANWHILE IT IS FASCINATING TO WATCH AS THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES PLAY OUT SO RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK TO POLLING DATA DONAL TRUMP IS WELL AHEAD IN LITERALLY EVERY STATE IN IOWA THE LATEST RESULTS FROM THE POLLING DATA HAVE DONAL TRUMP UP OVER HIS OPPOSITION BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN THE REAL COR POLITICS PULLING AVERAGE AND IWA HAS DONALD TRUMP LEADING HIS OPPONENTS BY UP TO THIRTY POINTS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARIES TRUMP IS LEADING HIS OPPONENTS BI UPWARDS OF TWENTY POINTS IF TRUMP WIN TO IOWA IT MAY AS WELL BE ALL OVER BUT THE CRINE NOW REMEMBER IWAS CAUCAS STATE THE PRIMARIES TAKING PLACE ON THE FIFTEENTH OF THIS MONTH SO WE NOW HAVE ABOUT NOW A LITTLE UNDER TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE IWA CAUCASIS IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE PULLING RESULTS FROM IWA ORE NOT CAN BE REFLECT OF THE ACTUAL RESULTS BECUSE AGAIN IT'S VERY WEIRD SYSTEM THE WAY THE IWA CAUCASIS WORK IS THAT IF YOURE FIRST CHOICE DOES NOT MAKE THE RUN OFF THEN YOU CAN SWITCH TO YOUR SECOND CHOICE SO LET'SA YO VOTE FOR NICKY HALEY AND NICKY HALIISNS IN THE TOP TO ITS TRUMP FOR SISANTIS YOU GET YOUR SECOND CHOICE THAN FLIPS INTO PLAY SO IF YOU VOTED FOR HALIAN THEN TO SANTUS FOR EXAMPLE THEN YOUR VOTE WOULD MOVE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER IN TERMS OF TOP RESULT THERE'S THERE'S ALSUCH WEIRDNESSES TO THE COXES THAT DON'T REALLY EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER PRIMARYES SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT IF TRUMP WINS THE EYEWA COXES IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW EXACTLY HE DOESN'T WIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE NICKEY HALEY HAS BEEN MAKING SIMBOOBOOS AND BECAUSE CRIS CHRISTY IS STILL IN THE RACE IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME THAT CHRIS CHRISTY CONTINUES TO STICK AROUND CHRISTEN NEW NEW WHO IS THE GOVERNOR OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO'S BACKING NICKEY HALEY HE SAYS LIKE WHIS CHRISTEVEN IN THIS RACE I'M SO CONFUSED NICKEY HALEY IS THE FIRST FEBALL MINORITY GOVERNOR IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY SHE'S ONE THAT STOOD UP AND INSISTED DIDN'T TAKE COMPROMISES INSISTED THAT THE CONFEDERATE FLAG DEVERY MOVE FOR THE STATE HOUSE LAWN I DON'THINK ANY ONE'S QUESTIONING A HER CREDIBILITY IN CREDENTIALS WHEN IT COMES TO RACE AN EQUITY IN THE QUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY SO FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY KNOW IT SHE'S ABOUT IT IT'S ANON ISSU CRIS CHRISTY'S A FRIEND BUT HIS RACE IS THAT AN ABSOLUTE AND HE'S GET TO SAY ANYTHING IN CAN THIS OR TWO PERSON RACE FRIHT IT'S BETWEEN TRUMP AND NICKEE HALEY EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT HE KNOWS HIS VOTERS WHO WANTESTY TRUNP DEFEATED ARE ALL COMING OVER TO NICKEE HALEY A IN FACT THE ONLY PERSON THAT WANTS CHRIS CHRISTY TO STAY IN THE RACE IS DONAL TRUP RIGHT I MA THINK ABOUT THE IRONY OF THAT SO  THE FACT THAT HE CRISES OUT THEIR TRYING TO ATTACK OR TRYIG TO MAKE WAYS THAT THAT'S NOT SURPRISING ANAGAIN THEVE THESE PRIMARIES BY THE POLLING GET UP AND PULLS AN ELECTIONS THE'RE NOT PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVE AT THIS PLAINT THE FACT THE CHRIS CHRISTY IS STAYING IN HE HAS NO SHOT OF THE NOMINATION WHATSOEVER IS SO INSANE IF HE ACTUALLY DOESN'T LIKE DOWN TRUMPLEA HE SAYS HE DOESN'T STANGIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL BUT CRIS CHRISTY IS SUCH A CREATURE OF EGO IT IS ABSOLYE ASTONISHING OVER THE COURSO LAST WEEK NICKEY HAYLEY CAME IN FOR SOME SERIOUS CRITICISM WHILE WE ARE OFF THE AIR TBECAUSE SHO'S ASKED ABOUT THE CAUSES OF THE CIVIL WAR AND SHE GAVE THIS ANSWER THANK YOU MASER ANKKY ES  WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CIVIL WAR WELL DON'T COME WITH AN EASY CUESTIONAN AND TE I THINK THE CAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR WAS FASICALLY HOW GOVERNMENT WAS GOIN A RUN THE FREEDOMS AN WHAT PEOPLE COULDNI COULDN'T DO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR WAS AND NOW SHO'S RACKED UP AND DOWN FOR THIS NOW CAUSE THE CIVIL WAR WAS INDEED SLAVERY ALTHOUGH AT HEBEGINING OF E CIVIL WAR WLINCOLN SAID WAS NOT SLAVERY AN LINCOLN DID OPENLY SAY TOBEGANING THE CIVIL WAR THERE WAS ABOUT THE RETAINING THE UNION OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT IF HE COULD RETAIN THE UNION OF THE COUNTRY BY RETAINING SLAVERY HE WOULD DO IT SO SLAVERY WAS THE UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT DROVE A WADGE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE UNION OBVIOUSLY AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAD THE CONFEDERATE STATES THAT WER PROSLAVERY AND THE NORTHERN STATES THAT WERE NOT PROT SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR EFFECTIVELY ENDED WITH THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY WITH THAT SAID WHEN NICKIY HALEY IS SAYING IS SECOND DARILY CORRECT THAT YOU DID HAVE AN ARGUMENT THA WAS TAKING PLACE OR RETHE POWERS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FORS THE POWER OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND IN WHICH ABRAHAM LINCOLN MADE THE CASE THAT THES DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IS GUARANTEEDS OF LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PRURSUE OF HAPPINESS OUGHT TO BE EXTENDED TO EVERYONE WHO LIVED IN THE UNITED STATES AND SHOULD BE A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING OF COURSE WH LACK AMERICANS BUT THIS PROVIDED AN OPENING FOR EVERYBODY TO ATTACK NICKY HALEY WHICHWAS A BOOBOO THAT SHE COULD REALLY NOT AFORD SHE DID CLARIFY HER STATEMENT'SA LITTLE BELATER HERS WHAT SHEHAD TO SAY YOU KOW I'VE DONE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TOWN HALLS MORE THAN THAT NOW AND WE SAKE EVERY HAND WE ANSWER EVERY QUESTION AND I STAY UNTIL THE LAST PERSON LAVES AND WE TAKE QUESTHIONS FROM EVERYBODY REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS AN A PEN IT WHO EVER SHOWS UP WE DON'T SCRAIN THEM WE LET THEM AST WHATEVER THEY WANT AND WE HAD A QUESTION THERE AND YES OF COURSE THE FIRST THING I SHOULD HAVE SAID WITH SLAVERY I COMPLETELY AGRY WITH THAT AN' WHEN YOU GROW UP IN THE SOUTH FLAVERY IS A GIVEN LIKE WHEN YOU THINK OF THE CEVIL WOR YOU KNOW IT WAS ABOUT SLAVERY THAT'S NOT AU O THAT'S NEVER BEEN IN QUESTION AND AU DON'T YOU LOOK A FACT I'M A SOUTHERN GOVERNOR WHO ACTUALLY AST AND GOT THE CONFEDERTE QUIGE TO COME DOWN IN FRONT OF THE STATE HOLF IT AGAIN THE FACT THAT SHE HAD TO DEFEND HERSELF ON THIS THET DESINNRA BELIEVE THAT NIKEY HALYES LIKE PROE SLAVERYOR DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE CIVILAR OF COURSE NOT E SORT OF WEIRD QUESTIONS AND THE IT DOES MEAN GIN GIVE BAD ANSWER THERE SHE'D GIVE BAD ANSWER THERE AS SHE HAD A CLARIFY BUT IS ANY OF THIS CON A MATTER AT ALL PROBABLY NOT OTHER THINGSTHAT DON'T MATTER ANYTHING DONAL TRUM CESSOR DOS SY I'S BEN THE ENTIRE DYNAMIC O THE PRIMARIES IS THAT NO MATTER WHAT TRUMP DOES AND I THINK I'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY FOR EXAMPLE TO SANTOS SUPPORTERS ARE ALMOST BESIDE THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE SAYING WE'RE MORE CON SERVATIVE THAN EVERY THING DONALD TRUM SAYS HE IS FOR AND YET NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE THE BIG CASE OF THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST WEEK IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN CALLING FOR THE D FUNDING OF THE FPIBAS THE FPI OF COURSE HAS BEEN MILITRIZED AGAINST HIM IN A WIDE VARIETY OF WAYS WELL HE THEN SAID THAT HE WANTED A NEW FP HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON D C HE PUT OUT A STATEMENTS AND QUAT THE FA HEADQUARTER SHOULD NOT BE MOVED SO A FARAWAY LOCATION BUT SHOULD SAY RIGHT WHERE IT IS AND A NEW SPECTACULAR BUILDIN IN THE BEST LOCATION ON ARE NOW CRIME WRIDTEN AND FILTHY DIRTY GRAFET SCARRED CAPITAL THEY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN BRINGING BACK YOU SEE NOT RUNING AWAY FROM IT ESPECIALLY THE VIOLENT CRIME THERE WIS TALK ABOUT MOVING IT OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON D C FELLOW REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE WHAT THAT HELL LY AREN'T YOU T ONE HAS BEN RAILING AGAINST THE F BII GOVERNOR DO SANS IS SEP DONAL TRUMP FAILED TO DRAIN THE SWAMPS OR PERHAPS IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT HE IS SEEKING TO DEEP IN THE SWAMP BY BUILDING A MASS WO NO FBI BUILDING IN D C ACTUALLY DRAINING THE SWAMP REQUIRES TAKING POWER OUT OF D CE NOT COMMENCING POWER INSIDE D C NOW WHAT WOULD THAT SAID AS THAT CAN HAVE ANY IMPACT ON TRUMP OF COURSE NOT IS SON CAN HAVE T ANY IMPACT ON TRUM THIS WHY SAY THAT ONE COMES TO THE WENTY TWENTYS FOR ELECTION BASICALLY ONLY EXOGINOUS CIRCUMSTANCES ARE GOING TO CHANGE HOW THE ELECTION GOS EON HAS THER OPINION TRUMP BASES THER OPINION BIDIN THAT CKAN IT IS WHAT IT IS O AT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT

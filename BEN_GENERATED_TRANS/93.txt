STAGE WITH DONALD TRUMP ONE F THE REASONS DIS NOT GENG ON STAGE DONAL TRUMP OBVIOUSLY ISSES HEALTH HIS SINILITY ALL THE RESTVENT THE OTHER IS THAT DONALD TRUMP ACHALY WOULD PUMMELHIM ON THE HUNTER STUFF IN THIS TIME IT WOUL HAVE SOME TEETH LAST TIME JOGES LIED ABOUT IT LAST TIMEJO SAID MYSON NEVER DID ANYTHING WRONG HE NEVER HAD A RELATIONS WITH CHINA NOVERNER DOLLAR FROM CHINAS TRUMP WORN DOLLARS FROM TRUM ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN BLOWN UP  TRUMP WOULD HIT HIM WITH THE KITCHEN SINK IF TRUMP IS INDEED THE NOMINE AS EXPECTED SO THERE NOT CON BE ON STAGE TOGETHER BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THESE STORIES ARE GING TO GO AWAY SURROUNDING JO AND THE CHAO SURROUNDING JOE IS THE BIGGEST THREATS TO HIS POTENTIAL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR RUN HIS INTIRE CASE RGHT NOW IS THAT THE CHAO SURROUNDING TRUMP IS SO BAD THAT YOURE BETTER OFF WITH THE CHAOS YOU KNOW RATHER THAN THE OTHER CHAOS TOS A BATTLE OF CHAOSES AND SO ALL OF THE CHA SURROUNDING TRUMP AGAIN IS HIS BEST CASE THAT IS WHY ALL OF THESE TRIALS ARE GOING TO BE DAMAGING TO TRUMP THINKS JO BIDON AND HE DEMOCRATS THINK THAT NOW THE PROBLEM FOR THEM IS THT AGAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A WHILE NOW IF THE RILIAN A HIT TRUMP WITH ALL THESE TRIALS THEY SHULD AVEANNOUNCED ALL THESE TRIALS YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR THEY HID IT A LITTLE BUT EARLY AND THAT MEANS THAT EVEN WHILE THE TRIALS ARE GOING ON MOST AMERICAN TO ME LIKE  RESEEM THIS BEFORE NOW TRUMP FOR HIS PART HE HAS FILE MOTISE ON THURS DAY SAYING HE'S GOING TO APPEAL A D C SJUDGEIS RULING THAT HE'S NOT A MUNE FROM BEING CHARGED WITH FEDERAL CRIMES FOR HIS EFFORTS TO UNDO THE OUTCOME OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION THE NOTICE IS MINOR PROCEDRAL STEP ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST BUT IT SUT'S IN MOTION ONE OF THE MOST POTENTIALLY CONSEQUENTIAL PARTS OF TRUMPS LEGAL SAGA AS THE FIRST FORMER PRESIDENT TO BE CHARGE WITH CRIMES BECAUSE AGAIN THIS HAS MORNED WITH THE TIME LINE THAN TH ACTURAL OUTCOME OF THE CASE IF THE CASE IS DELAYED BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND IF TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENTHE CASE GOES AWAY HIS TRUMP PRESUM LU JUST PARDON HIMSELF OR THE DEOCE IS NOW RUN  BY TRUMP AND YOU'D EXPECT THAD THE CASE BASICALLY GETS TUMPED AT THE ALTAR WITH THAT SAD IF THE CASE GOES FORWARD TRUMS GN SPEND AN AWFUL OT OF TIME AN COURT AND HAS TRUMPETS POINTED OUT THESE CASES ARE A STRATCH THE ONLY ONE OF THESE CASES FILED AGAINST ONNAL TRUMP THAT HAS ANY LEGAL MERIT AT ALL IS THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CASE IN FLORIDA AND AGAIN HE'S MADE THE POLITICAL CASE THAT THAT IS IN FACT A POLITICAL PROSECUTION GIVEN THE FACT THAT APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WHO'S INVOLVED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ENDED UP WITH CLASSIFIED MATERIAL IN THE BASEMENT NOW THE COUNT SUR ARGUMENT TO THAT FROM THE PROSECUTORS GAN BE WELT YET AND THEN THEY ALL TURNED IT IN WHEN WE FOUND OUT ABOUT ERS SUPPOSE TO U YOUARE SHIFTING BOXES ANT ALL THET BUT IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS IT ALL JUST LOOKS LIKE ONE WALL OF SOUND ONE WALL SOUND DIRECTED AGAINST TRUMP SO IF THE IDEA TRUM THE BIDON ADMINISTRATION IS THAT

WORD CONDEMNING COMMASS BUT HERE'S THE THING CARE REMAINS A GO TO ORGANIZATION FOR BOTH THE LEFT WN MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS IN POLITICS IN MAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO COUNTER ACCUSATIONS OF ANTISEMITISM FROM INSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE WHITE HOUSE ORGANIZED A NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COUNTER AND TISEMITISM THAT STRATEGY INCLUDED A GROUP DEDICATED TO CROSS COMMUNITY SOLIDARITY AND THAT GROUP THIS ANTI ANTISEMITISM GROUP TO FIGHT ANTISEMITISM INCLUDED CARE WHICH THE WHITE HOUSE SAID WOULD QUOTE LAUNCHA TOURS TO EDUCATE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES ABOUT STEPS THEY CAN TAKE TO PROTECT THEIR HOUSES OF WORSHIP FROM HATE INCIDENTS SUCH AS INSTITUTING APPROPRIATE SECURITY MEASURES DEVELOPING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FAITH COMMUNITIES AND MAINTAINING OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH LOCAL LAW

UNIVERSITY SYSTEM CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH THE FACTS THAT THEY ARE FUNDED IN LARGE MEASURE NOT ONLY BY RADICAL LEFTUS WHO ACTUALLY LIKE COME OSS FOR EXAMPLE BUT ACTUALLY BY GOVERNMENTS LIKE THE GOVERNMENT OF CUTTAR SO CUTTAR HAS SPENT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES I MEAN IT LIKE HUNDREDS MILLIONS AND THIS HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED TO BE OBSCURED BY VARIOUS COLLEGE PRESIDENT'S BUTT THE REALITY IS THAT AGAIN CUTTAR WHICH IS VERY VERY FROM LY WITH ERON HAS GAIN HAS GAINED POWER AT A LOT OF THESE UNIVERSITIES THE REASON THAT THEY THEY GIVE MONEY TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES IS NOT BECAUSE THEY LOVE AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION IT'S BECAUSE THEY WISH TO DEDICATE FOR EXAMPLE MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES PROGRAMS TAT ARE STACKED TOF PROFESSORS WHO PROMOTE THE PRO ORON ANTI ISRAEL PRO RADICAL ISLAM POINT TOF VIEW COLUMBIA'S MIDDLESTERN STUDIES PROGRAM IS JUST THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS BUT GOVERNMENTS LIKE CUTTAR THEY GIVE HUNS OF MONEY TO THESE UNIVERSITIES THEY'RE ASKED ABOUT BEGWATT UNIVERSITY PRESENTS WERE ASKED ABOUT THIS AT THAT HEARING A COUPLE OF DAYS GO AN THEY PRETEND THAD THEY HAD NO CLUE HOW MUCH MONEY WAS ACTUALLY FLOWING IN BUT THE ANSWER IS LIKE NOT JUST HUNDREDS OF MILLINS DOLLARS OVER THE COURCE OF YEARS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN FLOWING INTO AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES IN ORDER TO AGAIN BY ACCESS OR TO PROP UP PEOPLE WHO THEY THINK AGREE WITH THEM ACCORDING TO WY NET NEWS THREE WEEKS AGO THE FLOW OF CATARI FUNS TO VARIOUS SOURCES DIDN'T CONCERN ANYONE MONEY WAS DELIVERED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION BUT SOME OF THAT MONEY WAS BEING DELIVERED TO ACADEMIA THE CATARI GOVERNMENTS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO IVYLEAGE AMERICAN COLLEGES YEARLY FORCING INSTITUTIONS TO ADAPT AND LA VIOLANT PROPALISINIAN PROTEST FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO THE FREE PRESS COTTAR AGAIN HAS BEEN SPENDING THONS OF MONEY IN THESE PLACES SO IT'S NOT A GIANT SHOCKE AT TESE UNIVERSITIES ARE FULLY IN LINE WITH THE NEEDS AND WANTS OF THE CATARIES ACCORDING TO A PIECE FROM ELI LAG OVER AT THE FHREE PRESTRUS LAST MONTH SINCE NINETEEN NINETY HAVEN COTTAR HAS DONATED MORE THAN A HUNDRED THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY FRA FINE ARTZ CAMPUS SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE COTTAR HAS DONATED ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO CORNAL FRO MEDICAL SCHOOL SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE COTTERHAS DONATED NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO TEXAS A N M FOR AN ENGINEERING CAMPUS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR COTTAR HAS DONATED SEVEN HNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CARNEGY MELLEGAN UNIVERSITY FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE CAMPUS SO OM AS HE LI LIKES US ONE MIGHT EXPECT THAT SCHOLARLY INSTITUTIONS THAT A BENEFITED FROM THIS AUTOCRASY'S MONEY WOULD RETHINK THEIR PARTNERSHIP AFTER COTAR'S FORN MINISTER SAID THAT ISRAEL ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAGROMUP PREPETRATED BY COMAS TERRIS OR AFTER COTTAR'S PRIME MINISTER HAS KEPT THE COMASS OFFICE OPEN IN ITS CAPITAL BOT TH UNIVERSITIES HAVE DECLINE TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT ABOUTUS AT ALL IN FACT HALLY BROWN SPOKESWORMEN FOR A TEX SAN MT HAD QUOTE MAINTAINING RELATIONSHIPS OF CONTRIES LIKE COTTAR SERVES A BROADER PURPOSE INCLUDING FOSTERING INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION TEXA A AN MS RELATIONSHIP OF COTERS FOCASON EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES I MEAN SO WY EXACTLY WOULD THEY BE DOING ALL OF US AGAIN THE REASON THERE DOING ALL THIS IS TO BUY ACCESS THAT IS WHY YOU DO IT OR TO PROMOTE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY PUSHING YOURYOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE ON THESE ISSUES ANDTH THE FACT THAT THAT THIS WAS CONSIDERED WILDLY NON CONTROVERSAL FOR TWENTY YEARS AS CANNOMON AMAZING AMAZING THING UNTIL TWENTING TWENTY ONE THE HIGHS PROFILE RECIPIENTS OF COTARI MONEY IN WASHINGTON D C WAS THE BROOKING INSTITUTION IN TWENTNY THIRTEEN IT RECEIVED A FOUR YEAR FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLEGRAN TELP FUND THE BROOKINGS  DOHACENTER BROOKINGS RECEIVES ANOTHER FOR YOUR GRANTS IN TWENTY SEVEN FROM COTAR BUT IN TWENTIN TWENTY ONE THE INSTITUTE ENDED ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DOHA CENTER CLAIMING WAS FOCASING ON THE FUTUR ON DIGIRAL AND GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT WHY EXACTLY WELL BECAUSE THE DOHACENTER CLOSING OVERLAPPED WITH AN FPIAI INVESTIGATION INTO RETIRED MARINE GENERAL JOHN ALLAN WHOSE PRESDENT BROOKINGS BETWEEN NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BECAUSE WHOSE ACTING IS AN UN REGISTER LOBBIUS FOR COTTAR SO AGAIN THESE UNIVERSITIES TERE'S A LAD A MONEY TIED UP IN THEIR LEFT WING A GENDA THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE TARTING TO SEE THIS AND PULL THEIR CASH ACCORDING TO ACIOS UNIVERSITY PENSYLVANIA DONERS WITH DRAWING A GIFTS WORTH ROUND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO PROTEST THE CHOOL'S RESPONSE T ANTISEMATISM ON CAMPUS THE FINAL STRAW FOR ROSTEVENS FOUNDER AND SO OF STONERIGE ASSAT MANAGEMENT WAS TUESDAY'S TESTIMONEY FROM PEN PRESIDENT LIZMC GILL SO HE'S PULLING HIS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THERE ARE THEREARE OTHER OUTLETS THERE ARE NOW TURNING AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN EXCELLENT WAYS FOR EXAMPLE SO THERE'S A GROUP CALLE PALANTEER PALANTEER IS NOW OPENING UP A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HIRING SLOTS TO SUDEN'S AFRAID OF ANTISEMITISM ON CAMPASAND WILL S TIRE YOU DIRECTLY OUT OF COLLEGE DURENG YOU HAE TO FINISH UP HER COLLEGE TO GREEN AP THE OWING OUT WANT FROM PALENTIER IS EXPAND THAT NOT ONLY TO JUSAFRAIDE OF ANTISEMITISM BUT TO EVERY ONE EVERYONE NEEDS TO START HIRING PEOPLE TO RECTLY OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHERE THEY WANT TO COLLEGE THESE COLLEGES ARE IN DOCTRINATION MILLS THAT ARE DESIGNED SPECIFICLLY TO RACK UP DAT AND ALSO TWO INDOCTRINATE YOUR KIDS INTO LEFT WING WORLD VIEWS THIS IS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD STOP COMPLYING WITH THE NONSENSE THAT THESE UNIVERSITIES ARE ARE SOMEHOW TRAINING AND HONING THE MINES OF THESE FOLKS ACCORDING TO MEDIAI RABBI DAVID WOLPY WHO I KNOW I'M FRIENDLY WITH WITH RABBIWOPI IS A VISITING SCHOLAR HARVARD'S VINY SCHOOL HE JUST RESIGNE FROM TH UNIVERSITY'S ANTI SEMTISM ADVISORY COMMITEE ON THURSDAY JUST TWO DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT CLODYAN GAZES CONTROVERSIONAL CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY EARLIER THIS WEEK WOLBE SAID AS OF TO DAY I'VE RESINED FROM THE ANTISEMETISM ADVISORY COMMITTE AT HARVAR WITHOUT REHASHING ALL THE OBVIOUS REASONS THAT A BEN ENDLESSLY ADUM BRATED ON LINE WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MEMBERS THE CMMITTEE THE SHORT EXPLANATION IS BOTH O VENSON CAMPUS AND THE PAINFULLY AN ADEQUATE TESTIMONY REINFORCE THE IDEA I CANNOT MAKE THE SORT OF DIFFERENCE THAT I HAD HOPED THAT OF COURSE IS EXACTLY RIGHTS THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT SO ITS TIME TO ABANDON THESE UNIVERSITIES IT'S VERY IMPORTNATURALLY THAT PEOPLE ABANDON THESE UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY ARE ANTI ISRAEL AND PRO RADICAL IS LOM IS IT THEYRE WILDLY LEFT WING THEY'VE EMBRACED IN INSTRSECTIONAL IDEA OF LIFE THAT IS DEEPLY DAMAGING TO THEAMERICAN BODY POLITIC I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR TWENTY YEARS PEOPLE NEED REMOVE THEIR MONEY FROM TESE UNIVERSITIES AND GLAD THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE FINALLY CATCHING ON TO ALL OF THAT MEANWHILE IN ISRAEL ISRAEL IS GAINING THE UPPER HAND IN SOUTHERN GOZA AS WELL ISRAEL IS TAKING OVER A MAJOR CITY IN HON IT'S CALLED CONUNUS WHICH IS LOCATED IN SOUTHERN GOZA MEANWHILE CMAS IS LITERALLY FIRING ROCKETS OUT OF CIVILIAN SET UP  ISRAEL SING UP CIVILIAN AIR IS WORE CIVILIANS CAN GO FOR SAFETY AND COMSS IS IMMEDIATELY INBETTING THERE AND THEN FIRING ROCKETS FROM THOSE PLACES SHOCKER BECAUS THIS IS WHAT THEY DO MEANWHILE EVEN PALSTINIANS ARE NOT TALKING OPENLY ABOUT HOW HUMANITARIAN AID BEING SENT IN THE GOSSIS BEING STOLEN BY COMMASSERS AN ELDERLY PALISTINIAN WOMAN SAYING THIS SAN ALGE ZERA AGAIN THE SHOCK IS NOT THAT SHE SAYING IS THE SHOCK IS THAT ALGE ZERA ALLOWD IT TO BE BROUGHDCASTS USUALLY ALGE ZERA AGAIN OWNED BY COTAR TRIES TO CUT THIS OFF AND TIDPHON WOOTED IN THIS A THE ADLIS THAT THAT IS SHOWED OWOGO NO ANGAL SAYS NOT ALL  CO HERE CAN NOT FIND ANYTHNG TO YEUTER DRINK SAYS EVERYBODY IS SUFFERING WE SAID THE SITUATION DIVICOLT ALL THAT NO AIGHT IS COMING SHOES ALL THE AID GOES TO THE TUNNEL'S HUNDERMEN IT DOES NOT REACH ALL THE NIVOT WE CAME IN FROM GOSA CITY ALL THE AID IS MEANT FOR OSIMI'M NOT AFRAID OF COMMASI'M TALKING O THEM AS WELL ALL THE AID REACHES THE GOZISRALEI WOSTA I E A LOT OF AIGT IS COMING IN IS BEING DISTRIBUTED THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY HAT'S THE REPORTER  AN SAYS NO COMMAS TAKES EVERYTHING TO THEIR HOMES THEY CAN TAKE ME SHOOT ME OR DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO ME AGAIN THIS IS WHAT ISRAEL HAS BEEN SAYING IS WHAT ISRAELS BEN SAYINGS THAT WE'RE SENDING IN AID AND THEN THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE COMMASS FIGHTERERS AN TERR STEAL IT AND THEN THE INTERNA TIONAL COMMENI BLAMES ISRAEL FOR NOT SENTIN ENOUGH ADE WHICH COMMASS THEN STEALS AND MEANWHILE THE METIA RE DOING COMASSIS WORK SO YESTERDAY ISRAEL RELEASED PHOTOS OF ISRAEL IS RAILLY SOLDIERS WHO HAD ARRESTED AND DETAINED A BUNCH OF COMAS TERRAS WHO HAD SURRENDERD AND PHOTOS WERE RELEASED OF THE SURRENDER NATURALLY SEEAN THEN TREATED THIS AS THOUGH THIS WAS TERRIBLE AND EVIL APPARENTLY IN INTRUCING THE SAGMENT SIAN ENDS PHILLMATTINGALLY OPEN WITH NEW AND DISGUSTING IMAGES THIS MORNING SHOWING THE IS REALLY MILITARY DETAINING DOZENS OF MEN AND GOZASEEN STRIPP DOWNS THEIR UNDERWAR WELL ACTUALLY IT TURNS OUT THAT TOM THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL COMMASS MEMBERS THEY WRE STRIPPED TO THEIR UNDERWARE BECAUSE AGAIN THEY MIGHT HAVE BOMBS ON THEM THEY MIGHT HAVE BOMS ON THEM THE THE NOTION THAT ISRAEL IS STRIPPING RANDOS DOWN TO THEIR UNDERWARER FOR NO REASON AN JUSTARESTING THEM IS SILLY BUT OF COURSE THE META ARE DOING THE WORK OF E COMMASS IS WHAT THEY ALL THE TIME THE U ON BY HEWAY ALSO DOING THE WORK OF COMMAS SO THE UNITED NATIONS WHICH IS THE MOST DISCUSTING ORGANIZATION ON PLANT ARE TRULY AN AWFUL ORGANIZATION THE UUN SECURITY COUNCIL IS EXPECTED TO MEET TO DAY TO DISCUSS THE WAR ON GOZ AFTER SECRETARY GENERAL ON CONIO GUTETES IN A RARE MOO FORMELLY URGED THE FIFTEEN MEMBER COUNCIL TO USE ALL ITS INFLUENCE TO PREVENT A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE IN THE ONCLAVE BUTERRAS HAS IN VOKED ARTICLE NINETY NINE OF THE UAN CHARTER SINCE BEING APPOINTED IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S DONE THAT THE RULE ALOWS THE ON LEADER TO BRING ANY MATTER HE BELIEVES THREATENS INTERNATIONAL PIECE AND SECURITY TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL OOOO OO I INVOKE ARTICLE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX OFE SHOT THE FOKGOPYA MORON AND LIKE THAT THA THIS THIS RIDICULOUS NONSENSE WHERE WHERE GUTERRES SPENDS HIS DAYS DOING THE WORK OF COMMASS IS IS JUST AMAZING IN THE FACT THAT AYONE TAKES THE UAN SERIOUSLY IS RIDICULOUS AS ALY CON THE FORN MINISTER OF ISRAEL SAYS GUTENRIS IS TEN YEARS DANGERED WORLD BEES HIS REQUEST TO ACTIVATE ARTICLE NINETY NINE AND THE CALL FOR A SEASEFIRE AND GOZIC CONSTITUTES SUPPORTS OF KMMASS AND INDORSEMEN OF THE MURDER OF THE ELDERLY THE OBDUCTION OF BABIES IN THE RAPE OF WOMEN ANY ONE WHO SUPPORTS WORLD PIECE MUST SUPPORT THE LIBERATION OF GOZA FROM COMMASS THAT OBVIOUSLY IS STRUE THE MATTER WHETHER IT'S TRUE ER NOUTHTHE YOUONE IS A TERRIBLE GROSST PLACE SO THAT'S NO SHOCK AT ALL MEANWHILE THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION IS STARTING TO RECOGNIZE FROM THE TON BOOBOOS SO ONE OFTHOSE BOBAS BY THE WAY AS WHEN THE BYDADMINISTRATION CAME INTO POWER THEY IMMEDIATELY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO D LIST THE HOUTHIES IN ARE ONNIAN BACK TERRO GROUP AN YEMEN AS A

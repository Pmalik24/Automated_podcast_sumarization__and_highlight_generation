FORBID HE FALLS OFF THE TIGHT ROPE AND YESTERDAY JOBIDON DIDN'T JUST FALL OFF THE TIGHT ROPE HE JUMPED OFF THE TIGHT ROPE DIRECTLY INTO THE POLITICAL VOLCANO NOW AGAIN ALL THIS BEGAN WITH THIS USUAL

YOU FORGET WHERE YOU'R PHONE IS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE CAN'T BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEN YESTERDAY AND HD MET'L LAUGH OF THE AFTERNOON HE SPECIAL COUNCIL REPORT ONJOBIDONS MIS HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS BRAKES AND THERE TWO HEADLINES FROM THE REPORT ONE OF THE HEADLINES IS THAT JOBIDIN IS QUOTE UN QUOTE EXONERATED NOW THAT HEADLINE BARIES A LAW OF MISUSE OF CLASSIFIED MATERIALS WE CAN GO THROUGH THE WHOLE REPORT BUT THE BIG HEADLINE IS THAT THE REAL REASON THAT THEY ARE NOT ACTIVELY GOING TO PROSECUTE JOBIDON FOM MIS HANDLING CLASSIFIED MATERIALS IS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE HIS SENILE OLD MAN SO LET'S GO THROUGH THE REPORT IN ALL OF ITS DETAIL MHEN WE'LL GET TO WHAT AGAIN IS THE HINDENBERG OF PRESIDENTIAL PRESS CONFERENCES OE THE HUMANITY I MEAN JOBIDON SET HIMSELF ALMOST ON LITERAL FIRE YESTERDAY WE GETS T MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST WE WOULDN'T BE ONE OF AMERICA'S FASTISTS GROWING MEDIALITS WITHOUT PARTNERS LIKE STAMP STOT COM SERIOUSLY IF WE

SEND WEN AN DIVIDED UP INTO A FEW PARTEERS GET ALL THE DETAILS CAUSE THIS PRETTY IMPORTANT SO FIRST YES JO BIDIN DID KEEP CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CLEARLY THERE WARE CLASSIFIED MATERIALS THAT WERE IN HIS POSSESSION BUT SAYS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WERE NOT ON A PROSECUTE HIM QUOTE WE CONCLUDE NO CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE WARRNTED IN THIS MATTER WE WOULD REACH THE SAME CONCLUSION EVEN IF TO PARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICY DID NOT FORE CLOSHES CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THE SITTING PRESIDENT OUR IN VESTIGATION ON COVERED EVIDENCE THAT PRESINETENT BITON WILFULLY RETAINED AND DISCLOSED CLASSIFIED MATERIALS AFTER HIS VICE PRESIDENCY WHEN HE WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN THESE MATERIALS INCLUDED ONE MARKED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS ABOUT MILITARY AND FOREIGN POLICY IN EFFGANISTAM AND TWO  NOTEBOOKS CONTAINING MISTER BIDON'S HAND WRITTEN ENTRIES ABOUT ISSUES OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY IMPLICATING SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS AFTHE  AGENTS RECOVERED THESE MATERIALS FROM THE GARRASH OFFICES AND BASEMENT AND IN MISTER BIDN'S WILMINGTON DELAWARE HOME HOWEVER FOR THE REASONS SUNRISE BELOW WE CAN CLUDE THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISHES MISTER BIDIN'S GILT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT NOW WHAT EXACTLY DID BIDN HAVE IN HIS POSSESSION APPARENTLY HE HAD DOCUMENTS FROM FALL TO THOUSAND NINE THAT HAD CLASSIFICATION MARKINGS UP TO TOP SECRET SENSED F  COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION LEVEL THOSE WERE FOUNDS IN A BOX IN BIDON'S DELAWARE GERAGE THAT CONTAINED OTHER MATERIALS OF GREAT PERSONAL SIGNIFICANCE TO HIM AND THAT HE APPEARS TO A PERSONALLY USED AND ACCESS AS WELL THESE MATERIALS WERE MOSTLY PROOF OF A STAN THAT MISTER BIDON TOOK THAT HE REGARDED AS VERY IMPORTANT WHICH WAS ALL ABOUT HOW HE WAS PUSHING BORAKOBAMA TO BE YS PULLFULL SCALE OUT OF AFGANNISTON WHICH OF COURSE JOBID THEN DID AS PRESIDENT WHEN HE BECAME PRESIDENT IN THE MOST ASASTRAS FASHION IN AMERICAN HISTORY NOW THE REPORT CONTINUES AND HE SAID AND AN THE SPECIAL COUNCIL SAYS THAT JOBIDEN CERTAINLY KNEW THIS WAS A LEGAL OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS I LEGAL TO KEEP THESE CLASSIFIED MATERIALS AND THE REPORT READS A LOT LIKE THE HILLERY CLINTON REPORT THAT EVENTUALLY EXONERATED HER FROM JAMES COMEY BUSILY SAYING SHE WAS GUILTY BUGHT IT'S TO WHAT THIS THIS REPORT REALLY IS IS HE'S GUILTY OF MISS HANDLLING CLASSIFIED MATERIALS BUT SO JOBIDO SHOLD HAVE NOWN THIS WAS A LEGAL ACCORDING TO THE SPECIAL COUNCIL ROBERT HER SOME EVIDENCE  SUGGESTS MISTER BID NEW HE COULD NOT KEEP CLASSIFIED HANDWRITTEN NOTES AT HOME AFTER LEAVING OFFICE BIDON HO HAD DECADES OF EXPERIENCE OF LASSIFIED INFORMATION WAS DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH THE MESSURES TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD CLSSIFIED INFORMATION AND THE NEED FOR THOSE MEASURES TO PREVENT HARM TO NATIONAL SECURITY IN FACT TWICE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN JOBIDON VISITED THE NATIONAL ARCHIVE SKIFF TO REVIEW HIS CLASSIFIED NOTE CLARS WHELE WRITING HIS BOOK TUT HE KEPT HIS NOTE BOOKS WHICH ALSO CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN UNLOCKED DRAWERS AT HOME HE HAD STRONG MOTIVATIONS TO DO SO AND TO IGNORE THE RULES WERE PROPERLY HANDLING THE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN HIS NOTE BOOKS HE CONSULTED THOSE NOTE BOOKS LIBERALLY DURING HOURS OF DIS CUSSIONS WITH HIS GHOST WRITER AND VIEWED THEM AS HIGHLY CRIVATE AND VALUED POSSESSIONS WITH WHICH HE WAS UNWILLING TO PART IN FACT WELE READING ALOUD FROM HIS NOTEBOOK AND IS THE MOST DAMNING PART WELE READING ALOUD FROM HIS NOTE BOOK MISTER BID ENLISTED FOUR POINTS HE MADE ABOUT THE AROCK SETUATION DURING AJULY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND FIFTY MEETING BIDN EXPLAINED TO HIS GHOST WRITER OR PERSON IN MARK'S WANITSZER THAT HE HAD MADE HIS SIMILAR ARGUMENT YEARS EARLIER DURING THE TWOT THASS AN NINE D ABATE ABOUT THE TROOP SURGE IN AFGANNISTAN BIDON TOLD'S WANITTER HE HAD SENT OBAMA A FORTY PAGE HANDWRITEN MEMOL ARGUING AGAINST THE EMPLOYMEN OF ADDITIONAL TROOPS IN NAFGANNISTAN MID SENTENCE DURING THE INTERVIEW BIDON SAID IN A MATTER OF FAST TONE THAT HE HAD QUOTE JUST FOUND TO ALL THE CLASSIFIED STUFF DOWNSTAIRS SO AGAIN FIRST RULE OF CRIMING FOLKS DON'T DO IT ON TAPE JOBIDON DID IT ON TAPE HE HAD MITS FULL SCALE ON THE TAPE IN HIS WORDS THAT HE QUOTE JUST FOUND ALL THE CLASSIFIED STUFF DOWNSTAIRS AWHICH IS HIM ADMITTING THAT HE HASIFCLASSIFIED STUFF AND IT IS DOWNSTAIRS IT IS NO DIFFERENCE THEN DONALD TRUMP RAGGING TO A REPORTER THAT HE HAD IN FRONT OF THEM A CLASSIFIED SET OF DOCUMENTS ALL ABOUT ORON FOR EXAMPLE IS IS THE SAME THINGS AS I HAVE I JUST FOUND ALL THE CLASSIFIED STUFF DOWNSTAIRS N THAT SHOUL BE OPEN AND SHUT CASE OF VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL LAW WHEN A COMES TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND MISHANDLING THEREOF AND AS WE SEE ARE ARE POLITICAL BOSS IS IN THIS COUNTRY THEY GET TREATMENT THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD RECEIVE WHEN MY WIFE DOCTOR WAS WORKING AT VETERAN'S AFFAIRS IF SHE HAD WALKED OUT OF THE VETERAN'S AFFAIRS BUILDING I WHENCHRAS IN RESIDENCY WITH BIOLATIONS OF HIPPOT MATERIAL SHELD OULDHAVE EEN PROSECUTED JOBIDON IS BRAGGING TO HIS GHOST WRITERS THAT HE HAS CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN HIS CABINET DOWNSTAIRS ON TAPE AND THE STILL DIDN'N PROSECUTE HIM THE SPECIAL COUNCIL FOUND THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT AFTER HIS VICE PRESIDENCY BIDON WILFULLY RETAINED MARKED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS BAT AFGANNISTAN AND UNMARK CLASSIFIED HANDWRITTEN NOTES IN HIS NOTE BOKS BOTH OF WHICH HE STORED IN UNSECURED PLACES IN HIS HOUTS AND IT'S CLEARLY B IDON'S MATERIAL IS NOT AS THOUGH GOT MIXED IN AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE IS CAN OFUNNY HE WROTE ON ONE OF THE FOLDERS AFGANISTAN BUT HE SPELLED FGANISTAN WITHOUT THE AGE MEMBER THIS THIS A CAPTAIN BRILLIANTS OVER HERE HE CAN'T SPELL THE WORD AFANASTAND BUT E KNOWS ALL ABOUT AFGANISTAN POLICY ACCORDING TO THE SPECIAL COUNCIL MISTER BIDN SAID THE HANDWRITTEN LABEL ON THE FOLDER LOOKS LIKE HIS HANDWRITING THE DISTINCTIVE MISS SPELLING OF AFGANISTAN CON FIRMS THIS BIDON REPEATEDLY USED THIS OR A SIMILAR MISTS PELLING IN HANDWRITTEN NOTES AS VICE PRESIDENT AND BEFORE THAT NOTES HE TOOK A SENATOR DATING BACTINACTIATY SO AGAN I MAN LET LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS JOBIDON WAS NEVER ANY INTELLECTUAL BRACCHAKES THE FACT HTHE'S BEEN MISPELLING THE WORD AFGANISTAN FOR LITERALLY FORTY YEARS IS KIND OF AMAZING REA SO THE SPECIAL  COUNCIL THEN FINDS A SERIES OF EXCUSES FOR WHY JOBIDON SHOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED SO NUMBER ONE THE SPECIAL COUNCIL SAYS WE EXPECT BIDONS DEFENCE AT TRIAL WOULD BE HE THOUGHT THAT HIS NOTEBOOKS WERE PERSONAL PROPERTY IN WHO WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE THEM HOME EVEN IF THEY CONTAINED CLASSIFIED IN FORMATION DURING OUR INTERVIEW OF HIM THAT MISTER BDON WAS EMPHATIC TO CLARING HIS NOTEBOOKS ARE QUOTE MY PROPERTY AND EVERY PRESEN BEFORE ME HAS DONE THE EXACSAM THING A NOW THAT SOUNDS LOT LIKE PRESID IN TRUMP FRANKLY PRESIDEN TRUMP HAS BEEN CLAMING OVER AND OVER AND OVER THAT EVERY DOCUMENT IN HIS POSSESSION IS MINE AND THAT'S ACTULY BEEN THE REAL EXCUSE IT'S NOT AS THOUGH HE WAS GOING TO DISSEMINATE DOCUMENTS TO THE RUSSIANS OR SOMETHING HIS IK THESE ARE MY DOCUMENTS I'M CAPE THAT EMIN'S EXACTLY ABIDNA SAYING EXCEPT BIDASIN HERHORNARCES  SO THAT EXCUSE FOR NOT PROSECUTING BIDON LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE DEFENDS THAT DONAL TRUMP IS GOING TO USE IN HIS ONE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS MISHANDLING CASE FURTHERMORE THE PLACE WHERE BIDON WAS STORING THIS STUFF NOT EXACTLY THE MOST SECURE LOCATION QUOTE WE EXPECT MANY JURS TO BE STRUCK BY THE PLACE WHERE THE AFGANNISTANSDOCUMENTS WERE ULTIMATELY FOUND IN BIDONS DELAWARE HOME AND A BADLY DAMAGE BOX IN THE GARAGE NEAR A COLLAPSED DOG CRATE A DOG BED A ZAPBOTES BOX AND EMPTY BUCKET A BROKEN LAMP RAPED WITH DUCKTAP POTTING SOIL AND SYNTHATIC FIREWOOD SO CLEARLY HANDLING CLASSIFIED MATERIALS IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE HANDLED NOW THE SPECIAL COUNCIL DOES GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO TRY TO DISTINGUISH BIDON FROM TRUMP SAYING QUOTE MOST NOTABLY AFTER BEING GIVEN MULTIPLE CHANCEIS TO RETURN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND WOID PROSECUTION MISTER TRUMP ALLEGEDLY TID THE OPOSITE ACCORDING TO THE INDICTMENT HE NOT ONLY REFUSE TO RETURN DOCUMENTS FOR MONTHS HE ALSO OBSTRUCTED JUSTIS BY ENLISTING OTHERS TO DESTROY EVIDENCES AND THEN TO LIE ABOUT IT IN CONTRAST BIDON TURNING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS TO THE NATIONAL OUR COSS ET CETERA NOW IS THAT THIS POSITIVE ON A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDON NOT REALLY BECAUSE WHAT THAT REALLY SUGGESTS IS THAT JOBIDON WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO MISSHANNAL CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS FOR YEARS ON END AND ONLY WHEN HE GOT CAUGHT THAT ISWHEN HE TURNED OVERALL THE DOCUMENTS WHICH DOESN'T RELIEVE YOU OF THE RESPONSIBILITY NOCUMENTS HANNEL CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IF I TAKE HOME CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS FOR TEN YEARS AND I'MIS HANDLE THEM I LEV THM OUT EVERYWHERE AND THEN YOU COME TO MEANS A TURN IN THE DOCUMENTS AND THEN I TURNED IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DIDN'T YO A A CRIMINAL ACT BEFOR AND BY THE WAY WHEN IT COMES TO HILLERY CLENTONSHE ACTUALLY LIKE BLEECH BITTER HARDRIVE NAL THAT BUT NONE OF THIS NONE OF THIS IS THE REAL REASON THEY'RE NOT PROSECUTING JOBIDON THE REAL REASON THEY ARE NOT PROSSECUTING JOBIDON IS BECAUSE SPECIAL COUNCIL ROBERHER MAKES IT CLEAR IN THE REPORT IS WHAT SO DEVISTATING FOR BITON HE MAKES IT CLEAR OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THIS REPORT THAT JO BITON IS NO LONGER MENTALLY FIT TO BE EVEN IN THE EVEN IN THE DEFENCE BOX LET ALONE PRECIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHAT AMBOUT TO REACH YOU ARE ALL DIRECT QUOTES FROM THE SPECIAL COUNCIL REPORT  MAKING ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT JOBITEN IS NO LONGER WITH US AND NOTAONLY THAT HAS NOT BEEN WITH US FOR YEARS THEIT'S MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE A SECOND FIRST THAT OLD CAR IS STILL SITTING RIGHT THERE YOU'RE TIRED OF

THE DONATION GET THE RIGHT OFF CRS FOR IDS AT DOT ORG SLASHBEN HERE IS WHAT THE RE PORTS HAS QUOTE MISTER BITEN'S MEMORY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED BOTH DURING HIS RECORDED INTERVIEWS WITH A GHOST WRITER IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH OUR OFFICE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE NOW REMEMBER THE YEAR IS TWENTY TWENTY FORT THIS REPORT IS SAYING THAT JO BITEN'S MEMORY WAS GOING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THT IS FULL ON SEVEN YEARS GO AT'S GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THEN QUOTE WE HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THAT AT TRIAL MISTER BITN WOULD LIKELY PRESENTS HIMSELF TO HA JURY AS HE DID DURING OUR INTERVIEW OF HIM AS A SYMPATHETIC WELL MEANING ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY SO ANOTHER WORDS HIS DEFENCE IS GOING TO BE AND HE IS A NICE OLD GENT WHO DOES REMEMBER THINGS ANY MORE WHICH IS THAT A GREAT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU WANT IN THE OVAL OFFICE BASTON AR DIRECT INTERACTIONS WITH AND OBSERVATIONS OF HIM HIS SOME ONE FOR WHOM IT MANY JURORS ONCE WHI DENS FI REASONABLE DOUBT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE A JURY THAT THEY SHOULD CONVICT HIM BY THEN A FORMER PRESIDENT WELL INTO HIS ATIES OF A SERIOUS FELLONY THAT REQUIRES A MENTAL STATE OF WILFULNESS S THERE SAYING THAT THEY'RE JUST CAN TO SEE A JERIATRIC DOTTERD AND THE'REGNTO LET HIM OFF MORE QUOTES FROM THE SPECIAL COUNCIL REPORT QUOTE MISTER BITN'S MEMORY ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS BOTH AT THE TIME HE SPOKE TO HIS GOST WRITER IS WONITSER IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS EVIDENCE BY THEIR RECORDED CONVERSATIONS AND TO DAY AS EVIDENCE BY HIS RECORDED INTERVIEW WITH OUR OFFICE MISTER BITON'S RECORDED CONVERSATIONS WITH AS WANTITER FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARE OFTEN PAINFULLY SLOW WITH MISTER BITON STRUGGLING TO REMEMBER EVENTS AND STRAINING AT TIMES TO READ AND RELAY HIS OWN NOTEBOOK ENTRIES ANOTHER QUOTE IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH OUR OFFICE MISTER BITEN'S MEMORY WAS EVEN WORSE HE DID NOT REMEMBER WHEN HO'S VICE PRESIDENT IT ISN MIND BOGLING SUFFFOKS JOBITON SITS DOWN WITH SPECIAL COUNCIL INVESTIGATING HIM OVER CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS HE'S PRESIDENT OF TE UNITED STATES OF THE TIME HE DOES NOT REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT FORGETTING ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS INTERVIEW WHEN HIS TERM ENDED QUOTE IF IT WAS TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN 'T I STOP BEING VICE PRESIDENT AND FORGETTING ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE INTERVIEW WHEN HIS TERM T BEGAN QUOTE INTO THOUSANON A I STILL VICE PRESIDENT NOW CALL ME CRAZY BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LIKE IN TERMS OF THE YEARS THAT SEEM PRETTY IMPORTANT IKE I REMEMBER THE YEAR THAT WE STARTED OUR COMPANY HERE AT DAILY WIRE PRETTY IMPORTANT YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN IREMEMBER'S PRETTY IMPORTANT THERE'S LOCK GOING ON THAT YEAR THAT'S NOT BEING VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT HE COULDN'T REMEMBER THE YEARS WHO'SE VICE PRESIDENT IT GETS WORSE QUOTE HE DID NOT REMEMBER EVEN WITHIN SEVERAL YEARS WHEN HIS SON BOU DIED MIND BOGLING ABSOLUTELY MIN BOGLING MEIN JOBIDON PULLS OUT THE STORY OF BO'SDAF ALL THE TIME ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WHEN ASK DIFFICULT CLESTIONS ALL THE TIME ITS STARTED OFF AS SOR OF A SAD THING THAT HE WOULD THAT HE WOUD TALK ABOUT HIS DECEASED SON AND THEN BECAME OBNOXIOUS AND TERRIBLE BECAUSE HEU WOULD DO IT IN THE WORST POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES HE BE TALKING TO THE FAMILY OF HE DEAD SOLDIER IN HO SUDDENLY BE TALKING ABOUT BOU AND IMPLYING THE BO HAD DIED IN A ROCK IN SERVICE OR SOMETHING BUT NOW WE ARE LEARNING FROM THE SPECIAL COUNCIL THAT HE DIDNT HE QUOTE DID NOT REMEMBER EVEN WITHIN SEVERAL YEARS WHEN HIS SON BO DED AND HIS MEMBORY APPEARED HAZY WHEN DESCRIBING THE AFGANNISTANDTBATE THATWAS ONCE SO IMPORTANT TO HIM AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MISTAKENLY SAID HE HAD A REAL DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH GENERAL CARL I CANBURY WHEN IN FACT I CAN BURY WAS AN ALLIE WHO MISTER BITON SITED APPROVINGLY IN HIS THANKS GIVING MEMODE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA THERE'S MORE QUOTE GIVEN MISTER BTONS TENDENCY TOWARD LOOSE TALK WITHIS WANITZER AND MISTER BITON'S LIMITED PRESITION AND RECALLED URING HIS INTERVIEW WITH OUR OFFICE DISCUSSED ABOVE REASONABLE JUROERS MAY HESITATE TO PLACE TOO MUCH EVIDENTIARY WAIT ON A SINGLE EIGHTWORD UTTERANCE HIS WANITER FROM ALMOST EIGHT YEARS AGO IN THE ABSENCE OF OTHER MORE DIRECT EVIDENCE AND OTHER THE REASON THAT WRE NOT PROSECUTING HIM OVERSAYING TO HIS GHOST WRITER I HAVE A BUNCH OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION DOWN STAIRS IS BECAUSE HE'S TOO OLD IN HIS TWO SENILE AND THEN THEY REITERATE BIDON WILL LIKELY PRESENTS HIMSELF TO THE JURY AS A SYMPATHETIC WELL MEANING ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY BHILE HE IS AND MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS ACTIONS HE IS AFTER ALL THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BASON ARE DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF HIM BIDON IS SOME ONE FOR WHOM MANY JURS WANTS TO SEARCH FOR REASONABLE DOUBT QUOTE WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE SAME EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS REASONABLE DOUBT FOR CLASSFIED AFGANISTANS DOCUMENTS ALSO SUPPORTS REASONABLE DOUBTS FOR THE NOTE BOOKS INCLUDING MISTER BITON'S COOPERATION WITHTHEINVESTIGATION HIS DIMINISHING FACULTIES IN ADVANCING AGE AND HIS SYMPATHETIC DEMEANOR AGAIN NICE OLD SENILE MAN IS THE VERTICT THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT GOING TO JAIL THIS REPORT IS SO MUCH MORE DOVI STATING THAN A SIMPLE INDICTMENTWOULD A BEN A SIMPLE INDITMENT BINE PUBLER TO GOTTEN OFF YOU TO KILLED TRUMS CLASSFIED DOCTMENTS DICTMENT AS WELL BUT BE STAIN OF A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SAYING WE CANNOT PROSECUTE HIM BECAUSE HE IS OLD IN SENILE IS DEVASTATING AND OF COURSE BE BIDANT HEEN PICKED UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY THEY SENT A LETTER HIS LAWYERS TO ROBERT HERK WHAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REPORTS TREATMENT OF PRESENENT ABIDINGS MEMORYES ACCURATE OR APPROPRIATE THE REPORT USES HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE A COMMON PLACE OCURENCE AMONG WITNESSES A LACK OF RECALL OF YEARS OLD EVENDS SUCH COMMENTS HAVE NO PLACE IN A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORT PARTICULARLY ONE THAT IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH ANOUNCES NO CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE WARRANTED AND THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH MISTER BITON'S GUILT AND THEN THEY MAKE AN EXCUSE THE EXCUSE THEY USE FOR WHYD JOBIDEN CAN'T RECALL WHEN HIS SON DIED OR WHEN HO IS VICE PRESIDENT IS QUOTE HIS INTERVIEW BEGAN THE DAY AFTER THE OCTOBER SEVEN THE TAX ON HIS ROL THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ACTUAL LINE THT'S GOING TOBE THE ACTUAL LINE NOW I ASK YOU IS THAT A GOOD DEFENCE SO THERE IS A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CRISIS AND THE PRESIDENT GETS MORE SEE NILE AND THAT APPARENTLY IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEFENSE TO HIS SINILITY SEE THAT'S WHY WE HIRE YOU FOR THE JOB IS BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HANDOL THE FORE A M FON CALL AS HILLERCLIN ONCE CALLED IT WITH SOME LEVEL OF MENTAL ACUITY IF YOU LOSE YOUR FACULTY IS THE MINUTE IN INITERNATIONAL EMERGENCY BRICKS OUT WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR SO PRESENT EMBITENT THEN PUT OUT A RITTEN STATEMENT IN WHICH HE SAID QUOTE OVER MY CAREER PUBLIC SERVICE I HAVE ALWAYS WORK TO PROTECT AMERICA SECURITY I TAKE THESE QUESTION SERIOUSLY NO ONE HAS EVER QUESTIONED THAT AY HE DIDN'T  MAKE ANY COMMENT IN HIS ORIGINAL STATEMENT ABOUT HIS LACK OF MENTAL FACULTY AT THIS POINT JKE TAPERON TANAN WAS CORRECTLY SKEPTICAL ABIDING'S ORIGINAL EXPLANATION ANDY COULD SEE MANY MEMBERS THE MEDIA WERE PRETTYU CRITICAL OF THE DEFENSE BECAUSE WE CAN ALL SEE IT WE CAN ALL SEE IT AND EVERYBODY HAS BEN TOLD IN THE MEDIA TO SHUT UP ABOUT JOBIDON BEING SEENILE HE SEENILE HE DAN

PARTICULARLY BAD WEEK FOR THIS REPORT AND IT'S COMMENTS ABOUT PRESDENT BYS FACULTIES IN HIS MEMORY TO COME OUT BECAUSE TWICE THIS WEEK HE HAS ACTED AS IF HE IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE SPOKE TO EUROPEAN LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS A ONCE HE CONFUSED OF FRANCLON ME TERALL WHO DIED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WITH EMANUAL MAC CRAN WHO IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE AND ANOTHER TIME HE WAS REFERRING TO ANGLA MARCOLL UNTIL RECENTLY THE THE CHANCELER GERMANLY AND REFERRED TE HELMET COL WHO I THINK TOT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IM SO THIS MEMORY ISSUE IS ALREADY OUT THERE BUT I WONTDER KNOW HOW MANY VOTERS IN MICHIGAN WITH CONSEN YOU THINK KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NO NO  A NOBOY BUT THEY AR NO OR  ARGUNI HALF THER WEYU AN OKE OR ARGUN A CALF TER VOTE FOR PRESIDENT BASED ON WHETHER SOMEONE IS NAMING MANUEL MAC CRON OR FRANC FRANCPA MA TORAGEN BU NAME THEY PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW BUT I THOGH NOT I GON IT'S TA BOUNT FACULTY IN MEMORY AND IND IN WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY THEY PERCEIVE IS COMPETENT BUT HE SO TAPPER IS SPEAKING FOR VIRTUALLY ALL AMERICANS ON THIS WHATEVER JOBIDON'S RANTOM FAILURE OF THE DAY IT'S ONE ABOUT WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE MIXES UP A DEAD FRENCH PRESIDENT WITH A LIVE FRIENDS PRESIDENT OR MAKES UP GERMANY IN FRAND THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT EVERY ONE KNOWS EVERY ONE CAN LOOK AND SEE THAT JOBIDON IS NO LONGER IN CONTROL OF HIS FACULTIES SO THIS IS NOW MERCHANCY TIME AND FAIRLY LATE LAST NIGHT FOR JOBITON WHICH IS TO SAY SEVEN FORTY FIVE AT NIGHT WE KNOW THAT HE USUALLY CALLS A LITT LIKE SEVEN P M BECAUSE AGAIN THE MAN IS HE IS CURRENTLY ON THE OLD AGE HOME SCEDUEL THEY HAVE HIM IN POLITICAL HOSPICE THIS PRESIDENT IT'S REALLY SAD HONEST TO GOD IT'S REALLY REALLY SAD HE'S MY PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT AND IT'S DAD TO WATCH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NOT IN CONTROL OF HIMSELF SAY THEY CALLED A PRESSOR AN EMERGENCY PRESSOR AT SEVEN FORTY FIVE NOW THRE'S ONLY ONE BULL FOR CALLING IN A MERCHANTCY PRESS CONFERENCE AND THAT IS TO BLOW UP THE WIDESPREAD ASSUMPTION THAT JOBIDON IS NOT IN CONTROL OF HIMSELF AT THE IDEAL WAS GOING TO BE THAN ENORMAL POLITICAL CYCLE WHT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE PRESENT WOULD COME OUT HE'LL BE FULLY IN  CONTROL HE BE READY TO GO FULLY IN CONTROL AND HE WOULD THEN DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL WAS JUST WRONG THAT HE WAS HAVING AN OFF DAY OR THAT HE HADN'T HAD A LOW SLEEP LAST NIGHT OR THAT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL HATES HIM BUT CLEARLY THIS IS A PERSON WHO'S NOT ONLY IN COMMAND THIS'S A PERSON WHO IS AT THE PIQ OF HIS POWERS SO JOBI DON COMES OUT LAST NIGHT WENNT GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE PRESS CONFERENCE BECAUSE IT IS VE MOST IS ASTEROUS PRESS CONFERENCE IN PRESIDENTIAL HISTRY IT WITH BARNON BARNON A SEEN A WATOMUM FOLKS AND FOLLOWING THE STUFF FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND IF SEEN A LOT O TAPE THIS IS EASILY THE WORST PRESS CONFERENCE F ALL TIME BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES JOBIDN SHOW THAT HE IS NOT IN CONTROL OF HIS FACULTIES HE THEN PROCEEDS TO COMMIT THE SEEME BAUCHERIES THA LAD THE SPECIAL COUNCIL TO SAY THAT HE IS NOT IN CONTROL OF HIS FACULTIES SO THIS THING STARTS OFF AND AS ALWAYS JOBIDON 'SKELLING AL WIND UP TOWAIGHT AT THIS POINT THE FIRST SEVERAL MINUTES  LI GOK HAV WELL HE LOOKS AWAY AND THEN AS WHATEVER THEY'VE SHOT HIM UP WITH WEARS OFF HE STARTS TO FAIL AND THE BATTERY START TO SPUTTER AND THE LIGHT BEHIND HIS EYES STARTS TO DIM HE CAN SEE IT HAPPENING IN REAL TIME WHICH IS WHIE IS IMPORTANT T WE WATCH THEWHOLE THING SO JO BIDON STAGGERS OUT AT ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY FIVE IS TEN FIFTY MINUTES LATE TO HIS OWN PRSS CONFERENCE AND AS SOME FIFTY EIGHT I GUESS AS

EAN ON ONS A OLIFI CERSOIS CONTOBE CASY NYAETS A MY STARYOHASS  SON COUPLE THING ONE WHEN HE SAYS THAT YOUR JUDGEMENT NOT THE JUDGEMENT OF THE PRESS FIRST OF ALL THAT IS THE JUDGEMENT OF THE VOTERS EVERY POLL TAKEN FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE DEEP AND APPARENTLY WELL GROUNDED CONCERNS ABOUT JOBIDIN'S MENTAL STATES AND THEN WHEN HE SAYS HE IS THE PERSON WHO IS MOST QUALIFIED TO BE PRESENT INTO IN THE UNITED STATES AT'S A RATHER AUDACIOUS CLAIM HOW MAD YOU BILL REALLY BELIEVE EME DEMOCRATS REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE'S NO ONE ELSE NO ONE ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES WH'S BETTER QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAN CHOBIDEN NOBODY BELIEVES THAT WHICH IS WHY THIS YUTE HAS A SERIOUS PROB ON HIS HANDS   I DO NOT SHARE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION I DID NOT HERE YOU L PASIT MY GOR ELEN THAT'S A WHY THAT'S A WHY HE'S LONG IT'S NOT TRUE THE REPORT IT SELF SAYS HE SHARED CLASSIFIED INFORMTIONWITH HIS GHOSTWRITER IT SAYS IT STRAIGHT UP WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE DID NOT SHARED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH HISGHOSTWRITER HE IS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH IT IS A LIFE IF SO HE'S LYING ENMYES FOR GETTING THINGS IN A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HOW HE IS A TOTALLY WITH THE TRUTH TELLER CONTINUE NOT GARANTE DID NO WUT THER THETHER CONTES THATE AI E DID NOT SA THAT ONLY BE BO E  O MISTER PETE WOEV OR AR THE FACT THAT THE MATTER IS WHAT I DIDN'T WANT REPEGED I DIDN'T WANT HIM NOT I DIDN'T READ IT TO HIM WAS I HAD WRITTEN A LONG MEMORANDUM THE PRESIDENT AN ABAMA WHY WE SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS IN AFGANSTAND AND I WAS OF TIS AMOTIBLE PAGES AND SO WHAT I WAS REFERRING DO I SAID CLASSIFIED IT I SHOULD HAVE SAID IT WAS SHOULD BE PRIVATE BECAUSE IT WAS A CONTACT BETWEEN A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESN TAS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT'S WHAT HEIS REFERRING IT WAS NOT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THAT DOCUMENT THAT WAS NOT ABOME BOB WHEN YOU LOOKD BACK AT THIS INCIDENT IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY NOW AND DO YOU THINK THAT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SHOULD HAVE BEN APPOINTED AT TE FIRST PLASE IN BOTH OF THESE CASES FIRST OF ALL WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IS OVERSEE THE TRANSFER OF THE MATERIAL THAT WAS IN MY OFFICE IN MY OFFICES I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT IF I  GO BACK I DIDT NOT RESPONSIBILITY THAT THERE WAS MY STAFF WAS POST TO THAT AND A REFERENCE THAT IN THE REPORT AND MY STAFF DID NOT DO IT N A WAY THAT FOR EXAMPLE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW HALF THE BOXAS GOT ON MY GARASE UNTIL I FOUND OUT STAFF GATHERED THEM UP PUT THEM AN GETHER AND TOOK HIEM TO THE GROGE ON MY HOME AND ALL THE STUFF THAT WAS IN MY HOME WAS IN FILING CAPINENTS THAT WERE EITHER LOCKED OR ABLE TO ME ON IT WAS IN MY HOUSE IT WASN'T OUT AND LIKE IN MARLAGO AND A PUBLIC PLACE WHERE AND NONE OF IT WAS HIGH CLASSIFIED DIDN'T HAVE ANY THAT RED STUFF ON ME ON O ME IN ROUND THE CORNERS NONE OF THAT AND SO I WISH I HAD PAID MORE ATTENTION TO HOW F THE DOCUMENTS WERE BEING MOVED AND WERE I THOUGHT THERE BEIN MOVE TO THE ART COCE I THOUGHT ALL WAS BEAN THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS THE LAST PARTY QUESTION SPECIAL CONSILIS SHO THA THEN APPOINTED IN THIS CASE HAD ON THE CASE OF YOUR RIABLE PRESENT FOR I THINK ESPECIAL COUNCIL SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPOINTED AND THE REASON I THINK ESPECIAL CANCOUNSIL SHOULD HAVE BEEN APOINTET IS BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO BEIN A POSITION THAT THEY LOOKED A TRUMP AND WORK ON A LOOK AT ME JUST LIKE THEY LOOKED AT THE VICE PRESENT AND THE FACT IS THEY MADE A FIRM CONCLUSION I DID NOT BREAK THE LALL PERIOD THANK YOU AR  IS IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH  AND THEN HES STARCH TO HEAD OFF AND THIS POINT HE STAVLI BOUT THIS IS THIS IS BAD IS IS NOT GOOD BAT MAYBE THE BRINGINGS I RELIEFE AND THEN HE COMES BACK HE COMES BACK FOR MORE ERE WE GO ATION HE COMES BAC FOR MOREANIS STAFEIHET MUST BE SPRINGING WHAT HE MUR ES PT WHAT ARE YOU DOING I KNOW YOU AS YOU KNOW THAT THE CONDUC OVERESFONSE IN GOZ IN A GAESTI AS AN OW OVER THE CO I THINK AT TO IYO NOW MAN HE'S NOT ELY EPRESEN E MEXICO SES I NOT ONE OPEN AF THE GATE TOLO E MAN CARRYIN TO A CAPOSIPFER A SECOND SO HE COMES BACK JUST TO SUGGEST APPARENTLY THAT ISRAEL'S RESPONSE IN GAZA HAS BEEN OVER THE TOP NOW THE WHITEHOUSES OUT THERE CLEAN UPON ILE MINE TRYING TO SAY THAT WHAT HE WAS SAYING IS AT COMMASES RESPONS IN GAZA TO DEMANDS THE RELEASE THE HOSSAGE HAS BEEN OVER THE TOP WHATEVER HE MEANS HE CLEARLY OS SAYING SOMETHING TERRIBLE MORALLY THERE ISRAEL'S RESPONSE TO TWELVE HUNDRED OF ITS CITIZENS BEING MURDERED AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY TAKING CAPTIVE AND A HUNDRED STILL BEING HELD CAPTIVE IS NOT IN FACT OVER THE TOP AN'S GROSS HIM TO SAY SO TO EARN VOTES IN DEERBORN MICHINGAN BUT THEN HE MAKES THE BIGGEST OF ALL BOOBS HE CALLS ABELFATA ELSE SE WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO IN A PRESS CONFERENCE DESIGN TO SHOW THAT HE IS MENTALLY FIT AND ABLE AND HIS MEMORY IS WORKING JUST FINE IN APPRESS CONFERENCE DESIGN TO SHOW THAT HE IS WITH IT HE SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT IS THE PRESIDENT WITH MEXICO WE OF MEX WHAT IN THE ACT WHAT IN FIRST OF ALL THIS WOULD IT THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY WE HAVE NT OPEN BORDER HEBES CALLING ELSESIAN ASKING TO SHUT THE BORDER AND ELSIES HIS LIKE THE BORER IS SHOT MEANING LIKE THE GASABORDER AND BAZAGUA E TELLS ME HAS SHOT I GUESS A EN ON OVER CLOSEAWAY WA A WHAT THE AS SOME ONE TREATED HILARIOUSLY THE NILESN'T JUST A RIVER IN MEXICO LIK MY GOODNESS MY GODNESS REMEMBER THIS IS TEN MINUTES INTO APESS CONFERENCE TEN MINUTES THIS NOT BEEN TWO HOURS DOES NOT BEEN FIVE HOURS IS NOT THE DAFTRACTOBER SEVENTH THIS IS TEN MINUTES INTO A PRESS CONFERENCE IT IS NOT LATE AT NIGHT IT IS NOT TEN THIRTY AT NIGHT IT IS NOT ELEVEN OR TWELVE AT NGHT IT IS EIGHT O EIGHT P M AND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS CALLING THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO WHILE BABBLING NONSENSICALLY ABOUT THE S RAILY RESPONSE IN GAZA I MEAN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A POLITICAL SELF IMMOLATION LIKE THIS HE DOWSD HIMSELF IN POLITICAL GASOLINE AND THEN AFTER A FEW ATTEMPTS SET THE MATCHALIGHT MY GOODNESS HE'S ALMOST DONE HERE WE GO I TOCK I CAN ASOAGI TOT THE BABY OPEN THE GATE ONE AS REALLY SO I'M A PUSHY REALLY HAR REALLY A TGI MAN CANCICENCEAN THE GAT NE LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE ORE STARTIN I INOCENT PEOPLEOR A TO A TI AS CASTOT NOT A ON NOMBER TO I WAS ALSO IN THE POSITION THAT I'M E IE MAKE THE CASE THAN WE HAVE TO D O MUCH MORE TO INCREASE THE MOUNTOF MATERIAL GOING INCLUDING FUEL THE WINDEMBOYS LINDRNOWNCE I'VE BEEN ON THE FONE WITH THE CATARIES AN HAN EFON WENT THE EGYPTIANS AV A  FONMENT TO STUDIES TO GET AS MUCH AID AS WE POSSIBLY CAN INTO GOSSIP THE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN IS SOME WOMEN AND CHILDREN WE'RE ALSO A BAD AND BADLY NEED OF HELP AND SO THAT'S WETE WERE PUSHIN AND I PUSHING VERY HARD NOW TO DEAL WITH AS HOSTY CEASE FIRE BECAUSE AS A NOW OF THE WORKING TIRELESSLY IN THIS TEAL HOW CAN I SAY THIS WITHOUT REFEALING TO LEAD TO A SUSTAIN PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING IN THE ACTIONS TAKING PLACE IN IN THE GODOS TRIP AND A BECAUSE I THINK IF WE CAN GET THE DELAY FOR THAT AAN INITIAL DELAYS I SO I THINK THAT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO A EXTEND THAT T SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE THE PROSPECT THAT THIS FIGHTING IN GODS A CHANGES AS ALSO A NEGOTIATIONS YOU MAY RECALL AND THE VERY BEGANNING RIGHT AFTER RIGHT BEFORE HAMOSS ATTACK I WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE SODIES AND OTHERS TO WORK OUT A DEAL WHERE THEY WOULD RECOGNIZE HIS REALS RIGHT TO EXIST LET THEM MAKE THEM PART OF THE MATTLAST AD RECOGNIZE AN FULLY AN RETURN FOR SERTAIN THINGS AN TO ON ISTATES SHOULD COMMIT TO DO AND THE COMMITMENT TO THAT WE WERE PROPOSED TO DO RELATED TO TWO  ARE TWO TWO WAY TAN TEM I CAN GOING DETAIL BUT ONE OF THEM WAS TO ZEAL WITH A HAVELING ON SENSE OF POTECTION AGAINST THEIR ARCH ENEMY TO THE NORTH WEST A NORTHEAST TE NORSE LESS THAN FITES TE SECOND ONE BY PROVIDING AMMUNITION AND MATERIAL FOR THEM TO DEFEND THEMSELVES COINCID DENTWY THAT'S THE TIME FRAME WITH THIS BROKE OW I HAVE NO PROOF FOR HM ABOUT TO SAY TUT IS NOT A REASON SUSPECT THAT A HAMOSS UNDERSTOOD OS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE AND ANTED TO BREAK IT UP BEFORE IT HAPPENED HE AND THEN HE JUST CON OF STAGGERS OFF AND THAT'S THAT SO DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THAT THIS PERSON IS MENTALLY SIT TO BE PRES IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT I'VE A QUESTION FOR YOU YOU SAY THE DONEL FROM IS THE SCARIOUS THING EVER TO COME DOWN THE PIKE IT SELLONT FROM BECOMES PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT THE UNITED STATES BATES LLE OVER THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER ELECTION IT'S PHILIPS IT'S PHILIP WROTHS DI THET THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA THAT WARRANG CHITLER IS GOING TO BE THE GUIDAN CHARGE ARE YOU CHOOSING TO KEEP IT IN PLACE THIS DODTERING SEENILE OLD MAN IT SERIOUSLY IT IS FEBRUARY FOLKS IT IS FEBRUARY THE ELECTION IS NOT UNTILL NO VEMBER A IF YOU I CAN'T IT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO EVEN IMAGINE THE DEMOCRATS KEEP MINT THE DOP OFTHE DICKET AND IF THEY DO IF THEYS DO ARE THEY LIKELY TO DEFEAT DONAL TRUMP SO THE MEDIAAVE TAKEN VARIOUS ANGLES ON THIS BIDON PRESSOR ANGL NUMBER ONE IS THAT EVERYTHING IS JUST FINE RACHELL MATO TRIED THIS ONE OUT LAST NIGHT AN IMAS EMBYSEE SHE CLAIND THE'S ALL HUB UB ABOUT NOTHING AFTER ALL JOBIDON CAN WRIDE A BIKE AN NEAT ICE CRAM OCCASIONAL Y HER WE GO THE FACT TOT HIS AGE IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN REBUT NIT CAN'T BE YOU CAN'T TACT THAT IF SOME ONE IS YOU'RE TOO FAR LEFT YOU CAN TACK TO THE CENTER YOU YOU THERE'S NOT THE MAN IS EIGHTY YEARS OL HE RITE THE BIKE AALI HE IS HE IS ANDAND SO ITS IT IT TI GERY USEFUL POLITICAL ATTACK FOR THAT RET GET CHRIS HAYSE THT LEAST LIVING THE WORLD OF REALITY RACHEL MATTABING LOKLIKE DOES HE DOES RIDE A BIKE HE DOES RIHT A BIKE GOOD LUCK TO YOU WITH THAT ARGUMENT NOW LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS WE LIVE IN SUCH A CRAZY POLITICAL TIME BAT THAT SEE NILE OLD MAN COULD VERY WELL WIN REELECTION THEREASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE I'M OLD ENOUGH REMEMBER A SENATE RACON PENNSYLVANIA WHERE A PERSON WHO HAD A STROKE AND COULD NOT  SPEAK OR HEAKER ONE A SENATE RACE SIMPLY BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP IN PENNSYLVANIA SO IS T QUITE POSSIBLE THE BIDON OULD WIN ANYWAY SURE IS THAT A RISK THET DEMOCRATS ARGONA AN TA TAKE THAT'S A SERIOUS QUESTION IS THAT THERITTEN OUT THE PROMEM FOR THEM IS THT THE PERSON WHO'S BACKING UP JOBIDIN IS COMLA HARRIS THE LEAST POPULAR POLITICIAN IN AMERICAN HISTORY SHE'S HORRIBLE AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT SHE'S THAT SHE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE TO DONAL TRUMP THEN JOBINE LOOKS TO HIDE HIM IN THE BASEMENT MAYBE IF THEY GET AWAY WITH IT AND THEN EVENTUALLY HELL PASS ON AND THEN EVENTUALLY COMLA HARRISE PRESENT N AL THE REST THAT'S THE HOPE BUT IF THEY HAVE COMELA HARRIS AT THE TOP AN TAKE AT THEIR TOAST ANDTHEN HAVE A LOT O OTHER OPTIONS THEY HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY OF GETTING RID OF COMELA HARRIS AND PUTING IN SAY GAVAN KNEW SOME OR SOMETHING FROM CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO HAVE IN MUCH MORE ROBUST CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IT IS AM LOOSE TALK ABOUT MICHELLABAMA SHE'S MADE PRETTY CLEAR SHE'S NOT INTERESTED IN RUNNING AT THIS POIN SHOU WOULD BE A SOLUTION TO ALL THE DEMOCRATS PROBS BECAUSE SHE'S A BLACK WOMAN WHICH MEANS THAT SHE COULD SUPPLANT COMELA HARRISON NOBODY WOULD SAY BOO INSIDE HE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT SHE APPARENTLY DOESN'T WANT IT BUT DEMOCRATS HAVE A REAL PICKLE ON THEIR HANDS A SERIOUS PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS AND DONALTRUM KNOWS IT WHICH IS WHY YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT THERE SLAMMING JOBINE'S MENTAL ACUITY AS YOU KNOW THERECTIO TO TEVER HAPPEN THA WAS A BALANCE TAGAINST A RAN AND WE BLEW OUT THE BALANCE AND NOW A RAN HAS ESENT IOLY TORAC AND THERET S A LI SANG TAT  TAT TOWAN IS   I OS ASHAME THE WORLD IS IN TO EN TIS DAN   DAO TE POSSIBTEA WORLD WORE THREE AND WE HAVE A MAN WHIS AT TOOLE THE WORST TES TE I TI TIS TOE TAN TO GAN TE TO TN TIS TOGEN TEIS NOT TO BEA E TE GOTO WI WHO  A SHE WO TI YON ON WE TOA TOCT EN TOBEA TE TEGOTSION WIT ANYBODY ONLY KNOWS TAT E TOIS DROP ON GO OV THE PLAC MEETING IS BONCE EXCEPT TE GIMALOUT OF PEOPLE  NOW HERE'S N'T THIN YOU SEE MEMBERS THE MEDIA HOR TRYING TO COMPARE DONAL TRUM'S MENTAL ACUITY TO JOBIDONS THER NOT A QUESTIONS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IN TERMS OF HIS FOR EXAMPLE IMPULSE CONTROL BUT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PRETEND THAT THESE TWO MEN OUR SOMEHOW IN THE SAME LEAGUE IN TERMS OF CLOSENESS TO SINILITY THAT IS OBVIOUSLY UNTRO IT'S OBVIOUSLY UNTREN OUT TRUM FOR HIS PART HAD A PRETTY AWESOME DAY YESTERDAY FIRST HE WATCHD JOBION COMPLETELY BLOW HIMSELF UP IN THE GREATEST POLITICAL SELF OWN I HAVE EVER SEEN MY LIFETIME AND THEN THE SUPREME COURT BASICALLY STRUCT EM IS IDIOTIC ARGUMENT THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED ON THE COLORADO BALLAT SO THE SUPREME COURT HAD A HEARING YESTERDAY DURING THAT HEARING VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE JUSTICES WERE SLAPPING AROUND THE BOYERS SUGGESTING THE DONALD TRUMP COULD SIMPLY BE KICKED OFF THE BALLAT IN COLORADO FOR QUAT WHAT INSURRECTION TESPITE THE FACT THAT INSURRECTION HAS NO ACTUAL LEGAL DEFINITION SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THAT ON A FEDERAL LEVEL HERE IS CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS OF COURSE IS REALLY NO RI WINGER TALKING TO JASON MURY THE COLORADO VOTERS ATTORNEY WHO IS DEFENDING COLORADO'S ACTION O KICKING TRUMP OFF THE BALLET I WOULD EXPECT THAT IT A GOODLY NUMBER OF STATES WILL SAY WHOEVER THE DEM MO CRATIC CANDIDATE IS YEUR OFF THE BALLAT AND OTHERS THFOR THE RE PUBLICAN CANIDATE YEAR OFF THE BALLANT IT 'LL COME DOWN TO JUST A HANDFUL OF STATES THAT ARE GOING TO DECINE THE PRESIDENTUAL ELECTION TATS PRETTY DAUNTING CONSEQUENCE WILL CERTAINLY YOURE HONOR THE FACT THAT THERE ARE POTENTIAL FRIVOLOUS APPLICATIONS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVITION ISN'T A REASON WEL NOLD ON I MEA YOU MIGHT THINK OF FRIVOLOUS THUON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BRINGING O MAY NOT THINGK TO FRIVOLOUS A INSURRECTION IS A BROND  BROWN TERM AND  TO SOME TE BATE ABOUT AN I SUPPOSE THAT WEL GO INTO THE ATESISION AND THEN A VENTUALLY WHAT WE WUL BE DECIDING AT WHETHER AND TET WAS AN INSURRECTION WHEN WEN PRESIDEN TOD SOMETHING AS SUPPOSE TO WEN SOMEBODY ELSE TO SOMETHING ELSE AND WEN WE DO TO WE WATE UNTIL NEAR THE TIME OF COUNTING THE BALANCE ANSO TO GO THROUGH WHICH STATES VALAD IN WHICH STATES AREN'T IS AS JOHN ROBERTS TAKING TO TASK JASON MARY THE COLRADO VOTER'S ATTORNEY AND ITS VERY MUCH EVERY JUSTICE YESTERDAY IT WAS JUST AS CAVINA IT WAS JUST AS GORESIT HERE IS  JUST AS GORSAGE GOING AFTER THE ANTI TREMPLOYER WULTIMATELY THERE STILL HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF PROCEDURE IN PLACE TO EJUDICATE THE DISQUALIFICATION CERTAINLY CONGRESS COULD IMPECH TO STTING PRESIDENT BUT THAT'S THE ONLY REMEDY I'M AWARE OF THAT EXISTS FOR FORREMOVAL OR OTHERWISE NEGATING THE AUTHORITY OF A SITTING PRESIDENT WHY WETHING WELL ON WHAT THER BECAUSE THE SUCT O TRE SPEAKS ABOUT DISQUALIFICATION FROM HOLDING OFFICE YOU SAY HE IS DISQUALIFIED FROM HOLDING OFFICE FROM THE MOMENT IT HAPPENTS CORRECT BUT NEVERTHELESSIT  OPERATES YOU SAY THERE'S NO NO LEGISLATION NECESSARY I THOUGHT THOT AS THA WHOLE THEORY OF YOUR CASE AND NO PROCEDUNESS HE HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY WILL CERTAINLY YOU NEED A PROCEDURE IN ORDER TO HAVE ANY REMEDY TO ENFORCE THE DISQUALIFICATION WHICH I UNDER  THAT'S A WHOLESUCE QUESTION THAT'S TO DEFACT OF THATENT DONE WORK HERE O KEPT WIT THAT ASIDE HE'S JUSTQUALIFIED FROM THE MOMENT SULF EXECUTING DONE AND I WOULD THINK THAT A PERSON WHO WOULD RECEIVE A DIRECTION FROM THAT PERSON HE PRESIDENT FOR A PRESIDENT IN INTERVIEW WOULD BE FREE TO ACT AS HERE SHE WISHES WITHOUT REGARD TO THAT INTIVIDUAL I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE I THINK AGAN THA DI WHO OFFICER DOCTOR WOULD NEVERTHELESS COME IN TO PLAY TO SAY THIS IS KNO DEFI TO THAT WULD THAT TH DOSN'T WORK MIS TE MARIK IS DHEFACT A OFFICERS TO THAT A FON E CONDUCT THATS DON AFTERWARDS AN AN AN INSLY FROM CUDITION OF VIEW PUT THAT ASIDE  MI CUT A SAY TO YEN PUT IT ASIDE HA SO AGAIN GETTIN BADTED AROUND TRUMSKAN BE ON TH BALLAT THAT'S JUST THE WAY THAT IT IS SO AGAIN DEMOCRATS HAVE A CHOICE THAY CAN LEAVE JOBIDEN THERE AND TAKE THEIR CHANCES OR THAT CAN TRIED TO DEFENTISTRATE HIM AND THROW THE ENTIRE RACE INTO COMPLETE AND UTTERAT CHAOS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS INDEED THE AT LEAST HE'S NOT THE OTHR GILACH THT'S EFFECTIVELY WHERE WE ALE RIGHT NOW WEIF THE DEMOCRAT WHARE ACTIVELY MAKING THE CASE THAT AT LEAST JOBIDON IS IN TRUM AND WE HAVE TRUM BACKERS WHA'RE MAKING THE CASE TWO INDEPENDENTS AND EMOCRATS WHILE AT LEAST HE'S NOT JOBIDEN WHOH WHAT AN ELECTION THIS IS GOING TO BE O' CAN MEANWHILE TUCKER CARLSON DID HIS LONG WAYTED INTERVIEW WITH LADMER PUTTEN YESTERDAY I THOUGT TUCKERDED FINE MAN I THOUGHT THAT HE ASKED SOME POINTED QUESTIONS PARTICULARLY NEAR THE AND ABOUT EVENGERSHCITCH WHICH WERE I THINK VERY USEFULTOS WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WALSTERE GERNERAL REPORTER WHO'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES IN IS BEING HELD IN JAIL FOR NO ACTUAL REASON FOR AS A BARGAINING CHIP I THOUGHT THERE WARE CERTAIN AREAS WHERE MAYBE TUCKER COUD A PUSH BACK HAR BUT THE REALITY IS THAT PUTEN JUST USED THE PLATFORM AS A WAY OF FILLIBUSTERING I ONLY TUCKER DID ANYTHING WRONG IN DOING THE INTERVIEW IN FACT I THINK AGAIN TUCKER ASKED HIM INTERESTING QUESTIONS THAT IS FULLY COINCIDENT WITH A BELIEF THAT VLADMER PUTEN IS AN ANTI AMERICAN DICTATOR WHO HAS VERY EVIL INTENTIONS AND PROCEEDED TO USE THE INTERVIEW AS A FILLIBUSTER TECHNIC AND I MEAN EVEN TULKOR BASICALLY SAID TO A FRON TUCKER SAID IN INTIN INTRODUCING THE INTERVIEW AT THE VIRSTHORITY FIVE MINUTES OF THE INTERVIEW IS JUST VLADMER POUTEN ESSENTIALLY BEGINNING WITH THE CREATION OF THE EARTH EXPLAINING HIS VERSION OF THE HISTORY OF YOU RAIN IN TUCKER IS LIKE EXPLAIN WHY YOU INVADED OU CRAIN AND VLADMER POTEN IS LIKE IT BEGAN WITH THE FORGING OF THE GREAT RAINS I GET THAT THAT'S REALLY THAT'S REALY WHAT HAPPENED  HE GOES LIKE THORTY FIVE MINUTES JUST EXPLAINING WHAT HE SEES AS THE HISTORY OF YOU CRANE WHICH HE SAYS WITH NEVER REALLY A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY AND WAS REALLY CREATED BY VLADMER LENIN WHICH IS NOT REALLY THE CASE AND ALL THIS IS PROVISIONIST HISTORY BUT YOU'D HAVE TO BE SORT OF EXPERT ON EASTERN EUROPEAN POLITICS AND THE HISTORY OF YOU CRANE THE PULLISH WITH TE WANIAN COMMON WEALTH THE HISTORY OF OF RUSSIA EASTERN EUROPE IN ORDER TO FACT CHACK HIM IN REAL TIME ON THIS SORT OF STUFF AND THAT'S NOT SOME THE ITHING TUCKERS PATICULARLY INTERESTED AND HERE WAS LADMER POUTEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION TO TALK ABOUT HOW LENIN CREATED OU CRAIN WHAT MATTERS THIS THAT LANDIN THA FOUNDER F THE SOVIET TAY ISTABLISH YOU CRANE THAT WAY IV SOTHIN IS POR THE CATES THET UCRANIAN SOVIET REPUBLIC DEVELOPED AS PARCH OF THE OU A I SA IN I AT TE PEECAN SHE MINYAND FOR UNKNOWN REASONS AGAIN THE BULSHOFEXPER ENGAGED IN YOU CRANIANIZATION IT WAS NOT MERELY BECAUSE THE SOVIET LEADERTIOP WAS COMPOSE SO GREAT EXTHAND O THOSE ORIGINATING CROCAL TINGRATHER IT WAS EXPLAINED BY THE GENERAL POLICY OF INDIGENIZATION PUR SOTHED BY THE SOVIET UNION SENE THINGS WERE DONE IN OTHER SOVIET REPUBLICS THIS INVOLVED PROMOTING NATIONAL LANGUAGES IN NATIONAL CULTURES WHICH IS NOD ABOUT IN PRINCIP AND WENT ON LIKE TAS TI SERING PASSIN OF YOU BY THE WAY AND TUCKER IS SITTING THERE LIKE CAN I GET SO LIKE AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION  WI O BUT A COUPLE THINGS JUMP OUT ONE IS THAT WHEN Y NACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE FULL INTERVIEW YOU'LL SEE THAT VINERPOUDEN HAS A VERY SELF SERVING VIEW OF YOU CRANIAN HISTERY THE BASICALLY ALOWS HIM TO ARGUE THA YOU CRANE SHOULD BE FULLY INJESTED BY RUSSA HE CLAIMS TAT OF COURSE HE HAS CLEAN HANDS AND ALL THIS HE'S NEVER HAD IN A FARIOUS THOUGHT HE'S NEVER HAD ANAFARIOUS OPINION HE INFACTIS NOT ANTI AMERICAN N JUST THAT THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN UNKIND TO HIM OVER THE COURSE OF RUSSIAN HISTORY AFTER THE FALL F THE SOVIET UNION YOU'LL ALSO NOTICED THAT JUSTIN TERMS OF AFFECT VLANMERPOOTEN FOR ALL THE TOT THERE IS A LOT OF TOLK HOW VLADMER POUTEN DYING HOW LADERHOODEN SECT HE CERTAINLY DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HE IS DYING OR SECOND THIS SINTERVIEP VANMERPOUDEN IS VERY MUCH ALIVE HE IS VERY MUCH WITH IT AM JUST IN TERMS OF PERSONAL AFFECT IF YOUR WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES AND YOU SEE AS I TO RUSSIAT AS IN A FARIOUS FORCE IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF FOREIGN POLICY WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUED TO BE THEN THE PROSPECT OF A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT WITH IT SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM VLADMERPOUTEN SHOULD NOT MAKE ANY ONE SANGUINE AT THIS POINT SO AGAIN HE WENT ON LIKE THIS FOR A VERY VERY VERY LONG TIME AND AGAIN HIS HISTORY BASICALLY SUGGESTED THE REASON THAT HE A TACKED YOU CRANE IS BECAUSE THERE IS A PROMISE THAT WAS MADE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE WEST WOULD NOT EXPAND NATO EASTWARD IN THE AFTER MATH OF THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION THAT PROMISE WAS APPARENTLY NEVER MADE ACCORDING T MC CHIO GORBICHOV WHO IS THE HAD OF OF THE SOVIE UNION AT THE TIME THE PROMISE WAS SUPPOSEDLY MADE SO HE CLAIMS THAT THE US BROKE ITS PROMISES THERE AND THEN TULKER ASKED WHAT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION HE SAYS WYEACTLY DID THE END OF THE COLD WORN NOT FIX THE RELATIONSHIP IN OF COURSE PUTEN THAN BLAMES THE UNITED STATES WHY DID THE END OF THE COLD WERE NOT FIX THE RELATIONSHIP WHAT MOTIVE ATES THIS FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW WITSCAUSE INESTO YOU SAID I WAS BITTER ABOUT THE ANSWER NO IT'S NOT BITTERES IT'S JUST THE STATEMENT THE FACT WE'RE NOT BRATHEN GROOM BITTERNES SO RESENTIENTIT'SN'T ABOUT THOSE KIND OF MATTERS SINCE SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WHIC JUST REALIZED WE WERE IN WELCOME THERE THAT'S ALL  OQE FINE BUT T LET'S BUILD RELATIONS IN ANOTHER MANNER LET'S LOOKI POR COMMON GROUND ELSEWHERE WHY WE RECEIVE SUCH A NEGATIVE RESPONSE ESHOULD ASK YOUR LEAER I CAN ONLY GESS WHY ITS O BE A COUNTRY I THESON OPINION AN SOONS AND BE I I SIS IE SEEING HOW ISES ER BEING RESOLIN N SO AGAIN HIS IDEA HERE IS THAT T WAS THE UNITED STATES THA REALLY LED TO THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE US AND RUSSIA POST SOVIAT IL GET THAT IS NOT ACCURATE THE REALITY IS THAT RUSSIA TOOK A VERY HARD ANTI U S ANTI WESTERN STANDS IN FOR EXAMPLE THE WAR IN YUDUSLAVA THEY WERE BACK IN THE SURBS THE SERBS WERE COMMITTING WHAT AMOUNTS TO TECHNICALLY A FORM OF GENICIDE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THE U S AND RUSSIA DIDN'T END UP WALKING AND LOCH STAP AS JOHN CONNER SUGGEST THED HE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD IN TERMINATOR TO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT IT IS NOT MERELY THAT RUSSIA IS A WONDERFUL PLAYER ON THE WORLD STAGE AGAIN RUSSIA HAS SPENT THE THE TIME SINCE THE FALL OF THE SOVIA UNION EMBRASING OLIGARCSTATION DESTROYING IT'S ON DEMOCRATIC FLOWERS SHUTTING DOWN THE PRESS TELLING POLITICAL OPPONENTS INVADING SOVEREIGN COUNTRIES THEY MADEA GEORSIA IN MADE U CRANE TWICE THEIR THREATENING OTHER STATES THAT ARE IN THEIR NEAR AREA AND THIS NONE OFTHE SECRE TO ATUCKER BY THE WAY ALL THE SECRETICAPUTN AND IT THAT'S OT OF REGINIS HISTORIE SO PUTENT FOR EXAMPLE HE SAYS THAT HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY START THE WAR IN TWENTY FOURTEINE IN U CRANE IN CRIMIA AND THE DONBAS THAT OF COURSE DONE TRUE HE SOMEWHA THE CALLED LITTLE GREEN MEN WHICH WERE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS WEARING THE UNIFORMS OF SUPRATISTS INTO THESE AREAS TO EFFECTIVELY CREATE BREAK AWAY A RENAS IN THESE PARTICULAR AREAS BUT WHAT'S WEIRD IS THAT RUSSIA DIDN'T ACTUALLY WANT TO SIMPLY ANNAX THE PARTS THE WORNK CRIMIASO RUSSIA ANNEXD CRIMIA AFTER TWENTY FOURTEIN RUSSIA DID NOT ANNEX THE PARTS OF THE DONBASSAT CONTROLLED WHY THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO USE THOSE AREAS OF U CRANE AS A BAS OF OPERATIONS FROM WHICH TO DEMOCRATICALLY TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF UCRANE TAND THIS LED TO ALL SORTS OF BIZAR SORT OF RAMIFICATIONS IN WHICH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF UCRANE DID NOT WANT TO ALLOW REGIONAL ELECTIONS IN THE DONBAS OUT OF FEAR THT THOSE WOULD THEN BECOME EFFECTIVELY SORT OF ENEMIES WITHIN PEOPLEWHO WANTED TO HAND TO OVER THE ENTIRATYOVE UCRANE TO THE RUSSIANS IT LED TO ALL SORTS OF SERIOUS CONFLICT TO LED TOTHE VIOLATION OF THE MINSK AGREEMENTS WHICH WERE AGREEMENT SIGNED AFTER TWENTY FOURTEEN TH OR PRETTY UN CLEAR IN EXACTLY HOW THEY WERE TO BE INTERPRETED BOTH RUSSIA AND U CRANE VIOLATED THE MINSK AGREEMENTS BY THE WAY THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT ONLY ONE COUNTRY INVADED THE SOVEREIGN TERRITORY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY RUSSIA INVADED THE SOVEREIGN TERRITORY OF UCRANE THEY TRIED TO MARCH ON KEEVE AND TAKE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HERE AS LANRPUTENT CLAIMING THAT ACTUALLY IT WAS UCRANE THAT STARTED THE WORD TO SPITETHE FACT THAT REALISTICLLY SPEAKING VLODIMERS LENSKY WAS A DOV AND BEFORE THE WAR LODIMERS LENSK ACTIVELY INFORMED HIS ENTIRE UPPER MILITARY ASHELON THAT HE DIDN'T WANT THEM OPENLY PREPARING FOR WAR BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAD THAT WOULD SCUTTLE ANY PEACE NEGOTIATIONS THAT HE HAD WITH PUTEN HE CAME TO OFFICE PLEDGING THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE PEACE WITH LANRPTEN IN FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE GRANNURANE ARE VERY ANGRY AT ZLENSKY FOR HAVING IMPROPERLY PREPARED UCRANE FOR THE INVASION BY RUSSIA LITERALLY DAYS BEFORE THE INVASION HUEWAS BASICALLY HAPPY TAU CKING THE ENTIRE POSSIBILITY OF AN INVASION OF OU RANE IS OLENSKY IN ANY CASE HERE IS PUTEN CLAIMING THAT EVERYTHNG IS EVERYBODY ELSE'S FAULT OF COURSE YIT WAS THE WHO START TET THE WARRING TWO THOUSAND FORT SEEN OURGO IS TO STOP THIS WENYO AND WE DID NOT START THI SWORING WENY SWENI SO THIS IS AN ATSENT TO STOP IT IM THEN WHYHE HASN'T THE WAR STOPPED THAT WOULD BE THE BIG QUESTION SO THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT COUKAR ASKED HE SAYS WHYN'T JUS STOP THE WAR AND PUHTEN THEN LAYS OUT A RATIONOW FOR THE COMPLETE DISSOLUTION OF THE GOVERNMENTOF U RANE HE CLAIMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF UCRANE REQUIRES DENSFICATION LISTEN TO THE TWISTED LOGIC HERE NOW AGAIN YOU CRAIE DOES HAVE CERTAIN PARTIES IN IS MILITARY NAMELY THE AZO BATELLIAN THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLY LINKED TO NEONAZIISM IN THE PAST FORSHORE THAT IS TRUE THE IDEA THAT THE GOVRNMENT OF EUCRANE IS EFFECTIVELY A GIANT NTY PARTY IS A BIZAR ARGUMENT FROM VLADMER PUTEN HERE WE GOT DO YOU THINK YOU'VE STOPED IT NOW EN IF YOU ACHIEVED YOUR AMES NO WE HAVEN'T THE CHITERANS YET BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS THE NACIFICATION THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO EXTERMINATE THE BULLS JEWS AND RUSSIANS IF THE D GA TESTASA BIOGRAPHYUDU HET WAS IT IS NECESSARY TO STOP THIS PRACTICE AND PREVENT THE DISEMINATION OF THIS CONSIT NNOTTHINI SAY THAT THE CRANIN SARE PART OF THE ONE  RUSHIAN PEOPLE ETHEY SAY NO WE ARE A SEPARATE EPOIN E O KE E FINELOISHTHI IF THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES TE SEPARATE PEOPLE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO BET NOTON THE BASIS OF NOSISNTHEN NOT SIATEOLEGE THT GIS WHAT HE IS DOING THERE THE CASE THAT HEIS MAKING IS THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO AR CONSIDERED SERVE THE HEROES OF OU CRANE HECAUSE THEY RESISTED FOR EXAMPLE THE SOVIET TAKE OVER OF U CRANE IN THE AFTER MATH OF WORLD WHERE TWO OR AS WORLDWARD WO HIS ENDING THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE RESISTANT TO THE SOVIA TAKE OVER WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN FACT PRONAZI IF THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY OF EUROPEAN HISTORY THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE TRUE IN A LOT OF EASTERN UROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WHO WERE REBELLING AGAINST COMMING IST RULE IN THE POSTWAR PERIOD WORE PEOPLE WHO HAD FORMERLY ALLIED WITH THE NATIES THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT THE IDEA THAT ALL OF OUCRANE IS TAKEN OVER BY NOZISM BECAUSE OF THAT IS TOTALLY CRAZY THAT IS A WILD CONTENTION BY VLADMAR PUTEN BY THE WAY WHEN PUHTEN ARGUES THAT HE IS ATTEMPTING DENATFICATION IN U CRANE WHICH OF COURSE IS AN ABSURDITY AND THAN HE TELLS HIS MISBEGOTTEN HISTORY OF WORLDWAR TO ONE OF THE E HACTE SAID THIS INTERVIEWS HE BLAME POLAND FOR THE OUTBREAK OF HODWOR TOO WHICH IS PRETTY WHILE FOR GOD WHOSE CLAIMING THAT HE WANTS O DENOS IFY THE CLAIM THAT THE NOZIES WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WORLDWARD WHO IS A HELL OF A CLAIM HEARS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN TAN'T TEEN THIRTY NINE AFTER BLAN COOPERATE ED WITH THICKLERCULISG E I PUSHIS OI DID COLOBORATE WITH HEONO HITLER OFFERED POLAND TA PES AND THA TREATHY OF FRIENDSHIP  H ES ELEGO AND A LIONS BEMANDTIN IN RETURN THAT POLAND GIVE BACK TO GERMANY THE SO CALLED THE VANCI CARRIDORTHO ICONNECTED THE BULK OF GERMANY WITH ES BRUSSHA AND KINNINGSPIRAS NOISES GET I MY ESGIN GE HE SLUSSTOSIYPOSO EWORAND THIS TERITORY WAS TRANSFERT TO POLAND AND INSTEAD OF TANCI A CITY OF DUNSK EMERGED  ISTTHENTE TUSHITLER ASKED THEM TO GIVE IT ANICABLY BIT THEY REUSED THOF COURSE THAT STILL THEY COLLABORATED WITH HITLER AND ENGAGED TIGETHER IF GET E ISTHAT ANY IN THE PERTITIONING OF CHECKA SLAVAKION AND NOW LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS ATTEMPTING TO SAY HERE ANDO MAKES US SENSE YOU MANIN THIS CLAIM FOR A LOT OF YEARS THE REASON HE'S MAKING THIS CLAIM IS BECAUSE HE IS A DEFENDER OF THE SOVIET UNION CAN THE ACTUAL HISTORY WHEN IT COMES TO THE BREAK OUT OF WORLD WOR TO IS THE MALATOV RIBBON TROT PACT WHICH INSURED THAT RUSSIA WOULD NOT ATTACK HITLER FROM THE EAST DIVIED UP POLAND IT CARVED IT DIRECTLY IN HALF AND T GIVE A LARGE TRUNK OF IT TO THE NATIES AND A LARGE TRUNK OF IT TO THE SOVIETS IN THE AFTER MOUTH OF THE NAZI'S SWEEPING THROUGH POLAND THEY DIVE IT UP A BUNCH OF TERRITORY THE SOVIETS AND THE NAZIES THEY OF COURSE WERE THE REAL ALLIES SO IEF YOU ARE RUSSIAN YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING CLAIMING THAT THE MALATOV RIBBON TROT PACT WAS NOT IN FACT AND ATTEMPT TO GRAB LAND WILE ALLYING WITH HITLER WHOSE ACTUALL AN ATTEMPT TO FORESTALL A HITLARIAN INVASION OF THE SOVIET UNION IN INVASION THAT OF COURSE DID IN FACT HAPPEN IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE SO THAT IS A REVISIONIST HISTORY THE CLAIM THAT THAT PUTEN MAKES RIGHT THERE IS THAT POLAND WAS SOMEHOW ALLIED WITH GERMANY BECAUSE DURING THE TO DATAN LAND AGREEMEN DURING THE MUNIC AGREEMENTS OF NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHEN CHECKSLAVAKI WAS BASIDLY DIVVIED UP BECAUSE HITLER TOOK IT AND THEN THE WESTERN POWERS BASICLY TO SHRUG THAT'S THAT'S THE FAMOUS PEACE IN OUR TIME NEVIL CHAMBERLAND STUFF WHEN THAT HAPPEND CHECKASLAVAKA GOT DIVIED UP BY A NUMBER OF PARTIES INCLUDING SOME TO HUNGARY SOME TO GERMANY AND POLAND AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE THEYG IT GRABBED A TINE SLIVER OF CHECKASLAVAKYA THAT HAD IN THE AFTERMAUTHOL WORLD WERE ONE BELONGED TO THEM THE BORSIN EASTERN EUROPE WERE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIKE ALL THE TIME AY SO BECAUSE OF THAT HE CLAIM THEY WERE ALLIES OF HITLER WHICH OF COURSE HIS WEIRD BECAUSE THEN HITLER DEMANDED THAT E PORT CITY ESSENTUALLY BE TURNED OVER TO THE TO THE GERMAND AND POLAND REFUSED AND THAT WAS THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WOR TO AND WE PUDDEN PLAYS THAT IS THAT POLAND WAS ACTUALLY PUSHING GERMANY TO HARD AND FORCED HITLER TO INVADE POLAND WHICH IS INSANE AND THAT THAT'S WHY WORLD WAR TO BEGAN NOW THE REASON HE SAING THAT ALSO IS BECAUSE THAT SORT OF IS WHAT HE AS SAYING BHAT YOU CRANE WHEN HE'S BASILY SAYING IS THAT BECAUSE YOU CRANE IS IN IS DEFENDING IT'S OWN BORDERS AND BECAUSE RUSSIA HAS BEEN ENCROACHING ON THOSE BORDERS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN IN CRIMEA AND IN THE DONBAS AND BECAUSE YOU CRANE DOESN'T WANT TO GRANTS ANOUGH POWER TO THOSE AREAS THAT IS WHAT JUSTIFIES YOU THE ERUSSIAN INVASION OF YOU CRANE HE SIMULTANEOUSLY SAYING THAT WE'LL SAING THAT HE'S TRYING TO DE NOTS TOIFI GAND NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SORT OF SENSE BUT PUTN'S A CLEVER OPERATOR HE SO AGAIN NONE OF THE STONTUCKER IS AN PUTENT PUTENIS PUNS A CLEVER OPERATOR OBVIOUSLY'S A VERY SMARK EYE HE'S COM PLETELY VICIOUS HE HAS NO COMMITMENT TO THE TRUTHE DIE CAGE YOU BE OPERATIVE I MEAN CAN WE STOP PRETENDING THAT LADMER PUTEN IS SOME SORT OF GREAT SSAVIOUR IN SCION OF THE WEST HE OBVIOUSLY IS NOT HE'S A RUSSIAN NASHE'S AN ARCH RUSSIAN NATIONALIST WHO WISHES TO EXPAND THE BORDERS OF WHAT HE PRECEIVES TO BE HIS NEW EMPIRE HE WISHES TO GRAB SOME STRATEGIC TERRITORY CRIMY IS VERY STRATEIC THEREIS THIS DOMBASS THAT HE'S COLNELTLY OCCUPYING ARE VERY STRATEGIC AND OF COURSE YO WOULD LOVE TO BREAK A PARTNATO BECAUSE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER TERRITORIAL EXPANSION WHICH HIS WIFE YOU TALK TO ANY ONE FROM ANY OF THE BALTIC STATES THEY DON'T BELIEVE HIM AND THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE A BORDER WITH LADMER PUTEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW NOW AMERICANS WE SHULDN'T REALLY CARE AL THAT MUCH ABOUTS GOING ON E EASTERN OUR YABUT EASTERN EUROPENS SHOULD I MEAN EASTERN EUROPEANS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE AFRAID OF LADMER PUTEN F YESCALITHUANIAN OR IF YOU ASK IN A STONIAN OR IF HE ASK SOMEBODY FROM POLAND ARE THEY WORIED ABOUT RUSSIA ON THEIR BOARDERS THE ANSWERS IF YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORY ABOUT THISREE FRON ONS OR OF COURSE THE WORD ABOUT SH THEIR BORDERS RUSH AS A LONG HISTORY OF INVADING THESE BLAZES OBVIOUSLY SO TUCKER ASK HIM ABOUT THIS IN CLIPTEN TUCKER SAYS YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ARGUING THAT YOU INVADED YOU CRAN ING YOU HAVE FURTHER TERRITORIAL AIMS IN PUTENT JUST FLATANIZE IT WHICH AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE THE CAGE YOU BE OPERATIVE SORRY FOR THE ARGUMENT I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS IS THAT WELLHE INVADED YOU CRANE HE HAS TERRITORIAL AMS A CROSS THE CONTINENT AND YOUR SANG UNEQUIVOCALLY YOU DON'T SIUNIT ASLYTIO IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTIONHOU JUS DONE HAVE TO BE ANY KIND OF ANALIST IT GOES THA GAINST COMLAN SENSE TO GET INVOLVE

DON'T BELIEVE YOU SIR EY AND TOM AND THEN PUTEN MAKES WHAT IS THE CASE THAT HE'S BEEN WAITING TO MAKTING ENTIRE INTERVIEW READ HE MAKES THE CASE THAT AMERICANS SHOULD BASILY NOT CARE ABOUT ANY OF THIS DON'T YOU GOTS HAVE YOUR OWN PROBISE TOFIING JEST YOU CRANE WHAT PROEM IS IT OF YOURS AND AGAIN CLEVER TASTIC BYPUTEN BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT YES YOU CRANE IS VERY FAR AWAY NOW THEY'RE SERIOUS JEO POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS TO PUTEN SIMPLY BEING ABLE TO TAKE OVER ALL OF YOU CRANE FIRST WHLE THEY'RE SERIOUS ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS NOT ONLY BECUSE OF COMPLETE RUSSIAN CONTROL OF THE BLACKSEE AND SHIPPING ROUTS AN ALL THE REST OF IT BUT ALSO BECAUSE YOU CRANE IS THE NUMBER THREE GRANE PRODUCEER IN ALL THE WORLD ALSO BECAUSE THAT WOULD THEN PUT LADIMER PUTENT DIRECTLY ON THE BORDERS OF HUNGARY ON THE BORDERS OF POLAND IT WOULD ALSO GRANT HIM THE PRESUMED ABILITY TO RUN DIRECTLY THROUGH LITHUANIA TWART COLININ GRATIS WE DISCUSS YESTERDAY MEUN IF YOU THING THE PUTEN'S AMBITIONS SOMEHOW ANTERM JUST WONDERING WHY DID HE INVADE GEORGIA A THE LIKE TDS NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'S INVADED YOU GRAIN NON TS FIRST COUNTRY IS IN MATED SO A YOU GRANTING HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THAT HE IS JUST A MILD MAN OR PERSON WHO IS SEEKING TO PROTECT RUSSIAN INTEREST WITHOUT CROSSING SOVEREIGN BOREIS IGNORES YOU KNOW LIKE HIS ENTIRE RECHIME I HERE HERE HE WAS A THOUGH TRYING TO MAKE THE SORT OF QUASY

HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY LOYAL TO PEOPLE WHO PROFESSOTHER RELIGIONS WHICH COMES AS A BIT OF A SHOCK TO ALL THE JEWS WERE FORCED INTO THE PALE OF SETTLEMENTS OVER THE COURSE OF RUSSIAN HISTORY AND IT BUT

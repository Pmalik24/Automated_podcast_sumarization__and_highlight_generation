YESTERDAY MISCHOLOBAMA THE DEMOCRATS BREAK BLASS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY CANDIDATE SOUNDED OFF ON JOBIDON AND HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID AND YU WONDER WHERE PEOPLE WHERE ARE WE IN THIS THEY AWERE OUR HEARTS WHAT'S GOG TO HAPPEN IN THIS NEXT SELECTION I AM TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN BECAUSE OUR LEADERS MATTER WHO WE SELECT WHO SPEAKS FOR US WHO HOLDS THAT BULLY PULL PIT IT AFFECTS US IN WAYS THAT SOMETIMES I THINK PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANITE SHE'S SPEAKING FOR A LOT OF DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW WHE'RE DEEPLY WORRIED THAT JOBIDON IS GOING TO LOSE THE UPCOMIN ELECTION TODANALD TRUMP AN THE LAT IS POLLS SHOW THE DEMALS FROM IS IN FACT LEADING JOBIDON IN VIRTUALLY EVERY SWING STATE JOBIDON IS DEEPLY UNDER WATER SO YESTERDAY JOBIDON HEADED TO EMANUAL AMY CHURCH IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE WHELL SPEAKING BOUT THE EVILS OF WHITE SU PREMISY AND THE MAGIC OF DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION OF COURSE AND WHO WAS DOING SO AT THE CHURCH WHERE THE CHARLESTON MASKER TOOK PLACE WHERE WHITE SO PREMISIS MURDERED A BUNCH OF BLACK PERISTIONERS WHY WAS HE THERE WELL BECAUSE A SELECTION TIME AND JOBIDON KNOWS THE ONLY WAY HE IS GOING TO WIN RE ELECTION IS IF HE HAS HEAVY BLACK TURN OUT AT THE BALLOT BOX THAT'S THE WHOLE THING THAT'S BEEN THE SECRET SAUCE FOR DEMOCRATIC ELECT TORAL VICTORY IN RECENT ELECTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND JUST FIFTY THREE POINT FIVE PER CENT TO BLACK VOTERS SHUT UP VOTE IN TO THOUS AT AGHT WHEN BAROKOBOMA IS ON THE BALLET THAT NUMBER JUMP TO A RECORD SIXTY POINT EIGHT PER CENT IN TWENTY TWELVE IT'S SBITE TO A NEW RECORD SIXTY TWO PER CENT THEN BECAUSE BAROKOBAMA WAS NOT ON THE BALLOT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IT DROP BACK DOWN TO FIFTY FIVE POINT NINE PER CENT IN HILRED PLINTON LOST THE ELECTION WHEN JOBIDON ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT NUMBER REBOUNDED TO ALMOST FIFTY NINE PER CENT AND BLACK VOTERS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION WENT FOR JOBIDON ATTY NINETY TWO TO EIGHT CLIP VOTERS OF COLOR OVER ALL BY THE WAY REPRESENT FOUR IN TEN OF JOBIDN'S VOTES THE BLACK VOTE FOR JOBIDON IS GOINGTO BE ESPECIALLY IM PORTANT BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER VOTERS WHO VOTED JUST PROPORTIONATELY BY MAIL IN TWENTY TWENTY AN PROBABLY WILL NOT SHO UP THIS TIME IN THE SAME WAY BLACK VOTERS WERE THE SUB GROUP MOST LIKELY TO SHOP AND VOTE IN PERSON THAT MEANS THAT IF MAL AND BALLOT'S DROP IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION AND TURN OUT IN PERSON STAYS KIND OF THE SAME YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE HEAVY BLACK TURN OUT BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE SHUT UP IN PERSON IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO VOTE THIS WAY SO IT'S BACK TO THE OLD PLAY BOOK FOR JOBIDON RASHEL POLARIZATION THIS HAS BEEN THE PLAY BOOK FOR DEMOCRATS MY ENTIRE LIFE TIME BUT IT AS EXASCERBATED GREATLY BY BAROKOBAMA IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND JOBIDN KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THAT GAME BECAUSE HE WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REMEMBER THAT TIME IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THA SAID THE MIT ROMNY YES MINT ROMY MOST MILK TOST REPUBLICAN PERHAPS OF ALL TIN WAS GOING TO PUT BLACK AMERICANS IN CHAINS DURING THE TWENTY TWELVE RACE

CHAN WOT Y PUT YOULL BACKAN CI YES MIT ROMNY WAS GOING TO RE SLAVERY BLACK PEOPLE IN THE UNITED IN THE UNINTED STATES SURE THAT JOBIDEN MADE THAT CONTENTION IN TWENTY TWELVE AND IT WORE SO IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FAST FORD TWELVE YEARS ONGIN TO IT AGAIN JOBIDEN BY THEWAY IN TWENTY TWELVE AT NOT REMOTELY THE SAME AS JOBIDON AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT THAT MAN AS NOT IN A STATE OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DEPLINE WATCH THE TAPES OF JOBIDEN BACKED BACK FROM TWENTY TWELVE AND WATCH THE TAPES NOW HE WAS NEVER ANY GREAT SHAKES OR ATTORALY HE WAS NEVER ANY SORT OF MAGICALLY BRILLIANT HUMAN BEING BUT AT LEAST HE COULD SPEAK WORDS FROM HIS FACE HOLD WITH SOME LEVEL OF SOLIDITY THAT IS ALL OVER IN ANYCATES IS NOW TWENTY TWENTY FORT JOBIDO MEEDS BLACK VOTES AND IT WAS TIME TO HEAD TO A HISTORICALLY BLACK CHURCH VICTIMIZED BY WHITE VIOLENCE AN THEN PROCLAIM THAT HE IS GOING TO STAND UP AGAINST ALL THE EVIL WHITE AMERICANS WHO MIGHT VOTE FORADONAL TRUMP WE GET TO MORTH ISN'T JUST

TRUMP HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SHOOTING AT A MANUAL AAME CHURCH AN SOUTH CAROLINA AFTER ALL THAT TOOK PLACE INTWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT YET PRESIDEN WOS A YEAR BEFORE DONAL TRUMPETS PRESEN BROKOBOMO'S PRESIDENAT THE TIME BUT THE IDEA IS THET DONALD TRUMP'S IDEOLOGY IS THE SAME AS THE IDEOLOGY OF THE EVIL WHITE TOF PREMISES WHO SHOT UP THE CHURCH THAT WAS THE IDEA AND THAT'S WHI CJOBIDIN SHOWD UP THERE'S A REALLY CYNICAL PLAY AND IT'S A REALLY UGLY PLAY BUT T SOMETHING JOBIDON IS QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE GAIN BECAUSE HE HAS DONE IT BEFORE SO HE SHOWS UP AT THIS CHURCH AND THE AUDIENCE BEGINS CHEERING FOUR MORE YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN IN FORM BY RELIABLE SOURCES THAT CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM IS ONE OF THE GREAT THREATS TO AMERICA CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM THE ABUSE OF CHURCH FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES OF COURSE THAT ONLY MEANS THAT EVEN TELLICAL CHRISTIANS SHOULD NOT SUPPORTDONAL TRUMP ES OU BE CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM BUT WHEN YOU CHEER FOUR MORE YEARS IN A HISTORICALLY BLACK CHURCH WELL THAT MEANS JUST THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO DO APPARENTLY THT'S LIKE GOOD KIND OF CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM HER SOME OF THAT  E IAS A LOT OF HOLITICS AND A CHURCHRIGHT THERE AND WELL HE NEED SOMETHING IN HIS HAD SO PERHAPS IT WILL GO TO HIS HEAD PERHAPS IT WON'T THERE'S NOT MUCH WEFT UP THERE GEN THE THEME OF HIS CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE THE DONAL TRUMP IS A NOTSY THAT'S CAN BE THE THEME OF HIS CAMPAIGN AND HE'S LATED OUT IN HE PAST FOUR DAYS FIRST OF VALLY FORGE WHERE HE SUGGESTED THAT DONAL TRUMP LITERALLY WAS A NOTZY THAT HE'S REPEATING NOTSY SLUGANEERING AND THAT IF DONAL TRUMP ONE THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER ELECTIONS AND THEN ON MONDAY WHEN HE WENT TO THES CHURCH WHERE HE SUGGESTED TAT IF DONNAL TRUMP WINDS WHITE SUPREMACY WILL HAVE ON JOBIDEN LED OFF THI SPEECH BY OF COURSE TALKING ABOUT THE MASKER THAT TOOK PLACE IN JUNE OF  TWENTY FIFTEEN IN CHARLESTON SOUTH CAROLINA HERE E GO YOU SENDETY TWENTY FIFTEEN E BEAUTIFUL WOL FON WONGWONT WONS TE WHITIS TANOIE ETURCH PA WHORT OF GOB WAS CERS BOT BOLLT O HE WA CEBY WHAT IS GON PO BY POISO PHIT AS FOR TOO LONG POT IS TIS WHAT IS THAT POIS WHITE  SI PREMIS AND IN THIS IDEA THAT WHITE SUPREMACY'S A WIDE SPREAD IDEOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES IS ABSOLUTE SURE NONSENSE IS JUST NONSENSE TAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T DANGEROUS WHITE SUPREMASIS OUT THERE I KNOW THERE ARE MANY OF THEM SEND ME TO THREATS BUT THE IDEA THAT THAT IS LIKE A CHIEF THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW IN IDEOLOGY IN WHICH WHITE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE SUPREME TO OTHER RACES IN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS ZERIL POL DETA TO SUGGESTS THE WHITE SUPREMACY IS A SERIOUS UNDER LYING PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES AMERICANS GENERALLY SPEAKING DO NOT THINK LIKE THAT BUT THIS CONSTANT HARPING ON RACE WHICH IS WHAT BROKABOMA BEGAN IN TWENTY TWELVE REMEMBERAN WO THOUSAND EIHT HIM ROUND AS A RACIAL UNITER NOT A RACIAL DIVIDER IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HE RAN AS SOMEWHAT OF RACIAL DIVIDER HIS ENTIRE PLAN IN THE TWENTY TWELVE ELECTION WAS RACIAL POLARIZATION SO AS TO RIVE MINORITY TURN OUT AGAINST AGAIN MIT ROMNY THE MOST GENERIC REPUBLICAN IT IS POSSIBLE TO GENERIC AND IT WORKED BUHE CAN SEE THE RESULTS OF THAT NOW THEN THE MIT THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE TO TELL THEMSELVES IS THAT BITE SUGGESTING THAT WHITE SUPREMACY IS A CONTINUING VAST PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES THEYRE SOMEHOW MAKING TE UNITED STATES A BETTER PLACE AND THAT'S WHAT JOBIDON SUGGESTED YESTERDAY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BRINGING DOWN OF THE CON FEDERATE FLAG WHICH HAPPENED IN THE AFTER MATH OF THAT SHOOTING AT EMANUAL A M  YOU'LL RECALL THAT THE SHOOTER IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE THEIR PICTURES OF HIM WITH THE CON FEDERATE FLAG THIS TURNED INTO A NATION WY DEBATE OVER THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AND WHETHER IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE FLOWN IN ANY STATE MONUMENTS OR PURINANY STATE MONUMENTS WHATSOEVER IV HOUT THEI'R FRANKLY PRETTY GOOD ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISLE ON THAT PARTICULAR ON THAT PARTICULAR DIS AGREEMENT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THE CONFEDERATE FLAG IN THE SOUTH WAS MORE OF A CULTURAL THING THAT NO LONGER CALLED TO THE ORIGINAL PURPOSES OF THE CONFEDERACY OBVIOUSLY BLACK AMERICANS LOOKD TO THE CON FEDERATE FLAGNES AT WELL AG EYES THAT WAS THE CONFEDERACY NOW I THOUTHER WER GOOD ARGMENTS ON BOTH SIDE BUT THE NOTION THAD AMERICAN RACE RELATIONS GOT BETTER AS A RESULT OF THAT PARTICULAR DEBATE HAS BEEN BELIED BY YOU KNOW ALL O AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE THEN THERE WAS JOBINE PLAYING THIS GAME YOUR BROUGHT GOWN CANFEDERATE FWIAN E EEHE SO  MERIC COR  O WE CAN BE WONT TO BE SMO NOW IF YOU ONCE SO GIVE CREDIT FOR THAT SOMEBODY THE PERSON HE SHOULD CREDIT OF COURSE IS ONE OF THE R PUBLICANS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLE THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CARLINAT THE TIME TO KEE HALEY AND SO IF YOU SEE THIS IS A GOOD THING THE NICKEY HALEES THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY TOOK TO CONFEDERATE FLAG OFF OF MONUMENS AT THE AT THE STATE CAPITAL WITH ALL THAT SAID AGAIN THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THIS HELPED BRINGING DOWN THE TEM PERATURE AND RACE RELATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IS OBVIOUSLY UNTRUE WHEN JOBIDAN SAYS THAT THIS HELPE THE NATION HEAL IN LEMENT LEMES RE YOW THE POLESTATISTICS AGANDTHERE'S ONE MOST SHOCKING POLE STATISTICS IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY THESE THESE POLSTATISTICS IT SAIS QUOTE WOULD YOU SAID RELATIONS BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK PEOPLE ARE VERY GOOD SOMEWHAT GOOD SOMEWHAT BAD OR VERY BAD AD HERE THE STAFTS FOR VERY OR SOMEWHAT GOOD RIGHT GOOD RACE RELATIONS HA AS OF TWO THOUSAND ONE SEVENTY PER CENT OF BLACK AMERICANS SAID THET RACE RELATIONS WERE VERY OR SOMEWHAT GOOD AND SIXTY TWO PER CENT OF WHITE AMERICANS SAID THE SAME IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THOSE NUMBERS WERE SIXTY NINE PER CENTS WHITE AMERICANS SAID THEY WERE VERY GOOD OR SOMEWHAT GOOD FIFTY NINE PER CENT OF BLACK AMERICANS SAID THEY WERE VERY OR SOMEWHAT GOOD IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SEVENTY PER CENT OF WHITE AMERICANS SAD THAT RACE RELATIONS WERE VERY OR SOMEWHT GOOD AND SIXTY ONE PER CENT OF BLACK AMERICANS SAID THAT THEY WERE VERY OR SOMEWHAT GOOD IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN STILL SEVENTY TWO PER CENT OF WHITE AMERICANS SAID THAT RACE RELATIONS WERE VERY OR SOMEWHAT GOOD SIXTY SIX PER CENT OF BLACK AMERICANS SAID THEY WERE VERY OR SOMEWHAT GOOD AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT LAUNCH AND IT MADE THE CLAIM THAT AMERICASY DEEPLY RACEIS PLACE FILLED WITH WHITE SUPREMACY IT WAS AGAIN IN OVERHANG OF THE OBOMABIDIN TWENTY TWELVE CAMPAIGN EXTENDED FOURD IN TIME THROUGH TWENTY THIRTEEN END TWENTY FOURTEEN AND SO WHEN THE FURGUSIN RIOTS BROKE OUT AND BAROCOBOMA DECIDED TO TAKE THE SIDE OF THE RIOTERS EFFECTIVELY SPEAKING WHEN THAT HAPPENED WHEN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENTS TARES MAKE THE FALSE CLAIM THAN AMERICA WAS RACEST IN ALL OF ITSIDERATIONS RACE RELATIONS ABSOLUTELY PLUMETED IN THE UNITED STATES IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SEVENTY TWO PER CENT OF WHITE AMERICANS SAID RACE RELATIONS WERE GOOD AND SO TID SIXTY SIX PER CENTOF BLACK AMERICANS BY TWENTY FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE PER CENTS OF WHITE AMERICANS SAID RACE RELATIONS WERE GOOD THAT IS A TWENTY SEVEN PER CENTAGE POINT DROP AND STILS SIMULTANEOUSLY FIFTEEN PER CENT PER CENTAGE POINTS FEWER BLACK AMERICANS SAID RACE RELATIOS WERE GOOD ONLY FIFTY ONE PER CENT OF BLACK AMERICANS SAID RACE RELATIONS WERE GOOD THISIS BY TWENTY FIFTEEN THEN THOSE NUMBERS CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WELL JOBIDONIS PRESIDENT WITH A DEMOCRATIC SENTIT FORTY THREE PER CENT AVOITE AMERICAN SABRACES RELATIONS ARE GOOD AND ONLY THIRTY THREE PER CENT OF BLACK AMERICANS SA RACE RELATIONS ARE GOOD ONE THORD OF BLACKS AND FEWER THAN HALF OF WHITES SEBRACE RELATIONS ARE GOOD AGAIN THAT IS FROM SEVENTY TWO PER CENT AVOITS AND SIXTY SIX PERCENT OF BLACKS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN  WHY DID THAT HAPPEN AND THE ANSWER IS THE MORE YOU TALK ABOUT THE PULLARIZATION BETWEEN RACES THE MORE YOU PERTEND THAT THAT IS THE SOURCE OF AMERICAN CONFLICT THE WORST THING'S GET AN OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP CLASS PARTICULAR AND LEFT HAS A HEAVY STOCK IN DOING PARTICULARLY THIS AND SO JOBIDON BECAUSE HE NEEDS BLACKVOTS HE IS GOING TO TRY TO TRANS MUTE THE WHITE SUPREMACY SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED IN CHARLESTON INTO IT ABADE ABOUT JANUARY SIX NO I GAIN ACTING ITST O REALLY AWKWARD FIT THEY'RE VERY FEW PEOPLE BLACK WAR WHITE WHO BELIEVE THAT DONAL TRUMP IS TO BE VICIOUS ANTI BLACK RACIS AGAIN ONE OF DONAL TRUMP'S SIGNAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHYN I JUST AGREED WITH WAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM WHICH WAS PUSH FORWARD BY TRUMP AND VANJONES WAS A BLACK ADVOCATE OBVIOUSLY BUT THIS IS JOBIDON'S PLITE RACIALLY POLORIZE THE

ANDTHERE IS SOMETHING MAGNIFICEN GOING ON WITHTHE CONFEDERACY ANDTHAT THAT COS HAD BEEN LOST IN THE AFTERMOUTH IN THAT THE SOUTH WAS RUINED AND ALL OF THIS BY THE LOST OF THE CIVIL WAR HE'S TRYING TO

TRYING TO LINK UP THE LOST CAUSED NARRATIVE ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR WITH DONALD TRUMP CLAIMING THAT HE ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION IS THAT THAT'S SUCH AN INSANE STRETCH THAT'S SUCH IT  AND IT'S SO OVISCIN WHAT HE IS DOING IT SO OBVIOUS THIS CULMINATED IN JOBIDIN CALLING TONAL TRUMP A LOSE OR TWO WHILD APPLAUSE AT THIS CHURCH AGAIN WHEN WILD APPLAUS HAPPENS AT A CHURCH FOR POLITICAL FIGURES WERE

BIDAN CONCLUDED THIS SPEECH BY SUGGESTING ONCE AGAIN THAT JANUARY SEXAS ALL THAT JANUARY SEXFORT FROBIDON IT'S THT IT JUST CAN BE GANUOUS SEX FROM NOW UNTIL THE END OF TIME FOR JOBIDON HE IS NOW CONNECTING THAT TO OPPOSITION TO DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION D I IS AN OUTGROWH THE POSTMODERNIST THEORY TO VOU A VERY BRIEF ONE MINUTE SYNOPSIS OF WHAT D E I IS IN ITS HISTORY POST MODERNISM IS A PHILOSOPHY THAT SAYS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TRUTH THERE IS JUST POWER PROMOTED BY WE SHALL WU CALL AMONG OTHERS THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT ANY THING YOU BELIEVE IS NOT ACTUALLY A BELIEF IN A TRUTH OR AN Y SYSTEM WHAT YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVES H REFLECTION OF YOU'RE OWN DESIRE FOR POWER AND THAT MEANS THAT ALL THE SYSTEMS IN AMERICA ARE NOT ABOUT WHETHER THEY WORK WHET THEY KNOWNT WHETHE'R FARE WHETHER THEY'RE NOT THE'RE JUST ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO SUCCEED UNDER THAT SYSTEM CREATING POWER STRUCTURES TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES THOU'S FIRST TRANSMUTED BY MARXIS INTO CLAIMS ABOUT RICH AMERICANS WERE ITS STRUCTURING THE SYSTEM FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT AND THET WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK IT WAS TRANSMUTED INTO RACIAL CLAIMS THOSE RACIAL CLAIMS BECAME CRITICAL RACE THEORY THE BASIC IDEA BEING THAT ALL THE STRUCTURES OF AMERICAN SOCIETY ARE INHERENTLY RACE IS PERPETRATED BY WHITE SUPREMISES IN ORDER TO REINFORCE THAT SUPREMACY AND THAT TRANSMUTED INTO DIVERSITY EQUITY IN INCLUSION THE BASIC IDEA OF WHICH IS THAT AGAIN ALL THE SYSTEMS OF AMERIC ARE FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEEN AND THE WAY YOU CAN TELL THIS IS BECAUSE THEREIS UNEQUAL OUTCOME BY GROUP AND THAT CAN ONLY BE RECTIFIED BY UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF GROUPS THAT'S WHAT DIVERSITY EQUIT E AN INCLUSION IS AND THIS JOBITN'S PITCH HIS PITCH TO BLACK AUDIENCE IS IS THAT HE IS GOING TO CREATE SPECIAL CARVEOUTS FOUR BLACKS THAT IS WHAT HE IS DOING RIGHT HERE THAT THAT THAT IS WHY HE IS SAYING THE SORT OF TUFF ITS WHY HE'S TRYING TO LINK UP ALL OF THIS INTO ONE GIANT BALL OF MISSH MASH SO HERE HE GOES CAN A LINK TOGETHER IN THIS STATEMENT JANUARY SIXTH IN ATTEMPT TO DESTROY D E EY AND E ZERO SUMMIT VIEW OF AMERICA WHICH IS AMAZING BY HE WAY BECAUSE D E EYE IS INHERENTLY A ZERO SOME VIEW OF AMERICA WHEN YOU SAY D E I IS THE SITUATION THAT WE SHOULD PROMOTE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT BASICALLY THER SHOULD BE RICIAL QUOTAS RACHAL QUOTAS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE ZERO SUM IF THERE IS ONE SLOT AND HAS TO GO TO EITHER OF THE MOST MERITORIOUS CANDIDATE OR THE MOST DIVERSE CANDIDATEIN THE NOT THE SAME PERSON IN THIS PARTICULAR SENAREA IF THAT HAPPENS ONE PERSON GETS THE SLOT THAT IS BY DEFINITION A ZERO SOME GAME A MERITOCRACY IS NOT A ZERO SOME GAME BECAUSE THERE ARE POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES TO THE MRITOCRACY IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE ARE BESTET THE JOB GET THE JOB THAT HELPS EVERYBODY WHEN IT COMES TO DI VERSITY EQUIN INCLUSION THERE ARE NO POSITIVE EXTRONALITIES THERE ARE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WIN IN PEOPLE WHO LOSE BUT THAT'S THE OPS OF WHICH YO BIDIN IS PREACHING BECAUSE HE'S FIDING WHY LETAGA I CET PART OF A BROATER TACK AN A CUANE MERICAN

SUGGEST THE THE MERITOCRACY IS DEEPLY FLOUD AND IS IN FACT A REAN FORCEMEN GURDER FOR POWER WHAT YOUARE TRYING TO DO IS HOLD DOWN THE MERITORIOUS THIS HERISON BURGERAN BY CURTVONEGAT YOUAR TAKING THE MOST MERITORIOUS AND YOU ARE SADLING THEN WITH BURDENS IN ORDER TO CONICL MAKE THINGS MORE EQUAL  MOST FAMOUS QUOTALONG THESE LINES THAT THAT SPRINGS TO MINE YOUR IS BAROCOBOLABEING ASKED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IF INCREASING THE CAPITAL GAINSTACK ACTUALLY LOWERED ECONOMIC GROWTH WOULD HE'D STILL DO IT AND HE SUID YEST FOR PURPOSES OF FAIRNESS BECAUSE DRAGGING PEOPLE BACK DOWN TO THE MEDIAN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVERYBODY RISING EVEN IF THAT RATE OF INCREASE IS UNEQUAL AND THIS IS IN THE NUTSHELL JOBIDEN'S CAMPAIGN THIS IS WHY HE'S NOT CAN BE ABLE TO LEKO OF T YAH GOBN IS NOW RUNNING DIRECTLY INTO A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM THAT HE HAS IS THAT THE WAY THAT HE COULD WIN IS THEORETICALLY TO GO TO CLINTONIAN TURD WAY HE COULD YHOU GO CLINTONIAN DOR WAY AND YO COULD WIN AGAIN IF YOU GO BACK TWO ABLECTIONS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ONE IN THE PAST WHAT YOU'LL SEAT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ELECTIONS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ONE WHERE BLACK VOTERS DID NOT SHO UP IN THE KINDS OF NUMBERS THEY SHOWED UP FOR FOR BAROCOBAMA FOR EXAMPLE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE BLACK TURN OUT RAHTE WAS FIFTY FOUR PER CENT BILKLINTON ONE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE BLACK TURN OUT RATE WAS FIFTY PER CENT BILKCLINTON ONE IN TO THOUSAND BLACK TURN OUT RAHT WAS FIFTY THREE ONE FIVE PER CENT GEORGE STOL BE BUSH ONE BUT ALGOR ONE TH POPULAR VOTE AND WHAT THEY COULD DO IS THEY COULDN RE BUILD A COL LITION OF WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS BUT GOBINON ONE DO THAT GOBIDON IS A BELIEVER IN THE BARACOBOMICOLITION WHICH IS FOUR IN TEN DEMOCRATIC VOTERS BEING OF COLOR AND PANDRING TO BEOPLE I THAT IS THE BASIC IDEA HERE AS OE CAN'T LET GO OF D YAI AND HE ALSO CAUNT LET GO OF HIS RATICAL RACIALIZED LEFT WING HE CAN'T DO IT NOW THE COSTS OF D YAI ARE VERY CLEAR TO THE UNITED STATES YOUR STARING  SEEAT A CORPORATIONS BY THE WAY WHO ARE ALL LETTING GO OF THIS YESTRUNONSENSE THAT'S ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNMENTS NONSENSE THAT IS DESIGNED TWO ESSENTIALLY SUBSUME THE PROFITABILITY OF CORPORATIONS IN FAVOR OF LEFT WING IDEOLOGY AND CORPORATIONS ARE LETTING GO OF THAT BECAUS COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND IT UNDER MINES MORAL AND IT UNDER MINES THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO DO BUS NESS BUT THE COS OF D YI ARE INSANELY HIGH I INSANELY HIGH FOR EXAMPLE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ACCORDING TO THE COLLEGE FIXES THE UNERERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAS AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE PAID IMPLOYES NOW FOCUSTD ON D YI PAYROL CLOS EXCEED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THOU COVER INSTACTUITION AND FEES FPROMOST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED GRADUATE STUDENTS THIRTEEN D YI STAFF MEMBERS ARE MORE THAN TWO HUNDED DOUSEN DOLLARS WHAT EXACTLY V THEY ADDED TO THE UNIVERSYA MICHIGAN SO FAR NOTHING AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE AGAIN D YI IDEOLOGY WHICH IS ROOTED IN THE IDEA THAT THE ONLY REASON CERTAIN GROUP SUCCEED IN AMERICA AND CERTIN GRUPS FAL IS B KAS OF INEQUITY AND EVIL THAT IDEOLOGY HAS PROMOTED RADICALISM YEU CAN SEE THAT BY THE WAY THERE'S THAT IN AMAZING CLIP THIS NOW MAKING THE ROUNDS FROM GOOGELS D YI LEADER OF PERSONAMED ADRAEL PARKER EXPLAINING WY D YI IS GOOD TBECAUSE THE OPPOSIT WOULD BE TO TEACH PEOPLE TO BE COLOR BLIND WHICH APPARENTLY IS BAD THE KEEP TELLING PEOPLE THAT OVER AND OVER I SO FRESTRATING AND I WAS JUST ON TIKTOK AND THERE'S THE TRAN WHERE PARENT THEIRE TEACHING THEIR KIDS NOT TO SEE COLOR QTN AND UNLIKE O KIS SO THAT A NEXT ROUND OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONG TO BE JOINING OUR WORK FOR ITS THAT'S NEXT GENERATION AN ARE GONG TO BE DEALING WITH THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW BECAUSES THE THA DON'T TEE COLER THEU DONOST THE ME YOU DON'T CARE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE STRUGGLES THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME FATH THAT THAT'S A WILD STATEMENT THAT F YOU TEACHER KIS TO BE COLOR BLIND THAT SOMEHOW TERRIBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SEEN THE STRUGGLES OF THE PEOPLE FACE WHL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THAT PERSONS ACTUALY IS THE PERSON WHO IS LEADING D YAIA GUGL WHAT WHAT IS THE ADDITIONAL STRUGGLE THIS PERSON IS EXPERIENCING DID CLOUDYING GAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL STRUGGLERS OR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THANKS TO HER RACE THIS IS INSANE IND STAD OF LOOKING T PEOPLE AS INDIVIDUALS THY LOOK AT THEM AS MEMBERS OF GROUPS AND TEN THEY SUGGEST THAT THIS IS HOW WE OUGHT TO JUDGE PEOPLE THIS ALS O BY THE WAY LEADST ANTISEMITISM BCAUE THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN D YA AND ANTISEMOTISM IT'S A VENDIAGRAM CIRCLE WHY WHET BECAUSE D IS A CONSPIRACY HEAR ABOUT POWER IT SUGGESTS THAT THE MOST POWERFUL AN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE MUST HAVE GOT IN THEIRE THROUGH EXPLOITATION AND EVIL AND THEN PEOPLE ON THE LEFT LOOK AND THEY SEE THE JEWS ARE DIS PROPORTIONATELY SUCCESSFUL IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEY LOOK AT ISRAEL VERS TO THE PALICINIANS AND THEY SEE THAT ISRAEL IS A DISTPROPORTIONATELY SUCCESSFUL STATE A WILDLY SUCCESFUL STATE IN A DEEPLY UN SUCCESSFUL PART OF THE WORLD AND THEY SAY WELL SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BEN VICTIMIZED IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THAT'S THE ZEROSOM VIEW OF THE WORLD AND JOBIDN CAUNTLETICO HE CAN'T LET GO THAT ZEROSOM VIEW OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THAT'S HOW HE FEELS HE IS GOING TO WIN ELECTION WHICH IS WHY YESTERDAY AT EMANUAL AMI IN THE IDDLE OF THE SPEECH A BUNCH OF PROTESTORIS GOT UP AND THEY STARTED CHANCING ABOUT GOZA NOW THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FORJO BIDEN TO HAVE WHAT USE TO BE CALLED A SISTER SOLDIER MOMENT SO VERY FAMOUSLY BILL CLINTON WHEN WHE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO K MADE A STATEMENT IN WHICH HE WENT OFF ONSESS TO SOLDIER WHY BECAUSE IN THE MDDLE OF THAT CAMPAGN SH DIDN'T INTERVIEW SIS TE SOLDIER WAS A A H POP M C AND POLITICAL ACTIVE IS IN ALL THIS AND SHE MADE A COMMENT IN AN INTERVIEW AT THE WASHINGTON POST SHE AS ASKED A QUESTION QUOTE EVEN THE PEOPLE THEMSELVESWHO ARE PERPETRATING THE VOUNDS TO THE ELLE RIOTS DOD THEY THINK THAT WAS WISE WAS THAT A WISE REASONES ACTION AND SHE SAID YAT IT WAS WISE I MEAN OF BLACK PEOPLE KILL BLACK PEOPLE EVERY DAY WHY NOT HAVE A WEEK AN KILL WHITE PEOPLE WHITE PEOPLE THATS GOVERNMENT IN THAT MAYOR WERE WELL AWARE OF THE FACK THAT BLACK PEOPLE WARE DYING EVERY DAY IN ALLAY UNDER GANG VIOLENCS SO F YOU'RE GANGMEMBER AND YOU NORMALLYTY KILLING SOMEBODY WHY NOT KILL AWHITE PERSON DOU THINK SOMEBODY THINKS THAT WHITE PEOPLE ARE BETTER ARE ABOVE IN BEYON TINE WHEN THEY WOULD KILLD THEIR OWN KINE SO CLINTON SPEAKING BY THE WAY AT THE RAINBOW COLITION JUSSHE JACKSONS ORGANIZATION IN NINETEN NINETY TWO RUNNG FOR PRESIDENT RESPONDED TO THAT QUOTATION AND TO SOMETHING THAT SOLDIER HAD SAID IN A MUSIC VIDIO WHERE SHE SAID WHAT IF THERE ARE ANY GOOD WHITE PEOPLE I HAVE MET THEM AND CLIN SAID IF YOU TOOK THE WORDS WHITE AND BLACK AND YOU REVERSE THEM YOU MIGHT THINK DAVID DUKE WAS WAS GIVING ET SPEECH RAIN OUT THAT PROBABLY ONE BILL CLINTON NOT JUST THE NOMINATION BUT THE PRESIDENCY ARE THAT THAT WAS A THATSE VERY WIDELY REPORTED AT THE TIME THE SORT OF SISTA SOLD JOUR MOMENT BECAME A BUZZWORD N AMERICAN POLITICS A SPEAKING TRUTH TO PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN PARTY OR TO RADICAL BUT JOBIDON ISN'T DOING THAT SO JOBIDON HAS MUCH PROTESTORS WHO GET UP IN THY START CHANTING IN FAVOR OF COMOSTRATE THEY SAY THEY WANT A CEASE FIRE IN GOZI THEY ONA SEAS FARN GOZA  BY THE WAY ASCOMSS CONTINUES TO KILL HIS RALLY SOLDIERS AND HOLD FEMALES HOSTAGE WORTH MENTIONING HERE BY THE WAY THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS APPARENTLY REFUSES TO SPEND ANY TIME TRYING TO VISIT THE FEMALE HOSTAGES WHO'RE BEING HELD IN THE WORST POSSIBLE CONDITIONS AND AN IS RALY SOLDIERS WO ARE TRYING TO FREE THOSE HOSTAGES AND KILL MEMBERS O COMMASARE DYING EVERYDAY DOES JOBIDAN SAY TO THESE RADICALS GIS YOURT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMASS IS IN EVIL GROUP TAT MUST BE EXTRAPATED DOES HE SAY THAT DOES YOU SAY YOU'R BELIEF THAT COMMAS IS SOME SORT OF PART OF THE BROADER RASHAL MATRICS INTO WHICH YOU HAVE CAST AMERICA IS JUST FALSE THAT IT'S A WY THAT YOURE BEZAR IDEA THAT PALSINIANS ARE BROWN AND HIS RALIES ARE WHITES THAT THATS STUPID THAT'S NOT HOW YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT MORALITY TOS JOBIDON TO THAT NOW HE CONCEDES THEM BECAUSE HE HAS TO CONCEIDE TOS RADICAL LEFT TO IN BASE CAUSE HE THINKS THAT RADICAL LEFT TOIN BASES IS KIN NEN TO TURN OUT IN VAST NUMBERS TO WIN HIM REELECTION BY THE WAY THAT SIS HOW YOU WOOZE THE MIDDLE IN THIS COUNTRY IT TURNS OUT SIXTY TWO PER SON OF AMERICANS ONE AMERICA TO GIVE MORE SUPPORT ISRAEL AND ITS CURRENT WAR AGAINST COMAS BUT HERE IS JOBIDON BEING ABSOLUTELY CASTRATED BY A BUNCH OF RADICAL PROTESTORS AT THE CHURCH WY CO TUE HERE'S NO WIHE WAL WIKEER DON'T  AN YOU GARWAES CANE WANE WYWE WORE  WYWE WOR YO ES YOURA GOR CAN GET CAN CAN    ONE GOT YOUSYO OL  NOW THESE ARE MUNCH AN NUTS INSIDE THE CHURCH I

INTERNATIONALLY PRIITED CHEMICAL WEPONS ARE BEING DROPPED ON ARABS AGAIN FINANCE BY AMERICAN TAX PAYER DOLLARS ET CETERA ET CETERA THE PROTESTORS WERE CALLING FOR A PERMANENCEES FIRE AN END OF THE OSE GOVERNMENTS ARMING OF HIS RAAL IN END TO THE SES OF GAZA AN ENTUSINIST OCCUPATION THEY BELIEVE BY THE WAY THAT ZINASTOCPICH MEANS TELL OF EVE AND THE RELEASE OF ALL PALISINIAN POLITICAL PRISONERS WHICH MEANS THE RELEASE OF TERRIS THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE CALLING FOR AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY KANCER SAY NO NOW ONE O THE REASONS THE EMCRATIC PARTY CANNOT SAY NO USE BY POLINGDID OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COLITION INCLUDES A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SYMPATHIZE WITH COMOSS IT IS UNFORTUNATE IS AN UNFORTIUNATE REALITY IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THINGS THAT WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE NATIONAL STORIES IF THE ATHNICITIES WERE DIFFERENT ARE NOT NATIONAL STORIES LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SO APPARENTLY ON THURSDAY NIGHT THERE IS A GIRLS BASKETPBALL GAME TBETWEEN A SCHOOL CALLED THE LEFFEL SCHOOL A PRIVATE JEWISH SCHOOL IN HARTSTALE AND A SCHOOL CALLED ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN YONKERS THEY PLAYED A NON LEAGUE GIRLS BASKETBALL GAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME WHICH TURN PHYSICALLY VIOLAN A ROOSEVELT PLAYER TOLD THAY VISITING JEUISHPONENT I SUPPORT COMAS YOU EFFING JEW AT ACCORDING TO THE YERK POST THE JEWISH SCHOOL HAD COACH HELD THEDISCUSSIOWON T PLAYERS THEY DECIDE TO END THE GAME AFTER THE THIRD QUARTER FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT LEFFELSENIOR PLAYER ROBIN BOS WITH ROTE NOR BED SAYING THE RIGHT FROM THE BEGINING OF THE GAME THE R SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CHAPS IN COMMONS THROWN AT THE PLAYERS AREN'TING THE MR HAVE EXPERIENCED IN A LONG TIME PARENTLY THE ROSEVELT PLAYERS WERE SHOUTING FREE PALISTONE ALONG WITH T ANTISMETIC SLORERS SHE SAID I HAVE PLAY TA SPORT EVERY ATHLETIC SEASOND THOUGHOUT MY HIGH SCHOOL CRAVE NEVER EXPERIENCE THIS KIND OF HATRED DIRECTED AT ONE MY TEAMS BEFORE INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TATR T MORE THE SAME WE CHOSE TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THE SITUATION SO WHY WAS IN THIS NATIONAL STORY IF THIS HAD BEEN AND A BLACK TEE BEING INSULTS BY WHITE PEOPLE USING THE EN WORD THEN THATWOULD BE A NATIONAL NEWSTORY FOUR LIKE A WEEK WHY DIDN'T WHELL BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK TAE PICTURES OF THE GAME IT WAS MINORITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO'RE INSULTING JEWS AND THAT MEANS THE INTERSECTIONAL VI THE INTERSECTIONAL HIERARCHY HAS NOT BEEN VIOLATED THIS IS THE PROBLE D IES PROM WITH RATICALS INSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BASE AND BY THE WAY THIS IS MATASTICIZING ACCORDING TO RESIME BUILDER DOT COM IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO RAS MAY BILDER SURVEYED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE TYOU HAS HIRING MANAGERS AD RECRUITERS ABOUT THEIR VIEWS ON JEWS K FINDINGS TWENTY SIX PER CENT OF HIRING MANAGERS SAY THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO MOVE FORARD WITH JEWISH APPLICANTS TBECAUSE QUOTE JEWS HAVE TOO MUCH POWER AND CONTROL AND TWENTY SIX PER CENT MAKE SUMPTIONS ABOUT WEATHER A CANDITATED JEWISH BASED NON APPEARANCE TWENTY THREE PER CENT THA THEY WANT FEUR JEWS IN THEIR INDUSTRY D E I AMOUNTS TO THIS BUT THAT'S NOT ALL D  IS D I ALSO SUGGESTS OF COURSE THAT AMERICAS SYSTEMS ALL OF THEM IN CLUTING ARMIGRATION SYSTEM ARE DEEPLY RASIS AND THE ONLY WAY TO RECTIFY THAT IS AS AOS HE SAYS TO LEGALIZE EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO CROSS THE BORDER EVERYTHING IS SEEN BY THE WAY BY DEMOCRATS IN TERMS OF THIS SORT OF RACIAL CONFLICT THIS IS WHY MAYOR BRANDAN JOHNSON THE MAL LORY LIGHTFOOT OF CHICAGO HE SAYS THWHEN GREG ABBOT IS SENDING ILLEGAL EMIGRANS TO MASOR DEMOCRATIC CITIES HE'S DOING SO BE CAUSE HE TARGEING BLACK PEOPLE EVERY GAME IS PLAYED THE SAME WAY IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CIRCLES IS REALLY UGLY HERE EGO WHAT ARE YOU THOUGHTS ABOUT THE CASE TAND IS THIS AN ACTION YOU WULD CONSER OF TAKIN AS WOIL WE IN A LOOK YOURE VERY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT THE INTENTIONS OF GOVERNOR ABIT HE IS A CACKING DEMOCRATICALLY RAND CITIES AN PORTRICTLY CITIES THAT ARE BEING LED OM BY BLACK LEADERS AR LEADERS OF COLOR THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE OMIT'S A VERY RAGGOTY APPROACH QUITE FRANKLY NOW IS TAN RECKLESS AND RAGEDY  BUT IT IS EVIL SPIRITED IT IS EVIL SPIRITED WHY IT'S APPARENTLY RACIS IT'S RACIS TO ASK THAT A SANCTUARY CITY TAKE IN YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO PROVIDE SANCTUARY AND THIS HAS TO BE WHAT'S MOTIVATING YOS POLICY AT THIS POINT IS YOUST POLICY IS A BLEEPSHO UNDERSTAND THE'R BUNCH OF FACTOR SAID THE BORDER THE BIGGEST FACTOR OF COURSE IS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS CHANGED TUUCH LAWS SO THAT IF YOU APPLY FOR ASYLUM WHICH MEANS LITERALLY YOU ARRIVE ON THE BORDER AND YOU SAY I FEAR TO GO BACK TO MY HOME COUNTRY WE WILL PROCESS YOU AND WEILL LET YOU INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES ALAHANDRA MAORCAS TOL BORPATRAL AGENTS THAT QUOTE ABOVE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF ALL ILLEGAL EMIGRANS ARRIVING ONTHE BORDER ARE RELEASED INTO TE UNITED STATES NOW FOR A LONG TIME TITL FORTY TWO ALLOWED PEOPLE TO BE TURNED BACK FROM THE BORDER THAT YOU SAID WERE NOT TAKING YOU IN GO BACK TO YOUR  GO BACK THE MEXICAN SIDE OF THE BORDER BUT THAT IS NO LONGER HAPPENING BECAUSE TITALE FORTY TO HIS ENDED BY THE BY DE MINISTR ATION AND SO NOW ABOVE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE STROWING UP ON THE BORDER JUS RELEASED INTO THE UNITED STATES THAT'S INSANE MAY ARCA SAID LAST WEK ONS PUSTUOR A BOART WELL MORE THAN A MILLION MIGRANTS RELEASED INTO THE UNITED STATESY ANNUALLY AND ARGUED REPEATEDLY TOS UP TO CONGRESS POVIDMOR FUNNING SO THEI'S MORE THAN A MILLION RELEASED INTO THE UNITED STATES ANNUALLY THN THAT TWO POINT THREE MILLIONS TO TISTIC THAT THE DE  CHEST RELEASED THE OTHER DAY IS A LI IT'S NOT TRUE IT MEANS THAT OVER THE COURSE OFTHIS ADMINISTRATION ACCORDING TO MERICAS HIMSELF AT LEAST THREE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO THE UNITED STATES BOARD PATROL AGENTS HAVE TOLD ME THEYRELEASED A MILLION NOWN GODAWAYS WHICH MEANS THAT'RE PROBABLY ANOTHER SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNKNOWN GODAWAYS IF THEIRE PERCENTAGES ARE CORRECT SEEORE TALKING ABOUT UNDER JOBIDN AMINIMUM ABOUT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ENTERED THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY YOU KNOW THIS BENEFITS BY THEWAY THE DRUGCAR TELLS THE DRUGCAR TELLS ARE MAKIN ABSOLUTE BANK ON THIS SORT OF STUFF ACCORDING TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AIN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CARTELLS MADE THOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS JUST FROM HUMAN TRAFFICING AND SMUGGLING BECAUSE EVERYBODY WHO IS CROSSING THE BORDER IS PAYING THE COYOTES SIX THOUSAND EIGHT THOUSAND UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM BEING SMUGGLED ACROSS THE BORDER AND BY THE WAY THE DRUGCARTALLS ARE USING THOSE VAST NUMBER OF E LEGAL MIGRANTS IN ORDER TO STRACT BORDER PATROL FROM POLICING THE OTHER PARTS OF THE BORDERS WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DROP OFF A HUGE CONTINGENTS OF ILLEGAL IMIGRANS AT SOME BORDER PATROL WAY STATEION AND THEN BECAUE OF JOBIDAN ALL TESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE BUSSED TO A TENTIONTENTER AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE AND THEN PROSSESS AND LET INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBEL UP TO NINETY PER CENT OF ALL BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE NOW STAFFED ON BUSSING AND ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES E'VE TURNED THEM INTO BABY SITTERS AND MEANWHILE THE ENTIRE BORDER IS LEFT COMPLETELY ON MAN WHICH MEANS THET PEOPLE ARE RUSHING ACROSS THE BORDER OF THE ONES WHO DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT IF VAS MAJORITY PEOPLE WALKING INTO THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY ONE TO GET CAGHT THEY ARE WALKING ACROSS AND THEYARE WAVING AT T BORD PATROL AGENTS AND SAYING HAY PICK ME UP COME TAKEME BUT ONE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT ARE ABLE TO EVADE ARREST BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BOARD PATROL AGENTS ANYWHERE ALONG LARGE SUAST OF THE AMERICAN MEXICO BORDER AND WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THE AMOUNT OF FENTINEL IN THE COUNTRY EXTRAORDINARILY RISING ACCORDING TO THATS SAME HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE FENTINEL COST AS LITTLE AS TEN CENTS TO PRODUCE THAT'S A FATE PRESCRIPTION PILL LAYE WITHENINEL IT CAN BE SOLD FOR TEN TOF THIRTY BUXS WHICH MEANS TEN KELOS OF FENTINEL ARE WITH ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS CATE JUST TO EXPLAIN HOW MUCH FENTINEL IS NOW ENTERING THE COUNTRY IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ACCORDING TO BORDER PATROL ITSELF FENTINEL SEISURES ES UR JUST WHAT WAS SEES IS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAN TO POUNDS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS FENTINEL THAT WOULD CALCULATE OUT TO ALMOST TWENTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FENTINEL THAT WAS CUAUD AT THE BORDER AND WAYMORE IS GETTING THROUGH THEN IS GETTING CUAUGHT THESE THE SUP THAT'S GETTING CAUGHT AT THE BORDER ARE MORONS QOR LARGELY TRYING TO BRING IT THROUGH PORTS OF ENTORY OR PEOPLE QUAR GETTING QUAUGHT WHICH IS THE MINORITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE NOW ENTERING THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY BUT APPARENTLY IT'S RACES TO MENTION ANY OF THIS APPARENTLY IT'S BIGOTED TO MENTION ANY OF THIS THERE IS NO REASON TO LEAVE THE BORDER OPEN THE WAY THE BORDER HAS BEEN LEFT OPEN AND MEXICO IS HOLDING JOBIDON OVER THE BARREL APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO FOX NEWS MEXCO'S PRESIDENT IS NOW DEMANDING TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS BASICALLY IN CASH PLUS WORK PERMITS FOR TEN MILLION PEOPLE FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER IN EXCHANGE FOR IMMIGRATION HELP ALSO MEXICO SAYS THE UNITED STATES HAS TO END IT'S BLOCKADE ON CUBA AND COUT VENIZWALAS ANCTIONS BECAUSE BLOPAZOBNADOR WHIS THE LEADER OF THE EXICAN GOVERNMENT IS IN FACT A PENCO SOCIALIST AND SO HIS ALLIED WITH THE ENTIRE PINK UAVE THAT HAS HAPPENED FROM VENIZUAYLA TO CUBA TO MEXICO DEBASITLLY WANTE THE UNITED STATES TO SURRENDER TO HIM THE ONLY REASON THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY AND EARTH WOULD SURRENDER TO THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS AN INTERNAL BELIEF INSIDE THE UNITED STATES THE YOU HALF TO SURRENDER ON ILEGAL MAGRATION BECAUSE IT IS UNJUST THET PEOPLE CANCHUS TO ENTER THE OTHER SOUTHERN BOARDER WILLIE NILLY SO WHAT AR THEY DO THAY JULY ABOUT IT SO SECRETARY OF HOMLAN SECURIDTY ALLAHANDRO MAYORCAS WHO ONSAN I DON'T KNOW MAYORCUS'S PERSONAL ROLE IN THIS VERSEES JOBIDONS ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT JOBIDON AND ALLAHAN DRO AMERICAS WHO MADE IT EASIER TO CROSS THE SOUTHERN BORDER THAN ANY TIME IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY BY FAR IT IS NOT

IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THET WHENN INDIVIDUAL IS RELEASE THEY ARE RELEASE YOU TO IMIGRATION INFORS E PROCEEDINGS WERE THEY CAN MAKE CLAIM UNDER THE LOSS TAT CONGRESS HAS PASSEED I' GAE LEME SLIMITHAT

THESE YHUSON AIR PORT WHERE YOU ARE FLOWNG TO WHATEVER YOU WISH TO GO THAT IS WHAT HE MEANS BY EMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT'S LIKE ONE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK AT ARRESTED FOR GOING ON A BRIDGE AND N THEYRE RELEASED WITH A SHOPEN COURT LATER DATE WAS THAT REALLY A PUNISHMENT PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE WHO GET THAT SHOW P LATER ATE ARE NEVER GON A SHOP AGAIN WHY WOULD THEY THEY LIKE TID TO GET EXPELLED WHO THEY GUD JUST YOU KNOW DISAPPEAR INTO THE INJERIOR AN EVER SHOP AGAIN AND ICE IS NOT CAN GO GET THEM BECAUSE ICE HAS NOT BEEN TASKED BY THE BY DEMINISTRATION WITH FOLLOWING UP WITH ANY OF THESE PEOPLE THE BY ADMINISTRATION IS NOT SENDING ICE TO GO ROUND UP ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO RELEASED WHEN THEY MISSE THEIR SELL BY DATE THEIR COURT DATE THE BY ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID UNLESS YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD WE ARED NOT GOING TO DO THAT UNLESS YOU COMMIT AN ACT OF CRIMINALITY WERE NOT CON TO DO THAT WHICH IS BY THE WAY WHY THE NUMBER OF DEPORTATIONS FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES AS RADICALLY DROPPED UNDER JOBIDEN THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON TO DO THIS IS IDEOLOGICAL IT IS CERTAINLY NOT DRIVEN BY AMERICA'S BEST INTERESTS IT'S D E I RELATED AGAIN BECAUSE D E I IS JUST COD FOR AMERICA IS CISTUMS OUR WHITE SUPREMISIS AND THEREFORE AMERICA HAS TO FIX LL OF ITS SYSTEMS BY BENDING OVER BACKWARD ANY TIME THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT WHITE INVOLVED IN A IN A PROCEEDING THAT BE THE BASIC IDEA RIGHT HERE AND MEANWHILE ON THE TRUM SIDE OF THE ISLE AN INSANE STORY N IF YOU VOGT OURE PUBLIC OFFICIALS CAN'T GET ANY MORE CORRUPT IN RIDICULOUS WRONG YOU ARE ACCORDING TO THE ATLANTIC JOUNAL CONSTITUTION DISTRICT ATTORNEY FANNY WILLIS REMEMBER HER SHE'S LOWN WHO FIRED FILED A RECO CASE AGAINST DONAL TRUMP FOR ELECTION INTERFERENCE

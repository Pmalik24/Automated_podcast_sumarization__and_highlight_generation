SASHO SPONTERBAKS PRESSVEPIEN THOUSANDS MY LISTERS HAVE ALREADY SECURED THIR NETWORKDATA JOIN THEM ATEXPRESSVY PIANDICOM FLASHMEN SO ACCORDING TO THE LEGACY MEVIA DISASTER IS ABOUT TWO BEFALL AMERICA DONALD TRUMP IS NOW THE OVERWHELMING FAVORITE TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN PRECIDENTIAL NOMINATION THE LATEST TO MOIN REGISTER AND BE S NEWS POLE SHOWS TRUMP AT FIFTY ONE PER CENT IN IWA UP EIGHT PER CENT SINCE OCTOBER HE IS GAINING MOMENTUM RON DO SANTIS IS IN SECOND PLACE AT NINETEEN PER CENT NIKE HAILEE AT SIXTEEN PER CENT ACCORDING TO ANALIST STEIVE CORNAKI IS REALLY GOOD ON THE SORT OF TUFF THERE IS AN ENTHUSIASM GAP IN FAVOR OF TRUMP SEVENTY PER CENT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAY THEIR MINDS ARE ALREADY MADE UP IN FAVOR OF TRUMP HIS CURENTLY AT SEVENTY TWO PERCENT FAVORABILITY WITH IWALL CALKIS GOLERS AND HERE'S THE THING IN THE GENERAL ELECTION TRUMP IS ALSO UP AND HE'S NOT UP BY A SMALL MARGIN HIS UP SIGNIFIGANTLY DONALD TRUMP IF THE ELECTION WRE HELL TO DAY WOULD BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AGAIN ACCORDING TO A WALLSTRETERNAL POLE OVER THE WEAKEND TRUMP LEADS BIDON FORTY SEVEN PER CENT TO FORTY THREE PERCENT IN THE NATIONAL POLES IF THIRD PARTINGAN INTE PENDING CANDIDATES ENTER THAT MAXE THAT LEAD ACTUALLY JUMPS TWO SIX POINTS THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT TO THIRTY ONE PER CENT WAT'S MORE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST SE ANEN POLE TRUMP LEADS JOBIDON BI TEN POINTS IN MICHIGAN HOIS BY FIVE IN GEORGIA ACCORDING T THE LATEST MINIAPOLIST POST POLE TRUMP IS DOWN ONLY THREE POINTS TU BIDON IN MINICE SODU IN OTHER WORDS TRUMP WOULD LIKELY WIN IN A LANDSLIDE WORTHE ELECTION HELD TO DAY HUD WIN GEORGIA MISCONSIN HUBEN PENNSYLVANIA HUWAN MICHIGAN THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS FIRST JOBIDON IS TERRIBLY TERRIBLY UN POPULAR THAT TEM MALLSTRETERNAL POLE SHOWS JUST TWENTY THREE PER CENT OF VOTERS SAY THAT BIDON'S POLICIES HAVE HELP THEM PERSONALLY COMPARED WITH FIFTY THREE PER CENT WHO SAY THAT JOBIDONS POLICIES HAVE HURTED THEM PERSONALLY THT'S A TERRIBLE STAFFFOR HIM THOSE EXACT SAME DATA CHO HALF OF VOTERS SAY TRUMPS POLICIES WHEN HE WAS PRER CENT HELPED THEM PERSONALLY FIRS IS ONLY THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT WHO SAY THEY HURT THEM PERSONALLY BIDEN'S JOB PERFORMANTS IS AT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT APPROVAL AND SIXTY ONE PER CENT DISAPPROVAL ONLY THREE IN TEN VOTERS LIKE CURDN'T QUAT BIDONOMICS LITERALLY THE ONLY ISSUES WHERE JOBIDON LEADS TRUMP ARE ON A BORTION AND THEY ARE HE ONLY LEADS FORTY FOUR PER CENT TO THIRTY THREE PER CENT NOT A HUGE LEAD AND TONE IN POLITICS THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT TO THIRTY ONE PER CENT WHICH MEANS EVERYONE HATES BOTH OF THEIR TONE THAT CONDITION AS UNLIKELY TO ALLEVIATE FOR JOBIDON BEFORE THE ELECTION IT IS ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL QUOTE LESS AFFORTABLE THAN ANY TIME IN RECENT HISTORY TO BUY A HOME THE MAF ISN'T CHANGING ANY TIME SOON HOW BAD IS IT ACCORDING TO THE WALLSTRE TURNAL PUOTE BE FOUR OF THE FEDS STARTED RACING RACE A PERSON WITH A MONTHLY HOUSING BUDGET OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD A BOUT A HOME VALUED AT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DAY THAT SAME BIER WOULD NEED TO FIND A HOME VALUED AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS IN A TIME OF RISING PRICES BY THE WAY AVERAGE NEW HOME PAYMENTS ARE UP TO THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DOLLARS TRUM ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SIX DOLLARS AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT IS E NINETY PER CENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE NEW HOME PAYMENTS SINCE JOBIDON TOOK OFFICE WHAT'S MORE BDEN SU POSTET SOFF LANDING YOU KNOW THIS THING WHERE WE BRING DOWN IN FLATION THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SAIL ALONG IT DOESN'T LOOK PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO HAPPEN DESPITE THE HAPPY TALK FROM THE MEDIA NOVEMBER JOBGROWTH WAS WEEK WHICH WAS EXPECTED IT'S WHAT THE FED WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY RAISED THOSE INTERESTRATS IN ORDER TO TAMPDOWN IN FLATION BUT HERE'S THE THING THAT JOBGROWTH WAS ONLY EVEN IN WEEK TERRITORY BECAUSE OF THREE SECTORS HELF KARE LESURE IN HOSPITALITY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO THE VACATION DAYS AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT IN FACT THOSE THREE SECTORS PLUFS PRIVATE EDUCATION IM PLOYMENT AIR RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHTY ONE PER CENT OF ALL JOBS CREATED IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT MEANS THAT JUST THOSE THREE SECTORS PLUFS PRIVT EDUCATION IN PLOMENT THIT'S LIKE ALL THE JOB'S CRITED IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE FEELING IT'S WEEK ECONOMY THEY ARE RIGHT BUSINESS STARTS ARE WEEK GROS OUTPUT WHICH IS A MEASURE OF THE ENTIRE ECONOMY NOT MERELY THESE SPENDING SIDE THAT WE SEIN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND WHICH CAN BE JOBS BY GOVERNMENT SPENDING GROS OUTPUT HAS BEN FLAT LINE IN THE FIRST TO QUARTERS OF THE YEAR BUSINESS SPENDING DROPS NINE PER CENT THERE'S A REASON THAT WARREN BUFFIT IS PULLING HIS WINNINGS OFF THE TABLE BROSHIR HALTHAWAY  SOLD TWENTY EIGHT POINTS HAVE EIN BILLIAN DOLLARS IN STOCK IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THIS YEAR BUFFET HAS A VERY SIMPLE STRATEGY SELL WHEN HE THINKS THE PRICES ARE TOO HIGH HE THINKS STOCK PRICEIS RIGHT NOW AREN INFLATED AND TOO HIGH BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW BIDIN'S TEAM E'S TRYIG TO WHISTLE THEIR WAY PAST THE GRAVEYARD ON HIS CANDIDASY THE LITERAL GRAVEYARD LIKE HE MIGHT DIE ACCORDING TO SEMAFORS BENSMITH AT THE WHITE HOUSE HOLIDAY PARTY WHERE BIDON HAS A VERY EASY JOB LE YOU HAVE TO DO IT JUST SAY A COUPLE OF NICE THINGS BAT HOW YOU KNOW YOU'VE A CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP WIT THE PRASS BUT THE FIRST MEN THAT REALLY MATTERS ANDTHEN OE SAY SOME NICE THINGS ABOUT CHRISTMAS OR SOMETHING INSTEAD ACCORDING TO BENSMITH QUOTE BIGON STRAIGHT INTO A COUPLE OF HAZY MONOLOGUES WHICH ENDED ONLY HENE HIS WIFE INTERRUPTED HIM TO REMINDS HIM IT WAS A PARTY HIS SPEECH WASN'T TERRIBLE OR EVEN NOTEWORTHY SAID SBENSMITH BUT EVERY ONE IN THE ROOM REALIZED BYDN HAD A SIMPLE RETORICAL JOB AND HADN'T QUITE PULLED IT OFF AN THAT'S A REALLY EASY JOB AT A HOLIDAY PARTY I'V BEEN TO WHITE HOUSE HOLIDAY PARTIES LEMMTELL YOU IT'S NOT A HARD JOB BUT JOBIDON LITERALLY COULD NOT GET THROUGH A HOLIDAY SPEECH OF THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT DOCTOR JILL GRABBING ONE F THOSE OLD VLAUDEVILL CANES IN YANKING HIM OFF THE STAGE THAT HOLIDAY SPEECH IS SUPER EASY SO UNENTHUSIASTIC DEMOCRITS ARE NOW BEING FORCE TO DEFEND THITS AILING OCTOGENEERIAN HERE IS FOR EXAMPLE MINISO TO GOVERNMERT HIM WALLS I'LL TAKE YOUR BIND AN A HUNDERED OVER IIN HES GAS  WATERAGE THEREOUT BECAUSE HE'S DELIVERING WELL THAT MIGHT BE O KAY FOR HIM TO SAY EXCEPT THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THAT JOBIDON IS VERY UNLIKELY TO SERVE A FULL SECON TARM NOT GIVING THE STATE OF DEGRADATION IN WHICH HE CURRENTLY IS STANDING WHICH LEAVES IN THE BACKGROUND DOHN DOHN DON COMELA HARRIS YES THAT HORROR MUSIC O YOU

SENTS LAST YEAR THEY PUT OUT OF VIDIO ABOUT HO HONICA WAS ABOUT LOVE AND LIGHT CLEARLLY DEMONSTRATING THAT THE ASHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE HOLIDAY OR IT'S ORIGINS THE ACTURAL STORY OF CONICA IS ABOUT RELIGIOUS JEWS THRORING HELLANIS GREE CELLANISS OUT OF THE TEMPLE AND RE CONSECRATING THE NATION TO HE BIBLICAL GODS VERY FUNAMENTALISTS HOLIDAY BUT LAST NIGHT THEY REALLY TOPPED THEMSELVES THEY CONFIRM THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CONICA WITH THIS INSANE POST SO DUGAMHOF PUT THIS UP ON TWITTER QUOTE THE STORY OF HONICA AND THE STORY OF THE JUISH PEOPLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF HOPE AND RESILIANS IN THE CONICAL STORY THE JEWISH PEOPLE WERE FORCED INTO HIDING  NO ONE THOUGHT THEY WOULD SURVIVE OR THAT THE FEW DROPS OF OIL THEY HAD WOULD LAST BUT THEY SURVIVED IN THE OIL KEPT BURNING DURING THOSE EIGHT DAYS IN HIDING THEY RECITED THEIR PRAYERS AND CONTINUED THEIR TRADITIONS THAT'S WHY HONICA MEANS DEDICATION IT WAS DURING THOSE DARK NIGHTS THAT THE MAKABES DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO MAINTAINING HOPE AND FAITH IN THE OIL EACH OTHER AND THEIR JUDIISM IN THESE DARK TIMES I THINK OF THAT STORY THAT IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY THE STORY OF CONICA AND MAT'S NOT EVEN LIKE HALF WAID TO THE STORY OF CONNICAISNOT IN THE SAME VEN DIAGRAM THAT COMELA HER'S LOVES IS THE STORY OF CONICA THEY'VEYOU N TOUT LIKE THE OIL STORY THAT IS THE REDEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE THEY FIND A CANISTER OF OIL THEY HAVE TO RE LIKHT THE HONICA MINORA ATSTETIOU THAT THE MINORA ACTUALLY ONLY HAS IN THE IN THE TEMPLE HAS FEUR BRANCHES THEY RELIKE THE MNORA IT LAST FOR EIGHT DAYS AS OPPOSED TO LASTING FOR ONE DAY BUT THOT'S BOUT THE REDEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE IT WASN'T DEMLIKE IN HIDING AN A CAVE SOMEWHERE WITH A  W WHAT WHAT IN THAT WHAT IN THE IN THE WHAT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO BACK UP YOBIDAN COMAA HERRIS IS HIS BACK OP SHE'S EVEN LESS POPULAR THAN HE IS SO THAT'S REASON NUMBER ONE WHY YOU'R BIDN IS LOSINGTS DON TRUMS CAUSE HE'S TERRIBLE AND HIS BACK UP HIS TERRIBLE BUT HERE'S THE THING THE ELECTION IS IN H LD TO DAY AND THIS BRINGS US TO THE SECOND REASON THAT TRUMP IS LEADING JOBIDON IN THE POLES RIGHT NOW HE IS NOT IN THE NEWS THAT'S ALSO THE REASON THAT TRUMP IS UP IN IOWA HEAD AN SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST OF THE CANDIDATE BECAUSE HE IS NOT IN THE NEWS HE IS BEATING BIDON IRONICALLY HE'S ACTUALLY USING BIDON'S OWN TWENTY TWENTY STRATEGY AGAINST JOBIDON IT'S DONALD TRUMP WAS IN THE BASEMENT HE'S NOT RUNNING AROUND CAMPAGNING HE'S LITERALLY EITHER IN COURT OR BACK AT MARLAGO ON TRUTH SOCIAL AND THAT MEANS HAV ROWNS FOCUSTON BIDON AND THAT MEANS HE'S A HEAD IN THE POLES AND THAT IN TURN TAKES THE ELECTABILITY ARGUMENT AWAY FROM BOTH RONITAN TO SIN NICKEY HAILEY WHICH WAS THEIR NUMBER ONE ARGUMENT WAS THAT TRUMP COULDN'T WIN NOMINATE US INSTEAD BECAUSE TRUMP IS NOT IN THE NEWS EVERYONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AWAY FROM TRUMPS CRAZY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIS ACKILLISEOL IRONICALLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS EVER TO HAPPEN TO DONALD TRUMP POLITICALLY WAS HIS SOCIAL MEDIA BAN BEKS IT MADE HIM NEARLY INVISIBLE ON LINE THE FACT THAT TRUMP ACTUALLY PUT HIS OWN MONEY IN TRUTH SOCIAL AN HE DOES 'T ON A LOSE THAT MONEY WHICH IS THE REASON HE HASN'T GONE BACK TO ACT EVENLY'S BEEN UNBAND ON EX WELL THAT MEANS THAN WE'RE NOT TREATED TO A SMALL MEDO WILD FIRE EVERY TIME HE TWEETS CO E'S ON TRUTH SOCIAL ERE HE HAS LIKE SEVEN PEOPLE WATCHING HIM AS OPPOSE TO YOU KNOW ON TWITTER OR HE HAS SEVENTY MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING HIM MOSTLY FOR DONALD TRUMP TRUTH SOCIAL NOW ACTS THE SORT OF VENTING T MECHANISM AND EVERYONE PRETY MUCH IGNORS IT AND BY THE WAY THAT IS THE BEST THING FOR DONALD TRUMP OVER ALL SO HERE IS THE QUESTION WILL THINGS STAY THIS WAY MAYBE THEY WILL NOT BECAUSE TRUMP DOESN'T LOVE BEING AT THE CENTR OF ATTENTION THERE'S LITERALLY KNOWN WHO LOVES BEING THE CENTR OF ATTENTION MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP DONALD TRUMP IS CONYA WEST VERSES TAILOR SWIFT AT THE GRAMMEES O'M A LET YOU FINISH LOSING THE SELECTION BUT FIRST BUT HERE'S THE DHING THERE'S LITERALLY NOTHING HE CAN DO TO CHANGE ANYONE'S OPINION OF DONALD TRUMP EVERYONE HAS AN OPINION OF DONALD TRUMP AND THERE HEU NOTE THEY THINK ABOUT DONAL TRUMP WHAT EXACTLY COULD HAPPEN IF HE GETS CONVICTED DID ANYONE'S OPINION ABOUT HIM CHANGE BUT HERE'S THE OTHER THING ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT ENTHUSIASM THI'S WHAT DENMOCRATS ARE COUNTING ON TRUMP CUID THEORETICALLY REIN VIGORATE ENTHUSIASM AGAINST HIM IF HE BUSTS THROUGH WALLS LIKE A BIG ORANGE COOLAY MAN O YH TRUMP IS ALREADY GIVING HINTS THAT HE MIGHT WANT TO DO THIS SO DURING HIS RECENT INTERVIEW WITH TRUNHANDY FOR EXAMPLE SHOHN ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD BE A DICTATOR IT WAS A SET UP IS A SOFT BALL QUESTION BECAUSE THE ENTIRE LAFT HAS BEEN SAYING HE'S GOIN TO BE A TYRANNICAL DICTATOR AND SHAWN WAS ASKING HIM ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT AND INSTEAD OF JUST GIVING ME OBVIOUS ANTER WHIC WOULD BEN RIDICULOUS RIDICULOUS THEY A LET DAN A TREMP TO SAY YES I'M NOT ADICTATOR AS PRESIDENT IREDY NOT A COMADIC A NOT DA DICTAT RAEDICTATOR JOBIDON VERY EASY ANSWER INSTEAD DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE IS A PERFORMER AND A COMMEDIUM HE PLAYED TO TE CROWD ANDTHEN HE TROLLED THE MEDIA BY SAYING HE WOULDN'T BE A DICTAOR EXCEPT ON DAWN AND WHAT HE MEAN IS THAT LIKE OBAMA AND LIKE BIDON HE WOULD USE A PEN AND A PHONE AND HE SAID THAT HE WOULD BE A DICTINERANTE ONE BY CLOSING THE BORDER FOR EXAMPLE USING THE PEN IN THE PHONE IT WAS A JOK TBUT IT ALSO GAVE HIS ENEMIES OXYGEN WHICH IS WHY YESTERDAY TRUMP HAD TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN THAT IT WAS A JOKE HE PUT OUT A TRUTH SOCIAL SAYING QUOTE FAK NEWS WRITER PETER OBAMA BAKER OF THE FAILING YAR TIMES REARSHIP INS OBSTRIP IONS WE TAN FROM THE GOOD O TRAMPIES WHOSE CLAIM TO FAME IS THAT HE WILL NEVER WRITE ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT THE GREAT JOB PRESIDEN TRUMPDID IN QUOTES TJUST WROTE IN A MAJOR FROM PAGE STORY THAT I WANT TO BE SITATOR BUT DOESN'T MENTION IT WAS SEDDENTY JOKING MANNER AND COMPLETED WITH BUT ONLYVER DA BEN THEN A CLOSE THE BUTTER AND GO GOGO AN MUCH DIFFER EN ATTITUDE MEEN O TRUMP IS RIGHT ABOUT ALL THAT BUT TRUMP ALSO HAS HE NASSY HABIT OF JUST POURING GASOLINE ON FIRES SO TRUMPS ENEMIES DO HAVE ONE PLAYBOOK HE WILL BE A DICTATOR RI TRUMP DOESN' HAVE TO PLANS O THAT HE MIGHT BUT THAT IS THEIR PLAYBOOK IS WHAT ALL THE BRILLIANT MINDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE MEDIA HAVE COME UP WITH TRUMPETLER SMALL MUSTACHE FUNNY HAIR ORANGE MAN MOUSOLINE HERE WAS MATHEW DOUD YESTERDAY ON EMASON BESE DOING THIS RETINE DOT'LL TRUP WINDIS ALL THE KY STATES BECAUSE HE' BE LOST NACHIONALLY BY FOURE OR FIVE POINTS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND BARILY LOST THE KEY STATES AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THOT BIDING CAMPAGN  OP MEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THE COURSE OF THIS AT SOME POINT THE BITIN CAMPAIGN ATS TO LET GO O THE IDEA OF RUNNING THIS SA REPERENDUMON JO BYN AE RUNNING IT IS A REPERENDUM ON BICONOMICS AND TURN THIS RACE TO HEARES OF THE CHOICE TOT PRESENTED BEFORE AMERICA IT'S DEMOCRACY VERSS DICTATORSHIP AN S YOUR FREEDOMS VERSS YOUR O YOUR LOSS OF FREEDOMS IN THE COURSE OF THIS INCLUDING ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN THIS O CASE SO THAT IS THE MAGIC THEY'VE COME UP WITH HIS ADONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO TAKE AWAY ALL OF YOUR FREEDOMS TO NOW THIES PRINGNOT CAN WORK BECAUSE WHO'S PRESIDENT ALREADY BUT THIS IGN A BE THEIR PLAYBOOK HERE AS THATN WHY YOU PROFESSOR RUTH BENGYAT WHO'S A SCHOLAR ON FASHISM COMPARING TRUM TO BENITO MOUSOLINI AND AND PENOCHE BAT WE KNOW CROW I KNOW FROM MY STUDIES A PRECURATARINES AN AT ITS SUCCESSFL MEDERS ALWAYS TAVE TO HAVE A POWERFUL PITNERS A AND TOISLY BI THE PEOPLE IN TH TOSSL TO INDISTE WHIC  TRIGRATIN HIS TIRSTADMINISTRATION AND ALL THOS TO IR AR EGER TO HAVIN ANYMYAND TATSALWAYS IMMIGRANTES IN CAT KEEPING IMIGRATS A AND TALKING ABOUT YOU UNE NATION OF SECURITY MEASURES AND REPRESSION BECAUSE EMIGRAT SUFLETDING ACROSS THE BROIDER AS BEEN USE BY EVERYONE TRUM WI SOLINY TO PENC INCE LA AP TI TRUMP THIS ISNAN OLD PLAYBOK MASHR REALLY OLD PLAYBOOK IS SIT IS CLAIMING THE YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT IS GOING TO BE IN EVIL DICTATOR WILL GET TO MORE OF THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST

THE NARRATIVE FOUR DEMOCRATS IS GOING TO BE DONALD TRUMP CANNOT BE PRESIDIM BECAUSE IF HE IS HE WILL BE A FASHIST MIT ROMNEY IS JUMPING ON THAT BAND WEGON HE HAS TAKEN ZERO BRAK FROM POSTERING ON BEHALF OF HIS OWN LEGACY BY THE WAY MIT ROMNEY'S LEGGASHY NOW MOUNTS TO FAILED IN TWENCE HE TWELVE AGAINST BRACOBAMA PAVED THE WAY FOR TRUMP TRID TO SERVAN TRUMPS ADMINISTRATION WAS REJECTED AND THEN JOINED WITH DEMOCRATS ON HE MEASURERS IN ORDER TO SHORE UP HE'S FAILING LEGACY SO NOW PART OF HIS LEGACY IS GOING TO BE APPARENTLY GOING ON LIKE MEET THE PRASS AND JABBERING ABOUT HOW TRUMP IS AF THRAT TOOU THE REPUBLIC OR SOME SUCH WE HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN HIM DO WHAT HE SAIS HE'S GOING TO DO WHEN HE SAID THAT HE BELIEVE THE RECTION WITH THE ELECTUAR WAS GOING TO BE RAGGED BEFORE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WENT TO THE POLT HE WENT ON TO QUESTION THE RESULTS TRIED TO OVERTURN THE RESULT OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM EXACTLY AT HIS WORD AI I I THINK WE AGREE THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT HIS BEHAVIOR AND HIS BEHAVIOR SUGGESTS THI SIS A PERSON WHO WILL IMPOSE HIS WILL IF HE CAN O THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM ON THE LET US SAY TO BRANCH ABOUT THE ENTIRE NATION M WHEN HE CALL PEOPLE TO COME TO WASHIN YO SEE ON JANUARY SIX THAT WASHOUT A RANDOM DATE THAT WAS THE DAT WHEN PEACEFUL TRANCE FER OF POWER WAS TO ROCCUR HE CALL THAT ON PURPOSE I HE IS NO QUESTION HE HAS AUTHORITARIAN RULINGS AN AND INTERESTS AND NOTE NOTIONS WHICH HE WILL TRY AND OPPOSE I'LGETE SO AGAIN THAT TRUMP FASHIUS ARGUMENT IS NOT PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO WORK BUT THERE IS ONE ARGUMENT THAT THEARETICALLY COUDWARD NIKEHALY IS ARTICULATING THAT ARGUMENT THAT ARGUMENT IS THE TRUMP IS ONELECTABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE PERCEIVE HIM AS A CHAOS AGENT NOT THAT H'S ONELECTABLE BECAUSE HE'S A TERROR OF HE'S A FASHISTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT BECAUSE HE'S JUST TOO CHAOTIC WE NA WAN HIM HERE IS NIKIHALY ARTICULATING THAT ARGUMENT CHRIS CHRISTY THAT HE'S ON FIT I WANTED AS PUT THAT DIRECTLY TO YO WAN E YES TER NO TO THIN DONAL TRUM TO DAY AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS TI TO  PRESIDENT I IT'S NOT ABOUT I TA TITINK HES  TO BE PRESIEN IT SHURD HE BE PRESIDNT I DON'T THINK HE SHO BE PRESIDENT HE KNOW I THOUGHT HE IS THE RIGHT PRESIEN A THE RIGHT TIME I GREED WITH THE LOT OF IS PIY THE CROBLNAS HE SE OUR CONTRY I TIN TIS THE RIGHT OUR WORLD IS ON FIRE AND YOU CAN'T TI TI TONA PRAT CAO FO THE REPUBLICIN COS AN DONAL TRUMP BREN TA CAOS  TOS NONT ABOUT ING A IT'S TUS TANON THINK HES THE RIGHT PERSON TO BE PRESENT IT WELL THAT ARGUMENT THE TRUMP IS A CAS AGENT AND ONLY WORKS UNDER TWO CONDITIONS ONE IS VERY LIKELY TO BE FILLED THE FEELING THE TRUMP IS IN FACT CHAOTIC CERTAINLY THT'SWHAT THE DEMOCRATS IN THE BIDIN DEOJE ARE DOING THIS WHY THEI'R INDICTING TRUMP OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAN ON EVERY CRIME FROM J WALKING TO CLASSFI DOCUMENTS MISS HANDLING TO MURDER THERE'S A REASON THAT JACK SMITH THAT JANUARY SIX PROSECUTOR WANTS HIS CASE ACCELERATED SO YESTERDAY THE SUPREME COURT AGREED TO HEARE SMITH'S REQUEST TO HERE QUICKLY ON TRUMS OWN CLAIMS OF IMMUNITY AGAINS FEDERAL TRIAL OVER JANUAR SIX TRUMPET SAYING BECAUSE HE WAS PRESIDENT DURING THE ENTIRE PERIOD NOVEMBER TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE OF ALL OF THAT HE'S A MUNE AGAINST SOME SORT OF CONVICTION OR Y EVEN A TRIAL THAT WAS RULE AGAINST BY ANABOBOMAPOINTOD JUDGE IS BEEN APPEAL TO THE D C CIRCUID AN NOW SMITH IS GOING DIRECT TO THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE HE WANTS IN ANSWER ACCORDING TO THE WALZER JOURNAL SMITH WANTS THE COURT TO TAKE UP THE CASE BEFORE THAT LOWER APPEALS COURT EVEN CONSIDERS IT ALLOWING THE JUSTICE IS TO SQUARELY WEIGH IN ON WHEN IF AT ALL TRUMS TRIAL SHOUN MOVE FORWARD THE SPECIAL COUNCILS MOVE CAME TEN DAYS AFTER THE TRIAL JUDGE PRESIDING OVER TRUMPS CASE THE CLINED HAS BID TO TOSS THE CRIMINAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CHARGES REJECTING ARGUMENTS THAT HE'S IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION SMITH IS ASKING THE JUSTICE IS TO CUT OUT THE LOWER APPEALS COURT AND RULE DIRECTLY ON THE MATTER HIS TEAMRO QUOTE TO FURTHER THE IMPERATIVE PUBLIC INTEREST IN A TIMELY TRIAL THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS A FULL AND FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE DEFENDEN'S CLAIMS THAT HE HIS ABSOLUTELY IMMUNE FROM FEDERAL PROSECUTION FOR CRIMES COMMITTED WELL IN OFFICE OR IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED FROM FEDERAL PROSECUTION WHERE HE WAS IMPEACH BET NOT CONVICTED BEFORE THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS BEGAN TBEFORE THE MARKED FORTH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TRIAL DAY THAT'S GOING TO SMITH'S TEAM AND TH SPRIMCOURT IS LIKELY TO DO THAT SMITHS TEAM WANTS TRUMP ON TRIAL AN THE ON IM ON TRIAL RIGHT NOW THERE HOPING AGAINST TOPE THAT TRUMP IS GING TO EAT ALL THE HEADLINES THE JOBIDONS BAD PERFORMANCE BECOMES A SECONDARY CONCERN BECAUSE TRUMP IS SO CHAOTIC TBUT EVEN THAT EVENTUALITY AND AGAIN IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT TRUMP WILL BE ON TRIAL AFTER LOSING THIS IMMUNITY APPEAL DURING THEHE ACTURAL ELECTION CYCLE AND BY THE WAY IT'S VERY LIKELY HE WILL BE CONVICTED SOME TIME IN THE MIDST OF THE SELCTION CYCLE IT'S ALSO LIKELY THAT THAT WILL NOT MAKE BIDON'S CASE THE TRUMP IS A CHAOSAGED IN ORDER FOR THAT TO WORK BYGON HAS TO AP YOUR SOLID AND NON CHAOTIC AND THAT IS NOT HAPPENING WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO THE POLES IN EVERY ELECTION ITS I'VE SAID OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVERY ELECTIONS A REFRUN HIM ON ONE OF THE TWO CANDIDATES THE RE FRUN HIM RIGHT NOW IS ON BIDON BARRINGSOM CATICLISMAC COLLAPSE BY TRUMP OR MAGICAL RECOVERY BY BIDON THE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS OF THIS RACE ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN STABLE ALL THE WAY UP TO ELECTION DAY WHICH MEANS THAT PULLING ADVANTAGE FOR TRUMP IS NOT A MERE CHIMERA IT MIGHT JUST BE TWENTY TWENTY FOR REALITY AND THAT IS WHY THE MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS ARE PANICING THEY REALLY REALLY SHOULD BE AR DY IN JUST A SECOND WE'RE GING TO GET TO THE LATEST INSANITY FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY WERE CLOUDY IN GAY IS GOING TO

THEAT SHE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN PLAGURIS AND NOTCHUST IN HER P H STEE DISSRTATION BUT ALSO ALL OVER THE DAMNED PLACE ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON FREEBEACON HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESENT CLOUDIN GAME PLAGRAS NUMEROUS ACADEMICS OVER THE CORSE OF HER ACANEMIC CAREER AT TIMES AIRLIFTING ENTIRE PARAGRAPHS AND CLAMIG THEM AS ARE OWN WORK ACCORDING TO REVIEWS BY SEVERAL SCHOLARS IN FOUR PAPERS PUBLISH

UNIVERSITIES TO PARTMENT OF GAVERNMENT WITHOUT PROPER ACTRIBUTION ACCORDING TO THE WASHING TON FREEBEAKAN ANALISIS OTHER EXAMPLES OF POSSIBLE PLAGURISM ALL FROM GAZES DISSERTATION RE PUBLICIZED ON SUNDAY BY THE MANHANAN INSTITUTES CHRISTO FOR RUFO AND CARLSTACK'S CRIS BRUNET THE FREEBEACON WORK WITH NEARLY A DOZEN SCHOLARS TO ANALYZE TWENTY NINE POTENTIAL CASES OF PLAGERISN MOST OF THEM SAID THAT GAY HAD VIOLATED A QUARP PRINCIPLE OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AS WELL AS HARVARD'S OWN ANTI PLATURIS AN POLICIES WHICH STATE THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO CHANGE A FEW WORDS HERE AND THERE RATHER SCHOLARS ARE EXPECTED TO CITE THE SOURCES OF THEIR WORK INCLUDING ONE PARAPHRASING ANDS USE QUOTATION MARKS O ACCORDING TO RECTLY FROM OTHERS TUT AT LEAST TEN INSTANCES GAY LIFTED FULL SENTENCES OR EVEN ENTIRE PARAGRAPHS WITH TRUST A WORD OR TO TWEAKED THIS IS DEVFINENTLY PLAGURISM SEID LEAD JUST AN A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST AT RUCKERS UNIVERSITY WHO REVIEW TEN SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISONS PROVIDED BY THE WASHINGTON FREBEAKON INCLUDING PARAGRAPHS FROM GAZES DISSERTATION THASHOU GAVE HER A PRIZE FOR THAT DISDISSERTATION FOR ONE WOD EXCEPTIONAL MERIT THIS IS THE LONGER PASSAGES ARE THE MOST EGREGUS BUT

TAGAIN HARVARD UNIVERSITY HAS ONE OF MOST RESTRICTIVE SPEECH COTS IN AMERICA THEY WILL THEY WIL COME AFTFEW FOR FAT PHOBIA AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY BUT IF YOU SAY FROM THE RIVER TO THE C PALISTINE SHALL BE FREE WHILE WAVING AROUND A COMMOSS FLAG EVERYBODY WILL APPARENTLY LOOK THE OTHER WAY ALL OF THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOLARS YESTERDAY CALLED ON HARVARD TO REMOVE CLOUDING GAY AS PRESIDENT OF THEUNIVERSITY THEY NOTED GAZE SHODDY PROFESSOR PROFESSIONAL WORK RECORD OF PLATURISM AND PROMOTION OF RACIS POLICIES THAT WAS HAUS OF YESTERDAY AND GAIN WHEN IT COMES TO CLOUDYN GAZE OWN UPSET OVER ANTISEMITISM ITS JUST ABSENT IT'S NOT THERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS AMAZING ABOUT WATCHING THSE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS TESTIFYING FROM CONGRESS IS EVEN IF THEY HAD SAID SOMETHING LIKE LISTEN WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT SPEECH THAT WE DON'T LIKE BUT WE REALLY DON'T LIKE THE SPEECH IT'S UGLY AND IT'S WRONG IS RELL HAS A RIGHT TO EXIST AS JEWISH STATE AND WE HATE ALL OF THIS BUT WE TROT WARD TRYING TO DRAW BALANCE IF THEY'D EVEN SAID THAT THAT WOULDHAV BEEN ONE THING UT THEY DIDN'T AND HERE'S THE THING THEY SAY THAT KIND OF TUF ALL THE TIME SO FOR EXAMPLE IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CLOUDYIAN GAT SIGNED TO LETTER TO THE HARVARD COMMUNITY ACCUSING AMERICA OF RACISM ANDS A CRYING THE SHOOTING DEATH OF ADAM TO LEAD A WHO FLASHE GUN AT THE POLICE WHAT WE IS A COMMUNITY MUST STAND AGAINST RACISM WE MUST COMMIT OURSELVES THE UNFINISHED WORK OF BUILDING A JUST SOCIETY ONE IN WHICH EVERYONE'S RIGHTS AND SAFETY U PROTECTED AND EVERYONE'S DIGNITY IS HONORED IN A

TALKING APPARENTLY ABOUT AMERICAN RACISM THEN THAT'S ONE THING NOW THERSHE'S VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT WHEN COMES TO ACUSATIONS OFVANTISEMITISM ON HER OWN CAMPAS THEN IT'S ALL BY THE WAYSIDE NOW HARVARD TRIED TO RELY ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM AS THE BASIS FOR WHY SHE SHOULD BASICALLY GET OFF THE HOOK SCOT FREE THERE'S A PETITION THT EMERGED ON SUNDAY FROM VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE PROFISORIAT URGING THE UNIVERSITY TO QUOTE RESIST POLITICAL PRESSURS THAT ARE AT ODDS OF HARVARD'S COMMITMENTS TO ACADEMIC FREEDOM BEL LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THITS THYDON'T CARE AOUT ACADEMIC FREEDOM AT HARVARD THERE'S

THE NUMBER OF REGISTERD REPUBLICAN TO ONSTAFF AT HARVARD LAWSCOOL WHICH HAD WELL OVER HUNDRD PROFESSORS ITWAS LIKE THREE I COULD NAME THEM IF THE FACT IS THAT HARVARD IS NOT A PLACE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM ANT NEVER HAS BEE A PLACE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN ANY SURIOUS MESSURE BUT THEYE ERE LYING ON ALL THAT IN ORDER TO  PRETACT T ANTISEMITS SO NOW NATURALLY THE HARVARD BOARD STANDS IN SUPPORT OF CLAD AT THEY HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO SHE'S A BLACK LADY AND SHE'S SELECTED FOR THIS POSITIONS SPECIFICALLY BASED I'N HERD I VERSE BONAFIETIES MEANING THAT SHE IS A BLACK LADY AND LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS THE REASON THAT SHE WAS ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH THIS SORT OF SHODDY WORK FOR YEARS ON END IS BECAUSE SHE HAD THESE SHIELD OF INTEROSECTIONALITY IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE AN INTEROSECTIONAL PERSON MEANING A RACIALLY DIVERSE PERSON WHO RANKS HIGH IN THE VICTIM HOOD COALITION THEN YOUNT GET AWAY WITH JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ON A COLLEGE CAMPAS THAT'S THE WAY THIS WORKS IF CLOUDING GAY WE'RE A WHITE LADY AND SHE BEEN IT WITH THESE CHARGES OF PLAGERISM AS A STUDENT SHEWOUD HAV BEN OUT SHE'S BEENG HIT WITH THESE CHARGES OF PLAGERISM BET ALONE WHAT SHE'S DOING AS THE ACTUAL PRESSINEN BUT NOW APPARENTLY THEY'RE GOING TO DEFEND THE QUALITY OF HER WORK THAT'S WAY THIS WORKS SO HARVARD UNIVERSITY'S BOARD HAS NOW PUT OUT A STAT AND QUOTE THERE MEMBERS OF THE HARVARD COMMUNITY AS MEMBERS OF THE HARVARD CORPORATION WE TODAY REAFFIRM OUR SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT GAZES CONTINUED LEADERSHIP OF HOVER UNIVERSITY OURE EXTENSIVE DELIBERATIONS AFFRM OUR CONFIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT GATE IS THE RIGHT LEADER TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY HEEL AND TO A DRESS THE VERY SERIOUS SOCITAL ISSUES WEAREFACING WHAT WERE THEIR EXTENSIVE DELIBERATIONS THY MET LAST NIGHT THOSE RE THEIR EXSTENSIVE DELIBERATIONS SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED TREMENDOUS DAMAGE AND PAIN BEASE OF COMMASS'S BRUTAL TERRORIST ATTACK THEN THE UNIVERSITY'S INITIAL STATEMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN IMMEDIATE DIRECT AND ON EQUIVOCAL CONDEMNATION CALLS FREGENICIDE ARE DESPICABLE AND CONTRY TO FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN VALUES PRESIDENT GAY HAS APOLOGIZED FOR HOW SHE HANDLES FOR CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY AND HAS COMMITTED TO REDOUBLING UNIVERSITIES FIGHT AGAINST ANTISEMITISM THAT' SO AMAZING SO THEY JUST REJECTED EVERYTHING THAT SHE'S DONE SINCE OCTOBER SEVENTH AND THE THEY LIKE BUT THE APOLOGA BUT SHE BUT WHY BECAUSE THE EDIFICE OF D I MUST BEUPHELD AS WE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH YESTERDAY THE ENTIRE REASON FOR BEING ALVE MAJOR AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LIBERAL ARTS PROGRAMS USE TO DEFEND THE IDEA THAT AMERICA IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNJUST THAT THE AMERICAN MRITOCRACY IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNJUST THIS IS WHY YOU NED DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION IT'S WHY YOU GIVE PEOPLE EXTRA POINTS ON THEIR APPLICATION BASED ON THEIR RACE THAT IS WHY YOU DO THOSE THINGS IS BECAUSE THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT IF YOU SUCCEED IN AMERICAN SOCIETY UNLESS YOU'RE A MEMBER OF AN INTERSECTIONALLY OPPRESSED GROUP IF YOU SUCCEED IT'S BECAUSE TE SYSTEM ITSELF IS BROKEN AND EXPLOITATIVE AND SO WE HAVE TO READ JIGGER THE SYSTEM BY PROVIDING BENEFITS LICKE SAY THE PRESIDENCY OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED FOR T APPOSITION WITH REGARD TO PRESIDENT GAZE ACADEMIC WRITINGS THE UNIVERSITY BECOME AWARE IN LATE OCTOBER VALIGATIONS REGARDING THREE ARTICLES AS A AT PRESIDENT'S GAY REQUEST THE FELLOWS PROMPTLY INITIATED AN INDEPENDENT RE VIEW BY DISTINGUISHED POLITICAL SCIENCE AND CONDUCTED REVIEW OF FOR PUBLISHED WORK ON DECEMBER NINTH THE FELLOWS REVIEWE THE RESULTS WHICH REVEALE THE FEW INSTANCES OF INADEQUATE CITATION WHILE THE ANALYSHIS FOUND NO VIOLATION OF HARVARD STANDARDS FOR RESEARCH MIS CONDUCT PRESIDENT GAYES PROACTIVELY REQUESTING FOUR CORRECTIONS IN TWO ARTICLES TO INSERT CITATIONS AND QUOTATION MARKS THAT WE'RE OMITTED FROM THE ORIGINAL PUBLICATIONS IN THIS TUMULTUOUS AND DIFFICUL TIME WE UNANIMOUSLY STAND INSUPPORT OPPRESIDENT GAG AT HARVARD WE CHAMPION OPEN DISCOURS AT ACADEMIC FREEDOM SURE SURE YOU DO AND WE ARE UNITED IN OUR STRONG BELIEF THAT CALLS FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST OUR STUDENTS AND DESRUPTIONS OF THE CLASSFROM EXPERIENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED HARVARD'S MISSION IS ADVANCING NOWLEDGE RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY THEY 'LL HULP ADRESS DEEP SOCITAL ISSUES AND PROMOTE CONSTRUCTIVE DISCORSE IN THATS THE KEY WARD HELP ADDRESS DEEP SOCITAL ISSUES YHE A HAF TO KEEPHER IN PLACE BECAUSE AMERICA IS BAD AMERICAN MERITOCRACY IS BAD AND BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE BAD SHE'S UNQUALIFIED AND SHE'S PROBABLY A PLATRIST DOESN'T MATTER WE'RE GOING TO KEEP HER IN PLACE TO RECTIFY THOSE GRAVE INJUSTICES OF THE PASSED THAT IS THE REASON THE HARVARSTICKMENT THOT I'LL BE ONISITHUM I'M FINE WITH THEM STICKING WITH HER THE REASON I'M FINDID THEM STICKING WITH HER IS BEAUSE I THINK THE WHEN THESE UNIVERSITIES FIRED THEIR PRESIDENT AT TO FIGLY A THENG WONE MC GILL WHENT AT AT UNIVERSITY PANSYLANIA I THING IT TO FIGLY AVTHING NOW THE IDEAS CAN O BE THEY GO BACK TO THE DOWNERS THEY SAY ACH LOOK WHAT WE DID WE GOT RID OFTHEY KEEP THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IN PLACE ALL THE FOUNDATIONAL D I PRINCIPLES THAT LEAD TO ANTISEMITISM INEVITABLY BESE AGAIN D E I IS A CONSPIRACY THEORY AND IT CROSSES STREAMS WITHANTISEMITISM AGAIN IF THE ENTIRE D E I THEORY IS PREDICATED ON AN OPPRESSOR OPPRESSED NARRATIVE IN WHICH PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL ARE THE OPPRESSORS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE UNSUCCESSFUL ARE THE OPPRESSED JEWS CANNOT FIT INTO THAT NARRATIVE TBECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH OPPRESSED IT GENERICALLY SPEAKING IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF T MS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY ARE TARGETED BY ANTISMAT A CATE CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES WAY HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER GROUP THEY'RE TARGED FOR HACRAMS GENERALLY MUCH HIGHER THAN OTHER GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES THEY'RE TARGETEN ON CAMPSES BUT THEYARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY SUCCESSFUL AND THIS MEANS THEY DON'T FIT INS THAT MATRIXS THEY KEEP BREAKING THE MATRIX ANF YOU KEEP BREAKING THE MATRICS IT TURNS OUT THE PEOPLE ARE GIN HAVE TO SHOVE YOU BACK IN THE BOX SO THEY CANNOT GET RID OF THE ANTISEMATISM WITH OUT ALSO GETTING RID OF D E EE AND GETTIG WHERE TO THESE PRESIDENTS IS A FIGLIF IT'S A WAY FOR THEM TO SAY ALKWAY FIXE THE PROBLEM PLEASE BRING BACK YOUR HUNDRED MILLIONOLEDONATION NO ONE SHOULD BE FOOL TOI'M ACTUALY KIND OF PLEASE THAT HARVARD IT JUST SAYING THE QUAPART OUT LOT FINE KEEP HER THERE AND HARVARD'S ONERS AND ALL OF MY FELLOW HARVARD ALONG IF YOU'RE UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY THAT PRESIDENT GAY HAS HANDELESS PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LOOK TO THE FACT THAT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY IS REFLECTIVE OF A SYSTEM OF VALUES THAT MADE CLOUDIN GAY THE PRESIDENT THAT IS THE REASON SHE IS THE PRESIDENT THEY ARE BACKING HER BE CAUSE THEY SUPPORTS HER IDEOLOGY AND SHE IS THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE SHE SUPPORTS THEIR IDEOLOGY IT IS ALL OF A PIECE AND IF THEY'D FIRED HER IT WOULD AE CHANGED NOTHING IS AGAIN D I IS HONEYCOMBES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THESE ADMINISTRATIONS THE NUMBER OF D I GUROCRATS ON ANY GIVING CAMPASS IS HUGE YOU MAY OUTWAIGH THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF FACULTY ON MANY CAMPASSES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR OR SPENT ON D INONSENSE THAT'S THE ACTUAL IDEOLOGY BEING PROMULGATED AT THESE UNIVERSITYES AND IT IS POISONOUS N IT BLEEDS UP INS THINGS LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE WHITE HOUSE NOW DEMANS THAT EQUITY BE A PART OF EVERY PIECE OF POLICY THAT THEY MAKE OR THE WHITE HOUSE NOW HAS TO DEAL WITH INTURNS YELLING AT THEM OVER NOT SUPPORTING COMMOS ENOUGH UNDERSTAND WHEREALL OF THIS COMES FROM IT COMES IONAMAT COKEESIVE IDEOLOGY ABOUT IN INTERNAL REVOLUTION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S WHY CLOUDING GAY IS PROTECTED SHE CANNOT THEY CANNOT ALLOW HER TO FALL IF THEY ALLOW HER TO FALL IT IS A REJECTION OF THE ENTIRE IDEOLOGY UPON WHICH THEY PREDICATE THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IF THEY OUSED THE BLACK LADY FOR NOT SUFFICIENTLY FIGHTING ANTISEMITISM THAT DEFEATS THE ENTIRER HIERARCHY F VICTIMHOOD IS THAT HIERARCH O VICTIMHOOD HOSS TO SUGGEST THAT DISTPROPORTIONATELY UN SUCCESSFUL GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY VICTIMS AND DISPROPORTIONTELY SUCCESSFUL GROUPS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY OPPRESSERS SO YOU CAN'T DO IT THERE'S NO WAY AN GET RADTA LISMC GILL BEAUSE LEISMIGLES A WHITELAD IT CAN'T GET HER TO CLOUDING GAY THERE'S NO WAY TO DO IT WITHOUT AGAIN DEFEATING THE ENTIRE PURPOS OF YOUR IDEOLOGY IN THAT INTERSECTIONAL COLITION IT'S SHOCKINGLY STRONG AND BIZARLY CONSTITUTED SO YESTERDAY TH A THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE WAS SHUT DOWN ONCE AGAIN THIS TIME BY QUEERS FOR PALISTINE AND HERE IS SOME FOOTAGE OF THIS MEN HAMRIDGE HARGAMI OYE NOW LISTEN THAT CHANP THERE FOR SECOND EXACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING AND THIS IS THE SAME IDEOLOGY PROMULGATED ON AMERICA'S

COLLEGE CAMPASES THAT THE LEFT THAT HATES ISRAEL THEY HATE AMERICA FOR THE EXACT SAME REASONS THERE'S NOT A SINGLE RASH ANALL THEY USE FOR THEY HATETRED OF ISRAEL THAT DOES NOT APPLY IN GREATER DETAILED TO AMERICA WHEN THEY SAYE FOR EXAMPLE THAT ISRAEL IS A COLONIALIST OPPRESSURE WHEN THEY SAY THAT IT'S A FOREIGN IMPOSITION ON NATIVE SOIL WHATDO YOU THINK THEY THINK ABOUT AMERICA WHITC YI

INTERSECTIONAL COLITION DEDICATED TO FIGHTING THE WHITE POWER STRUCTURE AND ANYBODY WHOS SUCCESSFUL IMMEDIATELY YETS PUT INTO THE WHITE POWER STRUCTURE JEWS NOW WHITE THEY'RE I THE WHITE POWER STRUCTURE ASIONS NOW WHITE THE'RE INTHE WHITE POWER STRUCTURE N IJURIAN AMERICANS JUST PROPORTIONALELY SUCCESSFUL AND WHITE THAT'S THE'RE INTHE WHITE POWER STRUCTURE THAT'S THE WAY ALL OF THIS

ISRAEL POLITICALLY SPEAKING WOULD BE DECIDE WITH COMMASS I DON'T EVEN SEE HOW THAT APPLIES IT'S RIDICULOUS TO ME IS THE IDEA THAT HE IS SUDDENLY GOING TO UPTICK IN MICHIGAN BI LIKE TEN POINTS IF SUDDENLY HE SIDES OF KOMMASS IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN HE IS DOWN TEN POINTS IN MICHIGAN WHY BECAUSE HE IS DEEPLY UNPOPULAR YOU NO IT ACTUALLY IS KIN OF POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES AS I TURNS OUT ISRAEL ACCORDING TO A BRAN NEW WALL STREET JOURNAL POLL IT FINDS THAT FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF THOSE PULD SAY THEY BELIEVE ISRAEL IS TAKING THE MILITARY ACTION NEEDED TO DEFEND ITSELF AND PREVENTS ANOTHER ATTACK BY COMMAS ONLY TWENTY FIVE PER CENTS OF RESPONDENTS SAY ISRAEL'S MILITARY ACTION IS JUST PROPORTIONATE AND GOING TOO FAR FORTY TWO PER CENT O VOTERS SAY THEY SYMPATHIZE MORE WITH HIS RAIL IIS COMPARED WITH JUST TWELVE PER CENT WE SAID THE SAME OF PALISTINIANS JOBIDENS MARKS FOR HIS RESPONS TO THE WAR REMAIN AT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT WY BECAUSE HIS APPROVAL RATINGS AT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT YOU COULD LITERALLY SAY DO YOU PROVE OF JOBIDON'S POLICY ON TOILET PAPER EVERYONE JUST CON TO GULL THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT YES THAT THATS IT'S IS SIMBLE AS THAT WHEN YOUOTHE THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT APROVAL RATING IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXCEED THAT RATING ON ANY PERTICULAR ISSUE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT BUT THE MEDIA BEEN ATTEMPTING TO PUSH THIS IDEA THAT IF JOBIDON SUDDENLY FLIPPED ON THE ISRAELVERS'S COMMASS WAR SUDDENLY HIS  NUMBERS WOULD UP TICK ACTUALLY IT'S THE OPPOSITE IF SECURITY IS RESTORED IN THE IDLE EAST AND IT IS NOT A HEADLINE BY THE TIME WE HID ELECTION SEASON THAT'S GON A REDOWND TO BIDON'S BENEFIT HE'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY QUELLOWED ISRAEL TO DESTROY COMMAS AND REESTABLISH DETERRINS IN THE REGION THAT'S CAN BE THE ACTUAL OUTCOME BUT IF YOU ALLOWED ISRAEL TO BE VICTIMIZED AGAIN BY COMMASSEL BECAUS BALLA UP IN THE NORTH WHICH BY THE AY IS GIN BE THE NEXT STEP ISRAEL CANNOT ALET IT'S GOT THIRTY THOUSAND CITIZENS ISRAEL IN THE NORTH OF ITS COUNTRY ARE NOT LIVING IN THEIR HOMES RIGHT NOW ISRAEL CANNOT ALLOW THOSE PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES UNTIL HUSBELIZE PUSHED OFF THE BORDER THERE'S NOW A LARGE SKEL PUSH BY ISRAEL IN BY THE WAY FRANCE

WHICH IS DOMINATED BY HISBALAC EVEN THEY ARE SAYING A MAY BEHASE BLESHU PULL BACK OR THE IDEA F MIGHT BE MARCHING THROUGH BAYROUTE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONS BUT AGAIN ONE O THE THINGS THAT IS AMAZING IS THE IS THE BREAK DOWN THE PARTISON BREAK DOWN HERE SO DO YOU SYMPATHIZE MORE WITH THESE RAILLY OR PALESTINIANS DEMOCRATS SEVENTEEN PER CENTS IS RAILY TWENTY FOUR PER CENT PALESTINIAN THT'S AN AMAZING STATISTIC HOW YOU SYMPATHIZE MORE WITHTHE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ELECTED COM OSS AND PALSINIAN AUTHORITY AN WH BY POLLING GETU SUPPORT OCTOBER SEVENTH BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS OVER YOU KNOW THE  DEMOCRATIC  COUNTRY THAT HAS HUMAN RIHTES INVOLVES WITH IT THAT THAT'SAN AMAZING THING FORTY EIGHT PERCENT O BOTH SIDES EQUALICH IS WAVSING OUT OT ONE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOREPUBLICANS THE ANSWER IS SIXTY NINE PER CENT ISRAEL TWO PER CENT PALESTINIANS SEVENTEEN PER CENT BOTH EQUALLY FOR INDEPENDENS THIRTY FIVE PER CENT SAY ISRAEL ELEVEN PER CENT SAY THE PALISTINIANS EVEN MONG YOUNG PEOPLE A PLURALITY THIRTY ONE PER CENT SAY THE SUPPORT ISRAEL OFER TWENTY THREE PER CENT FOR THE PALISTINIANS UNDECIDED VOTERS WOR THE MOST LIKELY TO SAY THAT YOUUS IS DOING TOO MUCH FOR THESE RAILY GOERNMENT IN TO LITTLE FOR PALISTINIANS BUEGAIN THET THIS NOTION THAT SOMEHOW JOBIDAN IS GOING TO WIN ADITIONAL VOTES IF HE SUDDENLY FLIPS INSIDES IFH COMMASS IS AT RIDICULOUS I THINKG BYDAN KNOWS THAT SO HE WEIRDLY ENOUGH MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE BYDON IS OUT OF IT BUT HES ACTUALLY IS NOT TWO ONLINE WHEN HE ALOWS HIS TEEM TO BE TWELVE ONUS VERY BAD FOR HIM HE'S ACTALLY NOT BEEN TWO UNLINE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUES SO YESTERDAY AT THE HOLIDAY PARTY I HE SUGGESTED OPENLY THAT HE WAS ZINIST WHICH THERE A LOT I TURNS OUT I KNOW THAT DYNIST IS COLED FOR JEW FOR A LOT O PEOPLE WHO HATE JEWS TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ORS IONIST HOR NOT JOUIGH NAMELY ANY ONE WHO BELIEVES THAT ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO EXIST AS A JEWISH STATE IS A ZIONIST THOUT INCLUDE JOBIDON A OR IN I A E E E  THE DU  DON COB GEIA E AYOF  E PAR MY TA ON O PAR OFTHE COUNTRY WHEN NOT THERTY GIESGI SAD DON'T HAD TO BE E BEZIN ON ISIN GON   YON HE IS CORRECT ABOUT ALL OF THAT NOW WHIT'S AMAZING IS AGAIN THE AMOUNT PROPAGAN OF BEING PUT FORTH BY THE LEGACY MEDIA ABOUT THIS CONFLICT IS TRULY ASTONISHING AND AN PEOPLE ARE BUYING INS IT SO FOR EXAMPLE THE JORDANIAN FORN MINISTER PERSENTEND I'M ON ALSOPHIDI YESTERDAY HE GIVE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE SUGGESTED THAT ISRAEL WAS CREATING HATRED AROUND THE REGION YOUR RIGHT GUIDES UNTIL UNTIL ISRAEL LINNIN TO GOS TERE IS NO HATRED WHICH IS WY AN OCTOBER SEVENS THE MOST JUSEROSLAUGHTERD SINCE THE HOLIGOS OTHER THAN THAT NAILED T ALSO I GOT A SAY BEING LECTURED THE WEST BEING LECTURED ABOUT TREATMENT OF ISRAEL BY THE GARNANIANS IS ASTONISHING ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO TREATMENT OF THE PALESTINIANS JUST  RETRACE JORDANIAN HISTORY JORDAN IS CREATION OF THE BRITISH MANDATE THEY'VE NO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE THEY GOVERN THE KINGDOM OF JORDAN NOT ONLY THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY ALSO A COLONIAL A COLONIAL OUTPOST OF HISRAEL IS THE GORDANIAN KINGDOM HAD SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ENTIRITY OF JUDEA AND CIMARIA THE WEST BANK AND EAST JERUSALEM FROM NINETEEN FORTY EGHTO NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AND THEY NEVER ONCE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF CRATING A SEPARATE PALACE INIAN STATE WEARD THAT WHY BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT IF THEY DID THAT IT MIGHT TOPLE THEIR OWN DYNASTY THEY ALSO HAVE REFUSED MULTIBLE TIMES OVERTURES FROM ISRAEL TO HAND OVER  CONTROL OF SOME OF THESE AREAS TO THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT WHY BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE PALCINIAN POPULATION IN THESE AREAS IS INCREDIBLY RADICALIZED AND HATES THEM AS MUCH AS IT HATES THE JUCUS BY MEANWHILE YOU GOT THE GORDANIAN GOVERNMENT SITTING ASIDE LECTURING EVERYBODY IS JUST THTE HYPOCRISYIN TE MADELEAST IS TRULY AN AMAZING THAING HERIGO IS THATIS GREETE TAT AMONT TOPII THE GOUD ON TIS TIS TIS EEGIEN TE GOUD DEPIN TUNORATIONS WILL COME AN THEREFOR IT CERTIN ITS ON PEETET IS MUCHAS E TISTE INGO E TETS O THEEGEN THIS IS A

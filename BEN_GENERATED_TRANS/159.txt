THE BI DEDMINISTRATION USES MEDICAR TO CRAM DOWN PRICING OWN DRUG COMPANISWELL CLAIMING TELPATIONS BUT THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IS UNDEFEATED THE NATIONAL ARKCHIVES REVEALS THERE ARE FIFTY FOUR HUNDREDEMALS FROM JOBIDON USING SUDENUMS AND HURRICANE ITALIA PREPARES TO MAKE LANDFALL I'M BENSHPIRO THIS IS THE BENCH PIRO SHOW TO DAY SHO SPONSER BAEXPRESS VIE HAN DOU LECCUR BYB HISTERE BEING SEEN IN SOLD THE ADVERTISERS NOW MA NEITHER AT EXPRESS WE CAN RIGHT OUT EXPRESS BE PIANDACOMS FLASHMEN UTON OLD SAW IN POLITICS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH WELL APPARENTLY THEIRE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THAT WHO BELIEVE THERE IS SUCH A THING AS FREE  MEDICINE AND THE WAY THAT THEY ARE BASELY MACNICASES IS THAT BIG FARMA IN THE UNITED STATES MAKES A LOT OF MONEY NOW THERE RE LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH BIG FARMA FOR SURE THERE ARE DRUGS THERE REALLY NOT GRAT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE MARKETED AS THOUGH THEY ARE AMAZING FOR PEOPLE A THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLE BEING OYCONTON BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT EVERY SINGLE DRUG YOU TAKE WAS DEVELOPED BY BIG FARMA EVERYSONGAL MEDICINE YOU TAKE WAS DEVELOPD BY BIG FARMA SO BIG FARMAIS RESPONSIBLE FOR OXYCON TER ALL SO RESPONSIBLE FOR ADVAL HE BIG FARMA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EMARNA VEXING THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE BIG FARMA IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE KEEP MOT THEROPE MEDICATIONS THE AR MOTHER IS TAKING SO BIG FARMA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THOSE THING IN THE MEDICAL ADVANCEIS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE LED TO A TREMENDOUS EXEXPANSION OF LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE UNITED STATES THE THE FIVES ER CANTSER SURVIVALRATE IN THE UNITED STATES IS MUCH HIGHER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH THE REASON BEING WE HAD BETTER MEDICINES THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE WE DEVELOP A HUGE NUMBER OF MEDICAL PATENS RIGHT HERE IN TE UNITED STATES WILL THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO DRUG PRICING IS MAYBE THE LAST COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT ACTIVELY ALLOWS PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO BY DRUGS AT THE PRICE TBIG FARMUP IS SELLING THE DRUGS AT AS SUPPOSED TO USING THE GOVERNMENT TO CRAM DOWN PARTICULAR PRISING NOW THIS MEEN OF BUGABOO FOR A LOT OF POLITICIONS BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT CANADA OR THEY LOOK AT GERMANY OR THEY LOOK AT EUROPE OR ANY PLACE ELSE ON EARTH AND THEY SAY WHAT THEI'R BUYING THOSE AMERICAN DRUGS FOR FAR LESS THAN WE ARE PANG FOR THOSE AMERICAN DRUGS THIS IS WHAT LED YESTERDAY THE BIDIN AMINISTRATION TO THROUGH THE IN FLATION REDUCTION ACT THAT IN NOTHING TO D WITH INFLATION RDUCTION AT ALL IT TURNS OUT THE PREMUCH THE ENTIRE THING WAS ABOUT GIVING AWAY MONEY FOR GREEN BOON DOGGLES AND ALSO APPARENTLY SCREWING UP THE DRUG MARKETS YESTERDAY THE US GOVERMENT NAME TEN DRUGS TAT WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FIRST EVER PRICE NEGOTIATIONS BY MEDICAR TAKING AIMENT ROM THE MOST WIDELY USED AND COSTLYE'S MEDICONS IN THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO TE WALZTER JURNAL AT STAKE IS ARGUABLY THE GOVRNMENTS STRONGEST EFFORTTO DATES TO TACKLE HIGH DRUG COSTS IF DRUG MAKERS CAPTPRSWAT COURSE TO SCUTTLE THE NEGOTIATING POWERS THAT MEDICARE WAS GRANTED LAST YEAR ON THE LIST OF TARGANDED MEDICINES ANNOUNCED BY THE BY DEDMINISTRATIONS WHOSE D OUR TREATMENTS FOR CANCER DIABEDIES AN HARTYZES THAT CAN COST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR OR MORE INCLUDING T THE BLOOD A THINNER ELOQUESS AND DIABEDES TREATMENT JARDIANS MEDICAR SPENT FIVE A FIFTY POINT FI BILLION DOLLARS ON THOSE DRUGS LAST YEAR ACORDING TO JP MORGAN CHASE THE TEN DRUGS INCLUDE MANY DRUGS FIGHTING  DIBEDES I'S ANARTHRIGHTIS DRUG FROM AMTIN CALLED AND BRIGLETON THE LIST THERE THEIR SRIASIS DRUG FROM  JOHNSON AND JOHNSON STACY DUS ZENA A HEALTH POLITY PROFESSOR AT VANDERBILL UNIVERSITY CHOOL O MEDICANC THAT IS A MAJOR STEP TOWARD REDUCING DRUG SPENDING AND OF COURSE JOBIDON IS VERY EXCITED BOUL ALL  THIS HE SAYS WE PAY WAY MORE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAN ANY OTHER ECONOMY ON THE WORLD IN IN THE WORLD AND HERE HE WAS YESTERDAY EXPLAINING THAT IF IT' SOLD IN CHICAGO YOUR PAYING MORE MONEY THAN IF YOU ARE BUYING IT IN TORONTO OR PARIS O COPINMAR HARN MARICER CHICAGO OO PCONR I CAY WELL THAT'S TRUE BUT THE REASON THAT THAT'S TRUE IS BECAUSE BASICALLY THE UNITED STATES HAS LOUD A BUNCH OF OTHER COUNTRIES TO FREE RIDE OFF THE PRICES THAN AMERICANS ARE PAYING SO WHAT EXACTLY WOULD THE DOWNS FROM EFFECTS OF THISPE ACCORDING THE WALSTER JOURNAL THE POSITIVE DOWN STREAM FACTS WOULD BE LOWER PRICES THOSE WOULD TAKE AFFACT IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX MEDICAIR WOULD SAVE ANESTIMATE A TWENTY FIE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE THE SAVINGS WOUEN MOSTLY GO TO MEDICARE BECAUSE IT PAYS THE BULK OF THE COST OF THE DRUGS THE REDUCTIONS WOULDN'T DIRECTLY AFFECT THE PRICE PATIENTS PAY AT THE FARMASY COUNTER BUT THE PRICE CUTSWOULD HAVE AN INDIRECT IMPECT ION PEOPLE SPENDING MEDICAR PLANS TO USE THE SAVINGS TO PUT A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR ANUEL CAP AND HOW MUCH MEMBER'S HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR DRUGS STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVES TUT TOWNS AGAN UNALLOYED GOOD RIGHT EVERYTHING IS GRATE IT'S OUSM THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WHICH IS THE MEDICAL INNOVATION IN THE UNITED STATES ISABOUT TO CRATER AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT CAN CRAMM DOWN PRICING AN ANY PARTICULAR AREA AND REMOVE THE PROFIT MARGIN FROM THE FROM THE ACTUAL PRICING MECHANISM THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO INVESTS THE KINDS O MONEY THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDERTO CREATE THE DRUGS IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE SAME WAY THAT RENT CONTROL DECREASES PEOPLE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTING BECAUSE WIWC YOU BILD A NEW APARTMENT KNOWING THERE'S NO PROFIT IN IT THE INVESTMENT IN THE BYO TEXT FERE IS'S GOING TO UTTERLY DRY UP IF THE GOVERNMENT VEAMEDICAIR CONTINUES TO CRAMM DOWN POLICIES LIKE THIS ONE BY THE WAY THE POLICY ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY WILD AN MEAN THE WAY THAT THEY ARE CRAMMING THIS THING DOWN IS THAT THEY GO TO THE COMPANYIS THAT THE MEDICAIR GOES TO THE COMPANIES THET PRODUCE THE DRUGS AND THEN THEY TELL THEM THAT THEY ARE NOW GOING TO BE SUBJECTED TWO THIS SERVE ARBITRARY CHOICE WHERE THEY WHERE THEY PICK YOUR DRUG OUT OF LINE UP AN THEY SAPE FROM NOW ON WE ARE GOING TO CRAM DOWN A PRICE ON OU THE SAMS CAN ONLY SELECT DRUGS HAD BEENO THE ARKET FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME FOR INSTANCE A SMALL MOLECULE DRUG A PRODUCT AN PILLFORM LIKE ASPAN MUST AVE BEN ON TE MARKETD FOR NINE YEAR'S A MORE TO BE NEGOTIATION ELIGIBLE A BY LOGIC DRUG IF ACSEENORGIN THERBY MUST HAVE BEN MARKETED FOR THIRTEEN YEARS OR MORE FOR ELIGE ABILITY THEYARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPTIONS THE DRUG MAKERS CAN USE THEY CONSI THAT THEI'RE SMALL BIATECT THAN THEY MANUFACTURE LIKE ONE DRUG OR BY LOGIC DRUGS HAT HAVE A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF GETING BY A SIMILAR COMPETITION WITHAN A COUPLE OF YEARS ON LIST THERE'S NO RES TO CRAM DOWN THE PRICE THERE'S GONE TO BE SOMEBODY WIC VELVPSAGE NERIC BUT THE THIS THE START OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS BASICALLY THEYARE NOTIFIED BY MEDICAIR THAT THEY ARE NOW SUBJECT TO A PRICE CRAM DOWN AND THEY HAVE TO DECIDE THEN WHETHER TO ENTER INTO TALKS IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO THEY WOULD THEN FACE AN EXCIZE TACKS SKALING UP TO NINETY FIVE PER CENT NINETY FIVE PER CENTS THEY THEY WOULD STILL BEABLE TO SELL THER DRUG TO MEDICA BOUT MEDICA OULD THEN CLAWBACK THE OTHE POWERO THE FATDER GOVERNMENT NINETY FIVE PER CENT NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF ANY INCOME FROM THAT DRUG OR THEYWOUD HAVE TO LEAVE MEDICARE OR MEDICATE ALL TOGETHER WHICH BY THE WAY DOESN'T HELP PATIENTS ON MEDICAR OR MEDICADE A WHOLE HELL OF LOT A SUMING DRUG COMPANIES THAN ENTER INTO THE TALKS THE FINAL LEGOTIATORATE ON THE FIRST SENTOF DRUGS SAPPLIES TO THE FARMSY COUNTER STARTING JANUARY FIRST TWEINT TWENTSEC SO WHAT IS THE DOWNS FROM EFFECT OF ALL THIS WILL HERE IS THE THING THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT SEEING  TO DEVELOP A DRUG YES YOURE LOING AT THE DRUG YOU SEE IT COME ACROSS THE COUNT AR YOU LIKE WOO LOOK AT THE STICKER SHOCK ON THAT THING THAT IS AND DOESN'T COST NEAR THAT MUCH TO PRODUCE THE DRUG THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS PUT IN AR IN D ON DRUGS IS INSANE I MEAN TOTALLY CRAZY I KNOW THIS BECASE I PERSONALLY IN VEST IN BYOTET COMPANIES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS SUNK IN TO BYO TEC TO DEVELOP LIKE A WORKING DRUG IS TOTALLY CRAZY AND I PROMISE YOUV YOU'RE MOE THE PROPHIT MARGIN FROM THESE COMPANIES THERE'E JUST BE LESS INVESTMENT IN THES PERE DRUGS THAT WOULD BEEN PRODUCED JUST WILL MOT BE PRODUCE I'LL GET TO MORE ON THIS IN  JUST ONE SECOND FIRST I WANT A TALK YOU ABOUT DAILYWARS MOST TRUSTO PRIVESY PARDNER IN FOR MERE SPONSOR OF THIS SHOW EXPRESSIVE V PN WE ARE LIVING IN THE ERA OF TYRNEY THE NTERNET IS TO THE FRONTIER OF A BATTLE FOR CONTROL WHEN POWERFUL INTEREST ONE A PUSH T THEIRE GENDA THEY GET BIG GOVERNMENT AND BIG TEC TO

MORE AGA SO IN ORDER TO UNDER STAND WHY THE GOVERNMENT CANCUR SIMPLY NAME PRICES FOR DRUGS AND THEN MAGRICALLY THE PRICE COMES DOWN YE'VE TO SEE THE DOWNS FROM EFFECTS THE PRICE'S ON THOSE DRUGS WILL INDEED COME DOWN IT'S THE DRUGS THAT WILL NEVER BE DEVELOPED THAT ARE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO IN TWENTY NINETEEN ALONE THE FARMAR SUITICAL INDUSTRY SPENT EIGHTY THREE BILLYAN DOLLARS SONCE TWENTY NINETEEN EIGH THREE BILLION ON AR IND RESIRCTION EVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO ONE TWENTY TWENTY STUDY WHICH COVERED SIX HUNDRED THIRTY TWO NEWTHEIR APPUTED DRUGS AND BYOLOGIC AGENTS OPPROVE BY THE F T THE ESTIMATED MEDIAN CAPITALIZED RE SEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COST PER PRODUCT WAS NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS  COUNTING EXPENDITURES ON FAILE DRIALS WHICH SHOULD COUNT BECAUSE THE VASTMAJORITY OF DRUGS TET ARE ORIGINALLY DEVELOPE NEVER MAKE ATO MARKET SOME ORTIN EIGHTY FIVE AND NINETY PER CENT OF ALL DRUGS THAT ENTER FASES ONE TESTI NG NEVER MAKE IT THROUGH F TA APPROVAL PROCESS BUT THEY COST A WAT O MONEY S THAT MEANS THAT FOR EVERY DRUG HAT ACTUALLY HITS THE MARKEN AND IT'S NOT THAT MEN DRUGS EVERY YEAR IT HUN MA I DOESIN COUPLE DOESN'T DRUGS HITING THE MARKET EVERIER IT'S COSTING LIKE ALMOST TO BILLION BY SOME ESTIMATES  SOM RETON ONE POIN THRE AND TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TWO DEVELOP EACH ONE OF THE WHAT TO ONE POING THRANGE TO POIN FOR BILLION DOLLARS TO DEVELOP EACH ONE OF THOSE DRUGS THAT'S HO MUCH MONEY THESE COMPANIES HAVE TO SPEND UP FRONTS TO EVEN TOEVELOP A WORKING DRUG SO HOW TO THE MAKE THAT MONEY BACK WHAT MAKES A PROFITABLE WHY WOULD THEY SPEND ONE POINE TO REACH TO POIN FOR BILLION DOLLARS I'M CRETIG A DRUG OR RISK  HUNDREDSTO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DRUGS THAT AREN' T EVER GOING TO MAKE IT OUT OF FACE THREE WELL THE REASON IS BECAUSE ON THE OTHER END THERE HASE TO BE SOME SORTS OV WAY TO EARN BACK THAT MONEY NOW AMERICANS DO BEAR THE BRUNTS THE COST BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FREE RITING WE ALSO CAPTURE THE INDUSTRY UPSIDE IT USED TO BE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THAT A HUGE PER SENTANT OR DRUGSIRECTURE DEVELOPED IN EUROPE TO DAY A HUGE PER SENTANTOR DRUGS AREDEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO ONE TWENTY TEN STUDY THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNT ED FOR FORTY TWO PER CENTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG SPENDING AND FORTY PER CENTS OF TOTAL GETIPY AMONG INERVATOR COUNTRIES AN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN PER CENT OF WHAT ARE CALED N M ES NEW MOLECULAR ENTITIES ACCORDING TO THE BEALAZ THE BEARE OF LABER STATISTICS THE FARMA SUITICAL AN MEDISON MANUFACTURING INDISTRIES RESPONSIBLE FORABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES NOTS ITTA BIG BUSINESS AND TO BIG BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE'S ACTURAL FREEDOM OF PRICING IN THE UNITED STATES TO WHAT EXACTLY WOULD HAPPEN IF MEDICARY GETS AWAY WITH CRAMMING DOWN THIS PRICING STRUCTURE ACCORDING TO NATIONAL EVIEWS  JEFFSIMEARI DRUG DEVELOPMENT WOULDROP OFF ND THA'S NOT AE GORING HAMINS GOING TO S B O THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE HAS PREDICTED THE SCHEME PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACTS WOULD LEAD TO A MANUFACTURE REVENUE LOSS OF FIFTEEN PER CENT SUCH AE CUT AND SEBEOES PREDICTED FORTY FIVE NEW DRUGS PER YEAR WHICH YOU JUST ROUND SEVEN FEW AR DRUGS PER YEAR THAT MEANS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE DRUGS LOST OVER IN EIGHTEEN YEAR TIME HORIZON AS ONE REPORT ESTIMATED SO WHICH DRUGS TO BE MOST LIKELY TO DISAPPEAR THE DRUGS MOST LIKELY DISAPPIRIT ACTIOAN BE THE ONES THAT ARE FOR RARE CONDITIONS RIGHT THE ONES THAT HAVE LESS OF A PROFIT MARCIN TO BEGIN WITH THOSE DRUGS WORE JUST GO AWAY SEENG FORGET ABOUT DRUGS BEING DEVELOPS FOR THE RARE CONDITION THE OUR MOTHER JUST GOT DIAGNOS BUT THOSE JUST NOT GOING TO BE IN THE MARKET ANY MORE BECAUSE WHO THE HEL'S GOING TO DEVELOP THEN IF TERE'S NO MONEY ON THE OTHER END THERE'S ANOTHER SOLUTION OF THIS BY THE WAY THAT' SOLUTION BE TO A RESSIVELY MAKE OTHER COUNTRIES PAY THEIR FAR SHARE WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICAN MEDICATION WE COLD USE EVERY LEAVERT OUR DISPOSAL IN ORDS DO THAT AND THIS IS WHERE A TRADE WAR WOULD ACTUALLY BE SOMEWHAT USEFUL SAYING TO CANDIDA OR SAYING TO THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE YUGUYS ARE GOING TO PAY A MERICAN COMPANIES WHAT WE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES PAY AND WE'RE GOING TO USE THE LEAVERS AT OUR DISPOSAL IN ORDR TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN THAT WOULD BE WELL WORTH WHILE HE'S RIGHT NOW BASICALLY AMERICA IS SUBSIDIZING THE REST OF THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO DRUG CREATION BUT THE SOLUTION TO THAT ISN'T FOR AMERICAN GOVERNMENT TO THEN CRAM DOWN A PRICING MECANISM ON THE BIG FARM A COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES AND MEDICINE COMPANIES WHET WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU JUST GET RID OF ALL THE INIVATION IMAGINE FIRST SECOND IF THE UNITED STATES IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY DECIDE THAT RUGESCIN A RACHET DOWN COST SUPPOSE IT GOVERNMENT COST ON ANY OTHER AIR OF AMERICAN LIFE I TAKE THE TAXECTOR OR OR TAKE THE FINANTIAL SECTOR RIGE SKIN A RACHET UP TAXATION AND WERE GING TO DO SO IN ORDER TO LOWER SUPPOSEDLY THE COST O TH AMERICAN TAX PAYRAGES CAN ATTACK THAT PRETICULAR SECTOR WHAT DEU THINK HAPPENS PEOPLE FLEE THE INNOVATION GOES AWAY THIS IS SIMPLE SUPPLYING DEMAN KIND OF STUFF WHEN YOU GET RID OF THE PROFIT MARGIN IN PARTICULAR PRODUCT LINE THERE IS LESS INNOVATION THERE'S LESS INVESTMENT IN THAT AREA IT'S VERY SIMPLE BUT YOURBIDE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THAT HE CARES ABOUT THE TOP LINE LOOK THAT HE'S BRINGING DOWN COST THE LOSTONOVATION IS OF NO CONSEQUENTE TO HIM WHATSOEVER THECAUSE WHN IT COMES TO BIDE NOMICS SECOND ORDER THINKING IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT IT'S ALL FIRST ORDER THINKING I DON'T LIKE THE PRICE THAT DRUG THEREFORE I WILL USE GOVERNMENT TO CRAMM DOWN O NEW PRICE ON THAT DRUG SURE MEANS THAT A BUNCH OF DRUGS AREN' CON PARTICIPATE MEDICAR YOU'E STUNGEN HAVE TOGET THEM OVER THE COUNTER SURE IT MEANS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE THE INVATION BY THESE COMPANIES OR HAVE THEM BASE THEMSELVE SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT AT LEAST YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HAVING SUPPOSEDLY BROUGHT DOWN THE COST BY THE WAY LIKE DEMOCRAT'S CARE ABOUT THE COST OF METICAR SIT IS SINCE WHEN AF DEMOCRATS CARE ABOUT THE COSTOMETICAR THEY ON EN RESTRUCTURE MEDICANR MEDICATE SOCIAL SECURITY WHICH REPRESENT SIXTY SIX PER CENT OF THE AMERICAN MANDITORY BUDGEEN EVERY YEAR ANY TIME ANYBODY MENTIONS MAYBE SHOULD RESTRUCTURE THOSE PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO LOWER THE COST THOUGIG NONE AN NOP THE CANTUCHIT APARENT THE ONLY WAY TO TOUCH ET IS TO CONFISCAPE MONEY AND INNOVATION FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR GENIUS IDEAS WEET TO ANOTHER GENIOUS IDEA THAT'S GOING UNDER THE RATE AR AND IS BEING CRAMMED DOWN BY THE BIDIN A MINISTRATION THE THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD IN JUST ONE  SECOND FIRST IT CAN BE VERY TOUGH YOU MAINTAIN A HEALTHY LIFESTOLT WITH THE BUSY SCHEDDULS I'M PRETTY BUSY AND IHVE ANOTHE PROBEM I

LAST WEEK I'S GOING COMPLETELY UN NOTICED AND IT'S GOING TO UTTERLY RACK A HUGE NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS BIG MOVE WELL THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD AND I'M AN TO SAY IT UP FRONT BECAUSE THEY'VE ACTUALLY COME AFT FRM IUS MANE JOKES ABOUT THEM I'M NOT KETTING THEY LITTERALLY SENT US HA LETTER BECAUSE I WON T'S MADE A JOKE ABOUT MY EMPLOYES AND UNIONS WE ABY BY ALL LAWS AND REGULATIONS HERE AT DAILYWAR ALSO THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BORDS A JOKE AND GARBAGE INSTITUTION THAT SHOULD'T BE A PART OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IT IS EFFECTIVELY SPEAKING A TOOL OF ORGANIZED LABOR AGAINST THE AMERICAN TAX PAIR AND THE WORKER AND BUSINESSES THAT IS WHAT IT IS THE ANALARBY IS A BLOT ON AMERICAN LIFE WE BY BY ALL OFILBE LAWS AN REGULATIONS HERE DAILY WARE O CASE SO WITH ALL THAT'S AT IM TO KEEP SAYNG IT OVER AND OVER BECAUSE THE FA SCHUSTIC AND ALARBY LITERAL IF YOU MAKE A JOKE THE LITERALLY WILL LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO YOU REQUIRING YOU TO OBTAIN A LAYER TO EXPLAIN WHAT A JOKE IS IS A THING THAT THAT THEN JUST HAVEN TO MEATILS HIVEN TO BEN DOMINATE OVER THE FEDERALIS TO TAME DO BUNCH O PEOPLE SO THESE DOLTS OVER THE AN ALARBY OR UNION BASE SOCIALIST THEY THEY THEY HAVE DECIDED THEY'VE NOW ISSUE A DECISION IN THE CASE CALLED SEMAX CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL SPACIFIC THEY NOUNCE THA NEW FRAME WORK FOR DETERMINING ONE EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRE TO BARGAIN WITH UNIONS WITHOUT A REPRESENTATION ELECTION 'SO NORMALLY YOU'D HAVE TOHAVE REPRESENTATION ELECTION RIGHT YOU HAVE YOUR ENTIRE BASE OF YOUR EMPLOYS VOTE ON WHETHER I FORM A UNION OR NOT NOW I'M NOT EVEN IN FAVOR OF THAT I THINK THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT IS RIDICULOUS ON ITS FACE IF EMPLOYSE WISH TO UNIONIZE THEN BY ALL MEANS GO AHEAD AND UNIONIZE BUT THAT MEANS THE YOU'VE TO GET ALL THE EMPLOYS TO BE PART OF THE UNION  NOT BY VOTING IN MAJORITY BUT BY GETTING IM TO ACTUALLY JOIN THE UNION IF I DON'T WISH TO JOIN UNION I WISH TO INDEPENDENTLY NEGOTIATE MY SALARY WITH THE EMPLOYER THAT SHOULD E MY PREROGATVE AND FREE COUNTRY I SHOULN'T BE FORCED TO JOIN A UNION TJUST TO GIS A MAJORITY OF MY EMPLOYES WELL OF MY FELLOW EMPLOYS WHICH TO JOIN A UNION WHATIF I'M BETTER AT MY JOB THAN THEY ARE WHAT IF I'M WILLING TO WORK FOR LESS BEAKS ANY TO MONEY WHAT THAT THEIR BUNCH OF REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT NOT WANT A TOEN UNION WHICH AS PRESUMABLY WY UN THON MEMBERSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES IS DROPPED TO OAF SMALL FRACTION OF WHAT IT ONCE WAS TUNION MEMBERSHIP IN TH PRIVATE SECTION IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOW WHAT SEVEN PRERCENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT I'SECAUSE UNIONS WEREN'T DOING THEIR JOBS THERE 'S BANKRUPTING THE COMPANIES THAT THEY WERE SIPHENING MONEY AWAY FROM IN ANY CASE MANY OF THESE UNIONS NO LORTON H THEY WOUD HAVE REPRESENTATION ELECTION THEY'V THE END OF THE THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT POSIT IS THAT IF A MAJORITY OF MEMBERERS OF YOUR EMPLOY E BASE VOTE TO FORM A UNION YOU THEN BY LAW MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNION AGAIN AS THIY SAY THAT'S RIDICULOUS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY I'N WISHIO NEGOTIATE WTH TE UNION TND I'M SORR IF I LOSE THEM THOSE EMPLOYS WOTH THEIR OTHER EMPLOYS OUT THERE BUT THAT'S OWT THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACTS AYS WE BY BY AL LAWS AND REGULATIONS HERE THE DAILYWARE O CASE SO HERE IS WHAT THEY'REKNOWING NOW AT LEAST THESE TOAFE TO HOLD AN ELECTION THESE TO HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVEAN ELECTION NOW THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD I SAYING THE OPPOSITE THEY SAY THE NEW FRAME WORKAL EFFET WILL BOTH EFFECTUATE EMPLOYS RIGHT TO BARGAIN THO REPRESENTATIVES OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING AND IMPROVE THE FAIRNESS AND INTEGRITY OF BOR CONDUCTED ELECTIONS UNDER THE NEW FRAME WORK WHEN A UNION REQREST RECOGNITION ON THE BASIS THAN MAJORITY OF EMPLOYES IN AN APPROPRIATE BARGAINING IUNION HAVE DESIGNATED THE UNION AS THE REPRESENTATINE AND EMPLOYER MUST EITHER RECOGNIZE IN BARGAIN WITH THE UNION OR PROMPTLY FILE A PETITION SEEKING ELECTION E SO LET'S BE CLEAR THEY'RE NOW SAYING THERE'S NO ELECTION IF TERE'S NO ELECTION IS DETERMINE WHETHER A UNION WAS FORMED AT THE LOCAL LAMAZON PLANT IRE'S JUST SOME UNION ORGANIZER WENT THROUGH AND SED HAD EVERY SIGN A PETITION SAYING I WISH TO JOIN A UNION NOW ON THE PROMISE OF THAT IS CAN BING AN AWFUL OT PRESSURE BARE UNIONS FOR YEARS ARE BROUGHT ENORMOUS MOUNTS PRESSURE TO BAR AN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYES YOU KNONT ALL YOUR BUDIES 'LL THINK IF YOU DON'T SIGN THIS HERE PETITION YOU ARE SCREW BOB OVER THERE BOB KNOWS WHRE YOU LIVE LHICH IS WHY THEY'RE THEY'RE USE TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY YOU KNOW WEWHEN WE GO O VOTE THERE'S THE SECRET BALLAT WITH WITH UNIONS THETRE NOW MOVING AGAINST THAT THAT NOT BASIVELY SAYNG NO MORE SECRET BALLET YOU'RE GONG TO BE ABLE TO GO AROUND S TO YOUR OTHER EMPLOYESE AND YOUGINGTO HAVE THEM SIGN A PETITION AND NOW THE COMPANY HAS TO CHOICE IS ONE THEY CAN EITHER EXCEPT THE UNION AS FULLY FORMED AND NEGOTIATE WITH IT OR THEY CAN PETITION SEEKING AN ELECTION HOWEVER IF AN EMPLOYER WHO SEEKS AN ELECTION COMMITS ANY UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE THAT WOULD REQUIRE SETTING ASIDE THE ELECTION THE PETITION WILL BE DISMISSED AND RATHER THAN RE RUNNING THE ELECTION THE BOARD WILL ORDER THE EMPLOYED TO RECOGNIZE IN BARGAIN WITH THE UNION SO WHAT IS THIS MEAN THIS MEANS LET'S SAY THAT YOU FIND OUT FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOMEBODY H'S ACTIONMEAN PRESSURING EMPLOYES INSIDE OUR COMPANY TO SIGN I PETITION AND THEN N ELECTO AND SO YOU FIRE THEM FOR INTERFERENCE WITH YOU'R LABOR FORCE THE ANALAR BY COULD COME IN THE BACK DOOR IN NHEC TO CH YOU RN' ALLOWED TO FIRE THAT PERSON AND NOW YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY FORCED TO BARGAIN WITH THE UNION AUTOMATICALLY FORCED TO BARGAIN WITH THE UNION IT'S A MAJOR CHANGE THIS IS WHY THE AMERICAN PROSPECT IS EXTREMELY EXCITED THEY SAY THE SEMIX DECISION WAS PROCEEDED BY ANOTHER ONE DAY OR ALIER IN WHICH THE BOARD ALSO LONG PARTY LINES SET OUT RULES FOR REPRESENTATION ELECTIONS WHICH REQUIRED THEM TO BE HELD PROMPTLY AFTER THE BOARD HAV BEEN ASKED TO CONDUCT THEM CURSAILING EMPLOYES TO ABILIT ABILITY TO DELAY THEM OFTEN INDEFINITELY SO A LOT OF THE EMPLOYERS WOULD BASICALY SAY LET TOLD AN ELECTION BUT LET'S WAIT AMONTHS WE CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PULL PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM SOM MATERIAL AS TO THE COST OF OF IMPLEMENTING A UNIONIOR NOW THE WORTS HIN NUP GOT A HOLD THE ELECTION RIGHT AWAY SO LET'S JUST BE CLEAR NO ELECTION US SERTING THE FIRST PLACE CAAN GET PEOPLE TO ZIGN A PETITION TWO IF THEY DO REQUEST AN ELECTION THE LECTION UST O BE HELD LIKE NOW AND THREE YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TOU TAKE ANY ACTION THE ANL OUR B DEEMS YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE OR BAD AND IF SO THEY'LL JUST AUTOMATICALLY DECLARE TE UNION AS TE AMERICAN PROSPECT A FAR LEFS MAGAZINE SAYS TAKEIN TO GETHER THIS ONE TO PUNCH EFFECTIVELY MAKES UNION ORGANIZING POSSIBLE AGAIN HAFTER DECADES IN WHICH UN PUNISHED EMPLOYER I LAGALITY WAS THE MOST DECISIVE FACTORON REDUCING THE NATION'S RATE OF PRIVATE SECTOR UNION ISATION FROM ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE PER CENT TO A BAR SIX PER SENT ALL THIS IS RUDED BY THE WAY IN A PERVERSE AND STUPID VERSION OF YOU CANOMIC

TOWN IS EFFECTIVELY IN OLIGARCY AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNIONIZE IN ORDER TO CHANGE CONDITIONS OFTHE COMPANY TOWN HOWEVER TUNIONISATION IN AMERICA'S CAR INDUSTRY ABSOLUY DESTROYED THE AMERICAN CAR INDUSTRY IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES BECAUSE AMERICA WAS THE ONLY PLACE CAPABLE OF ACTUALLY MAKING CARS WERE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZE NATION ON EARTHTAT HADN'T BEEN WIPED OUT BY WORLD WORE TO GET BIG PROPHIT MARGINS AND THE UNIONS ORGANIZED AND THEY SIGN THEMSELVES EXTRAORDINARILY RICH CONTRACTS ND THOSE EXTRAORDINARILY RICH CONTRACTS END UP BASITLY BANKRUPTING ALL THOSE CAR COMPANIES BY THE SEVENTIES THIS IS VERY OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN UNIONS ARE GIVING OUTSIZE ABILITY TO ORGANIZED THIS PARTICULAR TRN THE PUBLIC SECTOR BY THEWAYOUON TALK ABOUT THE BLOATED PUBLIC SECTOR AND UNITED STATES PRIVATE SECTOR UNIONS IN SOME CASES ARE AT LEAST UNDERSTANDABLE PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS ARE BLOCKED PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS ARE THE MOST CORRUPT BARGAIN IN AMERICAN POLITICS ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF UNION ORGANIZERS AND THEY NEGOTIATE WITH LEGISLATORS FOR SOME SORT OF BIGT GIVE AWAY DEAL INCLUDING VERY OFTEN THE ABILITY FOR THE STATES TO ACTUALLY TAKE OUT OF PEOPLES PA CHECK UNION DUWS IN HAND OVER THE UNION THE UNION THEN USES THAT MONEY TO GET A BUNCH OF DEMOCRATS ELECTED AND THE THE NEGOTIATES WITH THOSE PEOPLE TO SIGN MORE GIVE AWAYS FOR THEMSELVES  SUPER DUPER CORRUPT AND ITS ONEOF THE REASONS THE COST OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SKYH ROCKETING YEAR ON YEAR FOR LITERALLY MY ENTIRE LIFE TIME BEYOND IF YOU THINK THAT THE COMBINATION OF THIS SORT OF TOP DOWN ECONOMIC CONTROLS CENTRALIZATION OF AMERICAN CAN OF OF CONTROL OF THEAMERICAN ECCONOMY BY THE VY  ADMINISTRATION IS NGAN TO HAVE LONG FROM AFFECTS ARE WRONG IT'S CAN HAVE WILD THE FACTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE DRUG INDUSTRY ISTAT HAE WILD THE FACTS WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS OVER ALL WITH REGARD TO THESE NEW UNIONISATION RULES IN HE BY MINISTRYT OF  HEBENMINESTRITION AND CARE THEY'RE UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS AND DON'T CARE ABOUT IT N THE THERE THERE LIKE SMALL CHILDREN IT COMES T ECONOMICS I DON'T LIKE HIGH PRICES THEREFORE I WILL USE THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT TO YELL ABOUT HIGH PRICES TO BRING THEM DOWN IL KEP THEI'R SECOND ORDER OF FACTS OF THIS SORT OF STUFF THEY'RE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ALWAYS THESE THE KIND OF IDIOTIC THINKERS TRULY HO BELIEVE THAT IT IN IN WHAT THEY CALL THE BROKEN WINDOWS FAULS YO W TH GARD ECONOMICS THAT IF YOU THROW IN ROCK THROUG WINDOW JUST HELPED THE ECONOMY BECAUE NOW SOMEBODY HAS TO GOB NEW PAIN OF GLASS NEGLECTING THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU BREAK THE WINDOW THAT CHOPOWNER WAS GOING TO USE THAT MONEY TO INVEST MAYBE IN ANOTHER EMPLOYE MAYEBE THAT CHOPOWNER WAS GOING TO BY NEW EQUIPMENT AND KNOW THEY IFE TO WASTE THEIR MONEY ON ANOTHER PAIN OF GLASS AND THAT THIS THIS BIZARE NOTION IN ECONOMICS THAT THE ONLY THIN YOU HAVE TO FOCIS HONE IS THA THING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HE IS SUPPOSED TO ALL OF THE OUTSIDES DEFFACTS BEYOND THAT THING IT'S THE DEATH OF ACTUAL EFFICIENCY IT'S THE DEATH OF ACTUAL INVASION THE MADMINSTRATION OESN'T CHARACTERIS LOOKING FOR GIVE WAST THE POLITICAL ALLIES ANYWAY MEANWHILE JOBIDON HAS TO LOCK DOWN THOSE POLITICAL ALLIES BECAUSE THE ENTIRE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS THAT JOBIDON IS UNPLEASANT THERE IS A GROWING IMPRESSION THAT HE HIS CORRUPT THAT GROWING IMPRESSION SHULD BEN LAUNCHED YOU KNOW AT THE BEANING OF IS POLITICAL CAREERICAUSE YOU BEN CORRUPT FOR LITERALLY HALF A GENERAE HALF A CENTURY AT THIS POINT IN AMERICAN POLITICS IBUT THA TH THE BIGGEST THING THAT STICKING TO RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE MAN OBVIOUSLY IS NO LONGER WITH IT TYESTERDAY CREEN JHOHN PIARE TRIED TO DEFEND JOBION'S VIRILITY SAND WHELL HE DID GO TO YOU CRAINE YOU MEAN HE TOOK A PLAIN AND THEN WANDERIN AROUND THEIR WOW SHOCKING STUFF THERE CREEN

MEANWHILE IT'S TIME FOR THESE STUPID RACHAL CONTROVERSY OF THE DAY SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE THE STUPIDEST RACIAL CONTROVERSY OF THE DAY IS NON RACIAL AT ALL ACCORDING TO FOX NEWSTI COM IVIDIOS CIRCULATING ON ACS THIS WEEK DEPICTED A YOUNG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTING COLERARO SPRINGS CHOLERADO BEING REMOVED FROM CLASS FRHAVING A GASTON FLAG PATCH ON HIS BACK BACK THE CLIP APPEARED TO BE RECORDED BI JANAN'S MOTHER A SHE HER SON AND SCHOOLAD MINISTER DISCUSSED THE BOY BEING POOLED FROM CLASS AT THE VANGAR SCHOOL THAT DAY BECAUSE OF THE BATCH ACCORING T THE STAFFER AT THE CHOLERADO CHARTER SCHOOL THE PATCHWAS JIS RUPTIVE TO THE CLASS FRM ENVIRONMENT AN THAT IT HAD ORIGINS WITH SLAVERY NO IT DOSN'T NO IT REALLY REALLY DOESN'T THE GASDON FLAG FOR THOSE WHO KNW NOTHING ABOUT IT WAS FORMED IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE BUT BEFORE THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION IT WAS FORMED AS ANOTHER VERIGIN OF THE SNAKE FLAG THE CEN OF THE JOINE OR DI FLAG THA WAS ACTUALLY IN PLAY FOR THE COLONIES SINCE LIKE THE SEVENTEEN FIFTIES AND AS NOTHING TO DO WITH SLAVERY WHATSOEVER AT ALL SO IT'S TWELVE YEAR OLD KID WHOSE CAMPAGNING FOR VICE PRESSON I LOVE THAT THE SCHOOL IS BASICALLY RUNNING LIKE A STEEL

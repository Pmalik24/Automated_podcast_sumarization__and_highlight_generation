CAMPAIGN WAIT UN TIL TWENTY TWENTY FORG AND WE'RE IN IT IT HAS BEGUN HI'S THE FIRST TIME BY THE WAY THAT JOBITON HA'S REALLY LAUNCHED AGAINST TRUMP IN THE CAMPAIGN SO HE'S REALLY BEEN ATTACKING CQUON KL MAG OR REPUBLICANS IN THE IMPRESSION THAT PERHAPS SOMPANY WO IS NOT ON TRUMPLASGON TO WIN THE NOMINATION I THINK BIDING HIS HARDY FIGURING I HAVE TO DE FIND MY PPONENT TRUMP IS LIKELY TO BE THE OPPONENT SO HE LAUNCHED A FULL SKILLE FRONTAL ASSAULT ON DONALD TRUMP AT LEAS BEST HE CAN NOW THE OBTECTS HE PICKS FOR THE SPEECHES ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE BUT STRAINGE SO THE OBTECTS HE PICKED FOR HIS LAST DEMOCRACY IS IN DANGER SPEECH WHICH WAS AS I RECALL BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO ELECTION THAT ONE WAS IN PHILADELPHIA HE'S FLANKED BY MARINES IN THE BACKGROUND AND A BLOOD RED INTEPENNANCE HALL AND THAT IS WHERE HE DECLARED THAT THIR'S A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION WELL THIS TIME HE DECIDED TO DO A  GENERAL PATEN HE'S STANDIG IN FRONTOF A GIANT AMERICAN FL AG AND AGAIN ALL OF THIS IS JUST A LITTLE MUCH IT'S A LITTLE MUCH NOT THE AMERICAN PLAG MAG PLACE GRATE BUT FLANKING YOURSELF THE AMERICAN PLAG WALL YOU DECLARE THAT THE PEOPLE WHOE ARE RUNNING AGAINST OUR THREATS TO THE ASCTUAL DEMOCRACY IT'S A LITTLE BIT MUCH IT'S A LITTLE MUCH AND THIS ENTIRE SPEECH WAS BIDON GOING FULL HITLER AS BIDON SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS A FULL SKALE MOTZY AND THOSE WHO HAD VOTE FOR HIM PRESUMABLY OAR LITTLE BROWNSHIRTS THAT WAS THE MESSAGE OF THE SPEECH HE DID NOT REALLY TO FERENSHATE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FOLLOWERS HE DID NOT REALLY TO FRENDSHAPE BETWEEN TRUMS FOLLOWERS AND OTHE REPUBLICANS HE' DIDN'T TO FRENSHAPE BETWEEN TRUMP VOTERS WHO DON'T LIKE JANUORSIX AND TRUMPHOTORS WHO DO LIKE JANUORSIX EVERYBODY WHO HOALD VOTE FOR TRUMP IS APPARENTLY IN THAT PARTICULAR CAMP AND THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS PLAG IT'S THE SAME SORT PLAY THAT HILLERY CLINTON TRIED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN SHE SUGGESTED THAT DONALD TRUMP AGAIN WAS THE LEADER OF THE DEPLORIBLES AND TURNS OUT THE KNOWN VOTED FOR HILLARYCLINTON PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T SHOW UP AND SO SHE LOST THE ELECTION WELL WHAT HAPPENS THIS TIME WHEN YOU HAVE AN AILING ELDERLY FRAGILE OLD MAN WHO HAS TERRANNICALLY USED THE POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE IN ORER TO OVERTHROW GENERATIONS OF PRESIDENT WITH REGARD TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT CANNON CANNOT DO STANDING UP THERE AND DECLARING THAT HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES ARE ACTUALLY ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC ITSELF SO AGAIN THAT'S WHY HE'S A BALLY FORG HE WANTS THE DARK HE WANTS THE COLD HE WANTS YOU TO FEEL THAT BUT HE WANTS YOU TO FEEL THAT NOT ABOUT HIS ADMINISTRATION BUT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP I THINK THAT THIS AMANK SHOT I REALLY DO BANKCHOTSTON TON TO WORKAN POLITICS FOR THOSE WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH BASKABOULT TERMINOLOGY A BANKSHOT IS WHEN YOU USED THE BACKBOARD IN ORD TO MAKE A BASKET ANOTHER WORDS IT REQUIRES A RICKASHIY JO BIDON ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP AS A CANDIDATE WITH REFERENCE TO JANUARY SIXTH PARTICULARLY AS OPPOSED TO WHAT DONNAL TRUMP WILL DO AS PRESIDENT OR WHAT DONALD TRUMPS O GENDA IS AS PRESIDENT IT IT'S NOT CON A PLAY BECAUSE AGAIN HE DAIT ON THE CALENDER AS OF TO DAY IS JANUARY EIGHTH OF TWO THOUSAN AND TWENTY FOUR WE ARE NOW THREE FULL YEARS REMOVE FRUM JANUARY SIX AND IN THAT INTERVENING TIME DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT IN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT HO HORRIBLE JANUORS SIX WAS AT I THINK JANUORSEX ACTUALLY WAS QUITE HORRIBLE FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT JANUARY SIX WAS HORRIBLE I DID NOT ACTUALLY STOP THE PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER IN THE UNITED STATES IT DID NOT DONAL TRUMP LEFT OFFICE ON AN ALLGURATION DAY AND DROBIDEN BECAME PRESIDENT AND SINCE THEN THERE'VE BEEN THREE INTERVENING YEARS SINCE THEN THEREVE BEEN THREE INTERVENING YEARS OF THIS MAN BEING PRESIDENT AND HRE'S WAN TALK ABOUT ANY OF THAT ANY OF IT HE JUST WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HOW DONALD TRUMP IS A THREAT TO THE REPUBLIC AND ACAIN THIS WOULD GO OVER A LOT BETTER IF THIS GUY HIMSELF WERE NOT A THREAT TO THE REPUBLIC AS WELL DISCUSS SO HURA HERE IS JOBIDON LAUNCHING INTO HIS THAT THIS REALLY WAS THE LAUNCH OF HIS CAMPAIGN THIS IS THE FIRST PIECE OF HIS CAMPAIGN RELAUNCH VERY REGARDER YEAR TRUM TWO HUNDRED FORTY SICURS LATER JUST ONE DAY EFORE JANUAR E SIX A DAY FREER SURD AR MAVER BECASIT WAS ON THAT DAY WE NEARLY LOST TE MEN LOST AT ALL OET NO ONE WHO HAS A BRAIN BELIEVES THUS NO ONE BELIEVES THE JANUARY SITS WE NEARLY LOST AMERICA IT WAS A RIOT THAT WENT OUT OF CONTROL AND THEN WAS CLEARED UP WITHIN THREE HOURS AND THEN THE VOTE WAS CERTIFIED BY REPUBLICANS AND THEN JOBIDE MAKE CIM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DOES ANY ONE BELIEVE THT A BUNCH OF GOLTS AND SOME PEOPLE WHO JUS DIDN'T NOW THE HOW THEY WERE DOING WALKING THROUGH THE CAPITALBILDING WAS A THREAT TO THE VERY FABRIC OF THE MOST POWERFUL REPUBLIC IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD FORALL THE PEOPLE WERE SAYING THA IT WAS A COU TYPICALLY A COO REQUIRES YOU TO ACTIVATE THE MILITARY AND TO USE THAT MILITARY POWER IN ORDER TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE LEVERS OF POWER DID ANY OF THAT HAPPEN IIN THE ACTUAL BUILDING ITSELF WHAT WAS THE CROWD GENERALLY ARMED WITH WEAPONRY IE FONS HIM KNIVES ON BEU THEY FIND LIKE LOTS OF GUNS I'M BAZUGA'S ROCKET LONCHERS LIKE WHAT IYET YOU YOU CAN POINT OUT THET JANUARY SIX WAS UGLY AND TERRIBLE AND WAS PREDICATED ON A LIE WHICH THE DEVICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD THE POWERST UNILATERALLY OVERTHROW THE SORT OF FIED ELECTION RESULTS FROM STATES THAT WASN'T TRUE IT'S A BAD LEGAL THEORY AND DONAL TRUMPS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PUSHING THAT GRAP ES THAT THE SAME THING AS WE ALMOST LOST IT ALL THAT DAY BUT THE PILLT HERE'S THE THING THE REASON THAT BIDING HAS TO SAY THAT IS BECAUSE SIMPLICATION IS THAT IF DONALD TRUMP WINS THE NEXT SELECTION YOU WILL NEVER VOTE AGAIN DO YOU THNK THAT'S TRUE I DON'T THNK THAT'S TRUE I ONLY TAS TRUE THAT IF DONALD TRUMP WINS THE NEXT ELECTION YOU WILL NEVER VOTE AGAIN I ONLY YOU KNOW IN FACT I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT'S NOT TRUE THATIS NOT A REALITY HE HAST IT THE THE WORSE IS PRESIDENTCS HE LOOKS THE WORSE HE HAS TO PAINT TRUMP ATS A FASHUST SO THE FACT THAT HE'S GOING IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOURT LICE ELEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION THE FACT THAT HE'S ALREADY GOING TRUMP IS A NOTSY WHERE D YO WEUVEVEEN GO FROM THERE HOW DO YOU BUILD THE CAMPAIGN BEYOND THAT WHAT'S WORSE THAN NOTSY BY TRUMPEITS GOIN TO BE FULLON STATAN HE CAN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE TO ANY

KNOTICED THAT YOU'RE AT VALLEY FORGE AND YOU ARE SIGHTING VA PAST THAT THIS ISN'T FACT THE ENTIRE STICK OF THE CAMPAIGN SO SO YOU BEING OUT THERE SAYING THAT DONAL TRUMP IS ALL ABOUT THE PASS AND WORL ABOUT THE FUTURE AS OBVIOUSLY NO TRUEALSO WHEN HE SAYS THINGS LIKE ARS SACRED DEMOCRACIES AT RES AGAIN I WOULD TAKE THAT A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO OVER THROW

JANUARY SIXTH AS THOUG IT IS REPRESENTATIVE THE GREAT BREACH IN AMERICAN SOCIETY BUT IT REALLY REALLY IS NOT IT REALLY IS NOT I THINK THIS MOUTH WORKS WHEN JOBIDON IS NOT ON THE BALLAD BUT WHEN JOBIDON IS ON THE BALLAT HINS CAN OFE A TOUGH SELL THEN JOBIDNT STARTED TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WON THE LAST SELECTION WHICH OF COURSE IS TRUE WHAT'S WEIRD THOUGH IS THAT WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THAT HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WINNING THE ELECTRAL COLLEGE WHICH IS ACTUALLY HOW YOU WIN ELECTIONS THAT WAS THE ENTIRATE DEBATE OF THE JANUARY SIXTH RIOTERS IN IN COMPATRIOTES THE WERE A TIME AT TH ELECTRAL COLLEGEIN STATES CERTIFICATIONS AN ALL THE REST INSAID HE SIDED THE POPULAR VOTE WHICH AGAINS A WEIRD THING UNTIL WEARE WE DON'T DECIDE PRESIDENTIAL LECTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY BASE ON THA POPULAR ABOUT A RECORD EIGHTY ONMILLION PEOPLE VOTEN MY CANS THANDISTES TROP LOST THE POPULAR VOTE BY SEVEN MILLION GET THEN HE SUGGESTS THE DONAL TRUMP IF HE WERE TO LOSE OR IF HE WERE TO COME PRESIDENT AGAIN AND HAD THE POWER HE WOULD INVOKE THE INSURRECTION ACT TO GONG RESTALL OF HIS ENEMIES NOW GET THAT THAT IS NOT WHEN DOWN TRUM TALKED ABOUT NVOKING THE INSURRECTION ACT WHOS TALK ABUT TO STOP ACTUAL HONEST GOD RIOTS IN THE STREETS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY HERE IS JOBIDON JUST LET I GESS THE IDEAHERS THAT IF DONAL TRUM BECOMES PRESIDENT THEN JOBIDEN WILL ENT UP IN JAIL BECAUSE TRUMPINVOKES THE INSURRECTION

POISONING THE BLOOD OF THE COUNTRY HEWILL TALK ABOUT HOW MAGNETS DON'T WORK IN WATER THAT'S ABOUT HOW SERIOUSLY MOST PEOPLE TAKE DONALD TRUMPS ACTUAL VERBIAGE BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT DONAL TRUMP WHO IS BUFFOONISH WHEN HE SPEAKS VERY OFTEN EIS SOMEHOW THE SAME PERSON WHO IS GOING TO IN VOKTHE INSURRECTION ACT IN SEND FEDERAL TROOPS INTO YOUR HOME TO ARRESTUE IF YOU OPPOSE HIM OR SOMETHING AND HE SAYS THIS FIGT THE  OPPONENTS OF THE REPUBLIC OUR PONENTS OF DEMOCRACY HE SAID AT A AT A RALLY FLANKED BY A GIANT BACKDROP OF AN AMERICAN FLAG AS HE LABLES HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC AND THEN OF COURSE HE LUMPS IN OUR RE PUBLICANS AD THIS IS THIS IS HIS MAINSTICK HIS MAINSTICK IS THAT HE IS GOING TO LUMPIN PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY THAT'S CLIP EIGHT IS TRUE THE

HE'S EXPLOITING FEAR FOR PERSONAL GANE HE SAYS FROM THOSE WHO TRAFFIC AN LIES TOLD FOR POWER AND PROFIT HE LITERALLY LIES ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES SUGGESTING THAT BECAUSE AMERICA HAS TERRIBLE RACIAL HISTORY THAT MEANS THAT ALL IN AQUOLITY TO DAY IS A FORM OF AN EQUITY HE SAYS THE PEOPLE WHOARE TRIVEN BY GRIEVANCE AND GRIFT AND CONSUME BY CONSPIRICY AN VICTIM HUT ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE HE'S ENTIRE COALITION IS A COALITION OF THE SUPPOSED VICTIMS FROM THOSE SEEK TO BURY HISTORY AND BAND BOOKSTHERE LITERALLY PULLING DOWN STATUES IT'S IT'S TRULY NAMAZING THING THIS PITCH IS NOT GOING TO WORK IF THIS IS BIDON'S FINAL PITCH I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS CANNACT IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT DID EVEN SAY IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN JOBIDON WAS NOT ACTUALLY ON THE BALLAT A THIS A TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLAT BUT NEITHER WAS BIDON WHEN BIDON IS ON THE BALLAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHELL GET TOU JOE BIDON IN  JUST AT ONE SECOND HIS ACTUAL LOOK WHAT'S ATUALLY HAPPENING TO HIM THE'S PAR THE PROBE IS THE PERSON PRESENTING THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A CREDIBLE PERSON PRESENTING THIS MESSAGE FIRST I KNOW IT'S LIKE TO START AND RUN A BUSINESS DONE HERE AT DAILY WAR TIME SAVING IS KEY THAT'S WHAT I'M VERY EXCITED T HAVE RAMP IT'S A BRAN NEW SPONSOR IF YOU'RE FINANCE PROFESSIONAL LOOKING FOR BETTER WAY TO MAXIMIZE PRODECTIVITY AND CUT WASTEFUL SPENDING RAMP COULD BE FOR YOU RAM P IS

ON BIG PROMISE HERE FOR JOBITON IS THAT IF YOU ERE A RINGING IMAGE OF SMALL OU REPUBLICANISM SOME YE BELIEVES IN DEMOCRACY HE WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE A SEENAL DECREPID MESSENGER OF A FAILING AD MINISTRATION BUT THAT IS WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE SO JOBIDON CONCLUDED HIS SPEECH AND ONE BIG PROMS HID BEN HAVING ON THIS CAMPAIGN AND THRAUT IS PRESIDENCY IS THAT JOBIDON LITERALLY DOES NOT KNOWHERE TO GO WHEN THE SPEECH IS END HISN'T KNOW WHATE TO DO HERE'SN'T KNW WHERE TO GO HE GETS EASILY CONFUSED A'M TARR IF THIS IS HERTING FEELIGS BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE THE OBVIOUS CASE TO ANY ONE WHO HAS E FUNCTIONING PREEFRONTAL QUARTTEXAN RETINAS EVERY TIME TOBITEN FINISHES A SPEECH SHE STARTS WANDERING OFF INTO ALLS IT'S BAZAR I SHAN GILLIS IS LINE WHICH THAT HE TURNS INTO A RUMBA AT THE END OF SPEECHES IT'S TOTALLY TRUE SOA WHAT THEY DO NOW I'M NOT GETTING JI BIDON SHECK SHE SPRINTED UP ON STAGE SHE SPRINTS UPON STAGE TO GO GRAB HIM BY THE HAND AND LEED HIM OFF THE STAGE SO HERE SHE US SHE SPRINTS THIS THING ENDS SHE'S ON STAGE OK A SHOT HERE E GO U  G VAM AND HE'S TRYING TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT HIS WIFE BUT HE SEE NIL SO IT DOESN'T COME OFF AND HES TRYING SAY T SHE'S THE REAL POWER SHE SPRINTS UP ON STATE OF ROMS LIKE WISE JILL UP THERE SHE'S IN THE CRABLONE SECOND GO AND HERE'S THE REASON JELLOWS UP THERE I TH JUST TO LEAD HIM BACK HE CAN BARELY WALK HE'S STILL CONFUSED WHEN YOU THE VERY AN HE'S LOOKING ROUND THE WEREMAK WERY GONG WELL THER BEO MO 'M S IT'S SAD I'M LAUGHING BUT BUT IT'S SAD IT ACTUALLY IS SAD THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS OBVIOUSLY AILING HE'S OBVIOUSLY AILING AND BY THE WAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THREATS TO DEMOCRACY HERE'S A KIND OF A THRAT'S DEMOCRACY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY TO JISQUALIFY YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT FROM THE BALLIT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SICK CUR TO JA ON YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT FILING NO LESS THEN FOR DIFFERINT CASES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS SOME STATE SOME FEDERAL WHAT WHALD EXACTLY WHAT AMOUNTS TO AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLIC RIGHT NOW SCHERE'S A POLLING STAFF FOR YOU READY EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT STAT SHOULD DISQUALIFY FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTS ACCORDING TO A NEW SEBIUST NEWS YOU GOFV POLE EIGHTY ONE PRERSENT FOUR IN FIVE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD JUST BE THROWN OFF BALLOTS THROWN OFF THE BALLOTS HE'S NEVER BEEN CRIMINALLY CONVICTED OF ANYTHING E'S ANYMEING CHARGE WITH INSURRECTION BY THE WAY AND ALL THE VARIOUS CASES WHERE HI'S BEING CHARGE IS NOT BEIN CHARGE FOR INSURRECTION WHICH WOULD BE THE THING THAT WOULD THEORETICALLY IN VOKE SECTION THREE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT BUT ANY ONE PRESENTOF DEMOCRATS WANT HIM SUMMARILY KICKED OFF THE BALLOT NOW POLL REPUBLICANS ON WHETHER THEY THINK THAT JO BIDON SHOUL BE ACTUALLY BARRED FROM THE BALLOT I GUARANTEY IT AN ANY ONE PER SENT YOURON'T TALK ABOUT INSURRECTIONIUS LEGAL THEORIES SO BASICALLY THE CASE AGAINST TRUMP WHEN IT COMES TO JANUARY SIXTH IS TWOFULL AN YOU'LL HEURE BOTH CASES MADE BY DEMOCRATS USULD THE MERGE THEM ONE IS THE JANUARY SIXTH WAS IN FACT THE ACTUAL INSURRECTION WAS LIKE A FULL SCALE COO ATTEMPT BY DONALD TRUMP WICH IS WEIRDS AND CHOUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATE AND HAS THE POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE TO ORDER AROUN THE MILITARY WHICH HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY USE SO THERE'S THAT BUT THE CLAIM IS THAT HE INCITED IN THE INSURRECTION SO THE STANDARD FOR INCIPEMENT IS MUCH STRONGER THEN YOU NEED TO GO PEACEFULLY PROTEST AT THE CAPITAL BUILDING THAT IS NOT INCITEMENT OF AN INSURRECTION TOO IT WASN'T IN ACTUAL INSURRECTION IS A MUCH A MORONS WHO DECIDE THERE CAN A BREAK INTO TE CAPITAL BUILDING WHILE SCREAMING AND SHOUTING ONE DREST LIKE A WEIRD BARBARIAN WEARING BUFFALO HORNS AND THEN A MUNCH PEOPLE WHO WERE JUS GEN TO FOLLOWING ALONG CAUSE THE POLICE OFFICERS WERE STANDING RIGHT TERE IN THEIR WALKING BETWEEN THE ROPE LINES SO AGAIN THA NONT THO MINIMIZE THE VIOLENCE DONE THE POLICE OFFCERS OUTSIDE THE BUILDING THOSE PEOPLE WE'RE ARRESTED BUT CASE NUMBER ONE THAT THEY MAKE IS THAT TRUMP WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EVENTS OF JANUARY SIXT THAT SAID TRUMP RAISED THE TEMPERATURE THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOUR THE ACTUAL BREAKING INTO THE CAPITAL BUILDING TWO IS THE IDEA THAT FROM NOVEMBER FOURTH TWO JANUARY SIXTH DONAL TRUMP PUT FORWARD A BUNCH OF SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORIES THEY WERE UNTRUE ABAT ELECTION FRAUD ABOUT CERTIFICASION OF STATE ELECTION RESULTS ABOUT WHAT THE VICE PRESIDENT COULD DO IN THE FACE OF ALL THAT AND THE IDEA IS THAT THAT'S INSURRECTION THE SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORIES PUT FORWARD INTO LAW IS AN ATTEMPTED INSURRECTION AND THIS THE OTHER CASE THE ULK YOUR DEMOCRATS MAKE WHAT O YOU CALL IT WHEN YOU ACTIVATE STATE PLAYERS IN VARIOUS STATES TO LITERALLY REMOVED YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT FROM THE BALLOT WITHOUT A CRIMINAL CONVICTION OR IN VESTIGATION OF ANY SORT WHAT A DECTLY WOULD YOU CALL THAT BECAUSE OF A IS INSURRECTIONIST ACTIVITY THEN BE CLEARLY QUALIFIES S INSURRECTIONIST ACTIVITY SO WHICH IS IT YOURON'T TOLK LOUT THREATS SEDEMOCRACY IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE BARRING YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT THE PRESUMED NOMINY OF THE OPPONING OPPOSING PARTY FROM THE BALLOT THAT SEEMS ALL LITTLE INSURRECTIONI THAT SEEMS A LITTLE NON DEMOCRATIC AND YET THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRATS KEEP SAYING BY THE WAY WENT WHEN JO BIDIN SAYS THINGS LIKE DONALD TRUMP IS A THREAT TO THE REPUBLIC AND THAT JANUARY SIX WAS INFACT AN INSURRECTION HE'S AGREEING WITH THAT LEGAL THEORY WHEN HE SUGGEST JANUARY SIX WAS AN INSURRECTION AND THE DONAL TRUMP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR JANUARY SIXTH HE'S AGREEING WITH THE LEGAL THEORY THAT SAYS DONAL TRUMP NEES TO BE BARRED FROM THE BALLOT UNDER THE SECTION THREE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WHUT HERE IS WASHINGTON HE SEE'S MAR MURIAL BAWZER WHO CAN'T STOP CRYIME BUT CERTAINLY WANTS TO STOP FROM FROM BEING ONBALLD TALKING ABOUT TRUMPING BOODY FROM BALLAT DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD BE BARRED FOM ANY BALLATS GIVEN HIS ACTIONS ON GANYWAY WA I SUPPORT THAT EVERY STATE TAKING VARIAGRASSIVE ACTION ON TIT TO KEEP HIM OFF THE BALLAT I HE IS UNDER GOWAN A IN A COURT ACTION ACROSS AMERICA THAT'S AMAZING STOFF MEANWHILE THE COLORATO SECRETARY STATE HIS RESPONSIBLE FOR BORRING FROM FROM THE BALLAT THERE PENDING SUPREME CORLITGATION SHIS TA METISENFRANCHISING ANYONE BY BARRING YOU KNOW THE LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDAT FOR THE OPPOSING PARTY FROM THE BALLAT DO YOU THINK T HT THERE'S A RISK HERE OF TISENT FRANCHISING VOTERS I THINK THER BE IS RIS O TIS INFRANCHISEIN VOTERS HAPPEN ON JANUARY SIX WHEN DONALD FROM TRI TO TEEL THE PRESIDENCY FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE INTENDED TO DER I WE ARE A COUNTRY OF AS IN OUR CONSTITUTIONS THERE ARE QUALIFICATIONS FOR OFFICE IS TA FOR EXAMPLE IF A MO ATERS WOE TO VON FOR ONALS ORTINATER IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO SE BECAUSE HE IS DIS QUALIFIE FROM INING FOR PRESIDENT UNDER THE UNITED STATE CONSTITUTION TE DORSH IS NOT DISEN FRANCHISING ANYONE HE'S ACTUALLY DIS QUALIFIED WITDLE MAN'S I

DEFENETHAT HIS DEATH'S DOING JOP NO HE'SN'THE ICY YOU THE NUMBER THO'S NOT BEEN INFORMITIES IN THE IC OU SO SHE'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN RECEIVING UP DATES HE SHOULD BE RECEIVING THIS IS CRAZY THAT'S TOTALLY WILD WHY EXACTLY WITH THIS HAPPEN APPARENTLY THOSE BECAUSE AUSTEN IS SUPPOSEDLY TWO MOCHO TO LET ANYBODY KNOW THAT HE WENT IN FOR AN ELECTIVE PRECEDURE AND ENDED UP IN THE ICE TO YOU BUT THA'S A TERRIBLE REASON WHEN YOU STILL LEFT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHEN YOU ARE MISSING PRODUCERS ACT NOT IN TO DAY HE TOLD US AND THN HE DIDN'T COME IN THAT'S HOT WORKS WHEN YOU'RE SICK WHEN YOU GO TO THE I SEE YOU IM FOR FOUR DAYS AND YOU ARE THESE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE  YOU DONT TO LET YOUR NUMBER TO KNO WHAT IN THE ACTUAL WHAT THE WHAT WHAT THAT'S CRAZLY NSIRE THAT'S TOTALLY INSANE APPARENTLY THESE

THERE ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND THE SECRETARY T ALL TIMES TO MANAGE HMEN HLP MONITATED DEYBASIS NO ONE EVEN TOLD THE WHITE HOSE HAD ONE PENCE GON OFFICIALS I'M SURPRISE THAT NO ONE IS USING THE WORD COVER UP YET I MEAN IS OBVIOUSLY A COVER UP LIKE WHAT THE WHOW WHOW THAT'S CRAZY ACCORING TO POLITICO SOME ONE'S HEAD HAS TO RALL BUT I'S ONN BE AUSTENS I'M SURE TO BE SOME LOW LEVEL AGE WHO IS TOLD YOU NEED TO TELL MY NUMBER TOO AND THEN THE NUMBER TWO NEVER GOT TOLD TO LOW LEVELADE ENDS UP WITHOUT A JOB EXCEPTS THE LAY USUALLY WORKS IN WASHINGTON TO SEE THE HIGHER UP SHUTTLES ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY DOWN TO SOMEBODY LOWER DOWN THAT PRSNT GETS FIRED ANZA AND THT'S THE END OF THE STORY THE WHITE HAVE SOME PENSIGON INSIST AUSTEN'S JOB IS NOT IN JEOPARDY BUT THEY'RE STICKINGS THAT LINE DESPITE NOT EVEN KNOWING WHAT'S ACTION BEN GOING ON AT THE PENSAGON THE PRECISE NATURE OF AUSTEN TURGE TORE MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS EVEN IS CURRENT CON DITION REMIN UNCLEAR SEENER DEFENCE DEPARTMENTIN WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW THE DETAILS OF THE PRECEDURE TOTALLY INSANE TOTALLY TOTALLY CRAZY HE SO NO ONE'S IN CHARGE THE PRESENT IS NON CHARGE HE SECCR DEFENSE NON CHARGE  NUMBER TWO AT THEDEFENSE DEPARTMENT BETI WEU KNOW THE SECRETARY DEFENCES NO IN CHARGE SO THINGS ARE GOING AMAZING MEANWHILE OVER ON THE BORDER WE NOW HAVE SOME NEW STAFTS ACCORDING TWO DATA RELEASED BY THE BIDING ADMINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELEN SECURITY THEY SAY THAT TWO POINT THREE MILLION AOT MIGRANTS HAVEBEEN ALOWED INTO THE SOUTHERNBORDER CORING TO DEACHES NOW I DON'T KNOWIF THAT NUMBER IS REAL THAT NUMBER SEEMS LOW TO ME IT DOES THE REASON THAT SEEMS NOW LOTOMY IS BECAUSE AT LEAST SIX MILLION BORDER APPREHENSIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE JOBIDON TOOK OFFICE TO PUT THAT BY WAY OF PRESPECTIVE DURING THE ENTIRE FOR YEARS OVE DONNALD TRUMPS ADMINISTRATION THE'RE ONE POINT SIX MILLION BORDER APPREHENSIONS BY THE WYNT APPREHENSION IS NOT MEAN THAT THE PERSON IS THEN TURNED AWAY AND SENT BACK HOME WHERE THEY CAME FROM A BORDER APPREHENSION MEANS THEY PICK YOU UP THEY TAKE YOU TO IT TETTENTION FACILITY IF YOU CLAIM ASYLEM THEN THEY RELEASE YOUINTOF THE COUNTRY WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF THE DATE TO COME BACK FIRST SOME SORT OF COURT DATE THAT'S LITERALLYTI MEANS THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN WHEN YOU ARRIVE IN THE COUNTRY ANDARE PICKED UP BY BORDER PATROL AND WHEN YOURE RELEASED INS THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES IS USUALLY WITHIN A WEEK WHILL ALWAYS WITHIN A WEEK AND USUALLY WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS SO WHEN THEY SAY TWO ONLY TWO POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE OF ENTR OF THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS THAT THAT NUMBER IS ACCURATE I THINK THAT NUMBER IS WA WAY HIGHER THAT ALSO OES NOT INCLUDE THE STIMATED ONE MILLION GODAWAYS PEOPLE WHO JUST WHEN INTO THE COUNTRY SMUGGLE DRUGS INTO TE COUNTRY OR ENTERED BUT TWEEN PORTS OF CAUL AND AND WERE NOT PICKED UP BY BORDER PATROL AND APPARENTLY KNOWN GODAWAYS ONLY RE PER CENT MAY B MIN THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW S THEY ON'T KNOW ME UN KNOWN GODAWAYS THEY ESTIMATED THE C B P THAT 'S LIKE SIXTY PER CENT OF ALL GODAWAYS ARE KNOWN WHICH MEANS YOURE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNKNOWN GODAWAYS THEORETICALLY SHO IME GOT NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE WE'VE GOT INTO THE COUNTRY AS IT GODAWAYS ANYOR TALKING ABOUT ACCORDING TO D H S TWO POINT THREE MILLIONS THAT'S FOUR POINT ONE MILLION 'SA LOT OF PEOPLE AND BY THEWAY THE NUMBERS ARE WAY HIREDN THAT THERE'S NO WAYS ONLY TWO POIN THREE MILLION PEOPLE A D  CHU SPOKES WOMAN SAID SATURDAY THE AGENCY CONTINUS SOTPORT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS IF ON AUTHORIZED MIGRONS INCLUDING FAMILY BUT IS THAT REALITY I REALLY REALLY DOUBT IT AGAIN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE CHARTS THE CHARTS ARE INSANE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS THE LAST MONTH OF DONALD TRUMP FULL MONTH OF DONALDTRUM'S PRESIDENCY YOUAR TALKINGABOUT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND BORDER APPREHENSIONS BIFE BY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN EVERYBODY NOW REALIZES YOUR BIDENS IN OFFICE YOUARE LOOKING AT NORTH OF ONE HUNDREDAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND BOARDER APPREHENSIONS LIKE MORE THAN DOUBLE AND THEN IN DECEMBER THIS LAST DECEMBER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND APPARENTLY THESE ARE INSANE NUMBERS OBVIOUSLY AND IT'S A REAL BORDER CRISIS SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT IS CRISIS THE BORDERTS THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS TO CRISIS AT THE BORDER SO ACCORDING TO A BRANDO C BS NEWS YOU GOV POLL FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF AMERICANS SAY WHATS HAPPENING THE BORDER IS A CRISIS THIRTY PER CENT SOY WOAS HAPPENIG TH BORDER IS VERY SERIOUS EIGHTEEN PER CENT SAY THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT SERIOUS SO YOU ARE NOW UP TO BY THOSE NUMBERS NINETY THREE PER CENT OF AMERICANS SAY THAT IS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT SERIOUS SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT SAY A CRISIS OR VERY SERIOUS BY THE WAY TO CRISIS ONLY SEVEN PER CENT SAY NOT MUCH OF A PROBLEM AY THAT IS I THAT IS IAN ASTONISHING  NUMBER ACCORDING THAT SAM POLE IMMIGRANTS IN YOUR LOCAL AREA HAVE BEEN FORTY PER CENT INCREASING THIRTY FIVE PER CENT HAVENG NOTICED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT DECREASING AS FAR AS WHETHER PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE TOUGHER SHOULD BE EASIER OR IS HANDLINGTHINGS RIGHT FIFT FIVE PER CENT SAID SHOULD BE TOUGH FER IN SUPTEMBER IT IS NOW SIXTY THREE PER CENT TWO THIRDS W AMERICANS BELIEVE THET JOBDON SHULD BE TOUGHFER ON THE BORDER ONLY SIXTEEN PER CENT SAY THAT JOBIDEN SHOULD BE EASIER AND THE TWENTY ONE PRESENTED SAY THER HANDLING THINGIS RIGHT OBVIOUSLY DOES UNDERSTAND WAT THE HEL'S GOING ON THE BORDER BY THEWAY WHAT'S ACTUAL GOING ON THE BORER IS TWO THINGS ONE DOW TRUMS FR MAIN A MEXICAL POLICY WAS ENDED SO WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THE BORDER AN THE CLAIM ASYLUM BY AMERICAN LATHER OW PUT INTO THE SYSTEM HE USE TO BE DON TRUM HAD NEGOTIATED TO DEAL WITHTHE MEXICANS TO KEEP  PEOPLE WHO APPLIED FOR ASYLUM IN MEXICO AWAITING THEIR BORDER HEARING THIS CUT DOWN ON AI LEGAL EMMIGRATION BY A HUGE MARGIN BEKAUS A LOD THOSE PEOPLE GET TURNED DOWN AND IF HE READY A MEXICO THEY HAVE NO ENTERY TO THE COUNTRY DAY ONE JOBIDON ENDED THAT POLICEE SO INSTEAD PEOPLE COME THEY IMMEDIATELY SAY I FEAR FOR MY LIFE MY HOME COUNTRY THE UNITED STATES STATES THEM IN  PROCESS THEM AND RELEASES THEM INTO HE GENERAL INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES THAT'S WAL YOU HAVE TO DO JUST SAY I FEAR TO GO BACK TO MY HOME COUNTRY UNDER AMERICAS CURRENT ASYLUM RULES NUMBER TWO BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES REFUSES TO DETAIN FULL FAMILIES TOGETHER UNDER THE FLORA SETTLEMEN AND BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES RE FUSES DO YOU RE MAIN A MEXICO A'LL YET TO DO SHOP WITHT KID ANDBASICALLY YREGING TO BE RELEASED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES JOBIDON ENDED EVERY POLICY THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED MASS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BY THE WY THE CAR TELLS KNOW THIS THE CARTELLS AND BEEN REDIRECTING AMERICAN RESOURCES TOWARD THIS WAVE OFY LEGAL MIGRANTS THAT'S E WHY THEY'RE DOING IT AND THEN MEANWHILE WHILE THE BOARD PATROL IS ACTING AS A BUSSING AND FARYING SERVICE FOR LEGAL EMIGRANS ALL OF THE GODWAYS THAT WERE TALKINGABOUT DRUGS SMUGGLERS CRIMINALS THOSE PEOPLE ARE JUST T ENTERING BETWEEN THESE POINTS US RUSHING INTO THE INTEROR OF THE UNITED STATES AND BOARDER PATROL ISN'T THERE IT'S NOT THAT WE REQUIRE MORE BORDER PATROL AGENTS ITS THAT THE BOARD PATROL AGENTS WE DO HAVE OURE BASICALLY ACTING AS D M B AGENTS AT THIS POINT AND MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL METROPOLITAN BUSSING L AUTHORITY AS HOPPOSE TO YOU KNO ACTUAL BOARDER PATROL AGENTS HERE'S THEM IMAGES A BUM A BREACH IN THE BOARDERWALL AND ARIZONA THE BY E WAY THE THE WAY THA YOU REACH THE BORDERWALL IS OM IF THEY'RE NO BORD PATROL AGENTS AROUND THEY'RE NO BOARDE PATRAL AGENTS AROUND HEG JUST CUT A HOLE IN THE WALL WHICH 'S WHA THYRE DOING SO HEARSOME THAYO TE LEGAL EMIGRAN STRIMMING THROUGH THAT BORDERWALL THIS WOULD BE ON THURSDAY IT' E PEOPLE JUST WALKIN RIGHT ON THROUGH HERE WE GO IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE WY EVEN IF THEY'RE CAUGHT AT THIS POINT BORDER PATROL THEN ASK THEM WHAT AR YOU DOING HERE AND THEY SAY I FEARED YOU GO HOME TO MY COUNTRY AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEYRE PROCESS TO RELEASED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES THAT'S THE WAY THE DHIS WORKS MIKE JOHNSON THESE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE HE SAYS YO OF COURSE THIS IS A BORDER CRISIS THAT'S WHY WE ARE TRYING TO FOCUS IN ON IT SO WHAT HAPPENS MISS PEAKER AN NO NO MONEY FOR YOU CRAN NO MONEY TER ISRAEL NO MONEY FOR TIE ON AND THEN NO FIX FOR THE BORDER A MA HATIS IS CARISOLL WHAT DO YOU THINKIN WELL WELL WE'RE THINKING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS THE COM TOIT SENS AS THEY'RE GETTIN CRESSUR FRO EVEN DEVER CRATS O COURSE THA THE MAYER OF THESE FIC SECTARY SITIS AND BLUE STATES THETRE CRYING OUT FOR HELP THEY NO THAT A THOUTS AS TAN ABO THER TRAN IN ALL THER RE SOURS AS THERE WE HAVE A TECOLLICS ON THE OTHER SIDE OFTHE OW WHO UNDERSTAN N THAT THIS IS APRISE US THAT MUST BE RESOLVES SO IAM OFTEN TESS TACKE AND HOPEFUL THAT THEY'LL LISTEN OF THE AMERICANT PEOPLE AND MAKE THEN U SARY CHANGES AND POLICY THO GET THIS THUT I HOPE THE SET IT WHITL TACKE UP OUR LET US LATION AAR TO AND TO THE RIGHT THING THE COMEN SENS THING THAT FIX THE PROBLEM AMAZINGLY ENOUGH THE LEADER OF THE SANE OPPOSITION ON THIS POINT IS JOHN FETTERMAN I DRON'T HAVENT JOHN FETTERMAN H'S CERTAI INTO CHRISTANS INTIMA IT'S AMAZING HERE IS JOHN FETTERMAN OVER THE BEGAN TALKING BY THE BOROGRAZES ANAN ALLIES ADMIT THERES TA CLISE AT THE BORDER AND TH I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYPOTY COULD PRETEND LET THERE ISN'S CORRECT EVERYONE KNOWS THIS EVERYONE KNOWS THIS BUT DEMOCRATS ARE SO TIGHED INTO THE IDEA THERE MUST BE MASSE MIGRATION MASS ILLEGAL MIGRATION THAT THEY ARE REFUSING BORDER FUNDING IF IT EVEN MEANS CHANGING THE ASYLUM RULES THAT'S WHAT'SO CRAZY THE SINGLE THING THAT IS THE BIGGEST MAGNET DWRIVING PEOPLE NORTH OF THE BORDER IS THIS IDIOTIC RULE THAT IF YOU CLAIM ASYLUM WITH NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT YOU ARE BEING OPPRESS IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY OTHER THAN YOUR HOME COUNTRY IS CAN ASOC YOU ARE IMMEDIATELY ADMITTED SO REPUBLICANS HA BEEN SAYING OOKATE WHY DON'T WE DO A FOU THINGS WHY DN'T WE NUMBER ONES WHO REMIN A MEXICO NUMBER TOO IF YOU CLAIM ASYLUM WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH AT YOUR INITIAL HERING BEFORE RELEASE YOU INTO THE UNITED STATES THYOU ARE LIKELY TO PREVAILUM IN THAT CLAIM FOR ASYLUM YOU CAN'T YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORDS AND THEN ABRCATE ABRA ALL F THE DOOR S OPAN DEMOCRAT SUPPOSE THIS ALEHUNS OR MAYORCAS THE DACHA SECRETARY HE SAYS THAT THEY WOULD NOT EVEN ACCEPT MORE FUNS IF THOSE FUNS WERE USED FOR DU PORTATION WHEN YOU SAY THAT REPUBLICANS WON'T EXCEPT THE EXTRAFUNDING THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE FUNDS BEING USED TO RELEASE AN TRANSPORT ILLEGAL AMIGRANTS AROUND THE COUNTRY SO CONGRESS IS LISTENING RIGHT NOW WHICH YOU EXEXCEPT THE EXTRA FUNDING ON THE CONDITION THAT THE FUNDS COULD ONLY BE USED FOR DETENTION AND RENEW REMOVAL BUT NOT RELEASE INTO THE COUNTRY A BRECT THE FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELYN SECURITY WITH MORE BORTED PATROL AGENTS THE FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELYE SECURITY WITH MORE TECHNOLOGY THE FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE OUR DEPARTMENT WITH MORE DETENTION SPACE TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WITH MORE IMIGRATION JUDGES WHAT HE WANTS IS MORE MONEY TO BROAD IN THE SPICKET ALONG MORE LEGAL IMIGANS INTO THE COUNTRY WHY WELL BECAUSE AO SE SHE SAYS THE QUAPART A LA SAS THERE TWO WAYS OF SHUTTING DON IN LEGAL MIGRATION WHONE S YOU CLOSE THE BORDER THE OTHER S YOU PREVENT ANYONE FROM SAYING TES YUPALON TO LEGAL OUT SAY THES FOUVE ARE LEGAL NOW YOU AN'T YOU TENDED LEGAL MIGRATION BY THIS TOKEN BY THE WAGAN AND ALL MURDER IN THE UNITED STATES BY LEGALIZING MURDER IT WATCH ABRICAT ABRA MURDER IS NOW LEGAL SO I GESS THAT NO ILLEGAL MURDER IS TAKING PLACES ON MURDER IS LEGAL THAT'S BASELGOOD AOS HE IS SUGGESTING HERE JUST WITH REGARD TO EMIGRATION HERE SHE DOES FROM ALL PARTS FROM THE POLITICAL SPACKTROWN WHYNE OF THE PIGETATIONS THAT WILL HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO MEGRATION IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN UNDOCUMENTO POPULATION TAT YOU CAN FIX THAT BY TRINA BUILD A LAW OR YOU CAN FIX FAT BY TRINA DOCUMENT PEOPLE AND CREATE A PACTOSITISENSHEP I FAILOOK AT THE FIFTONS EKNO THAT OUR SHELTER SYSTEM HAV WAIT AN THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ONE OF THE RESON  THAT OUR PUBLIC SYSTEM EXPERIENCE WAY IFS BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A DOCUMENTED AND RELIABLE PATH TO WORK AND FIFTEEN AN FOLS JUST LIKE ALL OF OUR ANCESTERS DID AND OUR AND OUR GRANPARIN YET THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHEN OUR GREAT GRANDPARENTS CAME TO THE UNITED STATES THERE WASN'T A GIANT WELFARE SYSTEM THAT WAS IN PLAYS FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO CAME HE WITHOUT ANY JOB PROSPECTS WHATSOEVER ALSO BECAUSE OF THAT PEOPLE WERE FORCE TA SIMILATE MUCH MORE QUICKLY WHEN MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS CAME TO THE UNITED STATES IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THEY'LL SPOKE GITTISH NONE OF THEIR KIDS DID WHY BECAUSE THE MARKETS DID NOT BEAR PEOPLE SPEAKING GIDTISH PARTICULARLY LEARNING ENGLISH WAS LIKE A MAJOR MAJOR ASPECT OF THIS IT TURNS OUT THET MARKETS ARE GREAT WAY TO MAKE PEOPLE ASSIMILATE TO AMERICAN VALUES BECAUSE IF YO WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN A MARKET BASE ECONOMY YOUVE CHAVE TO PETER TO THE CUSTOMER BOWEN GET RID THEN ENTIRE SYSTEM AND THEN YOU DECLARED THERE SHOULD BE OPEN EMIGRATION OF COURSE WHAT YOU WENT UP WITH IS A MULTYPE CULTURAL STOO IN WHICH NOBODY ACTUALLY ASSIMILATES IBUT YOU SAIDN'T QUITE PART I LAD WHICH THE DEMOCRATS YOU WANT IN OPEN BOARDER S AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OPEN BORDER NOT A GREAT ECONOMY AND SAY D  I ALL OVER THE ADMINISTRATION VERSES DONALD TRUMP IS A FASH JUST WHICH ONE OF THOSE YOU THINKS IS MORE DAMAGING POLITICALLY SO WHEN IT COMES TO D I THIS ADMINISTRATION AS DECLARED ITSELF IN FAVOR OF EQUITY AT EVERY STEP OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENTS THIS ADMINISTRATION IS SAYS THAT IN FACT EQUITY MODIVATES ALL OF THEIR POLICY APPARENTLY INCLUDING MIGRATION POLICY WHICH IS WHY WE'RE JUST CAN OPEN THE BOARD WIDE WELL I HAVE TO SAY ONEOF THE GREAT EXCHANGES I'VE SEEN RECENTLY ON TELVISION HAPPENED OVER THE WE CAN RYHAN SALOM IS A AN AUTHOR AND RIGHT RIGHTS OVER THE MANHATAN INSTITUTE USE ON JOHN GULBERG AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DEBATE WERE A COUPLE OF WILD LEFTESE INCLUDING CARISWISHER ANDTHE'RE TALKING ABOUT D YI AN RYHAN WHO IS NOT A WHITE AMERICAN IS IN FACT MY NORITY AMERICAN YOU'D BE MUMPED INTO THE PEOPLE OF COLOR CATEGORY HE JUST GOES OFF RIGHT HEREINS PRTTY SPECTACULAR WHEN A PERSON OF COLOR FAILS ALL OF US ANATE AN INDITEMEN OF AN ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT THE RIGHT DOES THIS A SO RIDICULOUS SHE WAS A GRADUATE OF EXITER AND STANFORD WITH A PACHTY FROM HARVARD AN W ATERATION AA CETERATIONATION AMERICAN WHO CAME FROM A FAMILY THAT DOMINATED THE CONCRETE IN DO SIRAETY SHE WAS NOT THE WRETCHED OF THE EARTH YHOU A SOINE WHOSHON AN  OGSDAUGHTER BARREDLY AND I OITION RAAT WAAR A LO GO ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT SHE WAS SELECTED BECAUSE SHE A STABLISHED THE OFTHS OF DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSIOD AN BELONGING OT HARVARD SHE PROSIDED OVER A STEEP DECLINE IN TH FREEZ FEECH FOI I LEAN SHE ALSOARGIT BY NORITY PROFECTLOLO TO SANCTIT FROM PER PERSPECTIVE THAT LA  A PROBLEM SHE WAARTIN WITH IDEAS NOT FLLY BYHOG EVER I HA AREN'THEY HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT ABOUT ALL OF THAT BUT AGAIN HIVERSITY EQUIN INCLUSION STICK THAT IS THE BIDING STICK SO AGAIN YOU HAVE LINED UP ON THE ONE SIDE DON TRUMS TE FASAS NOTZY  OR IN JOBINES WORTH WHOS O GOVE TO AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE JOBIDON IS DOING EQUITY HESILLELIMIGRATION AND BY THE WAY HE'S DOING COMPLETE SUPPLIED CHAIN FAILURE SO THE HOOTHE ATTACKS ON SHIPPING CONTINUE ACROSS THE WORLD  THE COST OF SHIPPING HAS MARKEDLY INCREASED YOU WIGE THAT TIS A CHART FROM AXIOS AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS THE AVERAGE SHIPPING CONTANERATES FOR PARTICULAR ROOTS AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THEY HAVE JUMPED SPIKED DROMADICALLY TOWARD THE END OF DECEMBER WHY BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHEN YE STARTD SEEING HOOTHY ATTACKING SHIPPING IN THE RED SEA AND THE BABYL MANDIB STRAIGHT IN FACTS WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT THE COST OF SHIPPING FROM THE ASIA MEDI TERRANEAN FROM AS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AREAS JUMPED WILDLY FROM LIKE A LITTLE BIT OVER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A CONTAINER TO FIFTY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE TLIK DOUBLED WHEN YOU LOOK AT SHIPPING FROM ASA TO THE NORTH AMERICAN EAST COAST RIT THE STUFF THE WE CARE ABOUT YE COST OF SHIPPING WENT FROM WHAT LOOS LIKE ABOUT TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THIRTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT 'STHA MASSIT THAT'S PUR CONTAINER WHO BEARS THAT COST YOU BEAR THAT COST WE ALL BEAR THAT COST BECAUSE JOBIDON IS ALLOWING THE HOOTHIES TO BASICALLY GUM UP THE WORKS IN THE RED SEE AND IN THE BABELMANDEB STRAIGHT WHY BECAUSE DEMOCRATS KEEP HOPING THAT WELL YOU KNOW IF WE'RE SWET AND IF WE'RE NICE THAN THINGS AREN'T OIN ASKCLATE ME FERTHER WHEN IT'S PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE TACK THAT ACTUALLY GATS THING IS TO CALM IN TH MIDLEAST WHEN YOU ONT CALM THINGS IN THE MIDLEAST YOU KNOW IT YOU DO YOU MAKE CLEAR THAT IF YOU SCREW IT THE UNITED STATES THINGS GO REAL BAD FOR YOU THAT'S THE ACTUAL WAY YOU CALM THINGS IN THE MDELEAST IT'S WHY EVERY ONE IN TE ELAST WAS AFRIT TO START UP WHILE DONAL TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT GUIS NUTS THAT GUIDS RASE YOU MIGT JUST FIRE MISSILE AT MY HOUSE I DON'T KNOW BUT WITH JOBIDENS I OD OR NO SHOULD WE TOUCH THE WHOTHESE SHWE NOT THAT MAYBE SHOULD REMOVE AN AIROCRAFT CARRIER FROM THE MEDITR WHY DO YOUTHINK THES THING'S LASTING AS LONG AS IT IS WITH RE GOT TO HIS BLOCK HAS BOOGE KEEP FIRING ANTITANK MISILES INTO NORTHERN ISRAL WHY DYUTHINK THE'RE DOING THAT IF THE UNITED STATES HAD LISCEN WHEN HIS MISSILES GOES ARIGHT AND HITS AN AMERICAN AND YOU WILL NOT EXIST TO MORROW MORNING WHICH IS TRUE THAT'S ACTULLY THE REALITY BY THE WAY THAT IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE UNITED STATES SAID THAT IF THE UNITED STATES SAID IF YOU RADS YOUR RATE OF FIRE ABOVE EX AND YOU JUST WONE EXIST TOMOROWMORNING YOU KNO IT WOULD STOP TOMORROW MORNING THAT BUT JOBIDON IS TOO COWARDLY TO DO ANY OF THIS SO INSTAD YOU'VE GENER FOR GRAND HOME WHO IS OUT THERE DECLARING THAT YOU KNOW THEY KIND OF HOPE THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO CALM DOWN THEY'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY IF THEYRE GOIG TO CALM DOWN NOCKIN THIS SECRETARY OF ENERGY TOGGING ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW SHIPPING ILL POBLYC GET ATTER EVEN THOUGH MARSK IS NOW SAYING THAT THE'E CAN COMPLETELY AVOID THE RED SEA WHICH OF COURSE CREADES IS OBLIGING BOTTLE NACK WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO ACTUALLY INSURE THAT SHIPSHIPS CAN GO THROUGH THAT AREA O COOBVIOUSLY YET THERE HAS TO BE THIS COALITION EFFORT I KNOW THAT MANY COMMERSIAL A A SHIP SHIPPERS ARE REALLY NOT JUST THE'RE DOING WHAT MERSK HAS DECIDED TO DO WHICH IS TO A IRCUMVENT THE RED SEA AND THE SISS CANAL AND THAT MAY ADD SOME PRICE TO TO ENERGY IN TERMS OF

BOSTON UNIVERSITY INVESTIGATES THE IBRUM EXKEND ANTI RACIS CENTERP A TURNING GENERAL MERICARLANDHEADS TO THE HILL WHERE THE GIOPI GRILLSAM AND A RONZ PRESIDENT GOES TO THE UENTE CHIDE AMERICA I' VENTUONER O THIS IS T VENCHBARO SHOW  THE SHOWS PONSER BACKXPRESS BE PIANIS TIME TO STAND UP AGAINST BIG TACT PROTECT OUR DATAT EXPRESS VEPIANTICON FLESH MEN ALREADY FOK SO YOU REMEMBER IBERAM X KENDI THIS KY IS A GENIUS HOW DO I KNOW THAT HE'S A GENIUS HE'S SUCH A GENIUS THE HE ACTUALLY ON A'M A CARTHOR GENIUS  GRAND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE THOS A SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NO STRINGS ATTACHED FELLOWSHIP HONORING HIS EXCEPTIONAL CRATIVITY SCHOLARLY ACHIEVEMENTS GIVT FOR COMMUNICATING HIS ANTI RACIS WORK AND IDEAS WITH DIVERSE AUDIENCES AND PROMISE FOR FURTHER BENEFITING SOCIETY AND IS BOSTON UNIVERSITY THAT DOME THAT GAVE HIM THIS ANTI RACIS TO GRANT T THAT THAT IS SUPER INSPIRING STUFF NOW FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE PRODIGIOUS CAREER OF IBERMAX KENDI THE FOUNDER OF THE B CENTORF FRANTI RASIS RESEARCH HE IS THE AUTHOR OF A BUNCH OF REALLY NOT VERY GOOD BOOKS AND HE SPEAKS NONSENSE FOR LIVMIN THE NONSENSE THAT HE SPEAKS ALL ABOUT HO AMERICA IS DEEPLY AND IRREVOCABLY RASIS HE WROTE MOST FAMOUSLY A BOOK ALED STAMP FROM E BEGINNING THE DEFININT OF HISTORY OF RACIST IDEAS IN AMERICA ABYT HOW AMERICA WAS LITERALLY RACIS IN ALL OF ITS ITERATIONS FROM THE VARIBIANNING THAT IS UP TO AND INCLUDING ALL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS OF THE BILL OF RIHTES HE ALSO WROTE A BOOK LED HOW TO BE IN ANTIRASIST AND HE NOW HAS A PODCAS CALLED B IN ANTI RASIS SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS GENIUS SAY ABOUT RACISM WELL HE CAN'T REALLY DEFINE THE TERM HE JUST KNOWS THAT RASES HIM EXIST WHEREVER THERE IS A DISPARITY THE DIRET QUOTE FROM HIM AS AN ANTI RACIS WHEN I SEE RACIAL DISPARITIES ICY RACISM WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLY STUPID AND YOU MIGHT THINK THAT ITS GENIUS IT'S REALLY REALLY STUPID LET ME GIVENG EXAMPLE HOW STUPID THAT IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ENBA IS BLACK THAT'S A MASSIV RACIAL DISPRITY ONLY THIRTEEN PER CENT OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION IS BLACK THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ENBI PLAYERS ARE BLACK DOES THIS MEAN THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME SORT OF DEEP AND ABIDING RACISM IN THE N B A TO MAKE ALL OF THAT HAPPEN CONVERSELY IN HAKEY VIRTUALLY ALL THE PLAYERS ARE WHITE DOES THAT MEAN THERE IS A DEEP AND ABIDING RACES IN THAT EXIST AT THE ROOT OF HAKI AND THAT IS WHY THERE SNOTHEMANY BLACK HOCKEY PLAYERS PLAYING AT THE AN ACHA LEVEL OF COURSE NOT IT'S INCREDIBLY SILLY IF YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE THAT NINETY NINE PERCENT OF MEN IN OF PEOPLE INTPRISON FOR VIOLENT CRIMER MEN LESS THEN TWO PER CENT ARE WOMEN IS THAT BECAUSE OF SOME DEEPLY SEXIS ROOT IN SOCIETY THEIF WE ARE A NONSEXT SOCIETY FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE GOING TO PRISON FOR A VIOLENT CRIME WOULD BE WOMEN PRESUMABLY THE TRUTH IS DISPARITIES EXISTS ACROSS VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY ACROSS VIRTUALLY EVERY METRIC IN SOCIETY FOR ALL OF TIME THER ARE TIE TO EVERYTHING FROM GEOGRAPHY TWO INVIRONMEN THE IDEA THAT IF TWO GROUPS BY RASE DO NOT STACK UP IDENTICALLY IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA THIS IS BECAUSE OF SYSTEMIC AND ABIDING RACISM IS NONSENSE IT'S ABSOLUT NONSENSE IN FACT IS UNFALSIFIABLE NONSENSE BECAUSE LEGANA LITERALLY EVER Y A RENO OF LIFE IS GOING TO INCLUDE GROUP DISPARITIES AGE DISPARITIES HEIGHT DISPARITIES WAIGHT DISPARITIES TTHESE DESPARITIES EXIST LITERALLY EVERYWHERE BUT ITERAMASK KENDY'S INTIRE PROPOSAL WHICH WAS BUILT UP ON THE BACK OF THE BEELLA MOVEMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY IS THAT HE DOESN'T NEED TO PROVE THAT RACISM IS ACTUALLY AT THE ROT OF ANYTHING ALL HE HAS TO SHOW IS O DISPARITY WHICH AGAIN IS INCREDIBLY STUPID IT MAKES HIS JOBREALLY EASY TBECAUSE I TOO CAN POINT TO DISPARITIES IN EVERY ARENA OF LIFE BUT UNLESS I ACTUALLY PROVE THAT THAT THE REASON BEHIND THE DISPARITY IS SOME SORT OF EVIL I'VE NOT PROVED ANYTHING BUT KENDY BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WE DECIDED AS SOCIETY HAT YOU NO LONGER HAD TO PROVE THAT RACEISM WAS AT THE ROUTE OF FOR EXAMPLE CRIMESTATISTICS INSTEAD YOU COULD JUST SIMPLY CLAIM THAT IT WAS AND THAN EVERYONE WHO SAID THAT IT WASNANT WAS DEEMED TO BE RACIS THIS IS THE MAGIC OF ENNEDY KAN HE WAVED HIS MAGIC ONE AND SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WHO IS NOT RACIS BEFORE WAS RACIS HE SAYS THAT COLOR BLINDNESS IS RACIS IF YOU THINK THAT RACE SHOULDN'T MATTER THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR RACIS RACE DOES MATTER AN THEWAY WE NO RACE MATTERS IS BECAUSE O DISPARITIES AND THOSE DESPARITIES ARE EVIDENCE OF RACISM AND IF YOU SAY WIL LAST VI RATION MATTER THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR RACIS DON'T YOU SEE WELL FAMOUSLY ITRMAX KENDY MAC CARTHER GENIUS GRANT AWARD WINNER FAMOUSLY IERMAX KENDY WAS IT ASKED JUST COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW TO DEFINE RACISM HERE WAS THIS GENIUSIS DEFINITION  SO RACE THROUG THEM ARE WE REFINENT U ES E COLLECTION O OH RACE TIS POLICANSA RE FO RACIAL METHEDY THAT'S THES THIN YOU A RITHER UM WAIT SO THE WAY THAT HE JUSTIFIND RACISM IS RACE THAT RACIS POLICIES THAT LEAD TO RACIAL INEQUITY YOU CAN'T DEFINE A TERM BY USING THE TERM THAT IS NOT A POSSIBILITY YOU CAN'T DO THAT AM MEAYOU CON TRY BUT IT DOESN'T WORK AGAIN JUST TO READ YOU THE QUOTES SO YOU UNDERSTAND HODON THISIS QUOTE I WOULD DEFINE IT AS A COLLECTION OF RACIS POLITIES THAT LEAD TO RACIAL INEQUITY THAT ARE SUBSTANTIATED BY RACIST IDEAS THE AUDIENCE BY THE WAY WATCHINGIS ACTUALLY LAUGHED OUT LOUD AND THEN HE REITERATED HIS DEFINITION AND HE ADEQUET AND ANTI RACEIS BEENIS PRETTY SIMPLY USING THE SAME TERMS ANTI RACISM IS A COLLECTION OF ANTI RACEIS POLICIES LEADING TO RACIAL EQUITY THAT ARE SUBSTANTIATED BY ANTI RACIST IDEAS NOW AGAIN AS I SAY JUST TEXPOOC LOGIC YOU CANNOT DEFINE AN TERM BY USING THE TERM IF SOONE ASKS YOU TO DEFIND AN ELEPHANT AND YHE QUICKLY EXPLAINE THAT AN ELEPHANT IS AN ANIMAL MONE IS AN ELEPHANT THOW WE NOT ADD ANY NW INFORMATION TO THE DISCOURSE IF YOU SAID AN ELEPHANT IS AN ANIMAL THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE AN ELEPHANT AN ACTS EXACTLY LIKE AN ELEPHANT PEO WILL LAUGH AT YOU BECAUSE IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IRMX KENDY IS SAYINGS THAT HE DOES MATUALLY HAVE TO TO FINED THE TERM NOW REMEMBER HE WAS RICHLLY REWARDED FOR ALL OF THIS CRAP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BEALENISCAM THAT WAS HAPPENING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AGAIN IT WAS A SCAM THE LI THAT AMERICAN SOCIETY RESTS IN UNIDENTIFIABLE BUT EVER PRESENT RACISM IS A LIE THE NOCIAN THAT DESPARITIES AND CRIMES TO SIX ARE CAUSED BY RACIS TO POLICING AT'S A LIE BUT THAT IDEAL IS VERY PROMINENT WAS PRERTECTLY PROM AMONG LIBERAL WHITE FOLKS WHO FELT THATIF THEY SIGNE IBMAX KENDY A CHACK THE SAME WAY TAT THEY WOULD HAVE BACK IN THE NINETEENEGHTYES TO AL SHARPTON THEN THEY COULD GIVE BASILY ALSHARPEDON WITH AE POTINA OF INTELLECTUAL LEGITIMACY SOME SORT HEU WOULD GIVE A DISPENSATION TO THEM YOU SIGN TEERMAX KENDY A CHECK AND NOW YOU ARE AN ANTIRACIS IS MAGICONTIRACIS MORKS HOW DO YOU SHOW YOUR AN ANTI RACIS YOU BECOME AN ANTI RACIS IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO NOT BE RACIS IS WHAT KENDY SAYS IF YOU SAY I'M NOT A RACIS I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE SHULD BE JUDGED ON THE BASE OF THEIR RACE HE SAYS THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU MEAN TO BE ACTIVELY ANTI RACIS AND THE ONLWAY TO BE ANTIRACIS IS TO FIGHT RACIS POLICIES NAMELY ANY POLICIES THAT END IN SOME SORT OF DISPARITY IN SOMESOR VRSALIS VERITY AND THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT THOSE POLICIES IS TO GIVE TWO IBRMAX KENDY HOW MAGICGAL WHICH PRESUMABLY IS WHY JACKDORSY INTO THOES AND TWENTY GEVE KENDYES NEW CENSER FOR ANTI RACIS RESEARCH AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE VERTACS FOUNDATION OF VERTECT FARMATUTICALS GAVE THE SENTR ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE

WELL TOE PRETEND NOT BECAUSE BLACK LIVES MATTER NOW HOW PROTECT TOR BLACK LAS BEYOND ANYBODY NO PROVE IT DOES BUT IN FACT PPRECISELY THE OPPOSITE IT TURNS OUT THE BEST WAY TO ALLEVIATE DOSPARITIES IS

PROTESTORS IN THE UNITED STATES O OUR VERY ANTIGT BENJRAMINITON NOW WHO'S ALSO VISITING THE UNITED STATES AND IS HAVING A SIBAR WITH JOBIDON AT THIS POINT JUST AGAIN THE UAN CONTINUES TO BE NOT ONLY A USELESS BUT A COUNTER PRODUCTIVE ORGANIZATION O CA MEANWHILE SPEAKING OF USELESS AND COUNTER RECTOR ORGANIZATIONS YOUWOULD IMAGINE TH THE UN THIS INTERNATIONAL ORGANS ITIONS THESE WOULD BE THE PLACES WHERE  NEGOTIATIONS WOULD HAPPEN OVER FOR EXAMPLE NUGORNO CARBACH THIS IS A VERY LITTLE NOTICE AND LITTLE WATCH REGION OF THE WORLD EXCEPT BY PEOPLE OR SORT OF IN THE NO IT'S A HOT SPOT THERE CERTAIN HOTSPOT IN THE WORLD CASHMERSA HOT SPOT SAY THE GOSSIL STRIP IS A HOT SPOT AR E IS OF JANE SAMERI OR HOTSPOT ANEGORA CARBACH IS I IS A HOT SPOT THE REASN IS A HOTSPOT IS BECAUSE IT IS LARGELY ETHNICALLY ARMENIAN B AH IT IS CONTROLLD BY AZER BAJOAN AND SO FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS THERE HAS BEEN IN ARMENIAN SEPARATIST ATTEMPT TO TAKE NEGORNA CARBACH FROM THE RULE OF AZER BAJON WHELE NOW AOZERBSHANI FORCES HAVE ASSAULTED THE AREA THE APPARENTLY REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THERE RE LOT OF CIVILIAN DEATHS THE OZBRCHANI FORCERS SUGGESTING THEIR TELLING PEOPLE TO GET OUT IN ADVANCE OF THEIR ADVANCE BUT APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THE WALZTR JOURNAL ARMENIAN SEPARATE IS INIGORNAL CARBAC AGREED ON WENESDAY TO DISARM AND DISCUSS RE INTEGRATION WITH AZAR BAJAN FOLLOWING A SWIPP BUT DEDLYASSAULT BY OZERBACNI FORCES AT CAPITULATION SIGNALING THE END OF DECADES OF ETHNIC ARMENIAN RULE IN THE ONCLAVE AND THE RAPID DECLINE OF RUSSIAN INFLUENCE IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION TERRITORIES IT'S VERY COMPLICATED SITUATION BECAUSE BOTH RON AND RUSSIHA ARE SUPPORTERS OF THE SEPARATIS IN NEGORNA KARBACH MEANWHILE TURKY AN ISRAEL ARE SUPPORTERS OF THE OZERBAJHANY FORCES THE TERMS OF THE SEASE FIRE LAY GROUNDWORK THAT COULD BRING TO A CLOSED THE AUTONOMOUS RULE BY THE POPULATION OF NEGORNA KARBACH WHICH WAS ONE O FROM BAKU IN A BLOODY YEARS LONG WAR AFTER THE FALL OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE FIGHTING APPEARED TO CONTINUAN PASS OF THE ONCLAY OURS AFTER TE SIGNING OF THE SEASE FIRE THE SPEED OF WHICH THE ARMENIAN SEPARATUS AGREE TO ABANDONED THER ARM STRUGGLE UNDERSCORS MOSCOWS WANING POWER OVER EVENTS IN THE REGION AS ITS FORCES ARE STRETCHED INUCRAN HAS BEEN A FROZEN CONFLICT AND OF THE KRUMLAN HAS USED THIS AS E LEVER TO MAINTAIN OVER BOTH ARMENIA AND OZER BAJCAN ACCORDING TOTHE WAZTER JOURNAL OVER THE YEARS MOSCOW SENT BOTH WEAPONS AND PEACEKEEPERS TO THE REGION WHILE USING DEPLOMACYES RETAIN ITS POSITION IS THE ULTIMATE ARBATER OVER GIO POLITICS THERE IS OBVIOUSLY IS ANOTHER PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT THAT RUSSIA IS WEAKENING INTERNATIONALLY WHICH IS GENERALLY A GOOD THING RUSIES BIT OF VERY POWERFULL AND AGGRESSIVE FORS IN THE WORLD OBVIOUSLY PARTICULARLY ALONG ITS OLD SOVIET BORDERS ACCORDING TO THOMAS TOWALL EXPERT ON I GORNA CARBAC AND TENOR FELLA CARNEGY EUROPE  RUSSALS LOVERAGE AS MUCH WEAKENED BY WHATS HAPPENING IN CRANE WE SEE THE ARMENINS MOVING AWAY FROM RUSSIAN AZAR BAJON HAVING RELATIONSHIP ITH RUSSIA THAT IS MORE ON ITS OWN TERMS AGORNA KARBAC SET T WHIST TWENTY FOUR CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS IN THE DAY LON CONFLICT THAT BEGAN ON TUESDAY WITH ARTILLERY ASSAULTS ON WHAT OZER BACAN SAD WARMENIAN MILITARY TARGETS IN THE BREAKWAY REGION LOCALS POSING ON SOCIAL MEDEA REPORTED STRIKES ON RECIDENTIAL NEGHBOURHOODS IN THE TERRITORIES MAINCITY OF STEPANIKART RUSSIAS DEFENSE MINISTRIES HAD PIECEKEEPERS HAD COME UNDER FIRE AND DIED DURING THE VIOLENC THAT IN SPECIFY HOW MANY WERE KILLED OZERBACHANS HAS A PLANS TO TAKE BACK THE ONCLAVE IT'S INSIDE THE BORZVOZER BRUSSHON ITS POPULATED ALMOST ENTIRELY BY ETHNIC ARMENIANS WHO HAVE RULED SINCE THE NINETEEN NINEBES UNDER THE TERMS OF A PIECIAL ROKER BY RUSSIA SKIRMISHES A RUPTED INTO CONFLICT IN TWENTING TWENTY WHEN OZERBACAN RE CLAIMD AREAS AROUND THE TERRITORY THAT BATTLE ENDED GUARANTEEING ARMENIAN SEPARATEOS CONTROL OVER THAT PARTICULAR AREA BAPIECE HAS REMAIN SHAKI ARMENIANS LEADERS COMPLAINED RUSSIA WASN'T ABLE TO ENFORCE THE DEO S AGAIN A COMPLICATED CONFLICT IN WHICH THE UEN HAS BEEN ENTIRELY ABSEN THE OSRUSSIA AND U ALLSAID THEY HAD MADE LASTAG EFFORTS TO TO SUWADED OZERBCHANI PRESIDENT IHAM AN ALIA FROM ATTACKING THE TERRITORY ANGONO KARBAC HASRELIGHT ALMOST SOLELY ON ARMENIA FOR LINKS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD SECTARICSTAD ANSME BLINKIN CALLED THE LEADERS OF OZERBACHAN ARMENIA TO EXPRESS IS CONCERN OVER THE ASCALATION AGAIN WHAT ONE OFTHE THINGS THAT IS AMAZING ABOUT THESE S ORTS OF CONFLICTS THAT NOBODY NOTICES THEM UNTIL THEY BREAKE INTO VIOLANCE IN AFTER THAT LIKE FIVE MINUTES LATER NOBODY NOTICES OTHERWISE THIS WHY WHEN COMES TO AMERICAN FORM POLICY THE OUNTIFOCUS THAT ACTUALLY IS PLACED ON AMERICAN FORM POLICY AROUND THE WORLD IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY LOW BY AMERICANS IACCOUNT OF BURST INTO THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS FOR A HOT SECOND AND THEN IT IS JUST GONE AND MEANWHILE THE FEDS CONTINUED TO DEBATE THE INTREST RATES BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY CONTINUES TO STAGNATE ACCORDING IT TO THE WALSTER JOURNAL FEDERAS OROFFICIALS ARE SET TO HOLD INTRESTRATE STEADY AT THEIR MEETING ON WEDNESDAY WHILE DEBATING WHAT WU TAKE FOR THEM TO LIFT O BORROWING CLOSS AGAIN THIS YEAR THERE ANTICIPATED DESISIAN REN MARK THE SECOND TIME IN SIX POLICY MEETINGS THIS YEAR THE FET HAS NOT RAISED RATES THE R THE FEDI SIGNAL THAT WILL HOLD RATE SAIDINGAN MAKE NO SUBSTANCIVE CHANGES TO ITS POSTMEETING POLICY STATEMENT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT INFLATION HAS ACTUALY BEEN SOLVED IM BECAUSE AGAIN INFLATION IN THE UNITED STATES REMAINS ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW RET PROJECTIONS SUGGEST THAT MANUFEDOFFICIAL SEEA RISING NEUTRAL RATE WHICH KEEPS IN FLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT STABLE IN THE LONG RUN IT JUST MEANS THAT AS HARDY BAKED INTO THE CAKE ACCORDING TO THE WALSTR JOURNAL FEDERAL RESERV OFFICIAL SURPRISE MARKIS BY SIGNALLING THAT INTRESTRATES WILL NOT FALL AS MUCH AS PREVIOUSLY PLAND THAT TWEEK MIGHT BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT LOOKS IN THEIR PROJECTIONS AN COMMON TARIES SOME OFFICIALS HINT THAT REAKES MIGHT BE HIGHER NOT JUST FOR FOR LONGER BUT FOR EVER IT'S A FOR A VERY LONG TIME IN THE UNITED STATE YOU GET A MORTGAGE THREE FOUR PER CENT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE  FOR A LONG TIME TO COME AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE INFLATION T HAS BEN BAKED INTO THE CAKE BY THE LOOSE MONITARIAN FHYSICAL POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS ONE OF THE PROVENSHERE AND ONE THNGS THAT CREATES IN FLATION IS LACK OF LABOR AT PRODUCTIVITY ONE OFTHINGS THAT BRINGS DOWN PRICES ADDITIONAL LABOR ATE PRODUCTIVITY AS GREG IPRIGHTES FOR THE WALSTER JOURNAL FOR THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS AKES PERFECT SENS N MAN MARE PAY AND BETTER WORK LIKE BALANE FROM DETROITES THREE AUTOMAKERS AFTER ALL WORKERS TROUGHOUT THIS HISTORICALLY TIGHT LABOR ARKET ARE GETTING EXACTLY THAT BUT WHAT MAKE SENS THE STRIKING FACTORY WORKERS MAKES NO SENS FOR MANUFACTURING AS A WHOLE TPAYS ULTIMATELY TIE O PRODUCTIVITY THE QUANTITY AND PUALITY OF PRODUCTS A COMPANY'S WORK FORCE TURNS OUT AND HERE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IN WORKERS ARE IN TROUBLE THES SHU IS NOT WITH LABOR AN TENSIVE PRODUCTS LIKE CLOTHING IN FURNITURE WHICH OFF SHRORT A LONG TIME AGO IT'S IN THE MOST ADVANCE PRODUCTS ELECTRIC CARS AND BATTERIES POWRGENERATION EQUIPMENT OMMERCIAL AIR CRAFT SEMIN CONDUCTORS AMERICAN COMPANIES STILL LEAD THE WORLD IN DESIGN IN NOVATION BUT THE RESULTING PRODUTS AND CREASINAGLY ARE MADE ABROAD ESPECIALLY IN ASIA  JOBIDEN LIHETONAL TROM PLONCST REVERSE THAT THROUGH TAR OF SUBSTITIES NOWTHER GOVERNMENT INTRVENTIONS BUT THE PROBLEM IS IS REALLY NOT ABOUT THAT IT'S THAT ASION MANUFACTURERS HAVE BASICALLY DECREASE COST INCREASE QUOLITY AND AMERICAN COUNTER PARTS HAVE SLIPPED WHENYOU LOOK AT MANUFACTURING PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETED TWYO DOESAN'T TWENTY TO TI WAN IS HAD A PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH ANUAL AVERAGE FOUR PER CENT THE UCATE ONE POINT SEVEN PERS AND GERMANY ONE POINT FOR PER CENT THE US ZERO POINT TWO PER CENT IN MOTOR VEHICAL MANUFACTURING T THE PICTIURES E SPECIALY BAD FROM TWENTY TWELVE THROUGH LAST YEAR PRODUCTIVITY PLUMMETED THIRTY TWO PER CENT THAS NOT THE FAULT OF AMERICAN WORKERS AS GREGGOT POINTS OUT PRODCTIVITY TO PENDS ON BUNCH OF FACTORS INCLUDING MANAGEMENT DECISIONS SUPPLY CHAN PUBLIC IN FOR STRUCTURE REGULATION FOR DAMPL AMERICAN MANUFACTURES USE FAR FOU UR ROBOTS THEN THEI'R COMPETITORS BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE NOT BRINGING UP THE PRODOCTIVITY THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE ON THE WORLD MARKETS AND SO TH YOU A DOUBLE YOU IS STRIKING FOR TEMPORARY GAINS IN THE FACE OF WHAT ARE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT FUTURE LOSSES RIGHT NOW THE ATTEMPT TO TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY THE BIG THREE THAT'S AF VERY RISKY MOVE CONSIDERING THAT FORD IS SET TO APPARENTLY LOSE FOURPOINT FIVET BILLION DOLLARS ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES THIS YEAR THT IS NOT A GOOD NUMBER BOTING BOTING ILL FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS YOU A  U STRIKE

PUSH OF FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR EXAMPLE THE YOU A BLE U CONTINUES FORD WITH ITS STRIKE AND DEMOCRACTS ARE SIGNALING THEIR SUPPORT WY BEGUS AGAIN THE MOST CORRUPT BARGAN AN AMERICAN POLITICS IS UNION SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATS THE WAY THIE THIS WORKS NOT BY THE WAY NOT ALL UNIONS ARE BAD THEI'RE UNIONS THAT DO GOOD AN GO BACK TO THE COAL MINERS UNOS THE'RE PLENTY OF UNIONS THAT DO GOOD THE POINT IS THE ARE NOTAS TO NEE CAP WORKERS AS LONG AS A UNION IS JUST A VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATION OF MEN NEGOTIATING FOR PAY MEN WOMEN OBVIOUSLY NEGOTIATING FOR PAY NO PROBLEM IT'S WHEN YOUS OUR NEE CAPING PEOPLE OR RELYING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CRAMMD DOWN SOLUTIONS THE YOUARE NOW ENGAGED IN CORPOROTISM WHICH IS A A FORM OF FINANCIAL FASTIISM ECONOMIC FASSHISM O THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY KNOWS THIS EIT'S NO WONDER WHENEVER PEOPLE TUNG BY MONEY AN POLITICS THEYALLEAS NEGLECT UNION MONEYAN POLITICS BECAUSE THAT MIGHT IMPLICATD DEMOCRATS WHAT IS AMAZING IS HOW THE UNIONS ARE NOW HOLDING THE DEMOCRATS TO THE WALL BACK IN SEPTEMBER EARLY SEPTEMBER JOBIDON SAID HEU THOUGHT THAT YOU A BU STRIKE WAS UNLIKELY NOW OF COURSE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE END OF WEEK ONE OF THIS THING WHEN AT BY FAN AN BAT THI WI WHETHER IN AWAN A RI GOOD HAPPEN AN ET WHAT THEN KILLING TIME WHEN THE COMCRACT ON BEENT ATED OTTO WORK EARH EFIRE  THIN IN THAT E DON'T THINK THOU IS THER 'ME NOT WORD ABOUT A STRIKE UNTIL IT HAPPENS I DON'T THING IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT'S ALWAYS GOBINE IS INCREDIBLE AT THIS OF COURS THUNIONS ARE HOLDING HIN TO THE WALL WHY NOT THEY KNOW THAT THEY THEY OWN HIM MEANWHILE THE  GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA JOSHIPERO HE IS SAYING ALSO THAT HE STANDS WITH THE OU A DBLE YOU BECAUSE WHY NOT IF YOU'RE DEMOCRAT WHAT COST DOES IT HAVE TO YOU TO STAND WITH THE UNION EVEN IF IT ENSA BANKRUPTING THE KARNDISTRY COUPLE YURS IN THE FUTURE TUS BLAME CAPITALISM AFTER YOU REGULATE THOSE CAR COMPANIES IN TO THE GROUND THEN CRAN DOWN CRAPPY UNION DEALS ON THEM WHEN THE COMPANIES GO UNDER WELL THAT'S WHEN YOU BLAME CAPITALISM OBVIOUSLY HERE'S JOSHIPERO ARENY THANDERS THOUGH THAT IS THE NOW I THE BOSSES ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS BETTER TECHNOLIGAT THO WORKER SHU CUR THEY SHOUL HAVEN' WAR TIME WITH THEIR FAMILIES WAR TIME AT HOME WHAT DO YOU THINK WEL I STAND WITH THE STRIKING U A W WORKERS A TEN DESERVE THE SHARE IN THESE RECORD PROFITS THAT THE EXACUTIVE SIR TAKING HOME I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN EIS JUST A A A GREATER GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE EXACUTIVES ARE MAKING IN COMPANIES AND WHAT THE WORKERS WHO ARE PUTTING THE THE PRODUCT IN THE SERVICES A ON THE FIELD ARE EARNING WE EIN'T A SHRINK THAT GAP THEN I STAND WITH THE U A W STRIKING WORKERS OF COURSE THE DEMOCRATS ARE ALL IN HOCK MEANWHILE THEY'RE HOPING TO CRAM DOWN ALL THE REGULATIONS THAT AE TO MAKE THESE CAR COMPANIES GO BANKRUPT IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT' SO IRRITATING BY WATCHING POLITICS IS VERY OFTEN IT IS GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONISM THAT SKUWS THE INSENTIVE STRUCTURE FOR ALL THESE MAJOR COMPANIES CRAMS DOWN BAD CONTRACT ON THEM THEN WHEN THE COMPANIES GO BANKRUPT THEY BLAME CAPITALISM FOR THE FAILURE AND THEN THEY BAIL OUT THE COMPANIES BLAMING CAPITALISM ALL THE BALANCING BUT WHAT REALLY NEED HERE IS MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION THITS THE STORY THE TWO SEVEN THAT THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY THOUSAND EIGHT ECONOMIC CRASH THE GOVERNMENT CREATED IN SENSIV STRUCTURES IN WHICH IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS TO EVERYBODY THAT ALL O THESE COMPANIES WRENGING GAT BAILED OUT ANS THEY TOOK ALL SORTS OF CRAZY RISKS THE RISKS WENT SOUTH THE GOERMENT BELD THEM OUT THEM BLAME CAPITALISM FOR THAT AT'S NOT CAPITALISM THAT'S CORPORATISM PRETTY OBVIOUSLY BUT AGAIN THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE NOW PRESSURING THE CAR COMPANIES TO CAPITUALATE TO THE U A LU CARBON IS SCHLOSURE RULES OR COMMING FOR U S A COMPANIES ACCORDING TO THE WALSTR JERNAL MANY BIGUOUS COMPANIES AVEBEEN FIGHTING IN WASHINGTON TO BLOCK RULES REQUIRING THEM TO DISCLOSE AF GREENHOUSE GACIMISSIONS THEY PICKED THE WRONG FIGHT WITH CALIFORNIA AND THE U OUR POYS TO APPROVE RULES THAT REQUIRE COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS TO DISCLOSE THEIR MISSIONS THE RULES WOULD APPLI TO PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC COMPANIES AND REQUIRE BUSIESES TO CALCULATE AND DISCLOSE HEMISSIONS FROM THEIR SUPPLIERS AN TEIR CUSTOMERS WHICH GOES BEYOND WHAT WAS EXPECTED OUT OF WASHINGTON THIS MEANS THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERY MAJOR COMPANY IN AMERICA IS NOW GOING TO BE EXPECTED TO DISCLOSE THEIR CARBON AMISSIONS WHICH IS GOING TOHVE SOME PREDICTABLE DOWN STREIME ECONOMIC AF FACT SO THINGS ARE GOING INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY WALL CAT TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AND THEN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS AT THAT I LIKE TODAY SO PENNSYLVANIA STUDENTS HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GO ALONG WITH NEW TRANSBATHROM POLICIES SUGGESTING THAT BOYS CAN SIMPLY GO INTO GIRLS BATHERUMS AND SO THEY STAGE WALK OUT THE OTHER DAY TO PROTEST THESE BATHERUM POLICIES HERES WHAT A LOOK LIKE  ACCORDING TO THE NER COST HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS FROM PENNSYLVANIANS PROCOMIANS VALLEYS SCHOOL DISTRICT WALKED OUT A CLASS ON FRIDAY AFTER THE LOCAL SCHOOLBOARD FAILD TO ENACT APOLISE E REQUIRING TRANSGENDER STUDENTS TO USE THE RESTROM CORRESPONDING WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL SEC ABOFE THE DESCRIPTION THERE I MEAN YOU MEAN THAT THAT THEY THEY DIDN'T PASS A POLICE PROTECTING GIRLS KIDS WERE UP SAT GIRLS WHO WANTED TO PROTECT HIM THEY WERE USET THAY KNWANT MEN IN THER BATHROM SAID JOHN OUT WHO ORGANIZED THE WALK OUT HIS MOTHER STEFPHANY ACCUSED THE DISTRICT OF ONLY PROTECTING TRANS A STUDENTS NOT LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PICTURE PROPOSED POLSY SEVEN TWENTY CAME AFTER LOCAL FATHER T ON JAGGOR POSTSENOHN SOCIAL MEDIA TAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS LEFT TO TWO UPSET AND EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED TO WALK IN TH CHOOL BATHROOMS AFTER A LEGURALLY HAVING ENCOUNTER WITH A TRANS A STUDENTS IN ONE OF THE FACILITIES THE OUTLESS REPORT HOWEVER SAID NEITHER THE FATHER NORTHERDAUGHTER R ONE HUNDRED PER SENTS SURE THAT THE STUDENT JAGGOR SAUGTER ENCOUNTERED IN THE RESTAURUM WAS A BIOLOGICAL MAIL WHY MEAN HERE'S THE THING IF YOU HAVE RULES THAN HE CAN INSURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM BUT IT IS SOM IT IS INCREDIBLE ME THAT THIS IS EVEN A CONTROVERSY GOOD FOR THE TUDENTS FORT WALKING OUT CA TIME FRY QUICTING THAT I HATE A SO JOHN FEDDERMAN HATES PANS ON WHY I'M CONFUSED WHY HE HATES PANS BUT APPARENTLY HE REALLY REALLY HATES PAN SO MUCH SO THAT THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO APPARENTLY CONCEDE TO THIS BRAIN DAMAGED PERSON AND I SAY THAT WITH AGAIN THAT'S ON THE INSULT TIS STO REALITY THIS PERSON HAD A MASSIVE STROKE SO THIS APPARENTLY MEANS THAT DOME JOHN FEDDERMAN MUST BE ALOWED TO PRESIDE OVER THE SENATE LIKE MY  SEVEN YEAR OLD SON GOING TO GOING TO CAMP OR SOMETHING WI DOW THAT'S OF THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES ITS ALL THE STAFFER TILL HAE TO URSUITS JOHN FEDDERMAN HOWEVER HE LITERALLY PRESIDED OVER THE SENATE WEARING JIM SHORTS AND LIKE A SHORT SLEEVE BUTTON DOWN SHIRT LOOKING AS THOUGH HE JUST EMERGED FROM A HOMELESS SHELTER ACCORDING TO THE DAILY WIRE THE SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA TOOK HIS TURN SITTING AS THE PRESIDING OFFICER WHILE SOME OF HIS JIO PE COLLEGES INCLUDING SENTR OF JOHN THOON AND RAN POLLEN JOHN CORN'S LIVER REMARKS

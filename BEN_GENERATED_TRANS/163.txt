WHENEVER THERE'S A BIG DEBATE THE BIG QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE HIS TRO ONE AND WHO LOST BUT TO UNDERSTAND WHO ONE AND WHO LOST YOU FIRST HAVE TO DISCUSS WHAT THE METRICS ARE FOR WINNING AND LOSING BECAUSE YOU CAN WIN IN TOBATE AND IT CAN MEAN VERY LITTLE OR YOU CAN LOSE I DEBATE AND CAN ENDOUR A CAMPAIGN SO THE QUESTION FOR EACH OF THE CANDIDATES ON THE STAGION LAST NIGHT'S FIRST REPUBLICAN DEBATE WAS WHAT IS THE GOAL IN ORDER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GOAL WAS FOR EACH CANDIDATE N THE WE CAN GRADE THEM IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ACHIEVE TEIR GOALS WE CAN ALSO GRADE THEM IN TRMS OF WHAT WE PERSONALLY THOUGHT OF THEM IN TERMS OF TRUTH HONESTY POLICY IN ORDER TO GRAY THEM ON THAT BASIS WE FIRST HAVE TO CAN ASSESS THE STATE OF THE RACE GOING INTO THE DEBATE AND TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE RACE WAS GOING INTO THE DEBATE YOU FIRST HAVE T UNDERSTAND THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT ACTUALLY A COHESIVE THING THE CONSERVATIVE MOMENT AT THIS POINT IS NOT A COHESIVE MOVENT THERE'S AN ANTI LEFT UMBRELLA UNDER THE ANTI LEFT UMBRELLA THERE ARE SEVERAL GROUPS INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WIVE SEEN PEOPLE DIVIDE THESE GROUPS SIX WAYS IF YOU'R NTE COEN OF THE NEWYORK TIMES I'VE SEEN THEM DIVIDED A COUPLE OF WAYS THEY'RE NOT DIVIDED HOWEVER INTO TWO GROUPS ONE OFTHE CORUSUMPTIONS GOING INTO THE RPUBLICAN PRIMARIES BY A LOT OF POLITICOES IS THAT THEYRE BASICALLY TWO GROUPS THE PRO TRUMPS AND THE ANTI TRUMPS MAYBE THREE THE PRO TRUMPS THE ANTI TRUMPS AND THE LUKE WARM TRUMPS THAT'S NOT REALLY ACCURATE IN REALITY IN THIS RE PUBLICAN PRIMARY I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE FOUR LANES RIGHT NOW THEY'RE FOUR LANES AND THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU OCCUPY MULTIPLE OF THOSE LANES AND BE THE TOP PERSON AND MULTIPLE OF THOSE LANES OURE CAN HAVE TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO CHALLENGE PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO'S RUNNING AWAY WITH THE PRIMARIES RIGHT NOW BY FORTY POINTS NATIONALLY AND HE IS WINNING YES STILL IN IWIK HE IS WINNING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND EVERY OTHER STATE SO IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE RACE STOOD AND

SATO SPASECLY JUST WANTS TO HOLD STEDY THAT'S HIS GOAL HOLD STEDY AS WE AS WE LOOK AT THAT CHARP BY THE WAY I'M ANA EXPLAIN IN JUST A SECOND WHAT EVERYBODY'S GOAL IS GOING INTO THE DEBATE BY LOOKING AT THAT CHART FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOUR SELFUM IT'S IN TESPER NED OF FREPLACEMENT AW AS YOU HAVE YOURSELF ALONG ER LONGYOUR BATTERY LIFE BASICALLY TO GRAD SINCE NOW YOU CAN'T

SECOND PLACE BUT HE'S KIND OF STAGNENT WITH ALL THE WITH ALL OF THESE GROUPS REGT HE'S IN SECOND PLACE IN ALL OF THESE GROUPS IN THREE GROUPS HE'S GOT A BEE AND MONG THENEVER TRUMPERY'S GOT A BEE HIS ORIGINAL PLAN WAS HE WAS GOING TO SCORE LIKE A BEE WITH THE TRUMPERS AND THEN HE WAS GOING TO SCOREN TO A WITH PRETT MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE TAT WAS GING O BE THE THOUS CAN BE THE IDEA THAT IS NOT HAPPEN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE TO SANTIS WAS IN A SLIDE HIS GOAL FOR THIS DEBATE AND BECAUSE HE'S IN SECOND PLACE WAS JUST TO AVOID THE SPOTLIGHT ACTUALLY HIS GOAL IS TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY HE DID NOT WANT LAST NIGHT TO BE A RED WEDDING THEN HE THE TIME WHEN HE JUST COMPLETELY COLLAPSED ON THE STAGE AS WELL SEE I THINK THA HE LARGELY ACCOMPLISHED THAT FOR VAKE SCOAL I'S TO CONTINUE TO GAIN ATTENTION TO BE A LIGHTNING ROD THAT WAS HIS GOAL ON THE STAGE AND HE'S DOING REALLY WELL WITH THE TRUMP ADJASON HE KNOWS HE'S GOING TO DO NOTHING WITH ANEVER TRUMPERS AND HE NWS NOT KIN DO INTHIG WITH TRADITIONAL GEOPEE WHICH AGAIN IS WHY HE'S NOT REALLY RUNING FOR PRESIDENT HE'S RUNNING FOR DONNEL TRUMS VICE PRESIDENT OR FOR A CABIN A POSITION OR FOR SENTI POSITION HE KNOWS' OT TAKING IT AWAY FROM TRUMP AND THAT WASN'T HIS GOAL LAST NIGHT HIS GOAL LAST NIGHT WAS TOBASICALLY TO GRADE TO SAMTIS WITH THE TRUMP ADJASON BY GAINING MOMENTUM WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND HE MAY HAVE ACCOMPLISH ACKEL LAST NIGHT FOR MIT PENCE PENCE REALLY KNOWS THAT HE DOES HAVE A SHOT AT THE PRESIDENCE HE BUT T HE FEELS THAT HE HAS TO RON BECAUSE HE HAS TO PRESERVE HIS LEGACY AS A PERSON WHO STOOD UP TO THE PREDATIONNS OF DONAL TRUMP TBETWEEN NOVMEMBER IN JANUARY AND AS HE SORT OF TRADITIONAL OLD LINE REPUBLICAN POLITICIAN HOW DOYOU DO LAST NIGHT HE BASIDALLY ACHIEPE HIS GOALL NICKEE HAYLY HERGOALL WAS I NEED A LANE AND I NEED T ACTUALY SHOWS SOME MOMENTUM IN A LANE NICKY HALEAS WILL SEE ACTUALLY OUT PERFORMED LAST NIGHT AND SHE ACTUALY ACHIEVE TRIGOLL TIM SCOTT HE'S A QUICKSOTIC FIGURE I NOTUA WHY HE'S IN THE RACE IS NOT HIS MOMENT I'M NOT SURE HE HAS A MOMENT HE'S INCREDIBLY SOFT SPOKEN HE'S NOT AGGRESSIVE HE SEEMS LIKE A VERY NICE PERSON BUT HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY TEETH AND SO THERE WIS NO GOALL FOR HIM TO ACHIEVE AND  SO HE SUCCEEDED IN NOT ACHIEVING A GOLL I SUPPOSE BUT I FEEL LIKE TIMSCOTTASCAN BE ONE O THE FIRST PEOPLE OUT OF THE RACE AND FOR CHRIS CRISTY THE ENTIRE GOAL LAST NIGHT WAS TO LIKE THE BAKE LOCK DOWN ONE LANE MY LOCK DOWN THAT NEVER TRUMP LANE AND I THINK CRISTY MAY ACHIEVE THAT GOALL LAST NGH MEANWHILE TRUMPECHIEVE HIS GOAL WHICH WAS STAYAWAY GOLLATCHYE SO LAST NGHT I THING ACTUALLY EVERYBODY KIND OF ACHIEVED THEIR GOALL BUT HE EFFECTS IN TERMS OF MOMENTUM I'RE GOING TO BE THE QUESTION SO REGONG T GET TO THAT IN JUST ONE SECOND THE EFFACT LIKE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN VETHEMOMENTUM IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THAT  QUESTION AS TO WHO HAS MOMENTUM COMING OUT OF THEDEBATE WE WERE WE'REGOING TO HAVE T ACTUALLY JUMP INTO THE EBATE IT SO EN GET TO THE FUN PART HAKE SO I'M ABOUT YOU THE SUMMER HEATENIN SOT FLORDA ITIS REALLY REALLY HOT OUTSIDE BUT THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD NOT BE SWEATING THIS SUMMER THAT IS THE PRICE OF MEAT THANKS TO GOOD RANHERS YON HALFT YOUR PRICE CAN BE LOCKED IN FOR TWO YEARS YOU MIGHT BE THINKING A PRICE LOCK GUARANTEE ON MEAT YES IT IS AMAZING IT'S A MAZING BECAUSE AGAIN THESE PRICES ARE GOING UPSO WHY NOT LOCKE THAT IN GOOD RANCHERS IS THE ONLY

KEEP COCHER GOCHECK CIN OUT RIGHT NOWT GOOD RANCHERSTOT COM MEUS MY COOD BEN FOR THIRTYBOKS OFF ANYBOX OKSE SO AS WE JUMP INTO THE ACTUAL DEBATE I'M N EXPLAINED YOU HOW I ANALYZED THIS DEBATE SO THE WAY THAT I ANALYZE THIS PARTICULAR DEBATE IS GOING TO BE  MY OWN SUBJECTIVE BELIEF BECAUSE EVERY DEBATE IS A GROSHMON I TEA THE OLD CRRISOLOPHONE TERE'S A THOUSAND PERSPECTIVES ON WHAT SOMEBODY SAYS SO THE VAKE MIGHT STAY SOMETHING AND I MIGHTHING MAN HE IS BEING WILDLY DISHONES AND THEN THERE IG BE PEOPLES LIKE HYE ABUT Y'S PUNCHING SOMEBODY SO AGAIN EVERY DEBATE IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE I'M GOING TO CRITIK DEBATE PAR TICIPANCS THROUGH A COUPLE OF DIFFENT PRISEMS THAT I THINK SHOULD STILL BE IMPORTANT EVEN IF THEY SEEM INCREASINGLY NON IMPORTANT IN EVERYDAY POLITICAL LIFE AY SO I'M GOING TO GRAT THEM BASE ON LIKE IS WHAT THY'RE SHING TRUE ARE THEY BEING LIKE A DECENT PERSON SO ONE MY MY GRADES OF DECENCY GENERALLY IS I DON'T LIKE ATTACKS THAT ARE FALSE I DON'T LIKE THEM IM THIN VORYU N ATAK SOMEBODY SHOULD ATTACK SOMEBODY BASED ON WHAT THEY HAVE DONE I'D ONLHY YOU SHOULD JUST LAUNCH SPECIOUS ATTACKS ON PEOPLE AS A GENERAL RULE I UNDERSTAND THAT WELIV IN A VERY AGGRESSIVE TIME AND SO A LOT O PEOPLE TAKE A GRESSION ON STAGE PERFORMED OF AGGRESSION AS WELL IF HE'S DOING IT THERE THEN HALL DEFINITELY DO IT TO JOBIDON BUT DOES THAT MAKE YOU LIKE A GOOD PERSON I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD ACTUALLY YOU KNOW LAUNCH WELL TIMED AND WELL CALEBRATED ATTACKS ON PEOPLE AND STILL TAKE ON JOBINE MAYBE IT MAYBE I'M JUST SHOOTING IN THE DARK BUT THAT'S HOW I GRADE PEOPLE BUT AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THAT Y PRERSPECTIVE NOT THE ONLY PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS WHY AS WE GO ON HERE I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN HOW EACH LANE IS GRATING PEOPLE IN THIS ACTUAL DEBATE I'M ALSO GOING TO GRATE PEOPLE BASED ON THEIRE ACTUAL POLICY PERFORMANCE WHICH MEANS INHERENT ADVANTAGE TO PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE GOVERNED A STATE OR DONE ATHING AS SUPPOSED YOU JUST SAID A THING NOW AGAIN I'M NOT SURE THIS MATTER IS IN RE PUBLICAN PRIMARY ANY MORE IT CERTAINLY HAS NOT MATTERED SINCE PRESENT IN TRUMP I MEAN WHEN WHEN PRESIDEIN TRUMP BECAME THE NOMINE HE LITERALLY HAD NO GOVERNING RECORD HE' NOT BEN IN POLTICS AT ALL SO IGAN I'M USING METRICS THAT MAY BE OUTTATED BUT AGAIN I GET TO DO IT I'S MYSHO SO MY METRICKS ARE GENERALLY TRIS WHA THEYRE SHING TRUE ARE THEY BEING LIKE A DECENT PERSON IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING A REFLECTION OF ACTUAL POLICY WINDS ON THE GROUND SO FOR EXAMPLE I'MIN A GRADE PEOPLE BETTER IF THEY DO SOMETHING ANT I WOKE I SUPPOSE TOU JUST SAYING SOMETHING ANSE I WOKE I'M ALSO GOING TO GRAT PEOPLE BASED ON THE ACTUAL POLICY CONSERVATISM OF OF WHAT THEY ARE SAYING I DO I THINK THAT THE'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT OR NOT IT'S THAT THAT IS HOW I TYPICALLY GRADE THESE THINGS NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT MY GRADES I'RE GOING TO SOMEHOW GOING TO BE REFLECTIVE OF LIKE THE MOMENTHIM IN THE RACE I THING ABSOLUTELY NOT AGAIN I'M IF I'RE GOING TO PLACE MYSELF ON THIS CHART OF LIKE TRUMPBER'S TRADITIONAL GEOPE LIBERAL WANE TRUMPIT JASON I'M I'M SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TRUMP ADJASCENT AND TRADITIONAL GEO PEE PROBABLY I'M CERTAINLY NOT NEVER TRUMP CHRIS CHRISTY LIBERAL WING OF THE PARTY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT IN THE I WILL

IS SOME SORT OF CORRUPT TOOL OF THE SHATO WE ESTABLISHMEN ITHOUT TO FINDING CORRUPTION TOOL OR ESTABLISHMENT BUT AS YOU SEE LIKE THHE ALWEADY WANTED WHICH IS TO BE THE LIGHTNING ROD SO I CHRIS CHRISTY WHO CAN'T HELP HIMSELF AND IF THERE IS A PIE TO BE THROWN CHRIS CHRISTY WELL FOR GO EVEN EATING IT IN ORDER TO THROW IT CHRISTY THEN WHENT AFTER THE VACAND I WILL SAY THAT THAT CRIST CRISTY DOES HAVE A PARTICULAR SOT OF SKILLS WHEN IT COMES TO JUST LIKE RECKING PEOPLE ON STAGES THAT'SYOU'D HEACH IF HE SAYS N YOU WRETCT PEOPLE ON THE STAGE AND HE WAS OUT OF PEATA LAST NIGHT AND IM AND SO HIS HIT ON

WHEN ORDER TO DO THAT LET'S FIND CONSENTES CAN'T WE ALL AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BAND MATE CHARM ABORTIONS CAN'T WE ALL AGREE THAT WE SHO INCORREG TO DOCTON CAN'T WE ALL AGREE THAT DOCTORS AND NURSES YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ABORTION SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PERFORM THEM AGAIN I DI THIS I THIS A PERFECTLY FINE GENERAL ELECTION TAKE MIHT PENCE TOOK THE STRONGEST LINE WITH REGARD TO ABORTION HERE HE WAS LAST NIGHT AFTER I GAVE MY LIFE TO JESUS CRISE AS MY LORD SAVIOR OPEN UP THE BOOK AND I READ BEFORE I FORMED YOU IN THE WOM I KNEW YOU AND SEE I SET BEFORE YOU LIFE AND DE BLESSINGS A CURSE IS NOT CHOOSE LIFE

ADVICTO YOUR MY FRIEND BUT A CONSENTISIS THE OPPOSITE OF LEADERSHIP AND THAT'S AN INTERESTING  SORT OF DEBATE A CONSENSUS IS IS THE OPPOSITE F LEADERSHIP I ONLY IS PARTICULARLY TRUE I MEAN SOMETIMES CONSENSIS I'S ACTUALLY BUILT THROUGH LEADERSHIP HOWEVER WITH THAT SAT IT'S AN INTERESTING AND FASTENING I IT COMPLETELY WENT UN NOTICED RIGT THA THE SIDE SHOW THEN CONTINUED WHAT'S IT WHAT'S INTERESTING AS THEN WE GOT INTO TE SECTION OF THE EBATE WHERE EVERYBODY SORT OFE TRIED TO LOCK DOWN THEIR POSITIONS IT'SIN NOW THE FIRST HOUR THA DMADE IS BOT ESTABLISHING YOR POSITION THAT THE POSITION ESTABLISHE BY THE VARIOUS CANDIDATES IN THE FIRST HOUR OF THE EBATE WAS AS WE SUGGEST IN THEIR LANES AND AND A AND BASICALLY IN ORIENTATION FOR PREDICULAR GLES FOR O SANTIS IT WAS MAINTAIN YOUR PRESENCE DON'T LOSE GROUND STAY WHERE YOU ARE FOR VAK IT WAS BECOME A LIGHTNING ROD AND OWN THAT TRUMP ADJACENT LANE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT FOR NICGE HAILEY WAS ON THE TRADITIONAL GEO PE LANE AND THAT WAS THE DYNAMIC THAT SORT OF PERMEATED THE REST OF THE DEBATE SO FOR EXAMPLE RONDASSENT SON CRIME HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AND THIS IS THIS IS WHY I GIVE TO SANTIS ADITIONAL CRETON GIVE PEOPLE FOR JUR SANTINGS AS I LIVE IN FLOREN I'VE WATCHED HIM DO IT DE SANSIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS YOU WANT A THING DONE I DIDN'T IN FLORTA MAYBE ASHOU TO IT NATIONALLY THAT'S HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A PERIOD WHEREE A LOT PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO CARE WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO IN TRMS OF GOVERNING WHE NI MEAN PEOPLE COULD SAY THEY COUL U SAY THINGS NOW BE AMAZIN HERO IS OT RONDASSANS IS TALKING ABOUT CRIME THERE'S ONE GUY AND THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT'S EVER DONE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT ME WHEN WE HAD TWO OF THESE E DISTRICT ATURTIES AND FLORIDA ELECTED WITH SOROS FINDING WHO SAID THEY WOULDN'T DO THEIR JOB I REMOVED IM FROM THEIR POST THEY ARE AS IT AT WE ARE GETTO GO AFTER ALL OF THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THEY ARE VICTIMIZING INNOCENT PEOPLE IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS COUNTRY IN IT WI'LL STOP WHEN I GET INTO OFFICE S O GET HIS ENTIRE CAMPAN LAST NIGHT WAS I'M BUST GOVERNOR IN AMERICA I'LL DO IT NATIONALLY THAT'S FINE DID A MEAN MOMENTUM AS WE'LL DISCUSSIN A SECOND MAYBE NOT GAT MEANWHILE WE GOT INTO THE MOST POLORIZING QUESTIONS OF THE NIGHT THESE ALL SURROUNDED TRUMP AND YOU CAN VERY CLEARLY SEE WHO'S AIMING FOR WHICH LANE AN SO THERE IS A A QUESTION THOSE ASKED AS TO WHOUD SUPPORT TRUMP EVEN IF HE ANDED UP BEING CONVICTED IN CORT AS BERY AWKWARD MOMENT BECAUSE THE ONLY PRERSENT THE VAKE WAS LIKE THE KID IN SCHOOL WHO HAD THE ANSWER BEFORE ANYONE ELSE HE'S IN THE FRONT RUBMING THIS IS SORT OF A VAKES PERSONALITY ALSO BECAUSE THI SUPERSMARK I BUT TE VAKE'S ENTIRE PERSONALITY IS BASELY THE KID IN MODILY YOU AND TAT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT O HANG OUPAT YOUKNOW THAT HE'S ASMARK I SO HERE IS A VAKE WHO LIKE JUMPS OUT OF HIS SEAT BASICALLY RUNS AROUND THE ROOM WITH HIS HAND UP SCREAMING EVERYBODY ELSE A LITTLE BUT SLOWER I'M THE GUN HERE HERE IS THE QUESTION YOU ALL SAW TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT THE EVENTUAL REPUBLICAN DOMINA IF FORMER PRESENT TRUMP IS CONVICTED IN A COURT OF LAW WOULD YOU STILL SUPPORT HIM AS YOUR PARTY'S SHORCE PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU WOULD AND THEN THEN THEN VVACOUS TIME WHEN WE MAY HAND UP HERE ALL DAY LONG HESALL IF YOU GO BACK TO THAT CLIP IS ACTUALLY FASCINATING TO SEE THE ORDER IN WHICH PEOPLE RAISE THEIR HANDS A SOMETHING TO THIS RIGHT AND DOM AND FRANKLIM KANA SHOCK THAT' SOME OF THE HANDIDTE TEND THOUGHT ABOUT THIS QUESTION BEING ASKED BEFOREHAND BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THERING A SUPPORT TRUMP IT THESE THENOMINY OBVIOUSLY EXCEPT RASA HUTCHINSON HO KNOWON CARES ABOUT BUT IFYOU LOOK A THAT IF YO'LL GET TE ORDER O THE HANDS GO UP IN SO THE VAKE AS I SAY IS LIKE SUPERFAST OFF THE GUN DUIT IS LIKE WIET ERP ON THE TRIGGER HERE THE NEXT COUPLE OF HANDS THEY GO UP ARE HAYLY AND SCOT AND BURGAM TE SANTIS SORT OF RELUCTANTLY RAISE IS HANDS ON HIS PENS AND THEN AND THEN CRISTY IS CAN A SHAKING HIS HEAD SO WHY 'S CRISTY SHAKING HIS HAD U HERE WAS CRISTY LOCKING DOWN THE NEVER TRUMPLANE SOAN'S GOD STO STOP NORMALIZING THIS CONDUCT LO CE  OW WHETHER OR NOT WHITHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE RIGHT ORE WRONG THE CONDUCT IS BELIEVE THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  DOTHIS IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY BOING IS ALOUD WUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE TRUE IT'S THERY IS LOCKING DOWN THAT NEVER TRUMPLANE RIGHT AGAIN THERE THE FORE LANES THERE THE TRUMPERS TRSHON GIOPE TRUMPETJASON NEVER TRUMPERS THAT IS THAT IS CRISTY LOCKING TOWN HE NEVER TRUMPLANE HERE'S A VAGUE TRYING TO LOCK DOWN THE TRUMP ADJACENT LANE BY BEING SLAVISHLY SICOPANTIC TO PRESIDENT TRUMPRIGHT HERE LET' JUST SPEAK THE TRUTH OCA PRESENT TRUMP I BELIEVE IT WAS THE BEST PRESIDENT OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENT YOUR CLAIM THE DONALD TRUMP IS MOTIV ADED BY VENGEANCE AND GRIEVANCS WOULD BE A LOT MORE CREDIBLE IF YOU'RE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WE'RE NOT BASED ON VENGEANCE AND GRIEVANE AGAINST D TRUMP WITHOWT AND IODA OF VISON FOR THIS COUNTRY THEY COULD JUST CHANGE THE CHANNEL TO AMASAND BE SA RIGHT NOW BUT I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESID AN AN ASAN BE SEEN I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES GASO THERE THERE'S AGAI HE'S LOCKING DOWN THAT TRUMPETJACONT LANE BUT HE HE'S NOT RUNNG FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING IF YOU BELIEVE THE DONNAL TRUMP IS LIKE THE GREATEST PRESIDENT IN HUMAN HISTORY AT FIRST OF ALL I WILL SAY AGAI E VSUPERSMUNKOC WHEN HE SAYS AT GREATEST PRESIDENT OF THE TWENTY FOR CENTURY THAT'S A REAL SHORTLISS GUIS THERE'VE ONLY BEEN THREE OF THEM IL CA AND TWO OF THEM NOT SO GREAT IT'S GEORGE DO BUSH FOLLOWED BY BAROCKOBAMA FOLLOWED BY DONAL TRUMP AND THE NEXT ONE IS BYDEN SHAT'S THATS ON AMAZING LISTS THAT YOU HAVE TO TOPRT TE BUT IF YOU ARE THAT INTO TRUMP YOU COULD NOT RUN WE TRUMPIT SAIN HE WANTS THE FIELD CLIR I'VE NOTICED BY THE WAY THAT IN REACTION TO THES DEBATE AND EVERYTHING ELSE TRUMPTESS PRACE IS ROMIS WOMMY WHICH IS DONALD TRUMP IF YOU SEE SOMEBODIES AT THREAT YOUTHINK HE PRACES THEM THOT'N TROMP HAS NEVER PRAISED ANYONE HE HAS EVER PROCEED AS A THREATS THIS IS WHY THEY'RE LOT PEOPLE IN RE PUBLICAN PARTY POLITICS RIGHT NOW HARE LIKE YOU'RE JUST A STALKING HORSE  THAT LIKE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE IN THRAC DOES THAT MEAN THE THE VACASN AN LOCK DOWN THAT TRUMP IT JASON LINE UP HE COULD EASILY LOCK DOWN THAT TRUMP ADJACENT LANE AND TOM YOU KOW HE CONTINUED I TO DO THIS HE HE MADE A COMMINVEN ON THE STATION TO DAY ON HE WOULD PARDON DONAL TRUMP THEN WE GOT TO I THINK WHAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING EXCHANGE IS OF THE DEBATE AND THAT WAS THE EXCHANGE OVER YOU CRANE BECAUSE THIS GOES TO SORT OF THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WERE BROADLY AND WHERE THESE VARIOUS SLANS STAND ON FOREIGN POLICY AND THIS IS A COMPLETE WORSHOCKTEST BECAUSE IF YOU ARE IN THE SORT OF MORE ISOLATION AS SWING OF THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY SER OF TOCKER CARLSON WING ON ON FORIGN POLICY YOU LOVED WITH VAKE HAD TO SAY IF IN THE MORE TRADITIONAL WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTYOU THINK OF THY GOT HAS ASS HAND TED TO HIM S AGAIN EVERY ELEMENT HERE IS BASED ON WHICH LANE ARE YOU ARE YOU PART OF I'LL GET THEN WE GET TO THE FORM POLICY TEBATE AND HERE ONCE AGAIN THIS IS THE VAKE LOCKING DOWN THE TRUMP ADJACENT OF PEOPLWO LOVE TRUMP ON POLICY BUT YOU KNOW HAVE SOME PROBEMS MABBE WITH TRUMP PERSONALITYWISE THE WAY HE DOES THIS IS BY BEING THE ONLY PERSON ON STAGE WHO BASELY SAYS RIGHT AWAY THAT HE WOULD WOULD DRAW LIKE ALL MILITARY AID TO OU CRANE OM AND TOM THIS TURNS INTO A PRETTY FIERY DEBATE WHICH IGTHIS IS WHY YOU WATCH THE DEBATESIS SHE CAN NACTUALLY WATCH SPIRITED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ISSUE SOASHING ENJOY THIS PART OF THEDEBATE THE BOUT YURIS AE VAKE AND I THINK THAT THIS IS JUSATI ELSES BORDER WHEN WE SHOULD USE THOSE SAME MILITARY RESOURCES TO PREVENT ACROSS THE INVASION OF OUR OWN SOUTHERN BORDER YERIN THE NIATHE RUSHO CHINA LLIONS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT WE FACE AND I FIND IT OFFENSE THAT WE HAVE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIONS ON THE STAGES THAT WILL MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO KEIVE TO THEIR POPE IS E LENSKY WITHOUT DOING THE SAME THING FOR PEOPLE AND MALWY WOR THE SOUTHSIDE OF CHICIGO MAN SO ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE SORT OF ANTI CATHOLICE SLAP THERE LIKE POPEZALENSKY IS IS PRTICUATLY HELPFUL TO THE VAKE HE'S THE ONLY ONE ON THE STAGE WHO'S DRAWING A CONTRAST WITH REGARD TO OU CRANE AND HE WAS FORCIBLY SMACKED AROUND BY BOTH MIKE PENS AND NICKEY HAILEY SO HERE IS MY PENSE GOING AFTER A VAKE AND AVAKE ACTUALLY STRIKING BACK WITH ONCE AGAIN A QUOTE FROM ABOMA THIS IS WHY I SAY THAT BECAUSE WITH TACU SO STUDIED AND BECAUSE HEUNDERSTANDS WHAT WUT SUCCESSFUL POLITICIONS HAS DONE IN THE PAST SOMETIMES E JUSTONS A CRIBPING LOFF OF THEM BUTHE IF WE DO THE GIVE AWAY YOU WANT TO GIVE TO PRUDENT TO GIVE HIM HIS LAND IS NOT TOT TO BE TOO LONG FOR HE ROLLS OR CROSS AN MATO BOARDER AND FRANKLY AR MEN AND WOMEN OF ARE AR FORCES ARE I HAVE TO GO ON FIGDIM I WANT ON LET FO OU CRANI AS A RNIN O TO RAOU ITH TH REARLIER DO OR  ASIS MAT THAT BY AS EFENCE I DOU TA LUSH THAT YOU AS THE SAR DOES NOT EXIST ANY WAR IT FELL BACK IN NINETEEN NINDY U ORSER RE A F  T THE CIIN O AS TAS TAT TOF RA SALK A SO THAT'S ENOUGH THAT RIGHT THERE THAT'S WHERE HE QUOTO MOMERATE WHET HOU WILL THAT THAT'S OL BOM UP AGAINST MIT RAMNY TWENTY TWELVE THE NIGTIN ATIES CALLED THEN ONE TA FORM POLISY BACK RAN ME THAT THAT THAT'S ALL THAT IS THEN MATAY GETS INTO IT WITH NICKE HALY AND THIS WAS NICKEY'S BEST MOMENT O DEBATE BECAUSE SHE MADE A PRETTY COACHING CASES TWHY THE UNITED STATES OUGHT TO BE INVOLVED IN THE WAR IN U CRANE AGAIN THI'S TA VERY SPLIT QUESTION INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOW THISCENT OF A FASTIONING PART OF THE DEBATE SO THE REALITY IS  THA  TO DA  TE D II I  TA SOAN I THAT TAT THE SAME YEOPLE WHO TOOK US INTO THE EROCH WAR THE SAME BEOPLE WHO TOOK US INTO TOE VE AT NOT WAR YOU CANNOT END THAT YOU NOT STOR ANOTHER NO WIND WAR AND I DO NOT WANT TO GET TO THE POINT WAR SENTING ON MILITARY RESOURCES ABROAD WHEN WE COULD BE BETTER USING THEM HURED HOME TO PROTECT OUT ON BORDERS PROTECT THE HOME LAND AR THAT WOILLD MI TOP FIRYF A WE   TI T TE F  T IN TE RY TA FINT GOINTNG T TO TOTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE EVERYBODY AH IWE RESPECT EVERYBODY'S TIME HERE SO GOVERNOR HALEY AN YOU DID NOT RAISE YOUR HAND MEANING THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT MORE FUNDING FOR THE U CRANE WOR YOU HAVE A SAID OF GOVERNOR DOSANTIS THAT DA YOU DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT WHEN HE INITIALLY CALLED IT A TERRITORIAL DISPUTE WHY FIRST OF ALL THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT NEEDS TO HAVE MORAL CLARITY THEY NEED TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG THEY NEED TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SITUATION WITH RUSSIAN YU CRANE HERE YOU HAVE A PRO AMERICAN COUNTRY THAT WAS IN VADED BY A THUG SO WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO YOU CRANE LESS THAN THREE AND A HALF PER CENT OF OUR DEFENSE BUDGET HAS BEEN GIVEN TO YOU CRANE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERSENT AT JUST CUR G D P ELEVEN OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE GIVEN MORE THAN THE UESS BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTA IS GO BACK TO WEN CHINA AND RUSSIA HELD HANDS SHOOK HANDS BEFORE THE OLEMPICS AND NAME THEMSELVES UNLIMITED PARTNERS A WHEN FOR RUSSIA IS A WIND FOR CHINA WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU CRANE IS THE FIRST LINE OF TE FAND FR AND  THAT VE THAT TOT THEN UNDERSTAND IS YOU WANTS THE HAND YOU CRANE TO RUSSIA YOU WANTS THE A LET CHINA EAT CIWIN YOU WANTS TO GO AN STOP FINDING ISRAEL YOU DON'T WIOS AT TO FRIENDS WHAT YOU DO IN SAID AS YOU HAVE THE BACKS OF YOUR FRIENDS YOU CRANE AT TE FRONT LINE OF DEFENCE BODEN HAS SAID IF RUSSIA ONCE RUSSIA TAKES YOU CRANE POLAND AND THE BALTIC SURNEXT THAT'S A WORLD WAR WHERE TRYINE TOU FOR THAT WAR LOOK AT WHAT PUDN DED TO DAY HE KILLED FORGOSIM WHEN I WAS AT THE YOU ED THE RUSSIAN BASTER SUDDENLY DIED THIS GUY IS THA MURDER AND YOU WARE CHOOSING A MURDERR I E  TE CRE ON THE TEEN THE LOCK HEED AN RAD THEI NIN THE TA TE THE A EO RA YON AND YOU IN OIN TE O TA A GAN RIN I IS LI DAD YOU BEN PUSHTIN IS LI ALLWE WAN Y GO AND DE FIND DIS  YOU WAN GEN E AN U TA ON TAT YOU O  OIN YI O  TEN  O A THING YOU A NO OR O THING VER TAN IN SHAN YOU KNOW WAT IA KASE SOF THIS WAS HALEY'S BEST MOMEN OF TD BAY BY FAR IT WAS A VERY WEAK MOMENT FOR E VAGE I HAVE THE REASON IS HIS COME BACK RIGHT THERE RIGHT WHICH IS I WISH YOU WELL ON YOUR FUTURE CAREER ON THE BOARDS OF LOCKING RATHYON AGAIN THAT APPEALS TO THAT TRUMP ADJASENT CROWD WHO BELIEVES THAT ALL AMERICAN FORN POLICY AS RUN BY THE MILITARY ANS USTRIAL COMPLEX PERHAPS BUT THT IS A REALLY BASELESS INSULT AND AGAIN I GO BACK TO IF YOU'RE GOING TO HIT SOMEBODY HIT SOMEBDY FOR WAT THERE WAS WHEN HE HITS CHRISTY AND HE SAYS YOU WERE HUNGNG OBAMA TRUE IF HE'S GON TO HIT SOMEBODY ELSE ON THE STAGE FOR DOING A THING THEY DID O K BUT INSULTING ALL OF YOUR OPPONENTS AS TOOLS OF THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX THAT ANY EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT IS REALLY REALLY ABSURD AND AND NICKY HAY LAGHING HANDLED HERSELF REALLY WELL RIGHT THERE IT SO THE REST OF THE DEBATE WAS EFFECTIVELY MORE OF THE STAGE AND SO THIS BRINGS US TOO SORT OF MY PERSONAL GRADEON THAN WILL SEE LAKE WHAT HOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY DID SO LET'S START WITH HO GOT THE MOST SPEAKING TIME THE PROMISE YOU MAKE  CANDIDTES ON THE TAGE DEFINITELY SHULD NOT BEN THIS MANY CANDIDATES ON THE STAGE SO BURGHAM AND HUTCHIN SON TOK UP FIFTEEN MINUTS OF TIME THEY SOULDNHAE BEN ON THE TAGE TIM SCOTT WAS ON STAGE FOR EIGHT MINUTES BUT REALLY WAS ABSENT SO NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LI TWENTY THREE TWENTY FORMENTS OF TIME THAT REALLY WAS DISTRIBUTED POORLY THERE THE REAL PEOPLE WHO SHOUD HE BEN ON THE STAGE THE OR ARE THE ARE THE TOP FIVE PEOPLE IN FROM TO TIME PENCE ROMASUAMY CHRISTY DSANTUS HALY BY EVERYBODY ELSE IN IN THE STAGE IS BASICALLY AND ALSO RAN AT THIS POINT NOW REIGNOING THELEPHANT OUTSIDE THE ROOM WICH OF COURSE IS TRUMP WHICH MAYMEAN THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE OFF SO RAN'S BUT IN TERMS WHO GOT MOST TIME PENCE GOT THE MOST TIME WHICH  MAKE SOME SENSE IN THAT HE IS THE PERSON WHO HAS DONE PRECIDENTIAL DEMATES BEFORE LIKE THE MOST OF ANY OF THESE PEOPLE VEVAKE BECAUSE WHO'S A LIGHTNING ROD GOT THE SECOND MOST TIME FOLLOWED BY CHRISTY CHRISTY ALSO WANTETS YOU SOME LIGHTNING RODSTUFF THE SANTIS GOT THE FOURTH MAUNTIME HALY ACTUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT MINUTES ON FORTY ON SECONDS BUT SHE MADE HIM COUNT SO HOW DOS THAT STACK UP IN FRM IS MY PERSONAL GRATE SO I THOUGHT THO SANTUS WAS FINE I THOUGHT HE WAS SOLID I THOUGHT THAT HE HE BASICLLY LAID OUT HIS RECORD HE STAYED OUT OF SCRAPS I THINK THAT HIS ANSWER ON YOU CRANE WAS A LITTLE BIT BUT FUDDLED BUT I THINK OTHER THAN THAT TO SANTOS TID O K RIGHT IT WAS FINE I WOULD GRATE HIM LIKE A BEE I'D GIVE NICKEY HALEIAN E I THINK SHE ACCOMPLISHED FOR PURPOSES I THIN SHE DID TOWNE OF VERY SHORT AMOUT OF TIME I THINK SHE REALLY SUR PASET EXPECTATIONS FOR NEARLY EVERYBODY WHO WATCHD THE DEBATE EVEN YOE DON'T LIKE NIKEY HEU HAVE TO SEE THAT SHE ACTUALLY DID BETTER THAN YOU EXPECTED OR TO DO I YGI'VE SAW A TIMSCOTA SEE I WHO'S BASELY NOT PRESEN FOR ANY OF THIS FOR PENCE I SAY YO PROBABLY GIVE HIM A B BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THEN TO SANTUS A BE BECAUSE HE'S JUST IN AN UNWINNABLE SITUATION AN HE TOOD UP FOR HIMSELF I THOUGHT ACTUALLY RATHER WELL ON JANUARY SIXTH I THOUGH THAT WAS WORTH WHILE HE'S NOT CAN A GAIN ANY MOMENTUM FROM IT WILL GET TO THAT MOMENT AND AS FOR CHRISTY I'D SAY THAT TT THAT WAS LIKE A BE CRISTY PER FORMANCE IN A CRISTY PER FORMANCE E HE'S ALWAYS GING TO GET THE PUNCH IS IN BUT HE HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THE CHARM THAT HE ONCE HAD IN LIKE TWENTY ELEVEN SO NOW HE JUS THE PUNCHING MACHINE SO BE ISABOUT THEVESTY CAN DO AS FOR THE VAKUE THE VAKE IS VERY HARD GRAVE BECAUSE THE VAKE IS THE TOTAL ROSHAMON CANDIDATE YOU LOOK AT THE VAKE ON THE STAGE AND FOR ME IF I'M IF I'M ASSESSING HOW HE DID BASED ON SORT OF WHAT'S HE TELLING THE TRUTH I THOUGHT A LOT OF TI'M NOT OR BASED ON WERE HIS WHERE HIS ATTACKS ON OTHER CANDIDATES ROOTED IN THEIR ACTUAL RECORD ON WHAT THEY DID NO MANY TIMES A OR F YOURE BASING IT ON LIKE HIS POLICY I THINK HE'S WRONG ON SOME OF HIS POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS HAVING SOME OF HE STUFF HE SAYS ABOUT FORM POLICY IN PARTICULAR IS JUST NOT TRUE OR WITHIN THE REALM OF REALITY WHEN HE SAYS A IL I'LL START WITH DRAWING AID FROM ISRAL EXUM O CREEBE PIECE OF MIDDALEAST BETWEEN LIKE COTAR AND OMON IN ISRAEL LIKE  COTAR AND OMON ARE PROERON LIKE TAT THAT THAT JUST BETRAYSN NOT A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT H MAT A LEAST AND ON IS RECORD RIGHT BUT BUT IF YOU ARE TALKING BOUT LIKE THE INTRNAT CULTURE IF YOU'RE TOGUE WAT THE MEM CULTURE IF YOU'RE TALKING OUT WHO HAD ENERGY ON THE TAGE YOU'RETNGUE BOUT THE GUY WHO AS SAYING THE THINGS NOBODY ELSE WILL SAY WHICH IS ONE WAY THAT WE HAVE NOW LEARNED TO GAGE POLITICS IS WILL HE SAY THE THING NO ONE LSEWUD NOW I'M OF THE VIEW AND I'E ALWAYS SAID THIS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING POLITICALLY IN CORRECT IN SAYING THE THING THAT MUST BE SAD THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL SAY AND JUST SAYING THE THING NO ONE ELSE WILL SAY BUT THAT DISTINCTION 'S BEN COMPLETELY OBLITERATOR F OF COURSE THE LAST TEN YERS OR IFYOU JUST SAY A THING THAT IS VOR BOTON THEN THIS MEANS THAT YOU ARE BRAVE BY THAT METRIC FO VKE KICKED ASS BY THAT METRIC THE VAKTED GRAVE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE REFLECTED O KAS SO LET'S LOOK AT THESE DEBATE RESULTS THROUGH THAT LIGHT WHO HAS MOMENTUM COMING OUT O THE SPAKE THAT'S REALLY ALL THAT MATTERS RIGHT THREE DAYS RON OUND NOBODYS GON AMEMIS TOBATE THERE THERE'S NO LASTIN IN PACK BUT DID ANYBODY GET MOMENTUM HERE DID ANYBODY GET MOMENTUM SO I GRATED PEOPLE BASED ON WHETHER THEY HAVE LIKE STRONG UPPWER MOMENTUM IN EASH LANE SUM UP ER MOMENTUM SAME DOWN WAR MOMENTUM ORE LIKE REALLY DOWNWARD MOMENTUM SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK OF THIS CHART WHAT'S LOOKET Y TOF TESE CANDIDATES SO RONASSAN SAYS AGAIN HIS GOLD HERE WAS SURVIVE A WHICH AS WHOUP HOL THIS DEBATE AFFECTS TO SANTIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY UP TO WHAT TO SANTUS DOES NEXT ON THE YOU LOST GROUND ON THEE GANE GROUND WITH ANY GROUP HE WAS BASELY THE SAME WITH EVERY GROUP GOING IN AS HE WAS COMING OUT DOES HE HAVE ANY MOMENTUM INSIDE ANY LANE TO ONE OF THE THERE TWO WAYS THEACAN GAIN MOMENTUM THEY'RE TOO WAYS THE INGIN MOMENTUM IN O PRESIDENTIAL RACE WONE HES TOU GAIN OVER ALL MOMENT LIKE NATIONAL MO MENTBIG NATIONALMENTUM BCAUS YOU'RE DOING GRAT AN LIKE MULTIBLE GROUPS AND THEN THERE IS THE DO YOU HAVE MOMENTU INSIDE ONE LANE THIS CANNACTION MU A LOT SE YOUCOOD ACTION NOT TOO GREAT IN A DEBATE BUT IF YOU REALLY LOCK UP A LANE YOU'RE MOMENTUM IN THAT LANE THAT LANE IS NOW GOING TO START GENERATING SOME UP TICKIN NATIONALMU MAY NOT BE HUGE MO BEAN UP TOC A NATIONAL NUMBERS HO CAN BUILD OFF OF THAT SO LANE MOMENTUM IS SOMETHING YOU WANT COMING OUT OF THE DEBATE IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE LANES YOU WANT MOMENTUM THE SANTUS DOES HE HAVE ANY LANE MOMENTUM NO COMING OUT OF THIS DEBATE CAN HE BUILD IT SURE SO BASICALLY IT'S STATISQUO ANTE FOR TO SANTUS IT'S AS THOUGH THE DEBATE NEVER HAPPEN FOR T IS SANTUS FORVAVAKE THE VAKE HAD SOME MOMENTUM AMONG TRUMPERS THE THING ABOUT THE VAKE IS THAT NO ONE REALLY HAS MOMENTUM AMONG TRUMPERS BECAUSE TRUMP HAS TRUMPERS RAMINE THEY'RE LOCKED UP AMONG THE TRADITIONAL GEOPE OUT TAY THE VAVAKE WHAS CAN OF THE SAME IS BEFORE THE TRADITIONAL GOPED NOT SUPERFONT OF AKE MAYBE HAS SOME NEGATIVE MOMENTUM FRUM IT BUT CERTAINLY 'S NOT PICKING UP GROUND AMONG SORT OF THE TRADITIONAL GEOPE THREE LEGGED STOOL CROWD WITH HE NEVER TRUMPLING OFTHE PARTY HE HAD SERIOUS NEGATIVE MOMENTUM BUT AGAIN HE WAS NOT GONG TO WIN TOSE PEOPLE ANYWAY HE WAS HIMMING FOR ONE LANE AND ONE LANE ONLY THAT IS THAT FIFTEEN PER CENT ROR TRUMPETJASON HE HAS STRONG MOMENT AMONG THOSE PEOPLE SO THAT MEANS THAT HIS UPWER BOUNDARY TEVAKES UPWARD BOUNDARY IN THIS REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IS PROBALY ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT HE'S CHISELING THAT AWAY FRUM THE SANTUS RIGHT THAT SO HE ACHIEVE HIS GOAL WHICH OAS STRONG UPWARD MOMENTUM INSIDE THAT ONE LANE WHICH CREDIT TO HIM HE ACHIEVED THAT GOAL AND HE MADE HIMSELF MORE FA NATIONAL LANE WHICH WAS HIS GOAL IN THIS RACE IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN HE IS NOT RUNNING FOR PRESDENT AGAINST NONNAL TRUMP THE WAY I KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP NOSES HE'S NOT RUNG FOR PRESENT AGAINST NONNAL TRUMP WHICH IS WY DONNAL TRUMP HIS NOT ATTACKED HIM EVERY ONE WHO GOES AFTER TRUMP WHO'S PROCEEDS THE THREAT TRUMP IS ATTACKED THE'S ONLY ONE CANDIATE IN THIS RACE WHO'S HE SERIOUS CANDIDATE OR PROCEEDS THE SERIOUS CANDIDATE WHO HAS NOT BEEN A TACK BY TONAL TRUMP ANDTHAT'S TE VAKE O AK MIKE PENTE HE COMES AWAY WITH NEGATIVE OMENTUM FROM THE TRUMPERS BECAUSE AGAIN TRUMMED UNLIKE UM AMONG THE TRADITIONAL GEOPE HE CAM WEAR THE LUBIT OF UPWARD MOMENTUM HE CAME AWAY WITH SUM LIBERAL WING MOMENTUM LIKH SOME NEVER TRUMP MOMENTUM LITTLE BIT BUT DOES HE HAVE LIC OVER ALL LANE MOMENTUM LIKE LIKE STRONG LANE MOMENTUM AND THE WAYM MEASURING LANE MOMENTUM IS BASICALLY D' YOUHAVE A TOO IN ANY CATEGORY RIGHT DOD YOU HAVE STRONG MOMENTUM IN ANY ONE LANE NOTHING MINOR ENTS LIKE BIG MOMENTUM AN ANY ONE LANE SO NO FOR PENC HE'D AKE COMES AWAY BASICALY THE SAME HE WAS BEFORE A PERSON WHY I KNOW MY PENT I THINKE'S AN HONORABLE HUMAN BEING AN HONORABLE PERSON WHO'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE I THIS RACE NICKEY HALEY SHE IS BASICLY WERSIHROES BEFORE HIM WITH TRUMPERS IN THE TRADITIONAL EOPE LANE SHE HAS STRUNG LOMENTUM RIT THATS A BIT WAS VERY GOOD FOR NICKEY HALEY AMONG THE TRADITIONAL GEOPE LANE AND YOU COULD START LOCKING UP SOME DOWNERS SHE COULD BE SEEN AS AN ALTERNIVE TO TIM SCOTT YOUCOULDSEE A LOT OF PEOPLE TURNING AWAY FROM SCOT AND MOVING THE MONEY OVER TO NICKY HALEY FOR EXAMPLE ARE TURNING AWAY FROM MY PENSE AND MOVING OVER NICKEY HALEY I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF NICKY HALEY'S CAMPANE SARTS TO MOVE FROM YOUR TWO PER SENT NATIONALLY TOWARD THAT SEVEN O EIGHT PER CENT NATIONALLY IF YOU LOOK AT AT TIMSCOT AGAIN I THINK HE ENDED UP BASICLLY WHER HE WAS BEFOREHAND EVERY CAN ELIKES THE GABINOW NOS WAYS HERE AND HAS FOR CHRIS CRISTY HE HAS SOME LANEMOMENTUM WITH THE NEVER TRUMPLING WHICH IS STRONG NEW HAMPSIRE SO DID EVERYBODY SORT OF ACHIEVE THEIR GOLL THE ANSWER IS YES IS THIS CON MAKE LIKE AN OVERALL DIFFRENCE AGAINST TRUMP THE ANSWER'S ABSOLUTELY NOT BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TE OVER ALL A THE OVER ALL SORT OF TAKE AWAY FRUM THE RACE TRUMP STILL HAS ALL THE MOMENTUM WITH THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE TRUMP AND THE TRUMP ADJACENT WNG NOBODY IS TAKING HIM AT AWAY FROM HIM IN THE TRUMP ADJACENT WING IF YOU WISHED IN ORDER TO BEAT TRUMP A SOOME HE HAS THIRTY PER CENT LOCKED UP ABSOLUTLY LOCKED UP AND ASSUME THERE'S ANOTHER FORTY PER CENT THAT IS THAT IS PLAYABLE AND RIGHT NOW THAT SPLITTING TWENTY PER CENT TRUMP TWENTY PER CENT EVERYBODY ELSE AND THEN HERE'S ANEVER TRUMPLING THIS LIKE TWENTY PER CENT SO THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO STACK UP HOW TO BEAT TRUMPRIGHT NOW YOU AVE TO ASSUME TRUMP HAS THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE BOAT LOCKED UP THEN YOU HAVE THE  TRADITIONAL CIOPE WING WHICH HE IS SPLITTING LIKE HALF WITH THE REST OF THE PARTY WHICH MEANS THAT HE'S ALREDY AT FORTY CEVEN PER CENT AND THAT'S LEAVINGSIDE THE TWENTY PER CENT TROR TRUMP ADJACENT SO AN ORDER TO BEAT TRUMP YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO WIND ALL THE NEVER TRUMPLING YOU'VETHOMG AN ALL OF THE TRMP ADJACENT WING AND YOU AVE TO SPLIT THE TRUMP GIOPE VOTE OR YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF THE TRADITIONAL TRUMP IOPEEVOT AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE LIKE FIVE PER CENT OF THETRUMP ADJACENT WING WHO CAN CANSOLIDATE THAT YOUN SEE WHI TRUMP HAS THIS VERY VERY SOLID LEAD WHO EXACTLY CAN CONSOLIDATE THAT SORT OF MATH RIGHT NOW ALL OF THESE LANES ARE SPLIT AND TRUMP HAS A FOOT IN AT LEAST THREE OF THEM IS THERE AN NEARD COTHER CANDIDATE WHO HAS A FOOT IN THREE OF THESE LANES THE ANSWER IS NO THERE'S NOT A SINGLE CANDIDWHO HAS A FOOT IN THREE OF THESE WINS EXCEPT FOR TO CANTUS WHICH I'S WHY TO SANTUS IS STILL THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BE SHOT OF BEATING TRUMP IN A PRIMARY BUTY'S CAN HAVE TO SHOW SOME MOMENTUM COMING OUT OF THIS DEBATE BECAUSE THE MAF JUST NONE WORK ALL THAT WELL FOR ANYBODY WHO IS NOT NAME TRUMP UM MEANWHILE DON TRUMP ASSESS THIS DEBATE IN HIS OWN WAY AS YOU 'D PEDICT HE'S BIG FAN OF ROMAS WOBBY WHICH DEMONSTRATES ONCE AGAIN THAT HEIS NOT RUNNING AGAIN TROMASWAMMIN NORS THE BAKE RUNNING AGAINST HIM YE AT ONE POINT TWEETED OUT THIS ANSWER GAVE THE BAKE A BIG WIN IN THE DEBAPE HE'S OF A THING CALLED TO ROOTH THANK YOU THE BAKE THAT WOULD BE WITH REGARD TO THE BAKE EXPLAIND HA HE WAS THE BEST PRESIDENT OF THE TWENTY FIR CENTURY OF COURSE AGAIN TRUMP I THINK AT ABRYGOD TIME PROBABLY WATCHING THEDEBATE YA HE HE WAS ATTACKING CRISS CRISTY HE WAS A ATTACKING NICKEY HAYLEE LITTLE BIT HE WENT AFTER FOR SURE THE SANTIS BUT OVER ALL NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED THE DEBATE THAT THAT I THINK SHOOK TRUMPS LEAD MEANWHILE TRUMP SORY GETS WER WERE COMPLAINING THT THEY WERE BLOCKED FROM THE SPIN ROOMHICH THEY SHOULD BE BLOCKE FROM THE SPIN ROM IF YOUR CANDIDATE DOESN'T SHOP FOR THER BATE YOU DON'T GET TO GO TO THE SPIN ROOM AND THEN JABER ABOUT THE OTHER CANDIDATES CEN REDICULOUS M BUT T HERE IS A TONJUNOR COMPLAINING ABOUT LAST NIGHT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO BIN PEOPLE FROM ACTION WY HAVING JUST

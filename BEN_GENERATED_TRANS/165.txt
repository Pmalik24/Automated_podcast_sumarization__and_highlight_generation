NO IDEA HOW MANY KIDS O ARMISIN I THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THOUGH HE WAS ON DICATION HE WAS IN REHUBOF BEACH DELAWARE AND HERE IS HOW THE RULES OF POLITICS WORK GAN IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT AND MAJOR NATURAL DISASTER HAPPENS ON YOUR WATCH AND YOUARE APPARENTLY NOT WITHIN I SHOT OF THE THING THEN WE SAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE EMPATHY AND THAT YOU ARE VERY VERY BAD THIS WAS TRUE OF GEORGE JOBY BUSHRANN CAME TO HRRICANE CATRINA ITAS TRUE OF TAD CRUWS WHEN IT CAME TO FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN TACAS AND APPARENTLY IT IS NOT TRUE IF YOU 'RE DEMOCRAT IF YOUARE DEMOCRAT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTS JOBIDON WHEN ON VACATION REHUBBITH BEACHTOLLAWAR HE WAS AS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DEATH TOLD IN LAHEINA AND HE SAID NO COMMENT AND THEN HE WRODE ROUND ON HIS BITE AND HE HADS HIMICE CREAM AN HE SAT ON THE BEACH LIKE A WEEK AND THEN HE WENT TO LAKE TOHO IN NEVATA AND DOM HE SAT THERE AT THE MANSION OF A MAJOR DOWNER AND THEN HE TOOK THE TROUBLE TO FINALLY FLY TO MALLI NOW YOU WOULD IMAGIN THIS IS WHEN THE FAME JOBIDEN EPITHYU WOULD MAKE ITS APPEARANCE HE HEARS THE THING ABOUT JOBIDON HE'S NOT EMPATHETIC JOBIDEN IS A VERY SELFISH CREATURE IF YOU LOOK AT JOBIDON'STE ENTIRE LIFE HISTORY WHAT YOU SEE IS THA JOBIDON KARS CHIEFLY ABOUT HIMSELF AND ALSO ABOUT PEOPLE IN HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILIAL CIRCLE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO USE HIS POWER IN ORDER TO CORRUPTLY ENRICH ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE INCLUDING HIMSELF HE DOES NOT SEE POLITICAL POWER AS WAIT TO QUOTIN WOULD HELP THE LITTLE GUY AS HE PRETENDS HE SES AWAY TO HELP HIM IN HIS FAMILY AND H PEOPLE HE IS MOST CLOSE TO AND IF THAT MEANS DENYING THE FAMILY NAME TO LIKE A FOUR YEAR OLD HE'LL DO THAT TO BUT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO GET AHEAD BECAUSE THE MEDIA HVE BEENABLE TO SHIELD HIM BASED ON THIS FO SUPPOSEDLY ROGUISH CHARM THAT JOBIDON ONCE HAD NA I'VE NEVER SEEN IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONMAN FIND JOBINE CHARMING BUT THIS WAS THE LI ABOUT JOBIDON FOR FOUR DECKATES WHEN IN REALITY HE'S JUST WAERS FILLED WITH WITH BOLDLY I MEAN THAT THAT IS WHAT JOBIDEN IS IT THE PROMMIS THAT AS HE GET TOLD HER ALL OF THE LAYER IS OF CHARM ARE WORN AWAY THERE'S NOTHING LEFT A BUNCH OF THE EXCEPT A BUNCH OF FALSE OLD FAMILY STORIES THAT HE TROTS OUT AND WOOVE EMPATHY AND TREALLY QUITE UGLY WHEN YOU SEE IT IT'S REALLY UGLY THE FIRST TIME HE WENT TO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE IN THE PERSON HAD DIED A SOLDIER A DIED AND HE TALKS ABOUT BEAU THE FIRST TIME HE DID THAT HE GOT LOBUT A SYMPATHY FOR HIM AND THEN AFTER HE DID IT TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE SIMPATHY STARTED TO WEAR AWAYE WELL THIS TIME HE WAS VISITING LHENA AND HE PROCEEDED TO TELL A STORY ABOUT HOW HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LOSE A HOME HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST AS I' SAID BEFORE EXPLAIN HOW MORNING WORKS IN THE JERISH COMMUNITY WE

TALK ABOUT THE PERSON WHO DIED AND THE FIRST RULE IF YOU AREY PERSON WHO IS VISITING A THE HOUSE O MORNING IS KEEPIN MOUTSHOT YOU DON'T GO AND TALK ABOUT ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES BECAUSE THAT'S AWFUL AND SELFISH IT'SUCH HE NOT EMPATHETIC IF YOU WALK INTO THE HOUSE OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS DIED AND YOU START TALK ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT'S LIKE HOW THEY FEEL BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAD SOMEBONY WHO DIED THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY ARROGANT AND SELFISH THING TO DO ITS LIKE THE FIRST RULE OF VISITING A HOUSE OF MORNING LITERALLY THE FIRST RULE JOBIDON BRICKS THAT RULE HE DOES IT EARLY HE

OFFERING HIM WATER GETIN NO TI  MY GOODNESS MY GOODNESS WHAT A COUNTRY WE'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES MAN WE MEANT WE ENT WE MAKE GREAT POLITICAL CHOICES IN THIS COUNTRY WE REALLY REALLY DO WELL MEANWHILE THE DEMOCRAT'S A MEDYA THEY HAVE FOUND THEIRE ANGLE ON THE HOWYWILE FIRE IT IS NOT THE INCOMPETENCE OF ALL THE LOCAL OFFICIALS THEIR DEMOCRATS WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THEI'R WILD IN COMPETENCE THIS BY THE WAY IS TRUE EVERY TIME THERE'S A NATURAL DISASTER THAT STRIKES A LEFT EN AREA THE COUNTRY IF HURRICANE CATRINA HITS NEW ORLEANS AND THE MAYOR THERE I'S JUST ABSOLTE IIS RANAGAN AND HE'S THE WORST MAYOR IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE BI BECAUSE I CRAPPY MAYOR AND THE GOVERNOR IS ALSO I DEMOCRAT WEL THN YOU BLAME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND FEMA OBVIOUSLY IF YOU ARE A  GOVERNOR IN A NORTH EASTERN STATE AN A HURRICANE WIPES THROUGH YOUR STATE AND FLOODS THE PLACE THEN YOU BLAME CLIMATE CHANGE AND IF YOU ARE IN HAWI YOU DON'T BLAME THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CHIEF HO APPARENTLY DID NOT SOUND EMERGENCY CIRANS AS WILD FIRES NEARE LAHINA WE DON'T BLAME HIM WE DON'T BLAME MANY THE PEOPLE WERE IN CHARGE OF WATER MANAGEMENT AND CONCERVATION IN A HOWI WE DON'T BLAME ANY OF THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHO LEFT O MUNCH IT RY GRASS OUT THERE TO BURN AT EXTRORDINARY HEAT AND SPEED WE DO'T BLAME MANY THOSE PEOPLE OF COURSE WE BLAME CLIMATECHANGE NOW THE REALITY IS THEN VIRTUALLY ALL F THESE CIRCUMSTANTES WHEN IT COMES TO WILD FIRES WHEN IT COMES TO HURRICANES WHEN IT COMES TO FIRTUALLY ANY NATURAL DISASTER THEY'RE TWO ISSUES ONE IS THE ACTURAL NATURAL DISASTER THE SIZENSCOPE OF IT AND THE OTHER IS HOW THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS BUILT THE PLACE HOW PUBLIC OFFICIALS EXACERBATED OR MITIGATED THE PROBLEM THIS IS TRUE PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE IF THIS IS WHY IN EARTHQUAG OF FIVE MAGNETUE WILL HIT ARON AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE BUT AN EARTHQUAKE OF FIVE MAGNETUBIL HIT CALIFORNIA AND NOBODY WILL DIE BECAUSE THE BILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA ARE BUILT BETTER THAN TH BUILDINGS AN ROD IT'S A PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACTUALLY MATTER AN AWFUL LOT IN'STRMENS OF THE REGULATIONS IN TROMS OF THE RESPONSE ALL THAT STUFF MATTERS EXTRAORDINARILY WHEN A COMES TO PARTICULARLY NASTURAL DISASTLICT IS THE ONE THING THEY HAVE TO BE PRETTY GOOD AT WHEN HLIY THE RE RALLY BAT AT IT WHICH IS WIV THOUSAD PEOPLE DIDE THE CHIEF PERMANANTIAH SUBMITTED HIS RESIGNATION CITING HEALTH REASONS GOING COUNTY OFFICIALS A DAY EARLIER TO NEWS CONFERENCE ANTIAH DEFENDED TE DECISION NOT TO ACTUVATE THE SIRENS SAYING THE OUT DOOR ALARMS OUR PRIGT ARE YOUS PRIMARILY FOR TUNAMIS OH NOT OF HELP PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRAIN TO SEE HIGHER GROUND WHEN THEY HEAR THE CIREN WELL I MEAN EVERYBODY WOULD ELEASE LOOKED AROUNDING ON OD CRAP A GIANT FIRE COMING DOWN THE HILL SO HIS RESIGNATION WAS ACCEPTED AGAIN THIS FOLLOWS HARD ON THE FACT THAT WE WE NOW KNOW THAT THE WATER WAS NOT RELEASED T TO THE AREA UNTIL TOO LATE BUT AS WE SAY WHEN IT COMES TO ME THA NARRATIVE SOMEBODY ELSE HOUSE TO BE PLAMES IT CAN'T BE THE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC OFFICIALS THAT CANNOT BE ALLOWED AND CAN'T BE THE PRESIDENT FOR A LACK LUSTA RESPONSE OR NO COMMATE WHILE HE SITS ON REHUBOTH BEACH WE CAN'T BE THAT IT MUST BE CLIMATE CHANGE SO THIS IS THE NARRATIVE THEIR GONAGOWATH WHY GOVERNOR JOSH CRENE WHO IS THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHERE THESICART IS IS CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE REAL PROBEM HERE WHEN YOUR TIEANT GLO BILL WARMEN ARE YOU SYING THAT CLIM AT CHANGED AMPLIFIED THE COST OF HUMAN ERROR YES IT DID A THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DUE TO SAVE LIVES FROM THE FIRE FIGHTERS FROM CITIZENS AND IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE THAT I'M SURE AREN'T PERFECT IN THE MOMENT A AND BUT WHEN YOU HAVE FIRE THAT MOVED MORE THAN A MILE A MINUTE AND WHAT HAPPENED I'M TOLD BY SOME OF THE SURVIVERS THEY WERE AT THE INITIAL FIRE IT WAS PUT OUT SOME TIME LATE THE AFTERNOON IN LINA AND THEN THE FIRE FIGHTERS HAD TO GO TO THREE OTHER FIRES HAD STARTED BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS WHEN THEY LEFT THE FIRE STIRRED UP AGAIN AND THEN WHEN THE STORM WINDS FROM DORA WHICH WERE THAT STROWN SWEPT IT OUT IT JUST DESTROYED EVERYTHING IT IS THE CLIMATE CHANGE YOU SEE IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGINGS TUT THE EARTH GRADUALLY WARMING OFER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS OR SO HOI SENT OUR BRAN SHATSY TO THE SAMING TACT SAYS IT IS THE NEW NORMAL OF THE NEW NORMALIS A THOUSAND PEOPLE LING IN LINE APPARENTLY SEN WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT SPECIFIC LESSENS ARE THAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM THIS TO MAKE SURE A TRAGEDY OF THIS LEVEL DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN WELL I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT A SEVERE WHETHER VANS ARE GOING TO GET MORE FREQUENT AND MORE SEVERE I'M OWHY IS THA PLACE IM THAT IS EXPERIENCED VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND SENOMIS AND HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS AND WE'VE HOD A FEW WILD FIRES BUT NOTHING THAT A THREATENED AA WHOLE CITY AM NOTHING THAT FLATTEN THE WHOLE CITY AND I JUST THINK THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL FOR NOT JUST THE STATE OF WY BUT FOR THE WHOLE PLATTER FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO THIS I THE NEW NORMAL DISES IS JUST CITY'S GETTING FLATTENED BY WILDFIRES J INSLEY THE GOVERNOR OF WASHINGTON WHO'S BEEN BIG ON THE CARMAN LIMITATION BAND WAGON FOR YEARS NOW HE TOD THE EXACT SAME THING HES AYS WELL THAT THE BIG ISSUES WE NEED TO E CARBONIZE YET YOU NEED TO STOP DRIVING THAT CAR OF YOURS IS THE REAL IT THERE'S A GONWILE FIGHT THAT KILED

GET A DISASTER NO ONE THING MAKES IT HAPPEN THE LINKS BETWEEN HUMAN CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE IN FIRES ARE WELL ESTABLISH BECAUSE GLOBALL WARMING MEANS PLANTS CAN MORE EASILY DRY OUT BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER ISSUE WHICH IS THAT IN HOWYE IT'S ALSO MEANT MORE RAIN AH THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S TAPPENED IS INCREASED HUMIDITY IN HOWIE SOME IMMEDIATE ANALSIS TH WINDS OBSERVED IN HHY HE HAVE FOUND DORS PRESENTE MAY HAVE ONLY INCREASE THE GOSS SPEED BY ABOUT FIVE MILES PER HOUR WHICH IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED YEAR THE HURRICANE AND ITS INTENSITY WERE CERTAINLY NOT THE MAN EFFECT FUELING THE FIRES AS FOR THE TROUGT CONDITIONS THAT COVERED MORE THAN A THIRD OF MALLY COUNTY WHERE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES BURN THERE'S NOTE TERECT SINE THEIR PRODUCT OF CLIMATE CHANGE SAID ABBEY FRASER AN IF FILEAET FACULTY MEMBER A UNIVERSITY OF HAWI WHY THERE'S A LONG TRM TREN OF THE CLIMING PRECIPITATION HOWY THERE ISN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST HIS THE PRODUCTIVE ANYTHING BESIDE NORMAL CLIMATE PATTERS AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PACIFIC SHE SAID PRECIPITATION PATTERNS THERE ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCE BY ELNENIO WHICH RETURN IN JUNE AND BY LONGER TRM PATTERN KNOWN AS THE PACIFIC A DECATO OSCILLATION OLENOS  KNOWN FOR BRINGING DRIAR WINTERS WBUT IT'S RIVAL DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE CURRN CONDITIONERS SAID SAID FRASER IN THE SUMMER IT CAN BRING IT MORE PRECIPITATION THAN NORMAL TO NATURAL VERY ABILITY IS JUST REALLY STRONG AN HAWI SO WHAT EXACTLY COST IT WELL I MEAN PART OF IT IS THE FIRE PRONE GRASS AS AN ENVASIVE SPECIES THAN BEEN BROUGHT ON TO THE ISLAND IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR GRAZING SOME OF IT IS FAILURES OF LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS BUT HERE IS THE BEAUTY WHEN YOUR DEMOCRATICALOCAL OFFICIAL YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE THE MEDIA AVAILABLE TO EXPLAIN AWAY YOUR PROBLEMS BY BLAMING

CONTINUE TO CLIME MEANING THE PRICE OF BONDS IS GOING DOWN THAT'S HOW YOU END UP IF THE HIGHER TREASURY YIELDS RIPINGIS THE WAY THAT YIELD WORKS IS THAT IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACIAL PRICE

PEOPLE TO SAY THE SAME STUFF THEY BEN SAYING ON THE CAMPAGN TRAIL AN NATIONALTY THE PLEASE CONTINUE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON A SIX WEEK ABORTION MAN THOW BE WONDERFUL THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE ROODING FOR CASUALTIES IT IS WORTH WHILE NOTING HOW MANY OF THEM ARE PUSHING RIVALS TO GOVERNOR RONDO SANTUS IN FLORIDA THE POLL'S RIGHT NOW SHOW THAT SANTUS IS TRAILING TRUMP BY A WAT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THEN IWA THERE'S LIFE LEFT IN TO SANTUS ACCORDING TO THE LATES PULLING DADE UP IN IWA THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS A DOING SLIGHTLY WORSE IN IWA THAN THEORETICALLY THEY SHOULD BE J AN SELLS ARE THE FANES IWA POLSTER WHO PUT OUT SO NEW NUMBERS IN IWA IT SHOWS THAT TRUMP RIGHT NOW IS A IS AT FORTY THREE PER CENT MEANWHILE THE SANTUSIS IN NINETEEN PER CENT SELLSER SAYS THAT THE FINDING S INDICATE THE RACES CLOSER THAN IT MAD FOR SEAM THAT'S BECAUSE IN THE IEL CAUCUS IS A VODERS SECOND PLACE CHOICE MATTERS IT SO LET' SAY THAT YOU ARE RONDASANTIS YOURE THE FIRST TROICE O NINETEEN PER

AND MEANWHILE THIVID AXEL ROD IS ALSO PROPPING UP THE VAKE ROMASUAMY IGHT T LET'S YEUR TO LETHES THE VAKE IS NOT GOING BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THIS ELECTION CYCLE IN FACT THERE'S AN ARTICLE OUT TO DAY SUGGESTING THAT VEVAKE BASICALLY RAN IN ORDER TO ACTES AS STALKING HORSE FOR TRUMP IS ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM ABISYNEWS ROMASWUAMY TWO DONERS ITCHED HIMSELF TH CANDIDA WHO COULD MAKE SERIOUS WAVES IN THERE PUBLICAN PRIMARY TO MEETING WHEN MET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM ROMASWAMMY ARGUED HIS CANDIDAS HE COULD ALSO DISWAYE TO GOVERNOR TANCES FROM ENTERING THE RAYES IN THE LEAD UP TO HIS ANNOUNCEMENT ROMASWAM WOULD TELL SEVERAL OTHER CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIS HE BELIEVE TAT IF HE RAN IT COULDN STOP TO SANTUS FROM RUNNING OR IMPACT HIS VIABILITY AS CANDIDATE IF HE DID ENTER THE RACE A I IT

CULTUR WORRIER THAN THE SANTUS HIMSELF AND AN YOU KNOW GOING AF TER THE THE WOK ANSO ON HE'S JUST BEEN MUCH MORE COMPELLING HAV IT T JUST AGAIN DEMOCRATS ARE PROPING UP THE VAKE MEANWHILE BY THE WAY

THE MENSHPARASHOSPONSIBY EXPRESS V P N MAKE SHURE TO PROTECT OURSELF AGAINST BIG TECT PROTECT OR DATA AT EXPRESSYPIANDICOM FLESHMEN SO IT SEEMS THAT THE CHANCES OF CIVIL WARN AMERICAGUST ROSE SOMEWHAT DRAMATICALLY ON TUESDAY EVENING THE SUPREME CORT OF COLORADO RULED THE PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP HAD TO BE REMOVED FROM THE STATE BALLOT FOR BOTE THE PRIMARIES AND THE GENERAL ELECTION THEY SATIT AMENDMENT FOURTEEN SECTION THREE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES THAT SECTION READS QUOTE NO PERSON SHALL BE A SENATOR OR REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS OR ELECTOR OF PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OR HOLD ANY OFFICE CIVIL OR MILITARY UNDER THE UNITED STATES R UNDER ANY STATE WHO HAVING PREVIOUSLY TAKEN AN OATH AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS OR AS AN OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES OR AS A MEMBER OF ANY STATE LEGISLATURE OR AS AN EXECUTIVE OR JUDITIONAL OFFICER OF ANY STATE TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES SHALL HAVE ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION OR REBELLION AGAINST THE SAME OR GIVEN EIGHT OR COMFORT TO THE ENEMIES THEREOF BUT CONGRESS MAY BY A VOTE OF TWO THIRDS OF EACH HOUSE REMOVE SUCH DISABILITY THAT'S WHAT THE SECTION SAYS THE CAEY S MADE BY THE FOUR THREE COLORADO MAJORITY IN FAVOR OF BARRING PRESIDEND TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT IS SIMPLE THEY SAY TRUMP TRIED TO CONDUCT IN INSURRECTION IN THEIR JUDGHMENT AND THUS CAN BE BARRED FROM THE BALLOT BY THEIR SAY SO THE COURTZ HAYS QUOTE CONGRESS DOES NOT NEED TO PASS IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION FOR SECTION THREES DISQUALIFICATION PROVISION TO ATTACH THEY SAY THAT SECTION THREE IS IN THAT SENTS SELF EXECUTING IN OTHER WORDS SO LONG AS SECTION THREE SAYS IN SURRECTIONISTS ARE DISQUALIFIED FROM OFFICE THIS MEANS THET CONGRESS DOESN'T ACTUALLY NEED TO DEFINE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN INSURRECTIONIS ANY STATE COURT CAN DO THAT WHAT'S MORE THE STATE COURT SAYS THE CONSTITUTION AUTHORIZED TH STATES TO DETERMINE QUOTE THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BECAUSE OTHERWISE STATES WOULD BE UNABLE TO EXCLUDE AT TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD ANON RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR EVEN I FOR A NATIONAL FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY BALLOT IN COLORADO THE COURT SAYS IT IS QUALIFIED TO DETERMINE WHOISE GUILT GIVE INSURRECTION UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WITHOUT ANY CRIMINAL CASE OR ANY IMPEACHMENT CASE OR ANY PIECE OF CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION THE COURT SAYS THAT QUOT THE EVENTS OF JANUARY SIX CONSTITUTED IN INSURRECTION AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ENGAGED IN THAT INSURRECTION THE CURT ALSO CLAIMS WHAT PRESIDENT FRUMS TIRECT AND EXPRESS EFFORTS OVER SEVERAL MONTHS EXORTING HIS SUPPORTERS TO MARCH TO THE CAPITAL TO PREVENT WHAT HE FALSELY CHARACTERIZED AS AN ELLEGED FRAUD ON THE PEOPLE OF THIS CONTRY OR INDISPUTABLY OVERT AND VOLUNTARY MOREOVER THE EVENENCE AMPLY SHOWED THAT PRESIDEND TRUMP UNDERTOOK ALL THESE ACTIONS TO AID AND FURTHER A COMMON UNLAWFUL PURPOS THAT HE HIMSELF CONCEIVED INSAT IN MOTION PREVENTING CONGRESS FROM SERTIFYING THE TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND STOP THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER THIS READING IS TO PUT IT MILDLY INCREDIBLY STRAIND SECTION THREE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WAS DESIGNED TO PROHIBIT THOSE WHO HAD SERVED IN THE CONFEDERACY FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE IN TE UNITED STATES THE CONFEDERACY AS WE KNOW WAS AN ARMED REBELLINGAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES WHICH ENDED IN T DEATHS OF OVER SIX HUNDRED DOWS AN AMERICANS ON BOTH SIDES IT WAS UNCLEAR WHEN THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WAS PASSED WHETHER IT WAS DESIGNED TO APPLY TO ANY FUTURE REBELLION OR INSURRECTION OR HADOT OULD BE DEFINE OR WHETHER WAS EVEN SUPPOSED TO APPLY TO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OR THOSE SEEKING TO QUALIFY AS SUCH THE AMENDMENT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL CAN NINITUAL NOTICE OR EXACTLLY HOW WOULD BE EFFECTUATED BY STATES BY CONGRESS BY SOME OTHER PARTY CART LASH AUTHOR OF THE FOURTEENT AMENDMENT AND PROFESSOR OF LAW AT RICHMONDS SCHOOL OF LAWRIGHTS QUOTE THE AMISSION OF EXPRESS LANGUAGE ON THESE ISSUES IS SIGNIFICANT TBECAUSE PRIOR PUBLICALLY ANNOUNCED TO DRAFTS DID EXPRESSLY APPLI TO PRESENT AND FUTURE ABELLIONS DID EXPRESSLY NAME THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF TH UNITED STATES AND DID EXPRESSLY BAR CERTAIN PERSONS FROM EITHER HOLDING OR QUALIFYING FOR OFFICE WELL WHAT IS ALL THAT MEAN IT MEANS THE VERY LEAST THE AMENDMENT DIDN'T MEAN TO CLEARLY BAR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN FUTURE ELECTIONS WHO TOOK PART IN FUTURE QUO N QUOT INSURRECTIONS MOST IMPORTANTLY THE AMENDMENT IS TOTALLY UNCLEAR ON EXACTLY HOW IT SUPPOSED TO BE EFFECTUATENT REPRESENTATOFE FHADIOUS STEVENS ONE OFTHE MOST RADICAL REPUBLICANS ONE OFTHE GREAT FOUNDERS OF THE ACTUAL FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT SAID THE TAXTS WOULD QUOTE NOT EXECUTE ITSELF THE CONGRESS WOULD HAVE TO PASS LAWS MAKIN CLEAR WHO EXACTLY WAS BARRED FROM OFFICE AND HISTORICALY AS WHAT CONGRESS DID THEY GENERALLY IN FORCETY MECHANISM FOR THIS PROVITION IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO FOR EXAMPLE CONGRESS PASS WHAT WAS CALLED THE AMNESTY ACT WHICH STOOD AWAY WITH PENALTIES ON FORMER CONFEDERATES DUE TO THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND CONGRESS DID PASSALAW IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THAT  MADE IT A CRIME TO QUOTE ASSIST OR ENGAGE IN ANY REBELLION OR INSURRECTION AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES SO PRESUMABLY A CONVICTION FOR SUCH A CRIME WOULD AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFY A CANDIDATE FROM OFFICE UNDER SECTION THREE NOW EVEN IF THE AMENDMENT WERE SELF IFFECTUATING WHICH IT LIKELY IS NOT GIVEN THAT THIS WOULD THEN PREEDE A HUGE INSENTEN FOR STATES TO RANDOMLY DISQUALIFI CANDIATES THEY DON'T LIKE UNDER ITS AUSPECIES IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE THE STATE TO PROVE THAT TROM ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN IN INSURRECTION THE CANCST RANDOMLY TO CLEAR HE ENGAGED IN AN INSURRECTION AS THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE COLORADI SUPREME COURT BRYAN BOT RIGHT SAID IN DESCENT AND EMEMBER ALL SEVENJUCTUES HERE ALL SEVEN JUSTICES OF THE COLORADO SBENCORT REPOINTSD BY DEMOCRATS AND THIS WAS DECIDED FORTHRY THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE COURCE AD QUOTE AGE TIME PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS PRESIDENT PLACE OF BIRTH ALL PARALLEL COR QUALIFICATION ISSUES UNDER COLORADA'S ELECTION COTE CONVERSELY ALL THESE QUESTIONS PALING COMPARISON TO THE COMPLEXITY OF AN ACTION TO DISQUALIFY A CANDIDATE FOR ENGAGING IN INSURRECTION ANOTHER WORDS IF YOU BARRED TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT BECAUSE HE WAS TWENTY EIGT YEARS OLD THAT IS A BRIGHTLINE QUESTION IS HE THIRTY FIVE OR NOT IF YOU BARRED TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT ON THE BASIS IS NOT A CITIZEN THAT'S A BRIGHTLINE QUESTION EITHER HE IS OR HE ISN'T BUT ENGAGING AN INSURRECTION WITHOUT A DEFINITION OF INSURRECTION WITHOUT A CRIMINAL TRIAL WITHOUT ANY SORT OF EVIDENTIARY PROCEEDING WHICH TRUMP COULD ACTUALLY BE A PARTY BARRING TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT WITHOUT AN ACTUAL TRIAL FOR GUILT OR INNOCENS OR EVEN IN ENACTMENT FROM CONGRESS SEEMS TO VIOLATE BASIC DO PROCESS PRINCIPLES AS ANOTHER JUSTICE CARLO SAMOR AGAIN AP POINTO BY DEMOCRAT POINTS OUT IN DE CENT SO MORE RITS QUOTE BASED ON ITS INTERPRETATION OF SECTION THREE ARE COURT SANCTIONS THESE MAKESHIFT PROCEEDINGS EMPLOYED BY THE DISTRICT CORT BELOW WHICH LACKED BASIC DISCOVERY THE ABILITY DICAPPENAND DOCUMENTS AND COMPEL WITNESSES WORKABLE TIME FRAMES TO ADEQUALLY INVESTIGATE AND DEVELOPED DEFENSES AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FAIR TRIAL TOCH JUDICATE A FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIM A COMPLICATED ONE ATAT MASKARATING AS A RUN OF THE MILL STATE ELECTION COTE CLAIM THE CASE IS OBVIOUSLY WRONGLY DECIDED NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE EFFACT IS STAYED UNTIL JANUARY FORTH THAT'S THE DAY BEFORE BALLAT ELIGABILITY HAS TO BE SED IF TRUMP APPEALS WHICH HE IS GOING TO DO OBVIOUSLY THE STATE REMAINS IN A FACT INDEFINITELY UNTIL THE SUPREME COURT DECIDES MATTER OR TURNS AWAY THE RID OF SURCURARY BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT THE POINT IS THAT THE USE OF LAW AFFAIR AGAINST DONALD J TRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED WILL GET TO THAT POINT IN  JUST

THIS COLERADO SUPREME O COURT DECISION IS MASSIVELY DANGEROUS IRRADICALLY UNDERMINES LECTROL INTEGRITY IT CRATES IN AD HOCK WAK FOR POLITICAL OPPONENTS WITHIN EACH STATE TO BAR CANDIDATES THEY DON'T LAK THROUGH REINTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND OF COURSE THIS COLORADO STATE SUPRIME QORRULING IS JUST THE LATEST INTERATION OF WILD AND RADICAL LAW AFFAIR AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW CERTAINLY TRUE THE TRUMP OPEN HIMSELF UP TO THIS LEGAL HELLSTORM WITH HIS ACTIVITIES LEADING UP TO AN ON JANUARY SEX HIS HANDLING OF CLASSFIED MATERIAL AFTER HIS PRESIDENCY OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS ON PLANED EARTH TRUMP HAD TO KNOW THERE IS AN ENORMOUS TARGET ON HIS BACK AND IS ALWAYS YOU CAND OVE IGNORED THATN GUS DID WHATEVER HE WANTED BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THET HE IS NOT BEING TARGETED BY A VARIETY OF PERVERSE METHODS THE LAWAFARE THAT IS NOW BEING TO RECTED AT TRUMP IS EXTRAORDINARY IT IS UNPRECEDENTED TRULY ON PRECEDENTED THESE ARE LEGAL METHODOLOGIES THAT THREATEN THE FUTURE PIECE OF THE REPUBLIC I REALLY MEAN THAT IN VERY SERIOUS WAYS THERE RE CURRENTLY FOUR OUTSTANDING CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST TRUMP THREE OF WHICH ARE ROODED IN BASIC MISINTERPRETATION OF STATUNE AND THE FOURTH OF WHICH CONCERNS MISHANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS A MATTER FOR WHICH TRUMPS FRORM ARRIVAL TILERYCLINTON WAS LEKE COMPLETELY OFF TO HOOK FURTHERMORE THE PROSECUTATE IN TRUMPS JANUARY SIXTH CRIMINAL PROSECUTION HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON DEC THAT WOULD BE SPECIAL COUNCIL JACKSMITH HE IS OPENLY ATTEMPTING TO CRAM THROUGH THAT CRIMINAL TRIAL BUT FORE THE ELECTION SPECIFICALLY IN ORDER TO DAMAGE TRUMPS CHANCES IN THE ELECTION THAT IS LEGITIMATELY THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU ACCELERATE THE TIME LINE INVIOLATION OF THE DESIRES OF THE DEVENCE REMEMBER IT'S THE DEFENDS THAT IS GUARANTEED A SPEEDY TRIAL IT IS THE DEFEND DIDN'T WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL IF THAT DEFENDENT SEEKS TO DELAY THE PROCESS THE ONLY REASON TO QRUNQUT RUSH THE PROCESS BEFORE THE ELECTION AS JACSMITH HAS OPENLY ASKE THE SUPREME COURT TO DO IS IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE SOM CHANGE BEFORE TE ELECTION AS FROM A PROSECURED ANIMA CARTHY RIGHTS QUOTE THE PROSECUTORS PROPOSED SCHEDUL IS DRIVEN BY THE POLITICAL CALENDER NOT LAWIN FORCEMENT IT CONCERNS THE BIDIN JUSTICE DOPARTMENT TOOK NEARLY THREE YEARS TO CHARGE TRUMP EVEN HOUGHTHE FACTS BY THEN WERE WELL ESTABLISH THE INDICTMENT WAS STRATEGICALLY TIME TO SO TRIAL COULD TAKE PLACE DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAN NOT ONLY TO SMITH PUSHD TO FORCE TRUMP TO TRIAL AND JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER SMITH'S ON INVESTIGATORS TO TAKEN YEARS THE PROSECUTOR INDITED N'T WASHINGTON T C ONLY AFTER LOCKING TRUMP INTO ANOTHER COMPLEX CRIMINAL TRIAL IN ANOTHER DISTRICT A THOUSAND MILES AWAY IN SOUTH FLORIDA SO WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN THE SPRIMCOURT IS LIKELY TO STRIKE DOWN THIS DECISION BUT WHAT IS ALLTHIS MEAN IT MEANS THAT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS GOING TO BE TH MOST INSANE AN UGLY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY I TRULY MEAN THAT SO BUCKLE YOUR SEE BELT IT'S GOING TO BE IN EXTRAORDINARILY BUMPY RIDE THAT IS SAYING ALOUGHT SINCE THE YEARS BOTH NINETEEN SIXTY EGT AND TWENTY TWENTY ARE YEARS THAT EXISTED IN TIME ALREADY PARSON USE OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS TO STOPTRUMP HAS CREATED AN NARRATIVE FOR TRUMP THAT EVEN IF HE LOSES HE WILL HAVE BEEN CHEATED AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ENTIRELY WRONG IN FACT TILL BE MORE RIGHT AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAN HE WASN'T TWENTY TWENTY IN FACT IF HE IS BARRED FROM BALLATS IF HIS TRIAL IS EXPEDITED TO EFFECT THE ELECTION HE WILL BE RIGHT THAT HE THAT THE ELECTION HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN CORN QUOT STOLEN FROM HIM EVEN IF HE LOSES MEANWHILE BECAUSE THES SUPPOSEDLY A POLITICAL JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS NOW SIGNED T INTO THIS FIGHT ON BEHALF OF JOBIDAN DEMOCRATS ARE LIKELY TO THINK THAT TRUMP IS JUST NOT MORALLY BUT ALSO LEGALLY BARRED FROM OFFICE AND IF THE SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN THIS COLERAD O SUPREME CORT RULING THAT IS GOING TO COMPLETELY UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COURSE UNLESS SOMEHOW JUSTICE ROBERTS IS ABLE TO CONVINCE A BUNCH OF DEMOCRATIC APPOINTEAS TO JOIN A JUDGEMENT IN WHICH THEY OVERTHROW THE COLERAD O UPREME COURT OF THIS THING IS DECIDED SIX THREE IN WHICH ALL THREE OF THE DEMOCRATIC APPOINT ESE TO THE SUPREME CORT BOTE IN FAVOR OF BARRING TRUMP FROM A STATE BALLAT THAN EVERY DEMOCRAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING TO THING THAT TRUMP IS LEGALLY BARRED FROM RUNNING WHICH MEANS THAT EVEN IF HE WINS THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE POSSIBLY GOING TO ACCEPT HIS ELECTION SO BOTH SIDES ARE NOW SET TO NOT ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU'RE REPUBLICAN AND YOU JUST WATCHED DEMOCRATS THE BIDING ADMINISTRATION THE COLERDOF SUPREME CORT WEAPONIZED THE LAW AGAINST NONAL TRUMP PERSONALLY TO BARR HIM FROM BALLATS TO CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE HIM BEFORE THE ELECTION AND THEN HE LOSES YOU ARE GOING TO CLAMA CORRECTLY THAT TRUMP WAS CHEATED ANDYOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT JOBINS RE ELECTION IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT AND YOU BELIEVE THAT THE COLERAD O SUPREME COURT IS DOING THE LEGAL THING AND THT A BUNCH OF TRUMP UPPOINT ESE ON THE SUPREME COURT OVER THROUGH THAT TAN TRUMP IS LEGALLY BARRED FROM RUNNING BECAUSE HE'S AN INSURRECTIONIST AND THEN HE WINS THERE'LL BE MASSIVE RIOTS THE WEAPONIZATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM CREATES IN ALL CONSUMING FIRAT BURNS EVERYTHING IN ITS FACT BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONLY PART OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT WE ALL TRUST IF YOU CAN'T TRUST THE A POLITICAL PART OF THE GOVERMENT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE WILL ONLY JUDGMENT IT BEGAN TRUST THAT AN THEN HE OUT COME FROM THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS SIMPLY A RE IN FORCEMEN OF THEVE PREVAILING VIEW OF ONE SIDE VERSES THE OTHER THAT IS GOING TO END IN VIOLENCE THERE IS SIMPLY NO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR RESULT LIKELY TO RESULT IN ANYTHING BUT COMPLEVE AND MAYBE VIOLENT CHAOS THAT THIS POINT THAT IS TRULY FRIGHTENING AN'S BEING EXASCERBATED AS ALWAYS BY OUR MEDIO'LL GET TO THAT IN ONE SECOND FIRST I'VE BEN TALKING ABOUT MY HULITS MATTRESS FOR YEARS I KNOW ITS CAN BE HARD TO

SIMPLY BANNING THE LEADING CANSIDATE FOR ONE OF THE LEAD POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE PERSON CURRENTLY LEADING FOR PULLING FOR PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES FROM THE BALLAT THEE MATTER THAT TRUMSONCAN IN COLORADO NOW THAT MATTERS IT'S THE PRESIDENT HERE THAT I'S TRULY SHOCKING AND IT IS CREATING AGAIN THE PREDICATES FOR THE ARGUMENT BY TRUMP AND MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS THAT IF HE LOSES IT WILL NOT BE LEGITIMATE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE IF THE IDEA BEHIND EVERY CRIME IS THAT EVIDENCE OF CRIME IS MODE OF MEANS OPPORTUNITY HIT CERTAINLY HAV THE MOTIV THE THINK TRUMPS OFAHUS IT'S ERTAINLY OF THE MEANS BARRING TRUMP FROM BALLETS OR CRIMINALLY PROSECUTING HIM AND THEY CERTAINLY AVE THE OPPORTUNITY MEANING THE UPCOMING LUCTION THERE ME A LOT OF PEOPLE WHOERE POINTING THAT OUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD PARTICULARLY TRUM PLOSES BUT HERE'S YOU LIKE HONING AGAIN UNDER SCORING ME THE IDEA THAT I SUPREME COURT DECISION BAK BY COLORADOS STATES SUPREME CORT IS SOMEHOW LEGITIMATE AND INDEFENSIBLE WHICH IT IS NOT WILF THIS IS A HISTORIC DECISION IT'S A MOMENTOUS DECISION AS THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF SAYS THEY ARE IN UNSHARTED TERRITORY HERE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEPIN MIND THIS IS NOT THE LAST WORRIERE THIS IS ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING UP TO THE U  SUPREME COURT WHICH CAN REVIEW THE DECISIONS OF A STATE SUPREME COURT IN FACTIC COLORADO SUPREME CORT ANTICIPATES THAT POSSIBILITY AND FOR THAT REASON THEY PUT THEIR OWN RULING ON HOLD ON TILL GJANUARY FOURH ANTICIPATING THAT IT WILL GO UP TO THE SUPREME COURT THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCE AS IT STANDS AT THIS MOMENT THOUGH IS THE DOLAL TRUMP WILL NOT BE ON THE COLORADO BALLET IN THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOURT THE SUPREME COURT ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL TAKE THIS UP IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP MID FOR THE BROADER CONTECTS THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS OF THESE CHALLENGES FILED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EIGHTEEN OR SO OF THEM HAVE EITHER FAILED BEEN REJECTED OR BEEN WITHDRAWN BY THE PLAINT IF SO THIS IS REALLY AN OUTLIR THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO HAVE THE FINAL SAY THE CONSEQUENCES HERE ARE OF COURSE ENORMOUS AND MEANWHILE GEN SAKI FOR IM PRESS SECRITARY FOURT TE CURM PRESIDENTS OF TH UNITED STATES SHE SAYING THAT OF COURSE PETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IS LOCH ET BECAUSE ABSOLUTELY TRUMPETINTLER IF TRUMP WINS AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF THE TRACTORS WILL HAVE TO RECONCILE WHAT IT MEANS TO SHERI CONTRY WITH SO MANY CITIZENS WHO CAN'T WATCHAN TRONT SPIRO DEEPER IN TO ITS MORAL HOID AND FILL CONCLUDE YES THAT'S OUR GUY AND THIS ISN'T A FANIC TOTAL IT'S ALL SO REGISTERING IN THE POLES ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY OF LIKELY RE PUBLIC AND COCCA SCORS AND IWA FORDING TO PER CENT SAY THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT TRUN PROCLAIMING EMIGRANTS AR POISONING THE BLOOD OF AMERICA GATES O AGAIN THE IDEA HERE FROM SAKI AN COMPANY IS THAT TRUMP IS O STANDING FOR AMERICAN FASHISM THEREFORE HAS TO BE STOP NOW THE PRIDICTAPALE RESULT OF THIS ENTIDA REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IS AGAIN A BOOST FOR TRUMP ANY TIME THE LAFT TA TAK TRUMP ILLEGITIMATELY A CAUSES EVERYBODY ON THE RIGHT INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE ME TO SAY WELL MAYBE YOU JUST WANT IT YOU'RE GON TO GET A GOOD AND HARD LIKE YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE FIGHT YOU'REGIT TO GET THE FIGHT

SELEVATION IN THE PRIMARIES AS WE APPROACH PRIMARY T EIGHT TRUMP IS STILL AHEAD BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS IN THESE POLES IN IWA HEIS CURRENTLY UP IN THE AVERAGE BY THIRTY THREE POINTS FIFTY ONE OVER TO SANTISIS NINETEEN AND NICKY HALEY CLOCKING IN AT SIXTEEN POINTS MEANWHILE IN NOU HAMPSHIRE YOU AVE TRUMP CLOCKING IN AN THE LATES PALLING AT FORTY FOUR NICKY HLY AT TWENTY NINE CRISTY AT TEN AND TO

FAVORITE AND THE MORE YOU ATTACK TRUMP THE MORE PEOPLE DEFEND TRUMP THAT'S THE WAY THAT DIS WORKS SO WHEN NICKEY HALEY MAKES THE CASE AGAINST TRUMP THE CORRECT CASE BY THE WAY THE CHAOS FOLLOWS TRUMP WHICH JUS TO SAY TRUMP CAUS'S CHASAN THN COUS FOLLOWS HIM SHE'S NOT WRONG BUT ALSO WHEN YOU CAUSE THE CHAOS BUT THE CHAOS IS SO MUCH GREATER THAN THE THING THAT YOU CAUSE THE NARRATIVE TURNS FRUM YOU

FIED ELECTION RESULTS COULD BE OVERTURNED BY THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT WAS NOT TRUE WHO WAS NOT TRUE AND HE WAS FIBBING ABOUT IT AND HE WAS EXASCERBATING THINGS HE'S MAKING THINGS WORSE ALSO YE RESULT OF THAT IS NOT THAT OU GET BARRED BY SUPREME QUARTS ON THE STATE LEVEL FRUM THE BALLIT THAT IS NOT IT IS NOT THAT YOU GET CRIMINALLY CROSECUTED MOLTABLE TIMES A CROSS THE NATION AND SO NICKY HALEY IS RIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE AGAIN PEOPLE ARE RESONATING TO TRUMP IN RE ACTION TWO THE THING AT IS BEING DONE AGAINST HIM I IN PRESENT TRUMP WITH THE RIGHT PRESENT AT THE

RAY IL NOV A WORLD ON FIRE I WON'T GET THROUGH FOUR YEARS THAT CAR T RE CAN N ME EVEN IF SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IF THET EMOCRETS ARE SEEKING THE CHAOS THE ANSWER FROM ANY REPUBLICANS IS GOING TO BE OCAT THIN YOU'RE GOING TO REAP THE WHIRLWIND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE   RESPONSE PRICTOABLE RESPONSE FRUOM REPUBLICANS MEANWHILE DEMOCRATS RE GINTING USE THAT AS O KA WLE TE'RE READY TO ELECT WARRENT HITLER FINE WE'LL DOWHAT EVER WE CAN TO STOP HIM THIS GIN O GET SO UGLY SO QUICKLY BY THE WAY AS I SAY MOST NORMAL PEOPLE LOOK AT TRUMP AND WHEN HE SAYS WILDIN CRASY THINGS THEY THINKS THEMSELVES THAT'S JUST BECAUSE HE'S BRASH AND A LOUD MOUTH T'S NOT BECAUSE HE'S WRONG THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE WHONE IT COMES TO HIS RHETORIC AROUND ITMIGRATION SO YOU SAW GENSOCKY JUST A MOMENT AGO SUGGESTING THAT BHECAUSE PEOPLE SUPPORT TRUM MORE FORTY TO PER SENT OF REPUBLICANS HAV SPPORT FROM MORE AFTER HIS POISONING THE BLOOD OF OUR SYSTEM ILEGAL MIGRATION THAT THAT THAT

IN OTHER WORDS GET MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE WHEN SHIPPING LANES GET SHUT DOWN AND RIGHT NOW THE HOOTHES ARE ATTEMPTING TO SHUT DOWN THOSE SHIPPING LANES ACCORDING TO ATAM TAILOR AT THE WASHINGTON POST THERE'S A CRISIS HITTING SHIPPING NOT SO FAR FROM WHERE THE EVER GIVEN WOU REMEMBER THERE'S A CARGOSHIP THAT CHOU GOT STUCK IN THE SUE'S CANAL IN A BLOCK TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF CARGO EVERY DAY THS BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE NAGOT ANOTHER PROBLEM ON MONDAY OIL CHAMPE PEANAWNS AN IT PAUS T ALL SHIPMANS THROUGH THE RED SEA AFTER A TACKS BY THE HOOTHY MILLITANT GROUP TARGONING VESSELS ALONG THE ROUT WHICH LEADS TO AND FROM THE SUES CANAL WHAW HAS NOT YET DONE SO THE DESTRUPTION BEING CAUSED BY THE HOOTHTHE ATTACKS HAS THE WORRYING POTENTIAL TO CAUSE THE TYPE OF DAMAGE THE SUES CANAL BLOCKAE THREATEN IN IN EDITOIAL PUBLISH SUNDAY THE WALSTRGERNAL SUGGESTED IT WIS WORTH CALLING THE MOST SIGNIFICANTHRATS TO GLOBAL SHIPPING IN DECATES BY THE WAYTS WORSE THAN THAT IF TAGAIN IF THE HOOTHEES CAN SHUT DOWN A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF GLOBAL TRADE BY AGAIN BEING A RAG TAG GROUP OF PIRATES WITH VERY LO LEVE WEAPONRY WHAT DO YOU THINK CHINA IS LOOKING AT CHINASLIK OKA W ELL HERE'S ONE THNG WE CU DO WE CU BLOCKADE TIWAN AND PEOPLE A LIKE THAT WE CAN BLOCKHADE A LOT OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND WE CAN SHOT DOWN GLOBAL SHIPPING UNTIL PEOPLE JUST COMPLY WITH OUR REQUESTS ANOTHER WORDS IF YOU ALOW A BUNCH OF PATHETIC HURRIFIC SMALL TIME TERRORISTS AND THOGS TO STOP SHIPPING THROUGH ONE OF THE WORLD CHIEF CHOKE POINTS WA ETHING A MAJOR ARMY LIKE THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY IS GOING TO DU THEY BELIEVE THE DAYE CAN USED THAT SORT THAT THAT IS I ME THAT THAT IS A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THE WEST CAVING THAN EVEN AF GANISTAN AF GANNISON YOU CAN A LEAST MAKE THE CASES AT THE WEST WAS THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABATLIC GUYSAN AND FLATABLES WHE ARE GOING UP TO SHIPS WITH DRONES AND TAKING OVER THION TIRE SHIP AND THE WEST APPARENTLY DOING VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT SO OF COURSE CHINAS GON TO LOOK AT THATINTAILE CA WHLE I GESS THAT WE CAN EXERT SOM PRETTY SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE IN THE WATERS AROUND ARE ON COAST ACCORDING TOTHE WALSTREJOURNAL OURS AFTER THE UNITED STATES ANNOUNCED A MULTI NATIONAL TASK FOR S TO PROTECT COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC THROUGH THE RED SEA SHIPPING GIANTS EIGHT PEOPLE OR MARISK SAID IT WOULD SEND ITS VESSELS AROUND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE AND SOUTHERN AFRICA INSTEAD THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR SHIPPING FIRMS OIL COMPANIES ENSHURES REMAIN JITTERY ABOU A POSSIBLE SNARL SONE THEWORLD'S MOST CRUCAL TRADEROOTS IAGAIN TOTALLY UNCLEAR AS TO WEATHER THE WESTERN ATTEMPTUR WILL STOP WHAT THE WHOTHESE ARE DOING HOOTHES HAVE BEEN BULGE THAT PURE TO HAVE BULGING STOCKPILE OF MISSILES AN DRONES ANNALIS HAD DRONES THE LESS DANGEROUS THAN MISILES IF THEY SLIPP THROUGH THEDEFENCES COULD PROVE ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR SOME SHIPS IN THE COALITION TO SHOOT DOWN ONLIKE THE ARON AROCK WARE IN THE NINETEEN EIHTIES WHEN NAVAL VESSELS AESCORTED OIL TANKERS THROUGH THE REGION THE CURN VOLUME OF SHIPPING TRAFFIC THROUGH THE STRAITS IS WAY TOO HIGH TO MAKE RELOING ON PROTECTIVE CONVOYS FEASIBLE ACCORDING TO GE MARAN RETIRED YOU ESCINATE THE CAPTAIN WHO COMMANDS ED BOTH THE DESTROYER AND A CRUISER HE PREDICE TOF THE UNITED STATE WOULD HAVE TO STRIKE HOOTHY TARGETS ON LAND WHICH IS CORRECT OBVIOUSLY AND BY THE WAY WY EXACTLY SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ANDITS WESTERN ALLIES BE SHY ABOUT STRIKING THE HOOTHES I MEAN WE'RE NOT TALKING HERE ABOUT TAKING DOWN THE ENTIRE ARANEAN GOVERNMENT OR SOMETHING WITH A MASSIVE MILITARY OR TOM MOTAKING DOWN LIKE COOSTAL PIRATES NA MEN TONGE ABOUT TANE OUT THE HOTHIES ENTIRELY YOU'R TONGUE ABOUT DESTROYING THEIR ABILITY TO HARASS SHIPPING ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS BY THE WAYS BECAUSE THE THE WEST IS HAS OVERTECT ITSELF IN MANY WAYS WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT FOR EVERY DUM BOM TAT THE HOOTHES ARE FIRING ADDEDDED SHIPPING ADDE A SHIPPING CONVOY THE UNITED STATES AN ANTS ALLIES ARE SENDIN IT TWO MILLION DOLLAR MISSILE YOU US NAVY DESTROYERS AR COING TO POLITICL OF SHOT DOWN THIRTY EIGHT TRONES AND MULTIBLE MISSILES IN THE RED SEA OVER THE PASTUMONTS ACCORDING TO A DEFENCE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ON SATURDAY ALONE THE UST THE DESTROYER YOU US US CARNY INTERSEPTED FOURTEEN ONE WAY ATTRACK ATTACKD RUNSWHICH ARE SUICIDE DRONES THE COST OF USING EXPENSOF NAVAL MISSILES WHICH CAN ROP TO TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SHOT TO DESTROY UNSOPHISTICATED WHO THE DRONES ESTIMATED A FEW VASSIBOUT SEECH IS A GROWING CONCERN ACCORDING TO THE D O D THE COST OFF THET IS NOT ON OUR SIDES TO ONE DEO D OFFICIAL SO THEIR TALK ABOUT AY BE THEY NEED USE DIFFERENT AIR DEFENCE OR MAY BE INSET OF TRYING TO ACT OFFENSIVELY AGAINST AGAIN HOOTHY PIRATES YOU MIGHT L ANT TO ACTUALLY JUST DESTROYD THE HOOTHY PIRATES THIS IS NOT ALL IT IS A LACK OF WILL THAT LEADS TO THIS NOT A LACK OF RESOURCES THE UNITED SAYS THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY ND MOST POWERFUL NAVIAN WORLD HISTORY AND LIKE ALL MY GOD TPEOPLE ON IN FLATABLES

THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK SHE SAYS THAT THE STATE SHOULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER SLAVERY REPARATIONS IN NEW YORK WHICH WAS AS YOU MAY RECALL NOT A SLAVE STATE I SHE SAYS THAT SLAVERY REPARATIONS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE CONSIDER I NOW BECAUSE NEW YORK OBVIOUSLY HAS TONS OF MONEY TO SPEND ON THIS SORT OF ISSUE AMIDST THERE SERIOUS CRIME PROBLEM ECONOMIC TURMOIL PEOPLE LEAVING THE STAPEICAUS OFTHE HIGH TAXES I SHIP BETWEEN HER AND AVANUESON MY GOODNESS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A BENCH WE'RE PROUD TO BE HOME OF CORADEOUS SLEADERS LIE CARRIET TOGMAN CONDUCT OR THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD BURIED UP IN OUBER NEW YORK TO JORNER TRUTH FREDERIC DOUGLAS AN ABOLITIONIS LAKE JOHN BROWN WHOS FARM IS WAY IN THE NORTH COUNTRY WE'RE PROUD TO EMBRACE THE DELIVERANGE FROM SLAVELY FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAILRAY ITSELF WHICH FRAN FROM NEW YORK ALL WAY TE KANNADA CROSSTHE OVER  NIGERFALLS WHERE I WAS YESTERDAY AND THET HAD THE STRONG SUPPORT OF MANY GOOD AND MUCH GOOD WILL FROM RESIDENCE OF THIS STATE SO WE IT'S EASY FOR UST TO PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK I WE DID ALL THIS LOT OF OTHE STATESTINS THAT BUT WE HAD THE LEADERS HERE WE TOOK THIS SIN WE CAN SAY WERE THE HEROS WHERE THE ONES WHO FOUGHT AGAINST SLAVERY AND INDEED MANY DID WHAT IS HARD TO EMGRACE IS THE FACT THAT OUR STATE ALSO FLOURISHED FROM THAT SLAVERY IN A FEW MINUTES I'LL SIGN OF BILL AUTHORIZEIN THE CREATION OF A COMMUNITY COMMISSION TO STUDY THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY IN NEW YORK STATE O GOTY VARIO OMS THE REPARATIONS AND HOW WE CAN HELP RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE PASS IS OBVIOUSLY PANERING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PANNERING THAT THEY CAN STUDY ANY COMISSION THEY WANT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT SLAVERY REPORATIONS AS COMPLETELY ONWORKABLE AS A MATTER OF LAW HOW EXACTLY TO SCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF RACE A HOW DO YOU TRACE BACK THE ANCESTOR MANE ALL THESE PRACTICAL QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN SERIT WHO PAYS DO PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED  LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTY PAY DESCENDANTS OF AMERICAN SLAVES HABOUT BLACK AMERICANS WHO ARRIVED AND LIKE NINETN HOW AT HATIAN AMERICANS DO THEY PAY EXAT WHO PAYS EXACTLY WHARE THE BENEFICIARS AND ALL THIS IS NOT MEANT TO ACTUALLY CREATE ANY SORT OF SOLUTIONS IT IS MEANT TO EXASCERBATE THE PROBEMS AND EXASCURBATE THEDIVISIONS THE SAME THING HOLDS TRUE BY THE WAY FOR THIS ATTEMPT TO REMOVE A CONFEDERATE MEMORIAL AT ARLINGTON CEMETERY SO A JUDGE HAS NOW LOUD TH REMOVAL TO GO AHEAD ACCORDING TO THE NERTIMES A FEDERAL JUDGE ON TUESDAY CLEARED THE WAY FOR THE REMOVAL OF A CONFEDERATE MEMORIAL FROM ARLINGTO NATIONAL CEMETERY JUST ONE DAY AFTER A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER HAD HALTED THE PLAN TO MOVE ONE OF MOST PROMINENT MONUMENTS TO THE CONFEDERACY FROM THE NATIONS MOST FAMOUS BURIAL GROUND THE MEMORIAL HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR ITS ANITIZES TO PICTION OF SLAVERY AND ITS REMOVAL IS PART OF THE MILITARY WHIDE EFFORTS TO TAKE DOWN CONFEDERATES SIMBOLS FROM BASIS SHIPS AND OTHER FACILITIES NOW WHY EXACTLY IS THAT HAPPENING IS NOT HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU WISH TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE CIVIL WAR THAT'S NOT WHY BECAUSE AGAIN THE REASON THAT THESE MEMORIALS WERE ERECTED WAS TO EFFACT SOME SORT OF RECONCILIATION IN THE UNITED STATES POST CIVIL WAR A DELICATE BALANCING ACT THAT WAS IN PART THE RESULT OF THINGS LIKE THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WHIC WAVE BENDIS CUSSING EARLIER IN THE SHOW A TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO KEEP A COUNTRY A COUNTRY YOURE GOING TO HAVE TO REQUIRE SOME SORT OF RECONCILIATION AND MONUMENTS LIKE THIS WEREN'N ATTEMPT TO DO THAT IT WASN'T MEANT TO WON W OBSCURE SLAVERY AS NOT THE IDEA HERE THE IDEA HERS THA EN HAVE ONE HALF THE CONTRY FIGHTING THE OTHER HAF THE COUNTRY THE ONLY WAY OR GAN TAND UP AS ONE COUNTRY AFTER ALL OF THAT IS TO CREATE SOME SORT OF MERCY FOR THE LOOSING SOD THAT'S WHAT THIS MONUMENT WAS ABOUT THAT'S WHY I WAS UN CONTROVERSIAL FOR A VERY LONG TIMES TO WAT THE QUESTION IS WISEAR CONTROVERSIAL IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHEN IT WAS UN CONTROVERSIAL IN SAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY WHEN YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING MONUMENTS LIKE THIS BE ERECTED AND THER FAMILY MARC AE BEN KILLED BY MEMBERS THE CONFEDERACY AND YE  YOUR BROTHERS GOT SHOT BY A MEMBER THE CON FEDERACY FIVE YEARS AGO AND NOTHER ERECTING MONUMENT AN ARLINGTON NATIONAL WHY WERE YOUOKO BECAUSE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ONLY WAY TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE CONTRY ONE AGAIN WAS TO EFFACTUATE THIS SORT OF RECONCILIATION AND NOW IF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED INS WHO HAVE NOTPEN SLAVES THAT PARENTSWERE NOT SLAVES OR GRANDPARENT WERE NOT SLAVES YO'VE PEOPLE WHO NOT HAVE NO RELATIVES WHATS TO WETVER WHERE INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOHAVE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO AREN'N NOUT COMING FORTH INTING THAT THIS MEMORIAL OFFENDS THEM NOW WHICH IS ABOUT CREATING CONFLICT IN THE NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT IS TE GUAL IS NOT ABOUT TEACHING IN FACT THESE MONUMENTS AS I'VE SAID MANY MANY TIMES THEY PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TEACHING YET THT THEY PROVIDE YOU N OPPORTUNE ACTUALLY HAVE THE IS CUSSION BOUT WHAT WAS THE CONFEDERACY WHY WAS CONFEDERACY SO WRONG WHY WAS SLAVERY SO EVIL AND THEN WHY WAS THIS MONUMENT BILT IN THE FIRSTLEC A GEESE ARE GOOD COMPLAX NUONS INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS YOU NOIT'S NOT AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WHIPING AWAY HISTORY IN ORDERS THAT YOU CAN CLAIM THAT THE PROBLEMS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY AUE THE SAME AS THE PROBLEMS OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE WHICH IS REALLY THE CLAIM THE PEOPLE WHO ANT A RIPP DOWN MONUMENTS LIKE THIS THAT IS REALLY THE GOLD HERE ALISON PARKER HISTORIANT UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE SAID THESE TYPES OF MONUMENTS WHICH WEE PUT UP IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY SO AGAIN THERE PEOPLE WERE STILL LIVING WHO HAD RELATIVES KILLED IM IS OFIL WAR WHEREABOUT A CERTAIN KIND OF REC IF REIFICATION OF AN I STALGA BASED OWN THE NOTION SLAVERY WASN'T REALLY THAT BAT THERE'S A MIS CONCEPTION ABOUT THE NOTION THESE MONUMNTS NEDED BE PRESERVED AS AE REPRESENTATION IN SOME CASE I THIN INTOCET TO TAKE DOWN THESE CONTAMONUMENTS CAUS THEY STILL CARRY HURTFUL MEANINGS TO DAY SUCH ABSOLUTE TRIPE THIS DOES NOT MAKE THINGS BETTER IN ANY WAY SHAPER FORM THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES AT ALL AN YOU MEANWHILE YESTERDAY WE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS LETTER THAT FOCUSSED IN ON BLESSAMES FOR SAME SEX COUPLES AND WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANT AND I SAID THAT YOU'LL FOR ALL THE TALK BY HOUT CHANGED NOTHING OBVIOUSLY THE R POPLE INSIDE THECHURCH WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT IS CHANGING EVERYTHING EVIDENCE THAT I AM RIGHT COMES TO DAY CURTESY OF D AND WI VUS IS OUT COM A PEACE TADTLED MAKING HISTORY ON A TUESDAY MORNING WITH THE CHURCHES BLESSING AND I FEATURES A PICTURE OF REVEREND JAMES MARTIN A JESUIT PRIEST STANDING AND GIVING A BLESSING TO A SAME SEX COUPLE TWO MEN WHO ARE HOLDING HANDS SO AS I SAID YESTERDAY WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE CHURCH HAS ASTORICALLY SAID WHAT THEY'VE SAID IS THAT YOU CAN OF COURSE BE BLESSAS AN INDIVIDUAL SENTER EVERYBODY GETS BLESSED AS AN INDIVIDUAL SENTER THERE'S NO PROBLEM OT THAT AND THAT'S TRUE BY THE WAY FOR EVERY MAINSTREAM RELIGION EVERYONE IS A SINTER THAT'S NOT PREHEBYOU FROM BEING BLESSED WHAT YOU CANNOT BE BLESSED FOR IS PARTICIPATING IN THE SIN WHEN YOU HAVE TWO GAMEN HOLDTHING HANDS AND RECEIVING THE BLESSING OBVIOUSLY BE VISUAL ON THAT IS DESIN SPECIFICALLY TO GREEN LIKE THE BEHAVIOR CLEARLY AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'D BE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS AND A MAN DIVORCED AND HIS WIFE AND THE VERY MARRIED STANDING AND HOLDING HANDS IN FORNAL PRIEST WAS BLESSING THEM IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A BLESSING OF THE DIVORCED COUPLE ITSELF THAT WOULD BE THE IDEA AS A COUPLE AND THIS WAS THE DISTINCTION ON'S MAGNESTORY AND REVEREND NAMES MARTIN IS GOING FULL AHEAD WITH THAT SO 'LL BE FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DOES ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IF THASHLE STAND BY THE IDEA THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO LEGITIMIZATION OF SAME SEX MARRIAGE OR SAME SEX ACTIVITY DON ME VERY HARD TO LOOK AT BHAT PICTURE AND AY THAT'S NOT A LEGITIMIZATION OF SAME SEX MARRIAGE OR SAME SEX ACTIVITY IF THE VADICAN DOES NOTHING THAT WOILL BE A VERY SOLID ANSWER AS TO WHAT EXACTLY THE BATICAN WAS DOING IN THAT LETTER ACCORDING T THE PIEST NEVER BEFORE WAS MARTIN PERMITTED TO BLESS THE SAME SEX COUPLE NOT UNTIL MONDAY WHEN THE POPE SAID HE WOULD ALLOW SUCH BLESSINGS AND ANNOUNCEMENT THAT REVERERATED THROUGH THE CHURCH ON TUESDAY MORNING DAMIAN STEEDL JACK FORTY FOR AND HIS HUSBAND JASON STEED OLD JACK THIRTY STOOD BEFORE FATHER MARTIN IN LIVING ROOM ON MAN HATTON'S WEST SIDE THE COUPLE RUNNING A BIT LATE BECAUSE OF HE SUBWAY TO LAYS TRUST CASUALLY SAMIAN A FLORAL DESIGN OR COMPLIMENT OD FATHER MARTIN ON THE PINE SMELL OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE IN KEEPING WITH THE VATICAN'S ADMONITION THAT SUCH A BLESSING SHOULD NOT BE PERFORMED WITH ANY CLOTHING CHESTURES OR WORDS PROPER TO A WEDDING FATHER MARTIN WARNO ROUPES AND READ FROM NO TEXT THERE'S NO BLESSING FOR SAM SEX COUPLES IN THE THICK BOOK OF BLESSINGS PUBPLISHD BY THE EST CONFERENCE OF BISHOPS WELL RIGHT MEAN JAW INSTEAD HE SELECTED A FAVOUR OF HIS OWN FROM THE OLD TESTMEAN HE UASE DEPRIESTLY BLESSING FROM THE OLD TESTMANT AND NOT LET ME JUST TELL YOU AS A DEVOTEE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT IN THE ORIGINAL HEBREW I CAN PROMISE YOU AT THIS A BLESSING THAT'S NOT TYPICALLY BESTOWED ON SAME SEX CUPLES AS THEY HOLD HANDS FATHER MARTIN HAS FREQUENTLY MET WITH POPE FRANS ABOUT MAKING THE ROMAN CATHOLICHRIRCH MORE INCLUSIVE ON TUESDAY MORNING HE WAS FAR FROM THE HALL'S POWER HE WAS AT HOME MAKING HISTORY HE SAID WAS REALLY NICE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT PUBLICLY AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO BE WHAT WETHER CHURCH ALOWS THIS THIS PICTURE IS THE STORY IS PICTURE IS THE STORY AND SO AGAIN IF IF YOUR PRETENDING ALONG WITH THE IDEA THAT THE VATICAN HAS CHANGED NOTHING IT' CAN BE VERY HARD TO MAINTAINED THAT IN THE FACE OF THIS PARTICULAR PICTURE MEANWHILE I DO ON PROVIDE SOME GOOD NEWS I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE SORT OF STUNMING DEVELOPMENT OF LAST THREE FORMONTHS HAS BEEN THE MAGIC OF JOHN FETDERMAN WHAT BY LIVING HALLIUN I IT'S VERY RAREE GITS TO IN A BRIGHT SPOT NEWS ON THE SHOW JOHN FETDERMAN WOW IN SIR JOHN FEDDERMAN CAMPAIGN AS LIKE AN AVERT SOCIALISTIC A BURNEY STANDARS ACALAGE WHO'S THE FURTHEST LEFT MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SENTAL BATTLE GROUND STATE CANDIDATE GROUP LIKE BY FAR AND THEN GET NANURISM AND HE  AHE WASN'T FULLY FUNCTIONAL CLEARLY AND WH AS A QUESTION IS TO WHETHER HE COUD EVEN SORVE IN THE SENATE AND NOW JOHN FETDERMAN HE'S LIKE TURNING INTO CHRISTON CYNIMA HE'S STURNINGS LIKE THE MODERATE VOICE OF DEMOCRATS HERE SO YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE JOHN FETDERMAN'S CRITICIZIN THE OPEN EMOGRATION POLICY AT THE SOUTHRN BORDER OH HERE IS JOHN FEDDERMAN YESTERDAY NI ALY CEN VERY LER THAT UNBENITHIN ON THE RIGTS TAT OF WHAT HAT BELIEVE TIT IS AN AN BEEN VERY UP FRON ANOTES WELL TO AN AN I REALLY AV BEEN ABLE TO IND ANYBODY THAT CAN SAY THERE'S NOT ANY KIND OF AN ISOU WRIT NOW ON THE BORDER THAN AS AROUND TWO HUNDRED SENY TOUDS AN PEOPLE BEING ENCOUNTERED ON THE BORDER JUST IN ONE ONTH AND E PU THAT IN RESPECTID IS THATS TAT BEFORE THAT'S THE SIDE OF CISPOR AND I ROUGHLY THE SINES OF CISPOR IS SHOWING UP IN THE BORDER UM THE THUSS WHAT YOU YOU NEED SAY THAT'S FIND I THAT'S NOT REALLY AN ISSUE I'S A PROGRESSIV THAT I JUST THAT THAT'S I WOULN BE A PEGRESSI BUT I A REMAIN AN AN ALWAYS BE VERY VERYS A O IMIGRATION BERONS WHICH AS BEN E BY TE IN THERE OKAY BUT HE SANG HIS PROMINE TE BOARDER BECAUSE AGAIN JOHN FEDERMAN VOICE OF REASON NON SOTISTCOMIG MEANWHILE JOHN FETDERMAN WAS ALSO RIPPING ON YOUNG PEOPLE INSIDE THEDEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO ARE GETTING THEIR HISTORY FROM TICTOCK BY THE WASI STATISTIC RECENLY THET SHOWED THAT TWO THIRDS OF DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THERE WAS A HISTORIC STATE OF P OLISTINE RUN BY ARABS NO THE ANSWERS NO THAT IS NOT A THING IN ANY CASE HERE WAS THAT JOHN FEDERMAN SANG YA THEY DON'T NOW ANY HISTORY BY THE WAY IN AN OFFICE WITH TWO HIS RITY FLEFTS BEHIND EM I JOHN FETTERMANMAN I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT A I'M I'M ALL FOR IT YOU'VE BEEN VERY CLEARLY ARGUING THAT COLOSS VAREST RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRAGEDY OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN GOS O WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY YOUNGER PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN YOUR PARTYES SEE IT DIFFERENTLY I I REALLY I REALLY DON'T REALLY DON'T KNOW I I DO KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING THERE PRERSPECTIVE FROM TITOCK AND I THINK IF YOUR KIND OF GETTING YOUR PRERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD ON TIKTOCKETS GON IT THEN BE KIND OF WORKER NOT REFLECTIV OF THE HISTORY N AN ACTUALLY THE WAY THINGS ATSLY ARE AND WHAT IS VERY CLEAR ISIS THAT HOMOSS STARTED

rebecga remembers exactly when yhou wearn the astonishing truth shesn second grate i man in to were best rund rachel its school one day and she pulled me aside and and said last night at you knw i lost the tooth and i woke up well the toothfairy was putting the money under my pillow and gess to the toothfairy was it said o my god who was it i i have to know and she said my dad my dad is the toothfary and i remember running home after school and telling my ma'm mim i know we the toothfairyous and declaring it as if i had grown up that i i knew who who the toothfairy ws and she said ol well who is the toothfairy and i turne to her and i said rachel's dad is the toothfairy ronnie lover fell is the toothfairy and she said i cannot believe you now it is totally secret you cannot let any one else know but your right ronnie is the toothfairy and he works realy hard and it is the secret as you cannot let any one else now he is the toothfair wyu cannot let anyone else now and from that day on ronnie ronnie loverfelt with toothfairy and i'll of my notes under my pillow were signed love ronnie lev as felt now i'm in his day job what id runnin over felt do i think he did something in fine aunce whos either an account an or a stock broker yeu work next to a stoping shop an maske thoth sets in newton a dark hair worse too ni deftly had images of his driving his volver around e bosstonarya and delivering the toothfary treats i remembering wondering what it was for rachel to know that her dad was the toothfairy and deftly being little envious that her dad had the special job in the special power and that he had this whole other interesting life for my jed dest came home from work and that was it when you would actually run into running overfeld what was i for you how would you act i tri tactcool i did not want any knotes if your star strock but you do not want them to know that your star strock sos ik meaning a celebrity exactly you down play it you try not to mention at but you definitely check them out twice and and look at them when they walk away i go my got for the toothfary but enough to play a cool and know enough to plake cal i said hay how you do and i what is for dinner hi'w m getting home to night how my parents gen to pick me up if they call you did play at corl when intshesting question in all this why did both girls come to what seems the least likely conclusion from the evidence in front of them of a parent swapping money for a tooth under a pillow whe i was not got nmix studies hell children thing she says of course it is logical for a seven year old to conclude that her own dad might be the toothfairy children understand that theire parents for instance ar powerful in all sorts of ways that make them very different from children i now from a child's point of view knowing where those powers begin and and is pretty tricky i mean to think about all the things that your parents can do that you cannot do and think about the fact that the is not any obvious explanation about why your father can use of easi cart for instance i know which is something that you cannot do i the power to be a toothfairy is not all that much more impressive its a certain con of story that coulds tell it the roning woer felt story het they will get something going on around them observe ir carefully thi about it logically i one thing connexts to the next thing to the next and then come to conclusions that ar completely in correct therre mist aglin golman in texas tells this story better litte girl in their plan then she was about for ears ord and her very first flihts and as the plain was eir born she turned to the woman next to her and said when do we get smaller that had been their experience at eirports watching airplanes take off they do get smalistories are joks andth rossa poems i think because theres is a ho quality to them some connection is made between things surpriseing connection a wrong connection actually well be at this american life love these stories and to day we bring you a full hour of them dh you be asy chicago is this american life a mira glass to day in our program kid logic are showing for acts at one baby scientists with faulty data a two where wils in their youth as sery for michael shape on a three the gaminin over to the fats o man things at for when small foughts me big grains stay with us ike one baby scientists with faulty data thirty years ago psychologists and scientists believed that babies could not think at all that they were irrational in a logical self sended little balls of need and wont what science as wearnt in the last thirty years is that this is not true the children are observing the world and thinking about it and coming to logical conclusions from the day they are born nallison gopenit and two over colleagues decided to sunrise a lot of this research in a book they called it the scientist in the crib many the babies are little scientists they argue that wen a small baby sits in a high chair and drops a spoon on to the for over and over and over for mamor dead to pick up what the baby is doing essentially is running a little baby sized experiment because it turns out that babies are very interested in gravity and how gravity work the thit fact that things full down an not up is not obvious to babies i and it turns out another fing ther very interested in is human beings and how they work we are actually the labrats there actually doing experiments all an os to see how we geg when you plaindrop this bo when you gen to for the price of one you get and experiment about gravity you get a little physics tutorial and you get a psychology titoril you can see about how that person a well do something over in oubering while kids think with the same logic that itdelts us and apply that logic just as rigorously there are certain things that they simply do not know and take a wild of figure out up the six or seven years old for instance it is not exactly clear to anyone what is imaginary and what is not or if wishing for something can make it come true there is a wonderful experiment about this actually that poharis in england it a where he got children to amagin a that something was in a box he would say ocade now here is this box wore wen open oupiing a closet a now it is imagine that there is a puppy in this box or else let us imagine that there is a monster in the box a and he asked the children is there really a monster in the box is there really a poppy ing th box they sid now they were just imagining it then the researcher would walk out of the room leaving the box behind with the child tand then something funny would happen the kids who were told to imagin a poppy in the box would go over and piqe inside the box just a check and the ids who were told that thre was a monster in the box they would edge away from the box there wore can it take any chances just in case wishing actually could make monsteris habin a they did not want to take any chances about what was going on in that box but by the time the children are six or seven they lik grown ups they have understood that just wishing for things is not going actially makthing hw when thet's jo small and in experience about what happens in the real world children have to make logical inferences all the time based on the day that they do have here is how jhudchan responded when our producer jonathan goldstin asked them about the toothfary what do you think she does with all f these teeth that she is collecting way she gae thi people at atteh who oh people what do you think she does with all these teeth sees the colleke teeth and make things i ey what kin to stuff i i thav a two how to twelve feet and i to sta how many teet tef thin takes to make a tooth house i d i dan why when she just make the house aut of brick it everyone else i o i elin te i a teet these stories where kid take a perfectaly logical premise and go through a series of perfectly logical deductions that we do perfectly incorrect conclusions junt said that science does not have a name for these stories which is surprising given how common they are and how they ir recognized around the world for their sheer entertainment value here we have colected a few more we lived in ta duplax the duplaxes directly to the left in the right of us were aunts and uncle across e treet from us all ans and uncles it was no such thing as walking out tistaing a strange i just we all looked alike we all had common ancestries well my i became mobile when i got my foer when i got my on first trisicple i could go a little bit further i ventured down the street and i looked and as sawl these thes couple sid nat these two people but they were people that i had never seen before i'd never seen anything that because they were white people and because i had never seen white people i as sume that they were ghosts i waves i wonder if i wave wou know what kind of people are they what they do they talk i waved and i remember hearing the man going whill thats must be the way they talk it was a scienttific discovery i discover the first ghosth people and they talke to me they got communicated i waved they waved i said they know how low and this are healow in their language e et all began at christmas two years ago whand my daughter was four years old and them it was the first time that shead ever asked about what it wwhat to this holiday mean and i i explain to her that this was celebrating the birth of a of jesus and she wanted know more about that and we woent o n bought a kids byble and had these readings at night she loved him wanted to know everything about jesus im we read aon about his birth an about his teaching and them she would ask constantly what that what that phrase was and i would explained to her that it was do one to others as you would have them do unto you and we would talk about those old words and what that all meant am and then one day we were driving past a a big church and out front was an enormous crucifex she said who is that nd i guss i'v never really told that part of the story i had the sort of ye well that is that is jesus s and i forgot to day the endin yet well al he he ran a fowl of the roman a government this message that he had was radical and unnerving to the prevailing authorities of the time that they had to kill i they they came to the conclusion that he would have to die that message was too troublesome th was about a month later after that christmas weh'd gone through the whole whole story what christmas mant and and it was me january and her pre school a celebrates the same holidays as the local schools martin wis the kingday was off i knocked off work that day and i decide we would play and i take her out the launch and a we wase sitting in there and right on the table where we happened to plop down was the art section of the local news paper and there big is life was a huge drawing by i a teniour old kid in the local schools of martin with her king and ashe said who is that i said well as it happens that is martin is the kang and he is why you are not in school to day s we are celebrating his his birthday this is the day we celebrate his life and she said who was he i said when he was he was a preacher and she looks up hi megas for jesus n i sid ya he actually he was but am but there was there was another thing that he was really famous for which as thait a he had a message and you trying to say this to a fore your oll its very this is the first time they ever hear anything she just very careful about how you phrase everything i said well yes hehe was a preacher and he he had a message she said what was his message i said whel he said and you should treat everybody the same no matter what they looke she thought about that for a minute and she said well that is what jesus said i said yet i guess it is and i never thought of it that way but yet an thany sort of do on to others as she would have thim doun to you and she thought for men ad much of te me and said that they kill him to i to where wolves in their youth in this act we have this example of kids thinking kids tit is an exiptosort story by michael shape on i had known him as a bull dozer as a somerai as an android programme to kill as plastic man and titania man and matter eater lad as a bewic electra as a peterbuilt truck and even for a week as the mackanal bridge but it was as a wearewolf that timothy stokes finally went too far i was not there when it happened i was down in the ravine at the edge of the school yard founding a capital for an empire of ants iad just begun to describe to my south and to the ants the complicated right sacred to the god whose worship i was imposing on them when i heard the first screams from the playground the girl screamed at timothy the same way every time he came after them in unison and with a thrill that sounded almost delight as if they were watching the family cat trot passed with something bloody in its jaws i scrambled up the side of the ravine and emerged has timothy shoulders hunched arms outstretched growled re ilistically and declared that he was hungry for the throat of puny human en timothy said this or something in every time he turned into a ware wilfon i would not have been too concerned of and the course of his last trance for mation he had naxtually gone an bit and virginia pes on the neck it was common knowledge around school that virginia's parents had since written a letter to the principal and and the next time timothys sdokes hurt somebody he was going to be e spell timothy was in our teacher missus gladfelter's words one strike away from an out and there was a wide spread if unarticulated hope among his classmates their parents and all of the teachers that copland fork elementary that one day soon he would provide the authorities with the excuse they needed to pack him off to special school i stood there a while above my little city watching timothy pursue us snarling bluebine corse along the hopscotch crosses i knew that some one ought to do something to calm him down but i was the only one and our school who could have any reason to wont to save timothy stokes from expulsion and i hated him with all my heart nd i fi have been cursed for three hundred years who de claim he was wearing his standard uniform of white dungeries and a plain white undershirt even though it was a chilly afternoon in october and all the rest of us had long since been bundled up for autumn and corduroy and down i have been cursed to stalk the night through all eternity he went on i have been searching for pray as lovely as you he lunged toward the nearest wall of the cage of girls around him the girls peeled away from him as though sprayed with a hose bump shoulders clung shrieking to each other sleeves some of them were singing the song we sang about timothy stokes tmothy stokes timoth stokes he going to the home for crazy folks and the one singing the loudest was virginia pees herself and her furry black coat and her bright red tightes virginia had blond hair and she was the only girl in the fifth grade with pierced ears and painted finger nail and timothy stokes was in love with her i knew this because the stokesas lived next door to us and i was privy to all kinds of secrets about timothy that i had absolutely no desire to know i forbade myself with an almost religious severity to showed timothy any kindness or regard i would never let him sit beside me as lunch or in class and if he tried to talk to me on the playground i agnored him who was bad enough that i had to live next door to him it was toward virginia that timothy now advance a ratling growl in his throak she drew back behind heur girl friends and their screaming now grew less melodious less purely formal timothy crouched down on all force he rolled his wild white eyes and took a last look around him that was when he saw me half way across the yellow distance of the sockerfield he was looking at me i thought as though he hoped i might have something i wanted to tell him instantly i dropp flad on my belly my heart pounding the way it did when i was spotted trying to spy on a basebog game or birthday party i slid doun into the ravine backward at first i could hear the girls shouting for missus gladfelter and then i heard missus gladfelter herself sounding very angry and the bell sounded the end of recess and everything got very quiet but i just stayed there in the ravine i told myself that i did not feel sorry at all for stupid old timothy stokes but then i would remember the confused look in his eyes as i had abandoned him to his fate to all the unimaginable things that would be done to him in the fabulous corridors of the special school i kept recalling something that i had heard timothy's mother say to mind just a couple of days earlier altheas dokes had told my mother ind that big sad donkey voice of hers your little paul is timothy's only friend i decided to spend the afternoon in the ravine the sun started down behind the embankment and the moon rising early emerged from the roof tops of the houses somebody was putting up in front of the school the moon i noticed was not quite full i did not hear the scrape of footsteps until they were just above my head paul said missus gladfelter leaning over the lip of the ravine hands against her thighs paul covell what on earth are you doing out here nothing i said i did not hear the bell paul she said now listen in me paul i need your help with what i did not think she looked angry but her face was upside down in it was hard to telp with timothy paul i guess he is just very wound up right now he is pretending he'is awarewolf to day and even though that is fine and we all know how timoth he is sometimes we have serious things to discuss with him and we would him to stop pretending for just a little while what if hy is not pretending i said what if he really is a warewolf maybe he is paul but if you would just come inside and talk to him for a little bit i think we might be able to persuade him to change back into timothy you are his friend paul i asked him if he would to talk to you and he said yess i'm not his friend missus gladfelter i swear to god i cannot do anything paul timothy isn'n trouble he needs your help and i need your help to now if you come right this minute and get up out of that dirt then i'll forget that you did not come in from recess if you do not come back inside i'll have to speek to your mother she held out her hand i come on please and i took her hand and let her pull me out of the ravine and across the deserted playground aware that in doing i was merely proving he unspoken corollary hat my mother had left hanging the other morning and the air between her and missus stokes there was a song about me too i'm afraid a popular little noban at went what is that smello paul covello he is a big fat hippoed jellow i the nute he smells pohe smells tomado beef alphabet's timothy stokes i knew as i followed missus gladfelter down the long silent hallway to the office hating him more and more with each step was my only friend a timothy was sitting in a corner of the office traped in an oranged vinal arm chair there was a roman neumeral three scratched into his left cheek and his brilliant white shirt and trousers were patterned with a camelflodge of grass and dirt and assfal well now timothy missus gladfelter took me by the shoulders and maneuvered me around her look who i fown hay timothy i said timothy did not look oup missus gladfelter gave me a gentle pushed toward him in the small on my back why do not you sit down paul now i did not want to be left alone with timothy not because i was afraid of him but because i was afraid that somebody would come into the office and see us sitting there too matching rejects and matching orange chairs that is enough now paul said mister buterbaul the principal his friendly smile looking more false than usual sit down saul right said missus gladfelter you see what you an do about helping timothy turned back into timothy we are just going to give you a little privacy she followed mister buterbout into his office and then poked her head back around the door i'm going to leave this door open in case you need us all right there were three chairs next to timothy's i took the farthest and showed him my back that any one passing by the windows of the office would not be able to conclude that he and i were engaged in any sort of conversation at all are you expelled i said there was no reply are you timothy iagain he said nothing and i could not stop myself from turning around to look at him timothy are you expelled i'm not timothy professor said timothy gravely but not without a certain air of satisfaction i'm afraid you are precious antodoke did not work come on timothy i said cut it out the moon's not even full to day now he turned toward me where were you he said i was looking for you i was in m the ditch with the aunts i nodded i heard you talking to them before are you aunt man no domming why not cause i'm not anybody you are not anybody either we fell silent for a while an just sat there not looking at each other kicking at the legs of our chairs i could hear missus gladfelter and mister butebo talking softly in his office mister buterbot calld her elizabeth the telephone rang a light flashed twice on the secretary's phone then held steady thanks for calling back doctor shacter i heard mister buteubout say yes i'm afraid i went to see doctor shactor a couple times i said he had my grenauts and the fembots he has stretch armstrong too said timothy i now why did you go see him timothy said did your mother make you yes i said how come i dunno she said i was having problems with my angerr biledel i guess i was mad about my dad and things he had to go to jail timothy said you are dat just for one night how come he had too much to drink i said did you visit him in jail timothy said no tupid god you belong in special school timothy i hope they make you eat special food and wear a special helmet or something i heard the distant slam of the schoolds front door and then a pair of hard shoes knocking along the hall here comes your mother i said what kind of special helme said timothy haunt man wheres a helmet missus stokes entered the office she was a tall thin woman much golder than my mother with long gray hair and red vany hands every morning she made timothy pancakes for his breakfast which sounded oqay until you found out that she put things in them carrets and left over pieces of corn oh hullo paul she said and her eyour voice missus stokes said missus gladfelter coming out of the principals office it is been kind of a long afternoon for timothy i'm afraid how is virginia said missus stokes she still had not looked at timothy oh she will be fine mister butebo said just a little shaken up we sent her home early of course he added her parents are going to one us b eak to you of course said missus stokes i'm ready to do whatever you think would be best for timothy i'm not timothy said timothy oh please timy stop this nonsense for once i'm cursed he leaned over and brought his face very close to mine telled them about the curse professor i looked at timothy and for the first time saw that a thin dark down of wolfish hair had grown upon his cheek then i loked at mister buterbau and found that he was watching me with an air of earnest expectancy as though he honestly thought there might be an eternal black magical curse on timothy and was more than willing to listen to anything i might have to say on the subject i shrugged are you going to make him go to special school i said all right pau thank you said missus gladfelter you may go back to class now stell later timothy i said he did not answer me he had started to growl again as i followed the secretary out of the office i looked back and saw mister buterbau in missus gladfelter and poor oled missus stokes standing in a hopeless circle round timothy i thought for a second then i turned back toward them and raised and imaginary rifle to my shoulder this is a dark gun i announced everyone looked at me but i was talking to timothy now i was almost but not quite in meris it is filled with darts of my special antidote and i made it stronger than it used to be and it is going to work this time and also there is a tranquilizer mixed in timothy looked up and bared his teeth at me tn i took aim right between his eyes i jerked my hands twice and went timothy's head snapped back and his eyelids fluttered he shook himself all over he swallowed once then he held his hands out before him as if wondering at their hairless pallor it seems to have worked he said his voice cool and reasonable and fine anyone could see he was still playing his endless game but all the grown ups mister buterbar in particular thok vary pleased with both of us thank you very much paul he said i'm not pa i said everybody laughed but timothy stokes he shape on reading an extrept from his short story where wolfs in the youth can findit in the quention of short stories of the same name is thit hi's novel just came out is called moonglow coming out kids talking kid talk adults not understanding but you will as i special kid say that arned is things addition of our programm continues in a minute from chicago bubogradio when our programme continues this american my from or glass he'c we con appeem of course we choose some theme bring different kinds of stories on that theme to day's programme kid logic we wanted an hour filled with stories in which kids empoy kid thinking especially the id thinking that is perfectly logical but completely wrong headed nd we' arrived at at three of our programme at three the gamaind over till the fats ome man things a little kid stuck about a crush or love are they talking about more or less the same thing that adults me by those words why how we jackowits remembers how he thought about love and grad school he wanted girls to him but they never seemed to ho he is looking back on it i think part of the problem was how i thought about loveis akid i had a few ideas abut how you gets some to love you that in rect respect one particularly helpful to me first i thought that if they can see me sleeping they would immediately fall for me when i went to sleep each night i would cauchusly try to sleep in acute way just in case the girls hat could peep on me i wiling to a feedle ball if yo kitten and scrunch my head and fom my pillow hands under my head i image at all he popular girls intentime cruelly pranking me bat a ladder and climbed wito my bedroom window but instead of painting fastso or whatever on my window as plant the collect of parts of melt as they saw me sleeping a babe an angel veried snuggly inte my blankets i gess was some cross over but kid's knowledge of what was not doing to adles plike to romance my second theory was that they would fall in love with me if they can see me reading aloud this conclusion came out of my exprence with niece's and nephews would faut all over me when i read to them by age six i was already and uncle and i felt to selept me a certain maturity often i resus time i go to the back of the classroom and read from a selection of kid's books all the kids would gather round in a circle i port hre books percy the rose eating donkey affecting the voices of the different characters and speakig with a preachers sweaty carisma i muth sor why but e've one of my class seemed to love the way hanmd it up the only prom with this was the girls in class ended a treemenlike their uncle they call me uncle howy and talke to me in baby talk leade me a stoy uncle how he on but get me wrong i love the attention but i want to lave not ove i had all these ideas about love and of all the girls i knew my theories were most intensely targetat one gir at most talkular girl in school carren she became i most serious crush i carried torture for caron from great one great six thoug carrn did not seemed to me much one thing i've learned about love on t v was that if one was sincere love cin break all boundaries i believe thathe would come a momen where i to speak the words i love you to carron wit such tenderness nd tears that i would break her heart and she would cry too confess her love i would allow one brave tear to travel down my cheratually troutean jont lic cayo t very very ter now years later in friends with carn atual friends with both her in her husband allan i even worke for him for a while lecann and i have talked be fore about her elementary school days usually steering the conversation towards how mean she was to me ut i've neverly spoken with her about populove i wanted to know what she remembered whether she knew i even had a crush and her at all fo who are your interest we will clt wi go yeur by year an ki definitely at interest a barysalli the dan i thete teygad more in milter yes yes yes notice if she does not mention even though it was far in the past youi crush is still such an awkward thing to talk about when i finally did tell her about how i felt about her when we were kids i sort of mumbled my way through it back peddling all over the place i even forgot to actually point the myke at her when i was in the elementriy school you are a big crush you see thout i t i ealize that there is a cason loe maybe it the time i knewba bu no g actually le me when i think back on it now one time in the field keep toll me to talpl you ihe said if you talple her she will you and ha no be popular itess the thing funny the story now is thats very good advice ii ma a i we i ibasically woud apen as i was standing off to the side lines i was not i wasten to often picked to play tis was lak coet game an semi very fun and i keet said a mistal carin the ball it yous youm hou e compent is aurs till you tackle he hallin tackle tackle a hot and you be popular in the emmine

bed a liketimes the way young kids reactis or or show affection is through physical yeu gos telling you before that we you nw i wrestled with marry because hoe juest want to be close this is not how she felt about it at the time because i felt the harder i tackled her the more popular i'd be i took hit down it was prison football the game came to an immediat and ev one circling carrns writing body the football near her liy totaly still she was holding her leg looking up in me saing you toble lat you broke my leg can does not remember any this she does not remember how she then jumped up got four five of her girl fromts in a huddle i miraculously cariagraphs and imprompt yough keeping corse line of fatsol men to the tune of the village people's matchol man fat fat man i would not to be a fat man fat fat man i would not to be fatso at that point the all through their hands up in the arin unison er i remembered perfectly but then after all it was my crush she had no recollection of the time the score talk for called her daisy duke and then trn aound calle me bosshon of the fitness daye that i beat hin a chariets of fire style race she did not remembr the big story them ol a six great graduation dance now the last ancs was starin to heaven ni want to the dance that answerd you but i could not because as was walking i line of people walke by and block me and then in it was gastpat second but then you were in the arms of a great seven really that wi t en doing a crash our grads exgraduation thence who is it ido ery lat he was tallent in thehad longish haire and he came to the back door of the jim they do not memb the last ance now you kiss this gentleman did iik ca paor mak a kis im mi that i know thin i was making at int ti no by adlestandrirds it was i and id say by great sextanted you ont ly it turns sat the can remembered exactly one story about me whele my most vivy memory of you is sitting in class and the teacher asking us to plutter homeward and you beev yo das and the paper kind of overflowing outef that desk and you rammaging frantically throug the dest trying to find wat homework and we were asked to take out and not being able to find it an our teacher wacking apty desk and everyone knowig what was coing because it probably hapen two days before and the teacher just th lacing in to you and damthing the conen dets gono ltanot anin lik and when dos when that happened dat i seem cool lice a bad boy now every on ha very e that here wo more than anything i wanted carrinto knowice me none that way i think the problem with my theories was that i expected her to fall fror me the same way i felt for her that she would see me from a far reading to our class mads sleep in little prince i thought that iswhat it took for some one to fallw month i wanted her to think that this was the real mu i wanted to think it was tveal me and the truth of it was that the real real me was getting screamed at and hw me as desks spild up on the ground each nan is a wacan lev a griwl in great six that waill never have again ti something about kids or at least the way i was as a kid that is purely romantic in the truest love son ateering sense if the word only a year or too later mi seeries in the ways lov a change drastically by semth gread i had some speen the bottle sessions under my belt and i had concluded then instad a dreamy about a true love i could not have i she get a little bit more pragmatic about the whole thing one night after deciding i wanted to have a real girl friend i called up i dentical twinsisters at len darleanan elizabeth darlen answered i told her that i liked her and asked her she to officially go out with me she kindly told me that she only me as a friend but she was flattered no problem i said is elizabethal she passed me over to her twin ho i made the same offer to a elizabeths sic shirt and that was it ther that is wat twins was the difference i figured we went up for two whole months it was great how he chackways is the creator writer and artist behind howy action commices me me ack for and small thoughts meet to big brains i cey saw all this hour we have been talking about kidlodjec and sometimes the incorrect logic of childhood dare not i get corrected during childhood it does not it get corrected till much much later when childhood is long over halkmomberg explains i can reconstruct the events that li made at one of the most embarrassing conversations of my adult life the chain starts back when i was eleven or twelve and i first heard the term nilson family i's probably listening to some adults talk and from their conversation i gathered that networks consulted nilson families to find out how popular a tellivishon shi was but that did not make sense why would they only ask people named nilson which shows they liked did thinking i knew that when they ficgured things this out they did not ask everybody they just tats a small persenat iv people and than extrapolated i think i ficgue they would done some research and found that the name nailson because was a common name maybe and iad seemed to cut a cross class an economic lance actually came pretty close to a representative sample i knew this was not the way they measured public opinion now but it seemed the nailson surveys had been around for while and i figured they wre just to hold ovher from o more primitive lestatistically regorous time after that i relatedn't think about it again or if i did it was only with a mild curiosity i wonde wy tyveestill does not that way fas's forward twenty years i was talking with a friend of mine who as telling about her friend who would been selected to be in nilson family and i said to her is not weard that thei're all named neilson my friend looked at me for what seemed a long time somewhere during her very long pause because of the very long pause in fact i realized of course the notall name neilson i makes no sense at all at the time of this conversation i was thirty four years old andi could not believe i got inthis far without ever stopping to think it through made me wonder what else i'd missed anif thit is ever happened ot any one besides me twhen i was a kid and i would see the school crossing signs and as a picture the little kids walking and i would sase school exting and i thought that the excing was a word n i pronounced to sing turns out i'm not alone i'v been talking to people about this for weeks there is lot of was out there me and this woman joddy mace carding around our childhood believs well into adulthood jody though thre we lots of zings dearsings railroad ings i make sense wells o my twentis and i was walking in to work and about ten geese walked in front of me in the sidewalk and om i just turne to my co worker in casually said it looks they should have a sing sign there for the geese those sor of a long alkward silence thend i saw it that he was thinking that really is a good idea but instaid he was he finally said sing is in a word an talking to people i found out that a lot of these lingering miss conceptions involved mis pronunciation and often e miss pronunciation survives into adulthood because the mistake just sounds better or makes more sense it should be a word and it should be zink ayou know you do not want a kid to walk slowly across the crossing she smart he is gone to sing consider the word miss led i talk to three people including my own father whe used to pronounce it misels all three believed it was the past tence of a non existent verb misel which means to deceive or to miss leed there is another goy spoke to who thought well into his early twenties that the word case o ia whwas panish for what is the deal tmost of the common childhood ments the babies come from storks tet corrected sooner or later hou'gh not obscure enough to sneak into adulthood un scrutinized but occasionally even a very popular childhood minth can make it through unicorns you knowin my had a unicorn was not really any different tan a zebrat this is cristy cruger i mean in terms of believability i think the unicorns really ahead of the dina sor what well i mean when you think about a dinas er it is from ma kids perspective i dynah sor is i these really large you na monsterous animals roaming tha earth and then you have a unicorn which a spacically just a horse with a horn is cristy crewgrer grew up she says that if she ever thought about unicorns they warenta grassy plan somewhere in africa drinking from watering hole with the wildowghbeast in the ampalla and then one night she found herself in a conversation at a party it was about a group of five to seven people kind of standing around the cag just talking and somehow a discussion of in dangered species came out an which i posed the question i'm is the unicorn in dangered r extinck and a tasically there was a theg gaped of silence as you might be gathering at some point and all these teris you come to a bi gap of silence and then everybody lauhe and then that laughter was college i more silence when they realized i was not laughing and om i was pia i o god an unicorns are not real oo no sometimes a ridiculous belieful surviving to adoult hood andit is our parents were to plan robin did not thnk there was anything strange about the wish wasers she lived together with he sister in apparence and a

to what great shafts they must be that they can make at dfferent meal every single night of the week and they just kind of kthey gon stared an theire what and i'm what what what is runnin through my head is wait a minute these people are implying that they had variation in their meal plan for their entire lifee itmind it is mine bending a mand i do not care what i learned throughout college this is the revelation that has stuck with me this is what i've learned all t a sudden oly got when robin came home for thanksgiving that year confronted her mother with the startling fact that everyone else sade things besides chicken growing up here mother jus shrugged her shoulders and said you chicken robin had to conceive the point even when they got out to restaurants robin ordered chicken they will had a here is one wore when harry learnd her was a girl her family was going through some leaniears there were two kids the house need repairs there was not much money for holiday gifts harry was seven and she wanted a bike her sister susan was twelve she wont of a set of insecle pedious but when they came downstairs on christmas morning there only two small boxes waiting for them what was inside them and we both had exactly the same gifed were these real ugly meddl tissue holders painted laughe wite these corne red and yellow roses am they were painted with these cheesy looking red and yellow roses and i looked at my tissue box and i started to cry and i looked at my big sister susan and i thought of course she was in a cry too and she looked maybe she was in a cry but then she soit of put on a big smile and then she told me that the boxes were painted by trained monkeys the box became harrit is prised possession she kept thit on display in her room throughoutl oer menteryscer hrough high school friends asked her about it sho say oh yet was painted by trained monkeys nobody ever challenged her on it may because she believed at herself completely then one day she was home from college back in the house where she grew up and i'm going through some papers ore maybe i was sneatino snooping through susans papers and i found a composition and it had her name on it that she had written it in high school and it was called the tissue box story i sat down on the floor of susan's bedroom to read this composition and susan told the story just as i told it except that she wrote how she felt when she saw me crying and how she then looked at my parents and saw that my mother was about to cry too and how she looked at the tissue boxes and thend she remembered that my father had a friend who made them and she knew how much my parents hated taking charity and suddenly even though she was about to cry she forced herself to smile and she pretended those boxes were painted by trained monkeys and then i'm and i ena of course i i did not know any of this but the funny thing she wrote in her composition is that she just rushed upstairs and started crying all over her pillow and she was not really said about the gift really is what she said in composition she was not sure why she was crying except that it was sort of ly she had volunteer to be a grown up before she was even ready for it wup until that moment i had never thought to question my sister's story i had never subjected it to the scrutiny of a grown up mind i mean i was twenty i i do not know i had this tissue box that was painted by trained monkeys and then it was not painted by train monkeys really bup until reading that story harriet thought that her sister's lies had been only to torment her lite the time harriets swallowed an applesed and her big sister convinced her that she had an apple tree growing inside her she always been jealous of her sister i was oing to be the big sister but reading her sister's story that day it realized how responsible her sister felt for her and for ther entire family how there were benefits to being the baby it was good to learn all that but the vision of the lie that we live in a world where monkeys can be trained to paint tried to give up aand really it is just that i con still picture this tissue box and how much i loved it this tissue box painted by trained monkeys i know what she means for me there is something appealingly wearied about a world were only people who hap pened to have been born with the name nuelson get sto decide what

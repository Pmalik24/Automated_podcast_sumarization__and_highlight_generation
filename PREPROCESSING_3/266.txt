i thing is made because the bad ones every part of them just fiels too obvious the couple meats but they hate each other at first they go through some things that make them you now wearn some important lesson about themselves from the very beginning tho can end up together and then no surprise they do when is not done well it is all two obvious and tired you coan feel the years working in

sleepless in siatl and a rom com scrip that never got made i's all kinds of thoughts about them and he realize this thing about rob coms and what is satisfying about the good ones they really think it is true i used to say that it was just watching just thek close ups of two beautiful people being funny and clever and witty to each other ye being ther are sot of besselves or sometimes worte woreselves but then eventually their vesselvs and that was kind of enough for me why s s tat's mad gryam and cave i climb wit the fake french hack sine in re french kiss n r in o n ony on an sitin in

they are all at the top of the list for this very reason that is f how much time the couples spends together talking take when harry met sally thing that i about it is that at least you get a vision of what their relationshaouts yis because they spend twelve years together before they finally get together you get to ee real fights you get to see they reallyship grow get to see their personalities

bonths in bunney you wanted i i nit you a pair of wooll sulk your feet would not get cold in the lab you never make that kind of that fon tay all you do is think about yourself that is in correct zan to sid what about emaladiim it took me nine months to sent thesize that element my named it off to you you were going to sent thesize that element any way emily sad you needed it for ou secret project that silver old thing in your lab and te ladyan was not about me it was about yo i mean for god siht you wont you can tell me what it does zante side is there anything i can do to make it up to you emily blinked back some tears i do not know i mean it is not you can just go back in time and get me a different present zanda's expression brightened wight there he said i'll be right back zanda hurried down the hall crept into his laboratory and locked the door behined him his time machine was right where he had left it he climbed inside the silver all and flicked on the pawaswitch his plan was simple travel back in time to this morning finding new gift for emily and bring it to the present but there were a couple of risks there was a chance for example that using the machine would caused the universe to explode he would never tested the thing out before there was also no guaranty that he would be able to find a good present he only had enough emiladium to fuel five minutes of time travel that did not give him a lot of wiggleroom wherever he wente he would have to shop efficiently zanda was usually a pretty good problem solver he had for example invented a time machine but qant in physics and newclear hydralics were trivial compared to the rigors of gift shopping he masarged his temples trying to remember if emily had dropped any hint slately he vaguely recalled her staring at a vasin cratan barrel but that place was full of vases there was no way he would be able to pick out the right one he was trying to remember the name of her favourite perfume when a thought entered his head maybe he was thinking too small he is machine could transport him to any time in place in human histury why go back a few hours when he could go back a few centuries he knew emily loved shakespeare she would written her senior thesis on one of his tragedies why not travel back to the glow theetter and swite pur an original script it would not be too difficult he reasonall he would have to do was dash back stage and grab one it would be the most impressive gift she would ever received in her life but which tragedy had emily written her thesis about he knew it was one of the king one's richard to something woul charles the something but there are bunch of those if he got it wrong it was too risky it was always jewelry he knew the general construction dates for king turts tom he could park in front of the pyramid run inside and snatch a jadestone he entered the cord nets and was about to push the lever when he started to second guess himself again buying women jewelry was always chantcy emily had very specific tastes i woul if she did not jade it was not ye be able to go back and return it he thought back to the night they met he was finishing his p hty at the time and his lab had closed early because of easter he would stuffed his papers into his brief case and shuffled through the rain to the hundred and sixteenth street station it was four or five a m and the platform was deserted except for emily it had been several days sinc zanda's last conversation with the human and when she started to speak to him he felt the stirrings of a panic attack but emily's friendly smile managed somehow to put him at ease she was awfully cheerful given her circumstances her metrocard had expired she said and the machines were broken she' been stranded for over twenty minutes would he be willing to sell her aride zanda nodded and watched as she routed around in her purse for some cash to pay him back it was a moment or two before it occurred to him that she had given him the chance to be gallant yuyou do not have to reinberse me he said i'll swipe you in for free she thanked him enthusiastically and then shockingly wrapped her arms around his chalso zanda was not used to physical contact and although the hug was brief it caused his entire body to tingle from head to to it was a startling sensation wite walking through an electrically charged field he still felt that way whenever she touched him zander was an atheist and believed fiercely in random causality but by the end of their shared subway wright he was sure he would experienced a miracle this wonderful person had shown up out of nowhere and given him a chance of love and in return he given her three years of misery he thought about all of his saturday nights at the lab ignoring her calls making excuses he thought about the way she cried when he handed her the tulips how could he make up for three years of romantic an aptitude with a single birthday present he closed his eyes and concentrated the hat to be a right answer clear patras crown jon of arc's sword e baby diner sor what was the greatest thing he could give her the very best present in the world it was the hardest problem he would ever attempted to sold but then as always the solution came to him zander parked his time machine by the hundred and sixteenth street station and dashed into the subway it was three forty five a n a little over three years in the past emily was standing by the turn style swiping and reswiping her expired metrocard he took a deep breath and approached her then me guess he said it spied metrocard she chuckled had i had a hunch come on i'll swipe you throg e that is i cae she said i'll just go to the machine upstairs or the machines are all broken he said you better catch this one he said the next one will not come for another twenty minutes before she could protest he took out his metrocard and swiped her through the turn style she smiled back at him with confusion are not you coming she asked as the train pulled into the station zander averted his eyes he worried that if he looked at her he would start to cry i nee to take a different train he said well at least let me pay you for that is all right he said his voice breaking it isa present he was about to turn away when shei leaned over the turn style and hugged him twas exactly as he remembered it her long brown hair brushing softly against his neck his entire body tingling with warmth thanks she said he tried to say you are welcome but the words got caught in his throat he waved good bye as she boarded the train then he marched out of the station alone tenurad ca in te hri story the present by siman rich from riche is book the last girl friend on earth at copisasse t stao simon riches

somewhere in jersey and literally when the smoke cleared and who is that tall boy with a cakys on in the big old chain in the curly hair how to i talk to him and om i conscious sort of inched my way over to him on the dance floor i remember doing this moth were were we both sort a roll and to each other's body and i can you get a wiff of his chicarna warnals oeo salos and my heart was beating fast i could herit and on opisses what love is i feel a porter we can mully ry walds likein any good first encounter there were magical coincidences we were walking out to the parkylot and we realized weh both at the same car masta proteges both ly spire mobs wits that a moment we e this is fate i mean not only did i go to this clo definitely unlike whyt out of all the cars in the world out of all the dance clubs he and me he was eighteen too but he seemed to rally grown up he worked at best by a selling a d vdies and he was also a drugdealer and in my mind els onmy got he cool he good mat he count quickly in case youre thinking drug dealer red flag he was barily a drug dealer he dealt we nearly every woman i know hi dated a wee dealer they quickly got serious and he was misschell's first bik relationship he was funny smart they had good banter and he was this incredibly accepting person made her felt comfortable confident about her body and about sex which she never really felt before she imagined a real future with him the plan was i mean looking back on it seemed basic but just to be with each other to have fun and to have kids and to go out to dinner after a move on a friday night you knows of garden cheesecake factory just kind of exist and a really ce apartment with base carpet in white blinds ye the american dream fast forward three years into the relationship theiur lives are totally in twined their families are closes thay vacation together it was that point of no return place in a relationship wherey just here it is this is it but there was this one thing that seemed sort of off a lack of photographic evidence no pictures of himself as a kit spes ifically kno school pictures no prom picture even his mom did not have any shots of him it was just weird and then one night i had a dream that he calld me up he told me that he never graduated high school i when i called him the next day nel i had this crazy drea he just started crying i could just here and gently sobbing and he is not only do not graduate high school i do not even know how to read 'm just how i thought i knew you what u have not we read something together their entire relationship flashd before her eyes one moment after another suddenly it all made sense and i was going back i realize on ma ad this is why we go to the same restaurant we would go to the same restaurant and he wouldoreto the same thing because he could not read them inew and i why he to go to restaurants that head pictures of the food i would write him poems o stuff and he is read them to me it is better when i here from you never want to go through his mail i had to help when he stopp and think about it the fact that he would been able to navigate the world convincingly and keep this from michell for over three years it was an incredible feat he must have been covering this up constantly when he told me why he did not kno how to read i just made my heart break even more i mean his dad died when he was young and his mam had to work three jobs and he was depress and jist dropped out of the fifth grate and nobody ever noticed his mm did not want to dea with it and ou know im mot judging cause it must been hard for her the only thing i wat kept going through my mind i remember was i want to save you i want to help you i want to make this better we are ging to get back on chack to what we had planed she was not going to allow this obstacle to push them apart she jump didn' to action this was before he could google everything some michell went to the library and did research on a dult litteracy she broke it down into manageable steps and wrode out a time mime for him my game planned for him it was i had a list of places he cald go to to go to night school a therapis he could talk to easy adult reading books tips and tricks as a whole sort of care package of had it just take it on and he was really overwhelmed by it unnos oquett this is a really big deal i get it michell's dist leks ic and her boy friend did not have a learning disability but still she could empathize with how hard it can be to read and at first michell's boy friend was totally on board with the plan but after a year of michel offering him solutions he still had not taken any action it just seemed he did not want to he got around the world just find without reading she started realizing a wait his eliteracy was a way bigger probe for her than it was for him and it really started pushing them apart i stoped being his girl friend i sort of became his coach or his or his mam and it was not fun for either one of us i tried every tactic i was patient i was nice i was sterin and then i lake con of bak dolfen whatever he needs to do on his own time it started to blead its way into every moment they shared together she could never fully relax any more even when they were happy she would snap herself at of it and think wait now ow we are forgetting that there is this huge looming problem and we have got to fix it before everything can be ocan she started to resent him we do not even laugh any more we are not even holding hands we used to we are not even having sex if we used to simply because you are not even go into this class if he just went to a class i would just be happy did you feel if you love me you will learn to read absolutely i mean is that weird but i tolly fell that i was who is gan a read books to our kids at night you got to get it together this was the vain if my exsistence sos and i could not really talk to any one about it cause how embarrassing as idid not one i did not want my friends to think less of him anum i wanted him to stel fee a man i just cond of carrid this by myself an o some point i jus look at myself mias hou got to go but even then if just how do i leave somebody win they are down well in a sense it actually it made the relationship last longer because everything became about him reading and if you could just crack that or fix that then maybe would work out oh my god what a you sock to fill wut tit ye i mean i fee i always live that if i could just lose those twenty pounds if i could just have a clean house all the time i could do everything i really want to do on my list and yet there was that we could just get past this than will live the life wor suppose to live that is the promise of an obstacle you feel all you have to do as conceret and you get your happy en how would it play out in a rom com the obstacle being his iliterosin ye oh o ke o he learns had to read he writes a new york best seller situation it becomes a movead channing tate an place him the sabonay place me and we live happily ever after with a bunch of mixed children in huge apart with bage carpet by shescape actery a mathing she i was imagining

secretly going to night school the whole time o i now and said he just foc to stripper oh ke she was not a stripper but she was sleeping with mishell's boy friend mi shell suspects that the entire time she was struggling to get him to read he was cheating on her she was focussed on the obstacle she thought they were facing she totally missed it of course since ram comes go the thing missing

police that is in a minute for cicago boa gradio when our programme continues tis maric in life from my re glass to day's programme for valentine's day rom cam stories must have taken from real life that mimic things that we have seen in romantic comedyes we arrived to dike three of our sho that three the ran this of course in rometic comedy is the scen where somebody has to crosstown at some point literally sprinting to chase down the person they love and stop them from yther marrying somebody else winning them back somehow it does only send up at the airport but lots o these do and honestly i have con say ilways surprise we found this ever happened in real life but here is one story that merca coens a dad used to to tell this story ives about his own marriage he dot couple years ago his name is rom the story goes this when he was getting together with maric's mam mersus mam debby drove across the country to move in with ron in forida and for tu left she had the post office forward her mail to his house in forida and he saw a letter arrive from her exfiance i think it is crazy about my dad decided that he saw that letter and he had to read it this marissa he just open the letter read the whole thing and is my dad put it my mom's exfiazce was declaring his undying love for her and was begging her not to go and was saying he wants to get back together with her and my dat treaked out he decided this is it it is now or never he decides he is going to meet her indawlus which is where she is in her car trip and also is were the exfiance lives he hurries to the airport the way he told it was he was going through the airport running through the florda air port gets a ring out of a little gumbal machine puts hoer much that costs a corder r whatever in the gunball machine om pulls out a making maushring because it is florda naturally i'm gets on the plaine flies and meets my mam and dawlis and wrihte there n the airport gets on o ro me the second he sees her i had no plans of seeing h axtiance at all what soever was merca's mam debby she had no idea the exfiance had written a letter ore the run and opend it all she knew is that he had offered to drive the rest of the way across the country with her and was convmener in dallis airport he gets off the plain and i greed him and practically the very next thing out of his now is ly marry me am any opens up a his and and an is hand he is got this little making moustering in his hand and i am not proud of my reaction at all do ev lin to hear it ye look areyour y iship les are you grazy this is the graziest thing i've ever hearid of i barely know you that was my reaction i to say that is my favorite part of this story i ould hav been a little more gentle now what i love about it is that in the movies when somebody does a gesture that often it is way craziers than what he did yes and kind of stalkragh but the movy just acts oh thot was a totally lovely thing for per son to do sbecause h unlovel out and i that you had the normal human reaction that a normal person would have would be a you nuts right right rigt right yem we i'm to pragmatic to fall for that one i guass julive e ventually did went out though at the wedding in addition to a regular ring she also wore the making outs s herewas anonthe straborhood about somebody running to wind love which actually kind of paralleled the run that happens at the end of neelsfavorite romcom when harry met sally when harry met sally the way it goes is that it is nears eve harry's wandering round the streets o thing youark and he realizes that he loves sally has to tell her now breaks into a run to go tell her thit is very new york centric in this one because heis charse to catch o cab and of course t canc than he is dislike he is jus gin a run the entire distance devi castonbam has ar real li version of this story bet a gy name steve snider the thought that some one actualy made one of these runs in real life seem unlikely to me that i wanted to see where it had happened retrace the stepson i met steve weare the run began at this burger place on ludlow street in orsay stepe 's the kind of gui who is not very good at hiding his feelings li get this were movy you could tile it say everydhing the set up to the run is this he would met this woman emily the birthday port he was totally smith what i

di jest i na that i wanted to talk to him bat i just did not know how it is i next between wanting to be right next to somebody an in runaway and hide julian was young twenty she had boy friends but nothing too serious and they would always liked her more than she liked them until jeoffrey they were working together at his shakespearfearer in new york at the end they put on a production of the winter's tail in stage shed sometimes get distracted that he was there that she would forget her lines sometimes offstage she thought maybe jeoffrey with flirting with her but she could not tell forsher and anyway she had a rule never sleep with a cas me for four months she kept her feelings to herself cut to the ide of the final cast party every ones at the bar that they always go to and it is the first night there no longer coorkers on her way over jilian makes it her mission to try and kiss him that night she talks to him alot at theparty but keeps chickening out finally she gives up and desightes to go home and i was standing there and as getting ready to to haile a cab finishing up the end of a cigarette and i felt him come up next to me and i he just it was kind of i remember him just brushing back hair kind of off of my cheek and is that moment where that you are actually in a kiss an he just feel it in your two bodies and just very lightly pressed his lips up against pine and ten it was a when othe can actual deeper kiss and and i know from the outside we made it look ta cause it very much felt one of those a good stage kiss eafter their perfect first kiss everything falls into place on cu he invites her back to his epartment she flicks her cigarette to the curb he opens the dor to the cab she glides into the backsat mor kissing en sus i do nothink that is poy the first ime i've ever made out with anybody in a back of a cab i vincars probably this cab driver's here they make out all the way across manhatin over a bridge and up five flights of stairs somehow jeffrey manages to unlock the door without removing his lips from jiliam this impresses her very much everything is going perfectly then i useis bath room because i've been drinking a lot of bear all night and and i'm nervous i notice that my hands are shaking in the mirr and nervouss and it jus look myself in the eye and i actually gave myself a peb talk point her fingers and dancing in the merre on being this everything you waited for is actual ly happening it is excitement nervous i believe in you mer then jillian encounters the first obstacle and wha will turn out to be a very strange night for her and my whole heart just sinks am i'm not actuall gan be able to have sex with him i just caught my period i realize that making ot with him in the back of the cab and and just my cigarettes in my leather jacket it makes me sing the cars is really cool sitty girl but the reality of who i am is this very nervous an person who grew up very conservative very very conservative jillian grew up on a farman rurld canadam this one time when she was young and got her period will wearing white pamts her whole family participated in a weird game of denial every one jus pretended she sat in sim jam she dinni to see the word period it was something that was kind of very hushhush and and not something i was used to disgussing openly jilian thinks there is no way we can sleep together to night she is disappointed and she is stressing over how she is even gen to tell him but she cannot hide in the bathrer much longer he is waiting on the other side of the door si laughed the bath room and it was i stepped out into another world is romantic world where he ectually taken a scarf and put it over a lamp ike lighting ti sis arange move lihtin he did not have a shurd on and my mind remembers and glistening he probably was and actualld thistening but that is how my mind remembers him we checked her mind remembers rigt jeffrey told me and he sike yet a very embirrassing looking back but while she was in the bathroom he flathered on bbe loile to make his muscles top any wite they sait to kss and remember at first being really into it in the remembering situations from my mouth just thet thing were it curls up a little thig and we kind of laugh a bit and it goes into kiss me again i d thet thing where i pull away again and he he was sweet he was wait what is going on he know asked it he read it right away in was we do not have to do this ike i want to be clear nothing is expected of you in this situation we do not we do not have to have sex and i was i want to i really i honestly i want to ah it is just and i cept hy to think of howam i gan afraid this i think of this thing that my room at used to say an she calls at her aunt flow mos i look at him and i i tell him that ah my aunt flow has just landed and she is very much in town and he gits a little bit confused u yes me if if my aunt is just arrived at the airport and if i have to go see her or something then tay i just i fess up and i tell him ic no i i have my period and ia'm pretty sure i whispered it and pretty sures i have my perit a and he smiled tis half smiles as li would you mean and he just he did not care he did not care he was older than her group with a bunch of sisters sulian is briefly astonishe considers this totally new possibility not caring is ide she is into it and they start kissing again and because is as the family show i will just say that everything that happen next went really well in fact it was the first time this particular act ivity went quite well regilian i felt i finally understood what it was aboll i member a lying there and listening to his heart beat ye just listening to his heart bate is such a comforting sound i can still hear it distinctly an and after a while he gets up to go to the bath room and he kinnin exflicts on that little light she is talking im out the lant by the bed and i i turn off that light and he flicts it on again i turn it back off we have this little ered moment laughter and he leaves and i turn the light on again and t looks a crime seen there is blood everywhere this is the first time i had seen much of my own menstrel fluid i was afraid of it i gar goudn't even fathom what he was going to think about it just when jilian thinks it cannot get worse she looks up from the bed and then i do not now how this happened but my very own red beloty hand print is on his white wall my god i just panic julian tears the sheets up the bed and throws them aside next the handprint he nov any water anything in his room shall use my own soliva to wipe that the bloody hant i half of the wall a out out dam spo nec she bundles up the sheets but she has no idea what to do with him she starts to put them in the hamper but then realizes that he would still hvpe to take them and wach them himself which she cannot bear to imagine she peaks inner his bed to see if she can stach them there but then she thinks no no that is creevy he will still find them jeffry'll be out of the bath im any minute she is running out of option i stuff them into my own back pack we were you take im oh ye will have to get out of there oou an can geto man mi that to you have gett in now to the sheets got i know but i was not thinking about that at the time all i could think of that i did not want him to have to wash these sheets and i did not ii did not i did not want him to have to clean up my mess i guess to cover her tracks julian throws the comforter over the beds you cannot see the sheets or missing shrains the pillows and gets ready table when jeoffrey comes back from the shower she makes the balame excuse about why she cannot see the night something about having to go to work early the next morning she could tell how flimsy it sounded as she was saying it and i just oh it breaks my heart but i remember him looking hurt and confuse i i wish that i did not leave i wish that iad stayed but she did not jeffrey offered to help julian hal a cab but she was no it is find i'll just take the subway she walked to the station totally miserable that it really hits me that i have stolen this mans sheet how do you come back from that how do yet how are you not the wearld girl who took his bed sheets y then i'm inside myself and i hear this foie being mam excuse me madam and i look up and in new york they have this station outside of subway entrances with i likfolding table upon the an ly pety stands behind and its ait is a random beg search no and here julian does what any sensible leading lady would do when confronted by lawn forsment i pretend i do not hear them and i try to ixset the sebway station i wel a brisk runwalk and nothing looks more suspicious than trying to avoid a rendom beg anshor shud e at oh the officer catches up to jilian unsips her back back and pulls out the sheet which re covered in blood i remember him and the subway has such distinct liting i just remember him holding up these sheets my menstrel sheets of shame menstral sheets of doo an i realize that they did not look menstral sheets of do they look murder sha aci he asked me to explain it and i just ar crying and i can barely get the words out just ie trying to explain to him it is my period on thos sheets and i stole the sheets from the gy that i was with and i know it that is wrong lik i know it the actual theft of the sheets is wrong and i promised the officer that i would return them im but i just inneeded to wash them first the police officer loiks jilian up and down asks for er ide and points her to go stand in a little box taked on the floor by the wall she watches and walk over to his partner and have a very serious looking conversation the sheet stay crumpled up on the plastic folding table he comes back and he gives me an altamaton we can go down to the pret seets am and they can file of report and they have got to keep the sheets just in case it is evidents onether gong to ask me abut her questions and follow up more i can take him back to the apartment the apartment that i just came from and have my partner corroborate my story and i had to think about it i honestly i honestly gave it a really solid good think there was a huge part of me that would rather go to the police station that have to go back and sho jeoffrey these not only showin these sheets bould also bring the policeer o but my my common sense cat up with me if ike this looks i've done something very wrong they makes the long walk to jeffrey's apartment fiolently they get to the doorstep in buds wait fory jeffrey to walk down five flights upstairs when he gets there the police officer does all the talking good evening do this woman jeffrey says he does that they just been hanging out then the cop reaches in to jillian's back back and pulls out the sheets do what these are jeffrey says does there my sheets the police officer asks can you identify the substance on these sheets and i from being fascinated athout hesit hesitating and almost li can tis stronger voice he just has menstral fluid you ei i will call lif here hid andy thing ater then what it actually was sofor hing to a look a police officer rat in the eyes and just say very confidently menstral fluid jus the sounded scientific and very grown up the cot having fulfilled their narrative purpose and successfully reunited our couple leve and then in alone deffrey im trying to apologize to im namely for stealing a sheets but allsare just forr jis just for everything for bringing the police back to his house julian remembers sobbing through all of this she is mortified all of ta sudden jeoffrey stops her and soys this thing that still hits stillian in a soft spot he told me here is for looking at me an yous ere's strange long wonderfully strange everything that you could possibly think of going wrong wet wrong and it it all still turned out o qet he still liked me no matter what this is my favorite moment in any romcom it is a scene intendthing iy head about you an julia styles reads her pom to hefletceir in front of the entire class is jack nichellson and as good as it gets telling hellen hunt how he just cannot believe she runs into strangers all day long and they do not know that they just met the greatest woman alive and of course that is mark darcy at the bottom of the stairs telling bridget jones i you very much just as you are to me the whole point of romcoms is to set up that line is what we all want to hear and say to the people we love most but wea does not guarantey a plot line that pushes us to say it dan we is one of produces of our shew julian and jeffrey dayto for a few months and then they broke it off when real life new jobs her expired veasof from canada got in away says she is gladit ended efor

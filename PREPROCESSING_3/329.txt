welcome to the huberman labpodcas discuss science sciencspace to i mandrew huberman and am professor of narbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day is an ask me anything episode or a m a this is part of our premium subscriber channel our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for this standard huberman labpodcast which comes out every monday and is available at zero cost to everybody on all standard feats you do applespodify and elsewhere we also started the premium channel as a way togenerate support for exciting research being done at stamford and elsewhere research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health physical health and performance i am also please to inform you that for every dollar the huberman lab premium channel generates for research studies the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health physical health and human performance if you to subscribe to the huberman labpodcast premium channel please go to huberman labdoc com slash premium it is ten dollars a month to subscribe or you can pay one

you that are not huberman labpodcast premium subscribers you can still here the first twenty minutes of to day is episode and determine whether not becoming a premium subscriber is for you without further ado let us get to answering your questions the first question is about resveratral the question specifically is and i quote there seems to be a lot of conjecture about resveretral and whether not it can extend life span could you please tell us your thoughts on thi subje ect will i will indeed tell you my thoughts on this subject and i'll use it as an opportunity to also give you my thoughts about supplementation for sake of longevity that is for extending life span more generally resvertrol got a lot of attention some years back because of at the time it was believed that supplementing with resvertrol could impact certain cellar pathways that would extend nochust the life span of those individual cells but perhaps the life span of the entire organism meaning us humans and as a consequence supplements such as resvertral supplements but also grape seed extracts which we know contain a fair amount of resvertrol or can be converted into resvertrl also received a lot of attention for the potential to increase life span i think by now twenty twenty three it is fair to say that most of that thinking has been lest just say debunct i think that most people understand that while indeed resvertrol might have some positive effects on the functioning of our cells that there is very little if any direct evidence that resvertrol can increase life span if you are aware of any data to the contrary that is modern is highly controlled and even better was carried out in human studies or non human primate studies or even mouse studies please put links to those in becomments on you two because i love to see those studies especially recent studies but my current line of thinking is that resvertrol while it may have certain health benefits does not seem to increase life span now with that said that does not mean that things resvertrol or grape sea d extract are of zero utility in fact i take four hundred to eight hundred milograms of grape sea d extract usually with a meal as just part of my standard supplementation stack every single day but i do that mainly for its effects on vascular function and blood flow and a few other effects that grape sea extract has been related to ithe data there i would say are reasonably strong strong enough certainly that when weighed against the potential downsides of taking grape sead extract including the cost of grapesead extract lead me to take four hundred eight hundred melgrams of grape s extract per day i just do that as a and a general insurance policy against the number of things and it is part of a small kit of supplements that i take that fall into that category meaning supplements that appeard to be very safe certainly at the dosages that i just referred to supplements that potentially our having pausive effects on ourselves and that are verily if not very low cost that is why i take grapesea extract i do not take it for its potential impact on resver tral and resfer tral related pathways per say and certainly not to extend my life span that basically answers the question that i was asked which is what are your thoughts on ert'sver trall for extending life spn my answer was i do not think it extends life span but i take something related to resfera trall for other health purposes and by the way i certainly would not place grae sead extract in my list of top five or even top ten supplements if somebody for instance said no i want to take anywhere from one to ten supplements i and i have ex amount of budget i to devote to supplementation and i'm thinking about taking grape seed extract would that be one of the topten supplements you recommend it i certainly would not put it in the top ten and by the way at some point in the not too distant future i will put on line sel produ a potcast episode listing out all the supplements that i takin the ration i'll behind those and how long i've taken them in the effects that iave observed both subjectively and in my blood work and what i recommend other people what i do not recommend other people what specific to me and on and forth but meanwhile that is my answer to the question i do not think resfr trall in creases lonchavity at least i'm not aware of any direct evidence for that in humans now with th t said let us uss as an opportunity to talk about some of the other called longevity supplements and drugs that are often discussed on line ind elsewhere in terms of their efficacy to increase life span about four or five years ago there was a sudden and increased attention on n a d related pathways for increasing longevity the na d pathway is some of you may already know is a pathway within all of our cells this is a pathway that is highly active in young animals and humans but all animals an humans across the entire lifespan make n a d in their cells it is related to celler energetics that is the production of energy and cells it has direct relevants to mytecondriol function an mito condro function to it and that is a discussion into itself but suffice to say that the pathway leading to n a d includes things such as n are n n n n n r and n m n are considered by many to be precursers to n a d o caswhy my telling you all these acranyms here is the deal the argument was made in fact by some prior guests on the huberman ladpodcast and elsewhere that by increasing n a d levels in our cells that one could potentially extend life span and there are generally three ways in which people have attempted to do that it will talk about whether not increasing n a d in our cells actually increases life spen and moment but for the time being lets just talk about some of the ways that people have tried to increase n a d within their brain and body the most typical ways that people have done that is through until very recently supplementation and there are supplements out there such as n ar which we know can increase n a d levels this is taken as a pill or a powder from typically as a capsl or a powder or by taking n m n which and here there is been some less to say debate as to whether not taking n m n a ctually leads to increases in an ad within ourselves whether i can get into ourselves whether not's converted into n ad and on and on but there again the idea was by taking an ad either in capsal form or it sometimes taken as a sublinguill powder that one could increas an ad levels and thereby potentially increase life spen and then there is a third way that is commonly used to try and increas an ad levels and that is by infusing by interveneous infusion or in some cases by orl administration either liquid or pill form ana d itself now i confess that i have tried all three of these approaches ok i do indeed take an n r supplement every day i take five hundred miligrams of n r i also and have separately taken an n m n supplement i take sublinguel n m n i'll take anywhere from one to two grams of n m n as a sublinguil powder which has the name suggests you put it under your tongue and it dissolves there it is get this canitangy flavor and the goal for me in taking n r an n m n each day and i should mention that sometimes i have just taken n m n or just n r to do the comparison between n r and an m n for me in a subjective way just comparing what are my energy levels how do i feel whether not there any side effects in then i've also taken them together and iave arrived at a protocol where i take n r nd n m n every single day and the goal of that is indeed to increase an a d levels within my system however really want to emphasize thus i do not take n r an n m n in order to increase my life span in fact at this point in history it is unclear and seems somewhat unlikely that increasing an ad is going to increase life spen but i think we should always keep our minds open there may be data to arrive in the future that shows that that actually does happen in humans now there are some animal data suggesting that increasing n ad either by takin n r and or n m n can increase life spen but frankly that is not why i take n r and n m n i take n r an n m n in an effort to increase an ad and now i realize what i'm about to say is entirely subjective and i really want a high that what i'm about to describe is my experience it is not based on any pere reviewed studies when i take n r nd n m n at the dosages i talked about a litlebet earlier it gives me a lot of sustained mental and physical energy throughout the day now i've always had a lot of mental and physical energy but i'm forty eight years old now and i'm interested in doing anything that i safely can to keep those levels of energy as high as is a reasonable right i do not wat have much energy that i cannot sit still or much energy that i cannot sleep at night but i find that when i take n r an n m n in the morning typically i'll do this before my first meal i do not really regulate how close it is to that first meal i'll wake up use the bathroom hydrate at my sunlight a do all the things i've talked about onother podcasts but i'll take my n r an n m n sometime usually within about an hour or two of waking ut and typically at least thirty minutes to two hours before my first meal which for me usually arrives around eleven a m sometimes i'll take it long before my first meal an any event it gives me a lot of energy and i seem to have that energy throughout the day i have gone periods of time where i stop taking n r nd or n m n and whil i did not feel as if i was completely depleted of energy i did notice a decriment in energy compared to when i took n r an n m n now i want to be very very clear i have no zero financial relationship to any company that manufactures n r and while i used to have a relationship to a company that made n m n as of recently there is an ft a ruling that has made n m n not available as a supplement in the wider world earlier this here that is in twenty twenty three there was a filing for n men as a experimental drug in a clinical trial and as a consequence n am en was elisted as a band or not allow to be commercially sold supplement and that has to do with some of the legality around clinical trials and when something is listed as an experimental drug it cannot be listed as a supplement none the less you can still find n amen on the open market if i knownot amazon i cannot really speak to the purity of one source forses another you will have to explore that on your own but i will say this even thughi said it before i have zero financial relationship to any company that manufactures and sells an emen at this time or an re at this time the short summary to this whole discussion about and r and an men is that i take an r and n emen but i take it because i how it makes me feel it increases my energy levels in the morning and throughout the day and it does in a way that tapers off nicely in the evening and i can still fall asleep et cetera i do not take it with any expectation that it is going to increase my life spen simply because i do not think the data substantiating the extension and lifespan are here yet they may arrive at some point but i do not think that they are here yet there ae god number of people out there that still take an r and ere an emen and are doing in efforts to increase n ad and let us take a moment and talk about increasing an a d directly because that is something that i have some recent experience with and that is becoming more common and is yes still after e approved at least as far as i know there are companies that can come to your house or you can go to facility and they will give you an ana d infusion they will infuse you directly with an ad into the vain i've done this twice now and i will say as most people experience when they do in anady infusion its pretty darn uncomfortable in fact much that a lot of people have to take anti naugiumeds in order to get the enady infusion i opted to not take the antinaugium eds not because i'm particularly tough but because i do not taking additional medication if i can but i've taken anywhere from five hundred to a thousand miligrams of anady by infusion i did that at times when i was feeling particularly run down itwere post illness and i did indeed find that after the anadiinfusion was complete i felt much much better in a number of different ways improve sleep an prove vigor i coming off those illnesses i felt much better but again there is no clinical trial exploring anad infusion forsake of vigor et cetera that i am aware of i just happen to be somebody whos interested an exploring these a tools in techniques from time to time and i deemed this as safe whether not safe for you you have to explore with your physician also i do want to re emphasize what i said a moment ago those anady infusions are pretty darn uncomfortable you can have the the person administering the infusion adjust the rate of the infusion that the drip is slower which makes it more tolerable as opposed to tryingto get the whole infusion bag in there in forty five minutes or lass i just want to get the whole thing over with i just said put in as quickly as you a reasonably and safely can it took about an hour before if i mence to an hour initially i felt naucious i felt some one was stepping on my chest i felt some one was stepping on my legs i felt well i've just felt lousi awful and then after about ten minutes it passed and i felt fine and then after the infusion was done as i mention before i felt terrific i was still able to fall asleep that night just fine although i did make it appoint to do this earlier in the day i have heard of some people doing nydy infusions later in the day and having challenges with sleep but again that is just anecdotal or reanidata if you want but it is anecdotl it is generally assumed for obvious reasons that anady infusions are more effective at increasing cellar levels of anady than are an are or n men or both together although the direct comparison has not been made as far as i know and there still this general question as to whether or not any of this stuff is getting into cells directly an impacting nad levels in specific cells although i think most people assume that the anad infusions certainly are now there re number of different experts out there who debate all the fine points of everything that i just said people doctor charles brenner people doctor davidson clare people ma caber line there are people who really actively and less just say heatedly debate all the issues that i just talked about i think the greatest debate is around whether or not increasing an ad levels and cells actually increases life spand but there is also debate around whethe or not n are is more advantageious than n amen whether not all of thus is too premature to explore et already yend i just want a restate for the third time i do not do any of this stuff in these enad pathways forsake of increasing life spand i do it forsake of the vitality and energy effects that i subjectively experience i must say that the anad infusions are expensive enough in convenience enough and 'nless just say uncomfortable enough that i do not see myself doing them very often although perhaps may be doing them couple times a year or more make sense should i find myself feeling run down or postillness fatigue or things of that sort i would be very curious to learn from any of you the audience what sorts of things you have experience when if perhaps you have explored an or supplementation an immen supplementation or nady infusions and as i mention earlier there is now a growing number of different products that claim that you can take anad orally either in pill tincture or other forms o no requirement for an infusion but i'm not aware of any studies that have directly linked oral n ad to anad levels in cells and how those two things relate lots more important science to be done in this area lots more debate surely to be had am atd any time we talk about supplements i just want to emphasized several times that i docy supplements as indeed supplements i think only by getting your light exposure sunshine movement neutrition stress modulation social relationships et cetera correct should you even begin to consider supplementation because supplementation is just not at the foundation of mental health physical health and performance it is indeed something that provided it fits within your safety and economical frame works a could potentially enhance mental health physical health performance in certain ways but it is certainly not the foundation from which you build mental health physical health and performance now we have talked about resveretrel lubit about grape sed extract we talked about n r animan an anaty and the anaty pathway there are a few other things that are commonly discussed in the longevity sphere let us call it a things such as met foreman i'll just be very direct and say i do not take metforment and i also do not take what some people call the pormen's version amet foreman which is berbering berberine gives me brutal headaches buerberine lowers blood glucos u why i think it is giving me brutal headaches a lot of people have explored or thinking about exploring taking met foremen or berberine forsake of lowering blood glucos and lowering a particular celler bus to say pathway or said of molecules m tour being the most a common of the mtormamalian target o rapamison is abundant in developing cells its responsible for the growth of individual cells and the amount of m tour in our cells tapers off across our life spand m tour and its pathways is something that ihave actually worked on fairly extensively in my laboratory in the context of the regeneration of the visual system some very familiar with it and for sake of convenience and ease ind this conversation we can just think of m tour is something that is abundant in cells during development an any time cells are growing including the growth of tumor cells and cellaor growth at any stage of the life span the logic that people have waged is that drugs met formen or compounds burberine that reduce mtor levels or impact the emtor pathway and ways that lead to net decreases in emtour the logic is that that could somehow increase life span there is also the logic that fasting can reduce emtour which can increase life span i doft think there is any direct evidence for that yet however at least not inhumans i'll tell you i do not take berbring for the reasons i mention before makes me feel uncomfortable i do not not psychologically will not makes me feel physically uncomfortable i do not take met foreman because expert colleagues of mine including doctor pe rtea have come on this potcess in fact we did a collaboration journal club pod cast that will provide a link to in the shownote captions during which we meaning mainly peter reviewed the dat a the purereview data on met forman and life span and at least to my understanding at present there is not sufficient data to support taking met foreman for increasing life span that is why i do not take it i may in the future if more data come out and things change but right now i see no reason to take met forman to increase my life span i do not take met foreman similarly there is a love discussion out there about rhapamisin remember emtour mamalian target of rapamisin is named because it is a target of this drug which is used largely is an anti cancer drug but has other purposes as well rapamisin is actively under investigation which a makes it sound there was a crime committed but a s far as i know there was not a under active scientific exploration would be the more accurate way to say it by excellent researchers such as doctor mat caber line up the university of washington in siatle he is been looking at rhapamisin for its ability to extend life span focusing on many different species including dogs as a dog longjevity projects that is really interesting doctor peter attea 's talked a lot about rappamisin and did a recent podcast about rhappamisin with not only matcaberline but one of the experts in the world on em tour invite you to check out that pod cast if you want to learn about rhappamsin there is a fair amount of understanding about the biological pathways of rhappamisin and em tour and on and there are clinition physicians peter as well as others who are quite excited about the potential for rhappamisin to extend lifespan although you have to go directly to peter to find out exactly what he is doing whether not he is taking rhappamisin or not i certainly cannot speak for him but at present i do not take rhappamisin why do not i take rhappamisin well i do not take rappamison because at least to my i a the data at present do not justify that forsake of increasing lifspin it that is not say that rappamison isn' an effective drug for the treatment of various cancers and for other purposes but for me at this point in time i just do not see a good reason for me to take rhappamisin relative to some of the let jus say substantiated potential side effects are rappamison is a drug that i think can be taken safely under certain conditions but has enough of a side of fect profile that i'm not interested in taking it forsake of increasing lifspan at this time no metphorman no rapamisin for me right now perhaps in the future i've listed out the things that i'm perfectly willing and happy to do grape sey to extract and are an an amend the occasional anaty infusion to increase anety directly and for the time being i've decide to stay away from metforman and rhappamisin but of course any in all of that could change going forward depending on the data that are published in my own experiences as a final point on this i want to again emphasise that the foundation of a quality life and a long life is most certainly going to come from the bas ics perhaps the most fundamental and important of which is to get sufficient amounts of quality sleep each night we know that not doing that can indeed reduce your life spand if not directly than certainly indirectly by increase number of accidents and certainly being far less happy and energetic during the day that is fundamental also and this is very important to emphasize and here i'm essentially borrowing the word straight out of doctor petertyis mouth forgive me peter this will not be nearly as eloquent or sussinct as peter would make it but it is very very clear that at present there is no supplement or drug for increasing longevity that even comes close to the known improvements in health matrics that relate to longevity that come from getting quality sleep and especially from getting sufficient amounts of quality exercise that means both a commination of cardiovascular exercise a minimum of a hundred eighty to two hundred and twenty minutes of called zone to cardio per weak ye that is cardio that you can carry out while still maintaining a conversation but should you increase the intensity any more you would have a hard time completing your sentences but in addition to that also doing some veo two max works or geting your hartraght wayway up at least once per week and also of course doing resistance training either with weights machines or bodyweight doing that at sufficient intensity sixsets minimum pur body part per weak to maintain notjoust muscular size and strength but equally important perhaps even more important maintaining nerve to muscle conactivity which correlates with cognive function and a number of other important longevity matric again exercise sleep quality nutrition quality social connection which means eliminating as pest you can toxic social connection and increasing quality social connection people that you and enjoy spending time with and feel enriched by stress modulation all of these things are key an of course getting morning sunlight all of those things combined to have a huge outsized effect compared to anything that you could take in pill capsle or infusion before even considering taking any supplement or drug to increase to your longevity or even for increasing vitality for that matter get those basics of sleep sunlight nutritian movement stress modulation or stress control i should say and relationships down get those right and get that morning sunlight to set your circadian rhythm because of course youar circanin rhythm is what anchors it all and i'd be completely remiss if i did not episize yet again that any time you are thinking of adding a supplement or removing a supplement from your regiment or adding a prescription drug or removing a proscription drug you absolutely should consult your board certified physicion thank you fr joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the hubermn labpodcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to huberman ladodcom slash premium just to remind you why we launch the huberman labpodcast premium channel struly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard huberman labpodcast channel which of course we will still be continued to be released every monday in full length we are not going to change the foremat or anything about the standard huberman labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which hthin we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aim toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channels huberman labpodcast in other media channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides tat s kinds of answers in the first place now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they are going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the humbern lapremium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m s you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some prmium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocals of huberman laponcast episodes not found elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health and performance you can sign up for the premium channel by going to huberman labdac calm slash premium again that huberman labdaoc calm slash premium and as always thank you for your interestin science

welcome to the huberman lapotcas a science science pace to e r i mender hubermen and ofm a professor of neurbology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor matthew johnson doctor johnson is a professor of psychatry at john sopkin school of medicin where he also directs the centr for psychodelic and consciousness research as many of there is extreme excitement about the use of psychodelics for the treatment of various disorders of the mind doctor johnson's laboratory is among the premer laboratories in the world understanding how these compounds work how things cylicipen and elestee and relate compounds a low neural circuitry in the brain to be shaped and change such that people can combat diseases depression or trama or other disorders of the mind that cause tremendous suffering doctor johnson is also an expert and understanding how different types of drugs impact different types of human behaviors such as secual behavior risk taking and crime doctor johnson and his work have also been featured prominently in the popular press such as articles in the new york times in michael polin's book had a change your mind and in a feature in sixty minutes about psychodelics and the new emerging science of psychodelic therapies for treating mental disorders during the course of to day's conversation doctor johnson and i talk about psychodelics at the level of what is called microdosing whether r not it is useful for the treatment of any mental disorders we also talk about more typical macrodosing what those macrodoseis entail and he walks us through what an experiment of a patient taking psychodelics for the treatment ad pression looks in his laboratory from start to finish the conversation was an absolutely fascinating one for me to partake in i learn much about the past present and future of psychodelic treatments and compounds and indeed i hope to have doctor johnson on this podcast again in the not to distant future that we can talk about other compounds that powerfully impact the mind and human behavior and perhaps can also be used to treat various diseases before we begin id t emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocosto consumer information about science and psience related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast he eason i started taking athletic greens and reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which are vital for microbiompealth i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gut microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interact with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probices to support my microbio if you to try athletic greens you can go to atletic green stock cam slash hubermen and claim a special offer they will gie you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in vitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things lykecharvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stoccam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar o talk many times before in this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodia magnesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those sells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and ifhydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatios of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement do cam slash hubermen nd you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase theire all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element do cam slash huberman and now my conversation with doctor mathew johnson omathew i've beenlooking forward to this for a long time mi m a huge fan of your scientific work and a mear to learn from you likewise big fan and happy to do this with you i thank you my first question is a very basic one which is what is a psychodelic we hear this term all the time but what qualifies a substance to as a psychodelic nomenclatur is a real challenge in the ere of psychodelics to starting with the word psychodelic igist if if your farmacologist it is it is not very satisfying because that term really spands different farmaclogical class is another words if you really concerned about receptor effects in the basic effects of a compound its spand several comclass is of compounds but overall it is really more of a a cultral term or a it does have a relation ship to drug effacts but it is at the at a very high level all of the called psychodelics across these distinct a classes that i can talk more about the way i put is they all have the ability to profoundly altar one sense of reality and that can mean many things part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self u acutely when some one's on the psychodelic the different classes thatcan be the specific form a calogical classes that can be called a psychodelic are one that what are called the classic psychodelic in the literature you will see that term and hallusengen and psychodelic ore all have traditionally been used synomnymously i think there was a littleof the tendency to stay away from psychodelics of the baggage but there is been a return to that in the last several years but the classic psychodelics or classicallucigens are things alest sylisivon which is in called magic mushrooms it is in over two hundred species that we know of far of mushrooms a dinathal trip to mean ordm t which is in dozens and dozens of plants a mesculine which is in the paote cacdi and some other cacdi san padro and even amongst these classic psychodelics there are two structural structural classes that is the chemistry thete's the trip domean base compounds sylicivon and dm t and then there is the phanethelan mean based compounds ities of the basic to di basic building blocks that that your starting from either a trip to mean structure or a phanethelan mean structure but that is just the chemistry the all of the what is more important or at least to to some one me are the receptor effects and then altimate leadatcan have a relationship to the behavioral and subjective effects all of these classic psychodelics serve s agonist or partial agonists at the serotonan two a receptor subtype of pseratonan receptor then you have these other classes of of of that yu compounds hit you could call psychodelic another bit big one would be the inimdia antagonists of this would include cedemen pc p and dextrom athoripment something i've done some research with which folks might reconize from robo tripping guzzling a culser u which is something kind of highschal kids are known to do when they cannot get hold or real drugs that type of thing a large overlap and the types of subjective effects that you get from those compounds compared to the two a agonist classic psychodelics but then you have in by the way this description this framework i'm describing not every one will agree some people will say no psychodelic only means classic psychodelic there is different opinions here but you have gash savonorna which is a capa obioid agonist which again does that come from e savia divonorum it is a plant o became twenty years ago wat sort of popped onto legal high scene and there is a me a long history of this predating in arnat going back to the stuff onecodor in the back of high times magazine inmost of the stuff never worked ye whits the smoke enough of anything made you little lightheaded but this is one of those things tat popped around twenty years ago when it quickly got the reputation holy ship the stuff actually works and works really strongly in these smoked extracts particularly people have these reality altering experience is unpar with smoked dmt the classic psychodelic often in we did the first blinded controlled human research with savonorina lots of inity contact feeling that you in the experience of one is actually inner acting with atonomis beings that type of thing and an you have a another big one probly should have mention even before the no savonorna u but you have imdam a which really stands in a class by itself it is been called in intactagin and and a what is that men u it means a a touching within e sort of eludes the idea that it can really put some one in touch with their emotions it is also been called in and pathagin in ccan afford empathy but i think intactagens probably that is the the term that i i tend to focas on and i know i'm not telling you anything you do not know but the for the for the u viewers that that the primary mechanism of imdia ma is seratoneand release and to a degree other monoanmi release openmean serotoneand and structurely thats also in the fanetholaman class which contains masculine the classic psychodelic a but also emphedemi sojust aterall is is is innat fanathel mean class an sis is is other example were chemistry does not dictate i mean you can tweek a moleculat mit have that same basic structure but now you have profoundly changed the way it inner acts with the receptor in imdiama does not a exert its actions by a i to say by bie by in mimicing the base ball intering the glove the post a a synaptic receptor side in acting as an agonists o mimicing the the the the indogenos nearer transmitter sertoneand the classic psychodelics to imdiama works on the picture side of just basically throwing out more of the natural the biandag do not sing more sir do not be more sarton an flooding ye senabs i get the impression that the psychodelic spase is te en ormous cloud of partially overlaping compounds ri a meaning summer impactin the sartonan system more than the dopomin system others are impactin the dopamin system ore the than the sirtonean system given that the definition of a psychodelic is that it profoundly alter sense of self at least that is included as a partial definition can we break that down into couple of sub category for instance on hallucinating ought either auditoryor visual o synestesia perceptioal blending the psense that o you can hear colors a and see sounds for instance a common a report opea take psychodolix a insufficiently hydosis hallucinating senestesia and then in terms of sense of self as a noro scientist i think an what does it mean to alter sense of reality really what the brain does i in a very coarse way is to trying figure out what is happening in space physical space and that physical space can be within us or outside us in what is happening in time and o as a vision scientist the simplest explanations when i move my hand from one location to another location it is measuring the space the location of my hand in space over time and then you get a rate and a your speed and all that kind of stuff right yet that get's more comply as ye ento the emotional om ream but is it fair to say that psychodelics are impacting the space time analysis that the brain is performing and thereby creating hallucinations and thereby altering the blending of senses is it fair to say that i think it is it is fair to explore that ariad here hears what i'm thinking the the clearly there is a change relationship certainly at the rit os of orientation an space time i think as as ai'm primarily a behavior is in in terms of farmacot human behaviourformacology and always go to comparative phamacology cake what can we say that is it truly unique about the classic psychade or psychodelics in general bith that description om thinking o ka alcohol can really throu up yeur time space a rentaliaception your patreosastalor and in many ways in inser in those gross motor ways far worse been o course everythings to is dependent but in the classic psychodelics o obviously debens it asipines being verysintly out same thing i'd wanted dig in a little more in terms alike may be there' something more specific we could say about that relationship to time in space that that the psychodelics are tinkering with but i'm not sure it is an interesting hypothesis that the idea that is a mediator that that is something that there is something fundament ul about changing that the representation in time ins in space there might be something to that and i think of these is is psychlux is profoundly altering models were all were prediction machines and that is larg much of that as is topped down and a and and psychadelics have a good way of loosely speaking dissolving those mdels and and one of the the realivous an example of one of a model a i know that when i throw a ball in the air it falls down not up that is it that is a prediction that i learned as a child tha i did not come into the world with a brain that knew that relationship between objects and gravity but one of the first things that a child learns is the relationship between objects an gravity in their trojectories yet and with a fore year old i mean i saw that at earlier ages that experimentation a yet that is what happens ot right i i if he were to throw aof your a chil were to throw all and it went up into the sky that would be absolutely mind blowing it would be atn adolt to i be prepsychadelicate xpere it is oaly right and there is that there is a spke there is a rule there your saying there is a a kind of a a a prediction bit there is a rule that that underlies a prediction that when that rule is violated all a sudden the circuit presumably for that prediction go it does not ot a li i o i noomhow it creates a surprise element or a were a ye gnition awemen and it is not filtered out a the and this might sound extreme but there are these cases it was over overblown and through the propaganda the late six ese early seventies but thereare credible cases of people and it is verie typical of sounds they really thought they could fly and jump out of of a window now far more people hery here fall jutteming who knows grat thet they fall and die out of from height because her drunk it is is extremely rare but therei some pretty convincing case there was one research volunteer in our studies a that a it she looked she was in one of our studies that she was trying to dive through a painting on the wall she was fine but she reviewing the vedeo it looked she really thought that she was going to go through that painting and ete she wear the other dimention yes ane violating these predictions u ye i the reason i ask it the the question the way i did is because given the enormous cloud of different substances and giving the range of previous experiences that people show up to a psychodolic experience with a i feel the ability to extract some universal themes is is useful sputchey for people who have not done them before i in might i not have an understanding of what their effects are can we just briefly touch on the seretonan system and the dopamean system i want of acknowledge that as you already know that thereare many nermodulator systems in the body o and the op systems can av anoi systems but there is something profound about the seretonean system in the dopeming system becaus the way i defined a nermodulator is it is a modulator it changes the way that other circuits behave and essentially it up it increases the probability that certain circuits will be active ind decreases the probably the other circuis in in it in a general sense compounds elesty ma surchagasa diafol mod and soliciban my understanding is that they primarily target this seretonan system how do they do that at a an of general level and why would increasin the activity of a particular seretonand receptor or bachosertoneand receptors lead to these profoundly different experiences that were calling a model challenge s challenging pre exysting models and yei mean at the end of the day it is a chemical and these receptors or scattered around the rain with billions of other receptors ye what da we think is going on it in a general sense ye yend this is really the area of active exploration and we do not have great answers we know a good amount about the receptor level fror acology some things about pose receptor signaling pathways in other words just fitting into the receptor clearly o sertonand itself is not psychodelic kenitelor else wud be tripping all of us all the tim i ean't a bagl i get siratoneand release rit im an there is aand etrary daving the natless afan right my understanding seretonean is that inginvery broad strokes that it it generally leads to a state of being fairly it pushes the mind and body towards a state of contentment w in the immediate experience whereas the dopeming system really places us into an external view of what is alther in the world and what is possible ye tha there o something i mean that is consystem with my i understanding and a and and i'l certainly not in terms i do not primarily identify s an a ineurascientists a definitely tell the the views that were far more ieurdema demain here than mine but interms of hal psychodolics and other drugs interface at the at theneurascience level o feel freeda to explain it at the experiential level ye it does not a it i think probathere probably are some audience members that are interested is at the fivage to see is that the layer five nerons and corge that conversation we could old than that is an interesting conversation but just in terms of the experience of syrutonurgic verses dopomanargic drugs ye they they do seem to create distinct classis of experience i think that is that is te the brier level for us to discuss them and in terms of how they and i i'd to explore the viology a little bit here and tell you sort of what is known in what is the iideas are is you have this pat as ou now these are levels of analysis and it is o which one is going on its almost for the particular question which level of analysis is most appropriate is it is a question best addressed by the biology the the the chemistry or r the physics i that i think of repseptr level post receptrsignalling downstrung affects another a other nero transmitters and then on actavation level effects and then cornation of actavation you got the clearly that with the classic psychdelics the two a actavation we we do know that there are downstrom effects in terms of a increasing gluetimate transmission this is likely a commonality why yocedemi is very psychodelic and psight different way but people who losin the do not can yes yes and it is more dissociative someone is more likely to sort of a be less behaviorly active ifthey have a really hide us they goin to a kayhole and anat the going o really hidos usorral ther ca unconscious yet not an ahole but a k a khole very different thekaholen cedemens interesting as people can take kind of bumps and con a dance on it with the sort of an alcohol level strength of a effect om anezero the class ic kind of raving you no use of it but then those folks want a tie trate their dose because a if they do more a line you get up to seventy five hundred milograms then you are talking about if you are in the dance floor you are on on the floor and your friends are trun to makesure people are not stepan on you that is yo whyai' ot somewodyn want to take a dissociate of an aesthetic iy to me it is completely mysterious as to why someone wl want to dissociate from their body people claim that these these the inthese enindia antagoni psychodelics are extremely encycl in in a very similar way to the experiences with the classic psychodelic an kedemin is now legal for the reputic ri right provado the the the the intrenasal form marketed by chance and which is escademy n is inrsrun of the ye it is prescription and u fo people are taking in the nasal spri ye and then are they under going talk therie whele they are doing typically not its iis as very interesting in their much work that needs to be done it is not treated as psychodelic therape and by that psychlctheripy i mean you tell the person there gn to have an alter experience you tell them to pay attention to that exp rience that they might learn something from that experience and afterwards you discussed that experience with spravado ethe model is spravado is is escademine fok a it is the the yet that the spray form of cademin thats it is been after ye approved for treatment resisting depression but it is you will you will probably feel different ignore that that is a psito fact that is an adverse ef fact a just ignore it a we do not think that has anything to do ith the way it works a but just get this thing it is it is a direct sortof kemo theraputic he fact in a sense it is it is it is not facilitating a learning process now there is older work there was a guid cropitzky in russia that did extensive work with hierdoses of cademy i should say spravado at the prescribed osas is not very psight it is a pretty lodose it is in the mild psychodelic range but it is not very strong but this older work that happened in the nineties an early two thousands and in russia a theyre reasing very hydos is in treating at a psychodelic yet treating it as if it was a psychodelic thereic you knowther with telling people you can have this experience it is cona were hoping you learn something from it were can help you through it in is discussed afterwards and they found incredibly highrates of success and some pretty well controlled trials for both heroine addiction an alcohol a a addiction i think a whole lot of work needs to be done now and you see some of the cedemin clenics that are using cedemy alflavel a lot of them ar treating it psychodelic therape there is essentially no research at this point on that do you get better results a straight apiuce of spravado there is some good variability but it is anti to press an effects last about a week a but the kickin immediately now a week is a long time for most most psychiatric drugs you take it every day right sa that is amazing but it is still just a week wersing effects ya year or more later with with with sylicivan and and some of the classic psychdos that could be a formo cological difference or could we that they get a lot more milage out of cedemine if they treated it psychodelic theropeence that is some soworthot leans on a really just our our syliciventic a yousessions which i know i haven described but briefly you have anywhere from four to eight hours of preparation getting to know the people who can be the guides or the therapist in the room wa maybes to walkus through this am let us say i were to come to one of your clinical trials cause these are coletical trials iner atyour lavat hopkins ye and a would i need to be depressed or cigous be somebody who wantd to explore psychodelics it we have had studies for all of these sok ant and a number of other dissort healthy normal studies oat the code for not a problem to fix but were all he that is what is amazing about psychodelics the because you if you adminishe them under this model and you develop a relationship an give ahidos of psydoc y can be healthy normal without a dignisible issue but man fere all human in the issues seem to come to your surfice but we have done work with a smoking cessations o people trying to quit tobacco and have not been successiv variety of reasons i maybe i'll just ask some very simple questions at the cona stepus through the process let' say i were to sign up for one of these trials and an i qualified for in these trials i show up you said i would do several hours in advance of getting to know the team that would that would be present during this psychodelic journey first there screenings ats kindof a a couple of days of both psychiacticallic structured inpsychatric interviews about your hole yet yo your past and symptoms across the the the the assend the psychiatric bible to see if you might have various disorders that they could u disqualify you th the main ones being the psychotic dissorters sketsofrinian were also including u by polar ser the manic side of o bi polar soso after that s anall carty of ascular screening heart disease after that screeng thin the preparation were you get you are both you get you develop a the re peter wre poor with the people who were going to be in the room with you your guides but you are also then didactically ser explained about what the psychodelicculd be and that is kind of a laundry list because theyre were known by their variability then it is gointo heat's not cocane youre going to feel stimulatid you are going to feel you can do any u sike you kow or a'l call your good probling in ta feel more relaxed it is i call uppers downers and all around ors and the psychodelixa all around os it is yet you could be you could have the most beautiful experience of your life er the most terrifying experience of your life this kind of laundry list of the things that could hapen tothers no surprises thing it is important for people to hear because te all arounders they the you really cannot predictile somebody is going to react internally i oneed jus briefly touch on something because we we left that topic but it occurred to me that a lot of these effects of psychodelics and how they function et cetera is still very mysterious but then i recall to mind that how most prescription an ti depressens work is also very mysterious they increase sartonan or dopemen or up and effern et cetera but why they take weeks on and several weeks to kakin et ceteras also mysterious be going back to the the the experience of of coming to your laboratory o cet let us say that somebody passes all the prerequisites and the and it is the day ams comes the day that they are going to have a this experience are they a eating mushrooms a you cureabout or are they taking in capsal form and howwhat sorts of doses are you prescribing as their dose response curve and then secondary to that to talk about mycrudose for macrodose how do they get the stuff in haw to people a receive it and how do they get into the ro they receive pure sylicive and the mushroom and there many species the most prive people ae taken mushrooms in the united states its it is most likely sy sylacibe cubenses o they are easy to grow they growin calpaties seasy fraining body to grom in their closit it does not take a a thousand lot liht canavas it takes a little oun a ten lit light balb and a toperware been those are what those of the types of mushrooms of pupatipically tape we are not administering those sylicivan is the compound you could draw a molecule sylicive and again based on the trip to mean structure that is a single milecular entity it is a white powder does it look ceratoneand molecuraly yes yes yes fres o wi look as arir shand bile the chemical structure or ceratone and the chemical structure of silicive and it would look quite similar right right and there is asily taking ceratonent it a modified version of seratone and which makes sense but it then again thits repeated theme of the chemistry does not always needly line up because masculine looks more a a dopheni than it does seratonan but yet it at the receptor activation level the pharmoclogeneur pharmological effect it is those are similar but but yet i mean and what it does at the receptor is in alternate its it is it is hiating the same swich but then having an alternate response at the receptor a we sover people that do not nas surely understand the relationsip between what we call ligan o the thing that parks in the receptor in the receptors the parking spoht one of the reasons that you can get such a variety of effects from different compounds is for instance seratonan might affect a certain pathway at o particular rate and a sylicidan might trigger activation of different components o that pathway different rates since you get vastly different experiences from two things that look chemically similar does it also a good a a reason why people should not just assume that they can cowboy their own chemistry right that what you see on paper and what you can mix up and aviles often vastly different a then what you predect it and there is a dose effect curve that is really interesting some of our early work with sylicive and a inhealthy normals a looked at a a trueplocivo plus four act of those as five ten twenty and thirty miligrams of silcivan body weight ajusted in a those milegrams pur seventy kilegrams of body waiy we have recently published of paper in our newer trials were we are dropping the bodyway adjustment as are going across hundreds of volunteers we have kind of figure out that that you should not really e you do not need to be adjusting by body way an yet well brainsize does not very that much between individuals yet yen and this is a brain effect mastily probly body as well o case the person in just the the yet powader oa lous hill rocyet and and not ontays thirty miligrams is a small y cfitted into a tiny little capsal and it will take about a half hour what mean where from fifteen minutes to an hour to kick in and non aver to s range was most of our studies ar are looking at where we we want a psychodelica factor in the twenty to thirty miligram range again because we have a justed by body wait and the average american is over seventy kilegrams about a hundred and fifty pounds people an in fact have god more me of forty forty five in a lot ic cases but it is still a small pill there t the session day itself is not full of for most of our studies is not full of tasks we really want to look at the ther peutic response obviously if it is a therapeutic study we wantit to be a meaningful experience and a research is found not surprisingly that you get a less meaning full experience when you are and an ethemor i or when you doing a lot of cognonan tasks we have done some research un un o that type for sure and plenty of colleagues have but when you are in a ther peutic study or if you trying to understand ther peutic affacy yet to recognize thereis is this this trade alf of what you can do our typical ther peutic model which again is not just limited necessarily to the therapeutic sudies we were trying to treat a specific disorder is is to you have that preparation you the person feels very comfortable with their gudes a nit all ultimately what i told peoples any emotional response it is all welcome i mean you could you could be crying a baby hysterically that is what you should be doing if that is what you feel and in a lot of way son as people with psychodelic experience u on their own it can be harder to train them in this model because in the real world people with psychlic experience lot times the rulers net hold your ships ayes sover friends go to party they split abag a mushroom thit is this is social pressure for good reason not to be the guy in the corner of the room whereevery one's trying to just have a good time relax crying about your mother your other friends or theire having an experience to in your being a drami king and blow of la and compose yourself hold your you are doing ome you are doing therughpy for people this is it is not just about the experience right and the experience is self as very much shaped by by that that container h by the environmen and it is agree to which when allows it to happen one should let go of control yet let us talk about the the letting go of control and then as we march through this u apothetical experience that does take place in your lapin we are using a sort of generic c ace example if you will a the letting go of controls an interesting feature actually because a one of the common themes of of good psychonalysis is or psychotherapy of any kind is that there is a trust built between the patient and the analyst and that relationship becomes a templet for trust more generally an trust in one self it is actually tha the engoll of good psychonalysis is that the patient actually one of the engols is that they develop an empathy for themselves which almost sounds an oxy more un butif you spendal time with that statement it it actually pands out the psychodelic experience is one in which chemically you are under a new new set of conditions right yetlet us coursely space and time or are altered in some way sense of self a for insas i might be going to a strongly and tereceptive mode where i'm focussing a everything within the confines of my skin where as normally or sort of interacting in space and pends and conversation and sor if i had occasiona i'll pain toucion my breathing but i'm sort of dilating my end contracting my focus for divertet all the time the letting go of control it seems to me could be sort of the expansion of one perceptioal bubble to the point where you are not actually worried that that perceptioal bubble is gon a pop or that meaning you are not worried about what people think of you yet you are not worried whether not your a brain is gan explode even though a thought could feel enormous ai keep going this it almost som psychodelic but that is the idea here a or if i'm paying attention for instance to some somatic experience am the the coursing of waves of heat through my body that i'm not suddenly saying is that weird i'm actually just going deeper and deeper into it ats essentially expanding a perceptioal phenomena how do you convince people to go further and further down that path what do you think allows them to do that because i think that that to me is one of the more unusual a aspects to psychodelics is that normally the the social pressure but also just our intrurnal pressure from our own brain is pay attention to many things at one is not just one is that specially these days yt thati ask wy multy task and the more that we focus on one thing the more bazaar that thing actually can appear to us right ry i mean even if it is the tip of your finger and you are not taking any psychodelis you spend a long enough looking into to your finger you notice weary wer yengs i that i think that is the classic psychodelic effect at r one classic effect an one have yuse many times of this example of whi people chunessirly i these are not these one should be judicious in putting themselves in these circumstances soe one co be yew having a very strong sillis ave an experien ance and theyr trying to navigate their way and man had not cross in the street and they might be staring into the hand and real that is their hand is the most amazing miracle the entire universe as sentially conspired to come to this one point to make this absolutely breathtaking it is almost i think of the simplest form of of of well we know the simplest form of learning is habituation simply keep a plying stimuli and there is less respects this is what organisms doe this whle we have to do and it is theirs is is habituation component that li is habituate yes a would not be able to get through life if we would not be able to cross that street if we were lie hoe this is a miracle we no i'm glad you brought this submem an here on reflecting my bis as o vision sides is but most people do not realize this but if you look at something long enough it eventually disappears to it pers it does not actually disappear but perceptioally it disappears youove these littl't micross iccods that insure that it does not whut most of us do not look at any one thing for very long ri the the brains default is to perceptionally jump around crazy with the visual system with the auditory system we all eighdydy n you i ti wat eity dealok this sort of baked int are underlying net workept some lubble and then we hat we can force attention but it sounds o sycadelics the one of the primary golls the reputically is to really drill into one of these perceptial bubbles and expand that bubble and the safety seems is the safety it sort a permission to to do that without worrying that somethings going to happen right because i've had people there on the couch on yet remember one lady said is is pibly a thirteen fourteen years ago said mat tell me again i cannot die i feel my heart is going to rip through my chest and she was afeeling i aitand i should say typically cardy vascular response is as modest that the a pulse and blood pressure go up somewhat it can be dangerous for people if there at severe hart risk and we do oner this we do yet we sother on other into a variety of devise yes o every half hour or we we take there on prodical we yoev space at a little further further an to the time course but we take their blood pressure in ther pulse and if it goes over certain level we have a proto caln we have had to do is only a few times but physician comes in gives m al anitric listern under the tongue and a ou no nox to blood pressure downlope it does not affect the experience o we have it all in place even tough they probably we find out of an abundance of cautious ure un but but yave it some one can feel that my got i onot die i i have never felt my heart be thhis before and the epirits of the breath can be just absolutely fantastic it into this sort of the breath is outisly interesting because it is this auta automatic you no control but it coul in also be voluntary people gegin into a sense of i got what if i it sounds silly a thurder r y brath exact but people that can be compelling it one other retan't get back to one of your questions is what do we do to kind of allow them to go further into these bubbles it is a one as as wearing the eyeshades we do not call em on blindfolds cause that has a negative connetationly pink kitten ou and their proliseeing a lot in there anyway blind is not the appropriate right right its that never thought of of ese to be inner sight shades a but when you close the eyes the levels of activity in the ratina actually are maintained its sponte is just spontaneous activity and it seems an i'd be curious about your thoughts on this n a but the way i describe it is that the in a the minds i the o this kind of loose tern we use can be on rock of booster a lot of times for some people a compounding solicidement for some people there is know perceptil affact a they are looking at this room and would pre pretty much look the same sometimes folks a yan things seem a little bit brighter not some people will say ma got there is waves that wallas waving in these curtains that on these compounds people do not tifically see pink elephants you do actually get that in another class it did not mention the the anti callonergics a sir atropine and scapoluming those drugs those wo that those of the true holloucinations were you thought you were having a conversation with some one who was never there ina thet am we will definaly get to those but when the reason i kind of crinsions that will my when you talked about those is that knowing a little bit about the pharmocology of a seet of calling the the idea of manipulating that system to me sound very uncomfortable because a the whole idea of of witches and flying tere was a whole history there your hundreds of years ago called witches taking these agents and then thinking they were flying around on broomsticks and things of that cedand and there is a lot of mythology round the broomsticks its comvegate but but that sound very unpleasant one thin i i about the serternergic leth jus i for with sylicide and u there is a peran expansion of a particular fairly narrow percept it could be sound an emotion could be sadness could be a historical event or fear of the dansur and you have mentioned before that there is something to be learned in that experience ye there is something about going into that experience in it in an ununin an in n undeterred way that allow somebody to bring something back into more standard reality ya given the huge variety of experiences that people have on psychadelics given the usariety of humans that are out there but what are now very clear it therapeuticaf facts in the realm of depression what do you think is the value of going into this fairl ly restricted perceptiural bubbl what we are calling letting go or giving up control because if the experiences ar many but the value of what one exports from that experience is kind of similar across individues that raises all sorts of interesting questions and this is not of a philosophy discussion were toying about biology and psychology here ye let say i decide domon focus on the tip of my pen i mean in the psychodelic state i could fall in love with this pen i do have no these pilent vefives i savents very much but i could feal real love ye for the pen yey that is not an unreasonable thing to expect on a psych in a psychodelic turn ri anin the context of your laboratory model which i thing is a great one that experience would be just as valid as me going into the experience of some of the deep friction that i might have with the family member over my entire life spin ye and yet the export from that those two very vastly different experiences is one of feeling a better relationship to the world into one sell i what is this tellin how about pen and the process in your child on tromout both lead to rite ye what is this a me it at that level it raises this question first of all how why a manore just what are your thoughts on that this is deafiling and the this is in the trrain were figuring out theres no the educated speculations the best i can provide but i i think the best that that the the te mo i think the common denominator are persisting changes an self representation tell me nore about self representation that is a the way one holds the sense of self the relate the fundamental relationship of a person in the world i mention earlier that these experience seems to alter at the models behold a reality and i think at the self is the biggest model that i an a thing that separate from other things and that is you i am tefined by certain i have a certain personality and i i'm a smoker that is having hardtime quitting or am a depressed person that in a these myself as a failure in all these thing those are models to and and i think i think that change in supprerepresentation may be an end point for these different experiences and he may be the falling in love with the pen the whole idea that your especiall in contemplation afterwards and obviously speculating here but that whole idea that you could have such a deep connection with this random obviously randon aspect of of the universe could potentially lead to this i you transformed understanding of the self and the pen may be a proxy for the the meracle of reality in a way that realize nothing on i no supernatural thinking e know you can be a hard atheist and take this in ultimately o my god that just the pentis is that this is amazing the fact that we exist until ythere could be an extrapolation chair and you use the pen but i think it sounds a similar to all tosycley's classing description in the doors of preception of the chair and the drapes he took o five hundred melegrams of masculine he was just ot a higdosennes ye yet and that is a in yen that is a heroic dos for sure and he just going off in the cheriness of the chair this chairs exubiting the quality of being a chair and the enclimansion of the perceptioal bubble a narrow a narrow a percept that then grows within the confines of that narrow percept ythe sense of self is a very interesting a phenomenon if we could dissect it a little bit there is the somatic sense of self the ability to literally feel the self a into this process we call in tereception and then there is the the the title of the self that i am blank ye and i knows you said that several times its entriguing to me abu a good friend i do not think i u cannor should mention his name but he had a very long and successful career in a within one of the more ile teamsan within the sealteams and he u his a fairly philosophical guy a alsovery practical guy a but he has said many times om to me that the most powerful words in any language or i am because whatever follows that tends if you repeated anoff tends to have this a kond of feed back a fact on the on how you are in the world and it hat at the first passit it it sounded to me a little bit kind of internette psychology type thin i know the secret or seningson which frankly a i'm dising oor doe a yenos if you cind alike the whole thinke ut till you make it i i do not actually subscribed to any of that but in disecting that low bit further with him i came to realize that a that these words i am are very powerful i do not think you reprogram your brain just by saying them but how one defines themselves internally not just to other people but how one psychologically and by default in a definds themselves i thing is very powerful and depressed people as well as happy people seem to define themselves in terms of these categories of emotional states i think it is it is interesting that letting go and going into this perceptional bubble which is facilitated by obviously a really wonderful team of a therpus but also to ceraternergic agent allows us to petentially reshape the perception of self that is that is a tremendous feet of neuroplasticity right and i think certainly more work needs to be done and this is the the he the horizon and an ashu credit a crislethor be a philosopher an australia who a has a forthcoming book it might be out right about anhour or sent within the coming months a a psychadelics and philosophy ah a's the title of the book it is is it might be psychadelic philosophy reallis lekers latherfei wet well put a link to it right add ind his conclusion and this it is a really great book and he really plays with the ideas psychedelic experiences come along with a lot of supernatural stuff a experience it can certainly go along with that but the ideas i can it can these experiences and including as their putic effects be explained from a naturalist point of a a view and in his conclusion is that thet changes in self representation may be the commonality now thi could go along with plant spirits and the budta and shockas and whatever your model system in jesus all of that but it could also a be completely devoid of any supernatural and your religious and we do in fact sy alt n all of these variety i i i think there is something about this change and in sense of self there is it seems to be something on the identity level both with i think of the the work we did with cancerpations who had substantial depression anxiety because of their canse or and also ore work with people trying to quit cigarettes smoking i mean there is a real there seems to be when it really works this change and how people view themselves with smoking really stepping out of this model i'm a smoke or it is tough to quit smoking cigarettes i cannot do it i failed of much at times i remember one participant during the session but he held on to this afterwards said i god it is i can really just decide flicking off abut i can decide not tho smoke in is i call these da experiences with psychodelics ecause people often in tecanter say you say i'm causing most of my own suffering i can i can follow my appointments i can do everything but i can soplan for the i'm not getting outside in the sunshine i'm not playing with my grand kids i'm choosing to do that ands i they told themselves that before and the smoker has told themselves a million times i can in it it sounds when it comes out oftheir mouths an folks will say this aspart of the ineffability of a psychelic experience foolks i i know the sounds bulshit and thi sounds but my god i can just deside ther feeling this gravity of agency and which i think its interesting aus regardless of the the the the debates on the reality of free will i think the philosophy of that whether ther it is ultimately freel free will pure agent see if that exists which i'm skeptical of or just the idea that clearly we have a sense of agency there is something there whether it is the sense of agency even that is the human being has and that seems to be at times fundamentally lik k supercharge from a psychadelic experience this idea i'm just going to make a decision normally outela depressed person lie do not do not think of yourself that way you are not a failu lika oits is yet you can actually in one of these states have an experienced we realize a my god just using india ay to treat pt ste organmy stering work with silciden treapetyis to some one could really reprocess their drama in a way that has lasting effects in clearly probably something yo reconsolidation of those memories ere they are they are altered very consistent with whith the are understanding the way memory work the whole idea people can actually in in a few hours have a such a profound experience that they they decide to make these changes an who they are an its sticks there seems to be something that and that is profound i mean i i think a few moments gaus i made a some semi disparaging statements about things the secret in atformations and and the reason i i do that with with a with a nod to the fact that the people in it who are putting those ideas for itor a well intention people is that the noural networks of the brain put language last we we tell stories and stories are very powerful but i think one of the a most cruel aspects of the whole self help a literature an popular psychology is this idea that everything you say your brain and body hear it that is ashallyg a very a unkind or even cruel thing for people who are depressed or anxious to hear because if they hear that and believe that and i will not a beclear i do not think it is true that they think that it is very hard to control thoughts is very hard to control thoughts somebody ums as i cannot and then somebody says well know every time you say you cannot your brain hears that and it reinforces that is a very a treacherous place to live am and language is powerful but noural networks the brain and the networks that underlie emotionality an perception and sense of self they do not change in response to language they change in response to experience and it just fundamentally you need there some prerequisites you need certain aremodulators present ceretonan or dope me you neeither to be at sufficient levels you do not need to drug necessarily do it you could a you give a kid a kitten or a puppy their first in arpuppyan the levels of dopening and ceretonean i've never measured them but we can be pretty sure that they are higher than base line ahand that experience will rechape them right ylikewise withan adult in a certain certcumstances i think i'm fastining by this idea that i ha somatic and a perceptional experience but a real experience of the sort that you are describing is what allows us to reshape our neurl circuitory and to feel differently about ourselves and ah i know there is been u really tremendous success in many individuals of alleviating depression treating trama with these different compounds i wanted step from the the experience under the effects of the psychodelic the person there with your team they go into the expanded perceptial bubbel if if things go well they are able to do that to a really deep degree maybe it is the the realive trama maybe it is the beauty of the their ability to connect to things in the world now i wonn't talk about the transition out of that state and then the export into life because this is really where the power of psychadelic seems to be in the therapeutic sense the ability to learn truly learn from that experiente that the learning becomes the default that one does not have to remind themselves oh i am the other oge to do in afformation i am a happy person i am a hape i was hing a bart senson writing on much o or a gen work for him does not work for the other lot of to but as they transition out of this state i know that there is a kind of a heighten there is a the socal peak ywhere everything seems to be connicascating in at such a level that the person just they cannot really turn it off at that point might chalenge and then they start to exit the effects of the drug are those transitionzones are those valuable much is the transition between a dream and the waking state valuable because you are in a sort of mishmash of altered reality and new reality writ what do you woutd you do to guide people through the out out the tunnel as they exional and i had to say this is where we need more experimentation u really the clenical model goes back to literally the night late nineteen fifties and there is been virtually no experimentation on let saying ranimize people to were ging a talk more during the latter half of the of the session verses not verses we have them ou know wrigt an essay after their session verses not vers we have this amount of inigration what is a thelation in your studies are they are they writing or talk in se er doing and it is called in a very lusy gusy in a term indegration but for us means as the're coming back from the experience a sort of five six hours and heu knows this is the afternoon they'v been dosed around nine ofclocks this is four ofclock ors just a initial tell us about the experience you want and not unpacking at totally but ten iv initially just have a little bat discussion before they go home this little bit of that but then that night their home work is to write something it can be ou know a few bullet points it could be twenty pages we we get everything in that range but ou know try not to be self critical it is not grated dis to process and for point of discussion the next day they write something that come in the next day for aaa one to two hour depining on the study inegration cussion basically discutless discuss your experience and depinning on what study it is an what ywhat might that mean for you'r dealing with canswer what might that mean for y your smoking your or becoming in on smokersy you encourage him to simply take it seriously and i think this again a sort of one of the points that could be the antithesis of what som just a social users youse an this was wridden about by a useton a smith the scholar of religion in terms of these mystical experiences that can happen from psychodelics and how a lot of times the attribution to a drug effect is dismissed the t even if one has this this sense of being one with the universe in it totally shakes their soul to speak it the next day their friends i o yours threwd up too much ascif you wo men next time you nu od have a few more bears to bring that dat this sort of social reinforcement for dismissing the experience all god you are talking out your head man even if it is been a good natured but it is this dismissal it is not what you want to do is tell me more about that you were crying at one point lik can talking bout your mon but's talk about that what was that do you remember that o you are you doing that follow up or you there occurs thould do that in their own life with the various people in their loik both we do that explicitly and in the follow wor we have these discussions and i o depending on what the situation is a you might encourage the person to can a follow up it is it is really the basics of it is is supportive u teripe it is non structure it is yeo no use all that you no reflective listening and the sort of the humanistic psychology that you unconditional positive regard for the person but but i think if if soe one feels inclined to you apologize to their to their you to to their sibling about some things lik yego adand called up when it mit tho something big a relationship change a be sit on that two weeks do not make any big do not end any relationship do not quit your job do not make any big jst to tall them not to start any relationship i do not remember that ever coming up youlut you let it let ot ot it om not yo os is wondering its but yi sense wy leke it teir dating and they thinking i i might be time to take it to the nex snellv should i ask this girl to marry me if it did come up i would say there too mint you setton that a weeker yot do not get lete your sober my own do not get a puppy certainly doft otins untill your i have a question about flash backs a one it one of the kond of o things you hear as flash backs on that out that people do people get flash backs and if what is the basis of flash backs the the on the street a lore about thisis that somehow some of the compound get stored in body fat tissues and then release later a is that complete nonsense no evidence for that probably complete nonsense flashbacks are nonsense over the storagin body fatis complete the storagein body fat to answer whether flashbacks are complete nonsense we have to definante i really think these are multipl constracts that are going thatit is not the same thing that fall under that term there is a phenomenon that that appears real that is called hallucengin persisting perceptial disorder it is in the deasem a certain number a people very small number of people a you percentage wise who have use psycodelics will have these persisting perceptioable disorders they will see halos around things they will see some traials the after images following an object in motion at they will see distortions in color and it will be anything else that is a i disorder in the deisemahacity clinically distressing and has to be persisting over some a number of of months and and very rare very mysterious some of the keys to that are amazingly it is never been seen in the thousands of perticipents either from the order eror from the late fifties to the early seventies a people in psychadelixayes with aliste sosive masculine in its never been seen in the modern air again now with thousands of participance at a number of centers ours throughout the world it seems to be something that is for some reason happening in ilicit use tat that brings in o ka is a polly pharmacolegy buy know cus you drink in during you take what you thought you yet what is the dose is without the purity but then also what i think is actually even more than tha what is likely going on is some sort of very rare near logical susceptibility there is one paper that is a case series of individuals reporting these symptems and they did not limit it to the to just people would had hallucinage in history in the amazing thing about this is that a a number of people seem to have straight up h pp d dignos is age peop a llucigeand persisting perceptial disorder who have never taken a psychodelic it is often prompted by alcohol bens at asapines canabys even tobacco and and i believe in one individual no lifetime history of any it was not preceded by any of those a substance u use is i think it is i think of it the precipit ation exascerbation of psychotic dissorts we t seems pretty clear through observation that some people with with either predispysicion or act of psychotic disease that this can destablize them e psychoic the same way that a life experience can de statorize us person more easily i think of that there is probably some pretty rare neurological susceptibility we have tended going this goes back to the aidies clinical practice it in it up in the deasem fokat son hallusage in because i i related to the the psychology of zenophobia it is always the weird other thing that gets the attribution you do not attribute to the thing o ye did you smoke scigarettes did you drink it slike well yet but i see lots of people drinking an not ending up with this you take a crazy drug and you can get p people to believe all sorts of crazy stup the biggest example of that is the that the cathenon derivitiv called bathsalts ean't remember several years back we a wi goiin with lord a that that ate the other guy's face there as a homeless gui that literally a part of some one's face alf wall the crazings alon while the person was alive and all it took was one share uf stepit e to say well i do not know but i bet it was some of that bathsalts sup that is been going on the only thinkg what wasit was the only thing in his sos of men we culd set the record straight for people what what was why would he say bathsalts and was it bathsalts it it was not and and the only thing in his tox was canovas which we all know tifically people do not eat people's faces alf after they gets that o hunger aot ta right right it is just an example of the zenophobia to day if you get on goodal images and look up bathsalts won the most comment ye you images you will see is is poor guy's face being eaden all we are just ready to lach on just the people of another culture that we do not know it is it is it is very easy to a sign attribution to a class that your very un familiar ut i think they the psychodelics got that attribution with this very rare an eur logical susceptibility the way that alcohal did not i think it is not specific to psychidelics but we do not really know we need but we we would look at it and our research haf never seen an example of it but flashbacks can mean a number of other things i think the most common thing people experiences what we call it state dependent learning it is it is it is it is returning yourself to a similar context can bring back the same thoughts and emotions as the experience en if someone used tos pea mushrooms a wek ago now they do something they smoke some canobas or they a or ther they take a warm bath a or there simply relas it seems to come out of the blue and all the son thes what were they follow a a thought trail that takes tem that reminds m ther nand they find themselves in that same experience again i think that is more state dependent learning it is not the distressing component that is in and it is nat typically not perceptil and then another class are just sort of perceptiole anomamies within a day or two following the experience which is not age peop pety most people have in a joke that this is a free trip you might see if ye trails or hailars the day afterwards it does not last longer than that in its does not screel up it is kind of finaly o am saying some tradmas people will say it can mean any of those things ot lasfacts ye cant you say no appreciate you you clerifying that i mean one very common misconception about neuroplasticity is that it is an event and it is not an event it is a process and we have no understanding of the duration of that process however the experience of any drug or any life experience rit even if a trama or wonderful experience or a psychdolic experience does not matter sitsin motion a series of domenos that fall and it is the falling of those domenos that we call naroplasticity i mean that the reshaping of neral circuits could take years we do not know it is the the trigger an then there is the actual change and i think that some of what you describe could be literally the reordering of circuitry that in some individuals might extend longer than others and there is one phenomenon that a i've been told a people experience and i'm wondering whether not any of the patience you have worked with er a people in your trials have eve reported this i've never done aawaska a which i'm assuming has some overlap with the ceretonian system prelli hits a variety is ayin to dyom asitm yas worya that is ryny o worsters that allow the the you be worthy and i should i should have a recalled that absolutely i've never done it but a number of people i know that if done aawaska as well as people i know who have done m d may a report and increase sense of what a sometimes called a samar these autano ma censery meridian reflaxes which is and it is interesting a lot of people a have these naturally and they hide these teser it is acually a something of many people keep hidden to themselves i'll just ask you if you can do it a some people are able to pass a a shiver down their spine or up their spine consciously you can kind of i'm able to actually passar shiver up my spine i should learn how to do this when i was a kid on a hot day of standing on a field and sports campos i get's really hot here nd i culd actually create a cooling a a percet cooled perception some people i've told some on this once and then it is led to a discussion of oh i can do it but i always hid that from people cause it it is ishilk a somewhat pleasurable and this is a well known phenomnon phenomenon a samar and some people i know whohave taken m d ma theraputically or awaska am will report that they un feel great relief from this they can generate these autonomic reflexes through their body more readily probably i'm guessing because they were able tho too ninto a kind of deeper sense of somatic self now on the innerat a som ar if you look it up it is loit the bassall thing but another direction there were people that pay a lemit les to say there a counts on you to t have many many millions of yours of people that will whisper to them about i for instance there is a a people that will go listen to it seems to be women in prettiler whispering about carm mechanics or something ereabout were scratching there certain sounds will do this whis spering tapping finger tapping and people in cerns immense pleasure from it it is not really sexual pleasure but it is this kind of deep corpes of mead that it is the autonomic nervous system down the crowdling let a certain number of people would call cundelini which is anothelent scientificallyye that is righti people who do long duration cundoliny breathing sessions many of them will report later feeling as if they their perception of self is outside of their head a ra that they are littlely walk it is a very uncomfortable for them that they feel ther walking around with their sense of self extended beyond the body and this is a nurral this is a clinically describe or logic for now have any studies been done i would imagine that prerson might actually would they dock oh wetin tertli dow ean interesting o o te ting my lad would want aed to tt the ether body can clear mere right projection ye would not the sense omself handing there is a there is a wel known phenomenon it it is very a in a few individuals very sad were people actually a avidly seek out imputation of their limbs because their limbs they feel do not belong to their body oh ye this is very sad and a te fortunately very rare but also very sad condition anyway i think that the the the corpes of this conversation that were were drilling into is this notion of of reordering the self and it is and it is a relief to me to know that flash backs are not something that is it kind of a forgive the tur baked in to the a to the psychadelic experience and i suppose that is a good seduay to ask about other sorts of drugs i a having said baked in the temptation is to go to a meroonor canabus but but if we if we could i'd to just ask about some of the more doplemen urgent compound in particular emdiama ye my understanding is the emdimay is a purely sense t synthetic compound that you are not gin a fine emdiama in nature far there cer deemte was for symphasized in the ladin an we thought it in' exist in nature and then a richard shalties found it everywhere and tat yet who knows a plan out i might be making imdiam but right as far as we know now no right and we will talk about deemptiin it sources within the body but emdyamay could exist in elsewhere a but it is been symphasized and my understanding is the emdia may leads to very robust increases in both dopeming and ceratonan simultaneously which from a from a nural networks perspective is a very unusual situation right normally because dopeing puts us in this exteroceptive looking outside ourselves seeking things in the world beyond the skin our own skin and dope escuse me ceratoneantunsto focus us inward those are almost mutually exclusivey out of neurochemical states boug theyre always at different robls why would it be that howting this a increased opeing and increase er atone and would provide an experience thet is beneficial and howdo you to esomethingyou can describe it how do you think that experience differs from the sort of experiences that people have on sylisidein or more seratonergic agents just broadly speaking ye ye in terms of that that balant terms of the the the effects generally on seratonen and dopening i can only eu know speculate sort of is that dopominergic component necessary for let us say we know that the migdola is less react of during in under acute of facts and that may play a role in u a there is last sort of a control from from the imigdala and terms of one's experience of memorie maybe part of the sort of reprocessing a this reconsolidation in these memories in a different way where the migdal is not going crazy saying freegalt y ot fiderflike wen ni aud have said it seems emdiama is being used clinically anyway mainly for trama not just for depression although pard of we really do not know ame may be that india may as great for depression and some of these other and it may be that and i waing to be looking at the son that silicide in as great for treating pt a steal ot of underground therpist say that underground psycodelic therpis we do not really knowi under a round oh becaus the e dling illegal but more a professioal therpis would it just illegal a mand this is a kind of a growing a thaing a we do not really know which it it speculating but it may be that india may for a broader number of people is better for for trama because the chances of having an extremely challenging experience what i call the bad trip really freaking out is much lower with india may heepe can have bad trips but they are f a different nature we was not it is not sort of freaking out because all of reality is sort of shattering and it is less of this it can take many forms with the classic psychodelics but typically you you will hear something i did not know what was going to be this no matter how hard you tryed to prepare them that this is get me alf thits you triis to your aas the sils have an i wa tra yet yet ant and just the sense of i'm going insang this is far beyond anything i've ever experience and it is scaring to shid out on me whi i haven' to hold on anything even that i exist as as as as an entity and that can be really i think frankly experientially that is kine of the gate way to both the transendental mystical experiences that the sense of unity with all things which we know our day to suggest is related on to long turnpositive outcomes wet i wont ta ma sure lat serysing the bad trip can be related to the trancidential expein ri i think those are both speculating but youyou have to pass through this sort of yet reality shattering including your sense of self and one can handle that in one of two ways you can either completely surrender to it or you can try to hang on and if you try to hang on it is going to be more a a bad trip again i wish there is more an hopuly ther will be more experimentation eres a lot going on here in the black box and terms of the operant behaviour of how you are within yourself choosing to handle letting go and eventually will be able to see this in real time with brain imagy ot there they are surrendering to the psychlic experience here they are trying to hold on but we are not there yet but i think it is a clinical observation seems pretty clear that something that is going on and certain drugs dem t smokdim t can be strong the reason i i think that can be extraordinary concompare the others cause it forces people there is no choice tiding over don' it i has told that tete is a high speed locomotive into the psychodelic experience and out of the psychodelic experiencee and there is no ability to hold on to the self while you are in the the copekpace is that correct a lot of people say that but som tarence mac cana whois cone of the classic barred on temt effects he would say the sense of self was not intact but everything else the sensorium and what you navigated which you oring into towards everything else change basically but it is hard to win everything's changing hard to say what is the self that is changing what is the rest of the world wh languages is tolly deficient to describe experience anyway much less ones psychodelic e what is makenna's background what is this qualification for being this un as you referred thispard of of dempti and ever talk that terence and thereis also the brother denis a whom i know whose whose can only imagine what yet thet rather is at tearence passed away on years couple decaes togo now but on he' serve the one who is known is being abarred and you can find hundreds if not thousands of hours of him on the lecture circuit in the eighties in nineties on you to but his background was really a gasion i i do not recall what his college degree was in but he basically u when he was nineteen he travelled to south america and an actually on the initial trip with his his brother who was even a younger than him with some other friends and just i i in search for indemte snuf that they had read about from in the harvard arkives from the work of shoulties from a generation before but they had discover all of these mushrooms growing that he at down there te silside mushons with a recognizing just took a lot of mushrooms and and and talked about it talked about i terence was basically a very intelligent very well read and in literature and culture person necad he was sort of the the next generations a tim leary someone who could really speak get a little closer to the magnitude of what the psychodelic experience was for people and he serves likeleary somewhat of of an advocate any he would telt tell people folks you could see in a the equivalent of a ufo landing on on the white house lown its right there itill take five minutes it will shake everything in your reality he would thert of good people in doing will certainly science and clinical medicine is a are just but two lenses with which to explorer these things in life but what parthe reason i ask is i feel in the world of health and fitness a you have this very extreme condition of arnold shortzanaggres and body builders who have two per cent body fand they look to most people they look ot freakish ye especially now right all especially now is gectin now ye and yet at honra yet i ye it regular exactly lak in his da ye and you have contortionists who can put themselves into a small box and wrapp themselves into a casil but from those two very extreme sub culture practices that i do not now anthing about contortionism really but except that they get really bendy that but it is a community that included a lifestile practices an nutritional practisn drug practices from those very extreme subcultures there is been an export which is that wait training is healthy right the general public is done that or that yoga is healthy contortionism to yoga et cetera and i feel a similar thing is happening in the realm of psychodelics where it was leary and huxly i mean i im from the bayaria 'm not far from the medl park vie where one flew over the cukouses besye i o and keasy in those gies and the there has been an attempt at reating this movement toward openness about psychadelics and their positive effects this is happened before the difference is that now there are people you inside the walls of the university or publishing pe reviewed studies and things in that sort reasask about mc kenna was you knw it seems mc kenna and his brother ar what set just two of many people michael paulin et cetera who haven no real formal training in biology or psychology the other guies who were at universities lost their chobs they were removed from places harvard and other universities for their of cavalier exploration a right and now things are kind of returning in the same way that body building led to wait training and every corner gim yet men women and children a and contortionism is one extreme but people generally think the yoga is a pretty healthy practice right there these are matter of degrees right and now here you are inside the the the the walls of a very highly respected universiy johns hopkins you areon the medical schools inunder got t the medcicl which it is it a serious health a institution u the question is to me what are the what are the valuable exports right and where does the extreme liveind clearly there is a there is a problem with u tinkering with reality through pharmacology and there is a benefit it sounds to tinkering witha reality through pharmacology and what striking to me is this is the elements of a typical experience a typical representation of the self for the for the average person right or for kids that are hearing this kids that are in their teens right what are i want to talk about what are the the dangers of psychodeliges in something you do not heare a lot about these days and it is not because i'm anti psycholic at all but what are the dangers right if a if a if a kid were adult has a predisposition toward lets say u a psychotic thinking right or auditory hallusinations or u were is on the a asperger side of the autisms pectrum is there an increased risk of of bringing the mind into these states cause it sounds a very lay bile situation could we talk a little bit about that and are their classes of these different drugs whether not b md ma elust or dm t that are that you think are particularly sharp blades and therefor need to be wielded particularly careful yet these can be profandly ge stabalizing experiences and ones that ideally ar ar had in a safe container sort of where where some one ywhat are the relevant dangers and what can we do to mitigate the there is too bigges one and i've already mention its people with very severe psychiatric illness not not tepressio not anxiety i'm talking about psycotic disorders skets ofrania or emania as part of by polar disorder an indignosically this is shiftet such a little hard to say how many people to day with by poler would ave been lable to sket ofriniaback in the sixties when some of this early research for jist clinical observation was done it seems very clear that folks with ta predisposition or act of disease they could be tostablized and some of the cases we know of always sank of sid bear it the first singer of pink floyd seems pretty clear although i think thin do not no will happen there not i should be sorry ping floid fans i i've never the songs ar ust really long yet you are more of a punki right yet i iie got my foot in a lot of worlds defily inpardon in the floid world but a itmet he basically went crazy early on he he it seemd out that hisfamily ever admented it but he develops skits of frania classic pattern and in and he was doing a lot of alesty but a lot of these cases it looked he was showing all of the signs of son some some some hints of of a a that he had that susceptibility before and often thes is hard to disentangle what causis what because when to people typically not always but develope whens the motal period for first break its ad lessons early andoldhood yet and when to people start playing with drugs same exact time period it can be hard to to disentangle but it seems pretty clear now i should alsos ay there are cases of folks with skets ofrani that sav syculicts have helped them there is anecdotes for everything to e people ros skits of rennic sai iselp the i knows o as when skits of rennic say things you have to i ma nont you avn way al wit all do compassion and respect frut skets fraits disorder of thinking if ther'e saying it help them ho yet can you trust them yet i would not be surprised if there was some colonel truth in some cases but there is just iit seems very clear that the other side is there to and that that there ever is a theriputic potential there for those disorders that that should not be the first thing on our less wean to learn a lot more because of the level oferist before we start in doing research to seeiv sell siveg an can help with skits of frania i do not think that may never be the case but even if it is he would hade to be even more cautious and figure some more things out for us wit some of these other disorders t o limes o oler bypolor disorder can o be exascerated by these yes yand it is it may be that that that sort of the manifestation of people having prolonged psychiatric issues after a a psycholic experience as as a typicale as that is when that happens it it it maybe that is that might be more a manic episode than a psychotic episode and that can be ablurry line in its its the folk lore is that yon people goon a trip an thy never come bat it is clearly not the case because bo know the drug is matavalize for any one else in the next day theres not yents the noter resho circuitry from it right and there is still and i i really do think you n a much the positive o exyou know a long term of facts that this class of problems is related to the the to the experience in in the the dstablization that can happen from that from that experience if it is not in that in the right container and again these people are susceptible to some people with that psycotic predisposition they lucky to be born to a great family stable environment they maybe never have a full break or the one they have as not nearly as bad as what someone that t that use whose homeless and is coming from all kinds of early childhood tramaa the disease is probably going to be far worse that the psyt having a psychilic experience s is one of those dstabalizing experiences exclude ow fortunately it is really easy to identify those people and we even i eir in the pside of extreme caution by eliminating people with say first degre relative in some studies even a second degree relative given the heritability ther some increased chance if your brother your yet a in an abundance of caution o even elimiting at i think eventually if it is approve for use after ye use at we cal dial back on that as we learn more i think it is again over overly cautious which is but your onerrsrash clae ator on oery place the star at this point of time but ou know if you en give a skid or another structured psychatric interview with the clinition sing now in this person for a few hours todelvin to their history an an but you coul veri relively determine at this person has either you n a psycholic this order were by polor disorder or a strong predisposition thats that you can screme for that and that is how you address that the far more likely danger is the bat trip any one can have this the most psychologically healthy person in the world probably you jack the dose high enough and especially n in n in a less than an a ideal environment you can have a bad trip you you even get it in an an ideal environment ours a at a hidose of around thirty miligrams f sillsive and after the best preparation we can provide about third of people will say essentially at some point they have a bad trip weat some point within the entire journey right now they could have one of the most beautiful experiences of their sometimes a couple minutes later but at some point they had a sense of strong anxiety fear losing their mind a feeling trap something that now typically when people have that in the when there just taken on their own lavings they are find they get through it you knowthe're more likely to be better off if they'r not having to navigate the streets of man hat and that or and if they are with other people with friends better that those friends are not also dealing with their enpsychelic experience but probably having some friend of any type but whatether im there is better than having nothing thery dependend on contacts and the tough thing her that that in in in conveying to the public is that a lot of folks will say they not takin psychodelics hundreds of times and this is your fear mongering and there is no you are exaggerating the danger there i want to say it is a typical but some times and i have a file folder that grows larger every year of these cases either in the medical literature or from the news of people that freek out on a psychodelic and they they get hearder they die they run into traffic they they they fall from a height whether they thought they could fly or other they just fell they you can do when you'r drunk or an you are intoxicated on any substance sometimes thats that is unclear u or gosh one of the craziest cases was a a a kid an eighteen year old or an in oregon several years back that just he even rode about i want to take the biggest he ha done mushin for i want to take a a a heroic dose the biggest oses have ever taken heanted up just totally out of it in it up in a neighbour's house heems just totally disoriented disconnected forality in the copsin an of killing him and i wa just tragic obviously nover useof force in that case cause he was actually naked at the tinest naked hundred and twenty pound i thing as a recall kid that in it af dying but well it is analogous to the you knowthet resi use the examples body going culture people therehave takin excesses o amounts of anabolics and diaratics and die then the contortionist culture people put themselves in a old plexy glass boxes to do at the extremes you you are going to get deaths and at the extremes and as and one of the extremes is the sheer number of people with different biological make ups taking the same drog and you can create extremes through numbers you can take extreyou create extremes through doseit rit it seems o it is why i'm such a fand of of the fact that people yourself are doing clinical trials inside a the walls of university not because a i think that psychodelics a only have utility in those environments but because it is important tward creating their transition to legality and to understand what legality means for a compound this right right what model right an again all will stay with the anabol exteries there is now to stostron and esterogem replacement there beforemon replacement there abe is a common medically approve practicebut that is vastly different than people taking their own stophorodie or deciding how much they nean to take right we said there is there is yeogun there is contortionism in a plexy glass blox and you ot thinking oodenior something there these are a matter of degrees aspeaking of dosage i definly want ask you about microdose verses standard or macrodose tell me tell me that i'm wrong but i'm always a little bit on i sort a little a i microcynical if you will about this termicrodose and the reason is that many people that i know who talk about microdosing are taking dosages of compounds that work at might that are very powerful at microgram levels the word micro i think can be a little confusing to people because microdose implies less than something yet a meaning dose right and yet some of these compounds were are tremendously powerful at microgram concentrations what it constitutes ha microdose and what is the value of called microdosing if any and how ioes it differ from standard or what i can only assume as called microdosand ye and elesty would be the the the protetypical example of that superpodent doi what what size dosage of of elesty will lead to hallucinations and conistandse ser the intry point for pcychidelic type effects which may not involve hallucinatio actually most classic cycodelics do not mea to true hallucinations as to find in psychiatry of an see thining youre talking to the person that is not ther seeing the pink elephant nots my licisi loserasirs and things lik right and and precisial son people never get that even at a very high dose i think more broadly interms of the psychodelic effects which is not just perceptial unless we get into the level as you are alluding to earlier abroader definition of perception one's models of the world the model of the self you can you can consider all of that perception in terms of you kno truly not sensation but perception the construction of a putting together reality on yet yet ye its a decychodelic effects are artypically considered to starp alisty round a hundred microgram a tenth of a melegram is a hundred micrograms it te sand taking a hundred micrograms of eleste they on the nowadays people might mistakenly refer to that as a microdose because it is microgra ns but that is actually a macrodose aid elist right they might and that is one of the mos common mistakes or situations that people get into with microdosing as they intended to be a microdose but it inds ot being a full blown dose now people do and whenthey'r working without theste and they are microdosing thyll shoot for something say ten miligrams i a something in that range ten twenty meligrams of aleste a ten the fifth something o kind of your intry level psychodelic dose peoples ability on the street to do this an i say the street as if thereound the corner but anyway outside of the medical profession to do this varies as you cand they are not measure of purity an moarity or thinand theresically and there is ways to do it even if you do not ultimately know the dose that is in the blater paper of acid one could at least get a sense of yet having one of those tabs is a one of those hits is is a psychodelic experience they could do something put in water it is a hundred per cent aqueos soluble you could vauit make surei a'll gets into solution and then volu matrically measure it is going to be homogeously distributed seeycin you take one tenth of that volume of water r after it is fully dissolved no that whatever you started with you can have a tent to that dose the people tat are more sophisticated well do things that and when they are working with mushrooms they they will grow much mushrooms in the no see put it in a colfe grinder i'm not kolling people to d this by the way i'm jist describing said do not do this at home but grind it all up it is homogenists cause you can have en a sort of taking two caps in a stem hey this two caps in the stend that this body takes is has a different punnecy in this two caps in a stend that the otherbody takes people that are kind of en to knobl wll grind it all up into a homogenus powder and thy'll pack it in to whatever size capsul and they will know that and again even if they do not have sometimes they migh have a budy that will sneak it into the h peel sea et their at they'r job or whatever if they hape not you are l i but not li lit that is ever ap it seriously never happened but but but they will at least know that hey i've got a sense of what two capsals do i've got a sense of what fize capsuls do and but in reality that is not what people do that they they' they will take a piece of blot or paper and they get a tiny little pierscissors swissarmy nife pierces and the cut up the tab of acid which is i cannot ove a quarter ang square somethi and they will cut it up in ten little pieces in it is i got youave no idea if it is equally distributed in that media yend we can chuckle about it and om but to me one of the reasons why this experiment around psychodelics this cultural experiment and this legal experiment we are seeing this now but this was all attempted once before in the sixties and seventies the difference was it was all out in the street the people in universities who were dabbling with the stuff lost most of them lost their jobs er were asked to leave through h y a loss of funning for this resi seranimaly and anserin on other topic tat's your these are prearious times me were it werd a were in a keen moment where everyone assumes that this is all going to be legal in a few years but i think that that is a premature assumption yerically but and im an let us touch on the legality and some of the things that are happening now but what is microdosing sylicide an verses om the sorts of dosages that you describe before in the tendit to forty o miligram range o i've heard of people taking one or two miligrams of sylicide an every day as a way to quoteun quote and for those liscening just making air courts with my fingers increase plasticity which is which is a term that i personally loath because hat what does that mean im you do not really want your brain to be plastic because yyou need to make predic if you need to maintain your ability to ma predictions ye i'm ri di as prediction yor you need models of the world et i you need huristics plasticity is never the goal or bet plasticity is never the goal o erected plasticity is the goal ri learning a language of reshaping your experience to a trama altering the perception of self but plasticity is a process a yet you sait is afrenia is a lot of plasticity exaisl right an man it might even be there is one theory that it is extreme on going plasticity that is why people never a create stable representations of anthing that is a a kind of a a minority view out there but what is the business with mycrodosing and is there any clinical evidence or pure revieu publish evidence that it works quon quote to make people feel better about anything microdosing i is is is the aim of taking against something a round a tenth of what would be sort of an intry level psychodelic dos for whatever compounds o am yet fit sillsunusually people almost never pet to people have pure silcivon won one miligram sisiden would be in the range of a micra as more likely people can have in a mushroom silo something a a a half of aa af a gram of mushroom i know people theyr goner as ran every day the're doings every day r in ther the same way that i take a a am personally am not s recommending other people do his but i take some a mafhan of elsee all carnatine lately ive in kind of experiment with th alebit which is not a psychad olic compount i take it every day and ta there taking ther that is a selsin everyday that is their supplement ye yet ithe claims are in their number of them thes two general ones one is i sort of acting in in place of the eighty eigh d treating drug the sychomunder stimulans o a better version of ateral the other claims are essentially a better version of of the traditional anti to presens a better version of prosac be no tikon both for attention defisite and for deprestion yet and the aspects of those disorders that ou know we all have a a degree of yjust infedomin is going to increase the focus of at the right dose of any one who takes in fedome and pretty much y whether your eighty gh d diagnost or not a the idea it is that the there may not be a necessarily a a clear divide between the their putic need and in a positive sychology even improving mood and focus ayou know it is not necessarily correcting a eighty eigh d but improving focus o supercharge your your life and those o the claims i am to none of the pure reviewed studies that are have much credibility om none of them have shown a benefit and they have tried another it wer there is only at this point for or five studies that and i think for things this you really need double blind resuch caus the effects i men there is one study done an amsterdam where peopleld knew they were taking sill siven trifles basically same as muchams an more the roots than micelia my onosong wanl taking of what would be considered a a a a microdose and then doing some some cognitive measures before and after ans types of thing that yo lot cogno measures are measured on the order of reaction time in mill of seconds and me in the types of effects you get as you could imagine ar ones that would be you would totally expect could be there from either a practise of fect or or an acexpectancy offectaplocebo of fact for something these claimd you could imagine a sort of an increased focus i an handsmen of cognition these are going to be more subtle effects that you really need aaa good plocebo control for the handful of studies that have done that have shown they have range from finding no effect whatsoever to just a little bit of empairment imparing some one's ability to do o time estimation in production task you want an accurate sense of time at least of your navigating in the real world it is different if you are on the couch on a heroic dose for their putic reasons were your safe but if you are crossing the street if you are getting up you giniuorn life yet which is where the way people are claiming yo use that helps them be a better see yo you want an accurate sense of time if anything to day to suggests that it makes it a little bit less accurate and and thereis evidence that someone feels a little bit impaired om n they feel a little bit high terms of you you call that abuseliability in research not surprising you take a little bit of of a drug that can result in a sometype of a high you take a little tiny bit of it you will fill a little bit high om yet none of the far no studies have a've shown you knows a en't any increase in creativity enhancement at any form of cognition ors or or a sustained improvement in mood now no studies have actually looked at the the the the system of microdosing that the offischin atos are claiming and there is a couple of models out there but but folks o pall stammets and others they will have particular formulas they are you need to take it one day than take many days off and take it every four days and ot o one of gettinto whose models wat but it is always something that some pattern of yuse usually not every day and and the claim is that it is not just yo sometimes people get benefit that first time when they take it but they really say you need to be onit for a while a few weeks in any may star to nos to this pattern of ut of using it any your you'r feeling to benefits on those off days the three or er two days in between you are active dose those of the claims again we do not know that there is any truth to that working but studies have not been done to model that that is a big haviot we as a feel as ey we is the as the the scientific feeld have not done the studies to really model what the real offichiatos are claiming in where the theyrepetint benefits come from that said it is it is it is almost assuredly there is a good amount of placivo there but but the caviot to that is almost everything in medicine or therepeudics there is an it is going to have some degree of plasiva the leef effects are or i've a collegat stamford a a leo crom who as publish really beautiful work on belief effects that show that it such a you give the same milk shake to two people you are two groups of people you tell them that one contains a lot of neutrience the other as a locallar shake ther there the insolent response amazing the're as dramatically between the two or two b two groups rather doing equivalent amounts of of physical movement and you tell one group that it is going to be good for them and help them lose weight than they lose on average eihte to twelve pounds more doing the exact sane patterns of movement and i think that these belief offacts well down to all sorts of a kind of natwork wide nor modulation things that sord then that the work at harvard suggesting that even if you do not have deception you give up placivo and say this is a sugar pill right you no an some of them that an it gud still treat things that t er to alow as the first thing they looked at right and there is a huge there is a reality there right o there is a necessity n developing drugs to make sure it is not only that but it but in the actual practice of medicine hopefully which are always getting is some underlying direct efficacy plas the plasiva that anyn hance is at now it could be that this is the real question is is the microdosing are those claims a hundred pecent placivo or they only partplacivo and part real in a cuodon c ote affact my bet is and this is totally base on anecdotes that i think there is probably a reality to the anti doppress an effects i find that more intreaguing we sas i suffering with depression even if it is an it would not be as interesting as i think what were doing with hidos sisive on our psycholics to treat u depression it would be if this is developed in those reality it would be more a better perhaps o better essess ari a better prosact wuld haver sitenglane more tools than fewer tools in the tool box and it should not be that surprise that even before the as going back to the trysyclix and the mao inhibitors coming to the fiftys agminning extracelular seratone in one way or another for many people leads to a dereduction and depressive symptoms it would not be that crazy for chronically stimulating a subtype of seretonan receptor that you have an anti dopress an effects i think if i have put my bets on it that there is if there is anything real it is in that catigar although i'm very open to lek maybe there is something to the creativity to the improved cognition which covers many domains in an of itself but u my my greatest hopes are on the on the anti dopress an effects that seit in the big picture i think all of the most interesting thing about psychodolics are the heroic dosis i mean the idea give something one too three times and you see improvements and depression months later and in a diction ean over a year later and with these bn o people dealing with potentially terminal illness i mean it is i mean i'm interested in big effacts and i do not thin you are ever going to get the really big effects thereis also some concern that almost all of these common psychth the more common psychodelics even counting indiamay they have seratonan to be agonist effects and agonizing seratonan to be has been shown to lead to heart valve formation problems morphology issue a vavolopithy and this is why fenfend was pulled from the market the gidro yes te efective right right nd it was the the portion of that commination that had the the the seratonan to be activity that was was the problem and we do not know all of the that the toxicologist s i'ave ever spoken to about this would uno say in cardialogist say loka if there is some concern there it is not applicable to the whole idea you taken something a few times stereputically within a lifetime but the idea of taking something e twice a week for years i mean even th the hippes back in the sixties were not doing that right there is not even these natural it and even if they even if there was some hart valved dises problem i that stemped from psychodelic use who ise connecting those dots that is not showing up in the clinical charts for any one to figure out there is in in injest theoretically there is more of a concern if it somethings gon to happen with with heart vawls it is more likely that that those issues would arise when some one taking these things yallic say twice a week forwar the next five years and i do whent to throw that out to people to really consider rit a something i had not heard before that in in micro sound safor micro dosing as opposed to heroico macrodosing and yet unless and in the context of your lab and and other labs doing similar work am you have got this people checkand blood pressure you have got people that are really monorduring your psychological and physical safety when people are out their microdosing it sounds there is the potential either through the seratone an five age to to be am receptor or other mechanism that if there could be some comncumulative negative of facts the a and i thing that is an ima really important consideration some glad you brought it up what about kids the brain is very plastic early in life it becomes less plastic as we age although it maintain some degree of plasto see throughout the life spen a the the year twenty five it not a a the youare twenty five but rather the age twenty five years am is sort of an inflection point where am the regitity of the narfo system seems to really take off of course people do not wake up on their twenty fifth birthday and find they have no narrow plastocity ras the day before they had a lot these are unots plaser miness a ever it is a year to but am depends on the individual am however the bthe young brain is very plastic and i could imagine there could be great risks who knows maybe ven benefits but i'm certainly not a a thinking about those am mainly thing about the risks a for young people taking psychodelics are there any trials looking at people am in clinical traals is would be under the age of eighteen has any one explored this in a rigorous way am given the potential to exacerbat psycotic symptoms and bypolir symptoms and some people a is there heighten risk of that what is the story with age of use and psychodelic s for theraputic purposes there is no formal research although i there is a very high chance that there will be and this is one of the very interesting things polks may not realize are appreciate about the atia approval process the fie already in multil instancess signalled that there they want to see those studies before well not not before it is approved as necessarily as a eu know for for adults but there eno eventually one to see in facts of the the maps group that is developing indian a ferpetious te they am already signaled that that is conala an unlista of interest and there is even some incentives and that in the ft a a pathways for am for insintivising folks to explore that that yusein young people i know in some of the work that i helped with in pushing a sylisivan in to fase a fase to be clenical research the f to ye said whike why cannot you give this to kids it is are are you ware that the pression is a problem it with with adolescence in it is really interesting because this a aftias very concerned about suit o specificity we idea he fine sutospose you have put out a drug and say all this is good for men but not women this is good for black folks but not white folks an now sometimes there is a very good rational for that wwere talking about hormones in for a specific you knough for for for for men verses women and the certain a issues a yet certain disease ats ik maybe sicle selenemia thit is morralo a saxencs yet exactly but absent of something that the're very concerned about saying oh this is for this type of person but not that tive of person age is one of those things and also this recognition much the emphasis that at an i agh with with yu now with roden studies in human sadys that you cannot just say you are studyg men or just went when you nour rationow tforinly stepo yoot to be cleare to people there is n a it is a recent swhich but there is a stipulation in every federally funded grant that both sexes wwe do not refer to gender in scientific studies unless it is a study of gender persay we refer to sex meaning biological sects that there is a stipulation that in order to receive and continu receive funding you have to do a studies on both males and females of that species including humans and at least look even if you are not powered for at t least looking a that in exploratory nalysis as a grand review were charged with looking at did they address sex as a biologically relevant variable rigtining do y dicertnin ther's the same drug have different effects in males verses females right n o cau ot the us look at the trens even again if you are under power to look at those between subject type effects we non great shift that did not exist in a ten oir years ago a something we are both on grants panels am as study section members you did not have to do that now it is it is in important biological variable if you kdo not a look at that you essentilly will not get your you'r funding and ageis a similar thing it is the whole idea man of something could help kids what is the rational i think there is going to be now obviously you are going to have in thos studies at least just as much probably more it should be more of a cautio cautionary approach it is probaly going to be it would certainly whatever diseased tate electargan have to be proba treatment resistent at let as a for astapi i hase to atriassion yet yet and in all of that in the next but hey if the sto really helps people that are twenty five or thirty what is the rational that it will not help a younger person in there is conthese generic cindi concerns about the developming nervous system is more susceptible to probli man cuts both ways caus it is also woren clastic generally and adaptable may be resilient injury in certain ways but you kno you hear the rateric about kids their brains and drugs and it is the developing brain is a special concern yet but i think we are ging to be seeing research eventially that is it is intereting i went to the high school that is infamous sadly gun high school o for having it the highest degree at least at one point of suicide suiciderate wum lot very large number f suicide sis was written up in the times and elsewhere is all very academically successful school it is a verasia maidi pressuaraacally demanding school yet i went where they have restricted the kids will meet often at six thirty a m or six am before school for study groups anethings that sort that some of it may relate to that om but i have to say that even prior to all that at academic pressure when i went there it was not the pressure was not that that we had a an unusual number of suicides for whatever reason and and the idea of kids being prescribed and no one be emphasized prescribe not just using but i prescribed psycadelics for therapeutic purposes i think might make some people bulk but the idea of kids om killing themselves should also make people balk and i'm i'm relieved to hear that there is going to be a rational scientific safe clinical trial based exploration of this i want to ask you about the purrent status of these drugs and compounds i'm pretty active on social media more on instrgram than on twitter but as i have been on twirlemit more recently i've notice that there is a lot of dialogue around your account and other people's accounts around a couple of themes relate to psychodogs first of all what is the status o of the transition to legality for for prescription purposes medical doctors emdies prescribing it legally for therapeutic purposes that is the first quession the second question is what is the status as it relates to possession and criminal charges a for a long time i lived in oklent where we were one day told not to longo it is now qoulnt quot de criminalized is what i was told that double chack people of but what is that and then the other issue in the third question we can parch these one by one is i issue of less you say i am aware of a lot of investor dollars going into companies that are esentially companies focust on psychodelics as theraputics or psychodelics generally i have to assume that they are investing in anticipation of a shift in the leals tootus and there is a lot of interest now will sylicide band become a tack able thing just mareuanta it is start with o the question lat what is going on in the uas legally a is it illegal to possess and a sell and use these compounds my understanding is you can still go to jail for having these compounds in your possession or for selling right even though it is the the legal landscape is very different than with canibast o there are some similarities o one of the similarities is the regardless of what local municipal meaning whit city or state is decriminalize enact that word itself can mean many things the devil some some forms of decriminalization is close to what folks would call legalization and others are pretty weak just saying we suggest that the pollice make it their lowest lo inforcement priority that is nni e sort surn they turn the other choose con of the right but even that the cops can still choose to but some iet you now at pulled over for one thing search and then by definition if it is illegal and they find it rime they hav as te aly have to do something about and that will probably be determined by both judicial precedent is it can be thrown out and just the local prosecutor even before yi arthigan to choos even atpost arrest are ging pursue to really go after those charges make those charges stik i think that still in playing is can a dependen the municipality but canibas iffederally these are all scederal one compound which means theirylegal thit moch means theirelegal a the cavioht to tatres as has always been the case since propto fifteen an caliform with canibasts in ninety six is that hey ninety nine per cent of of drug inforcement is done at the local instate level the d ye which is the federal w level l inforcement is a tiny fraction of the arrests that goding most people at arrested for any drug are done by local or state level authorities but it is still technically illegal and say you can and they could be potentially and depending on the ambiguty local all they even those local officials could charge you with the a federal crime and theoretically the feds could always come in now although you'l again a similar case with the e whole canibas history it was the the feds came in in the early days but the folks that were basically highly visible they went fter tommy chong for selling bongs but ou n i remember him being on the tenightsho one time and i think it was back in the ja lino days hesas but o long sanamonical bordbe elec every shop sills bongs how did you go to prison for a half yeur for fongs escause he was in there cas e mis he was ing a tommy chong and and there was some high profile canibus groups of ou know that were distributing it an he were very vocal those who are the ones rated by the d in early days not the ones conting keeping to themselves keeping i quiet in just doing their thing there is always the potential for selectiv enforcement and and this initiative an oregon which is a state level legalization of sylicive an ferape which is really interesting in a part of their plan for two years is to figure out how to in a grat with the federal level and i do not know how that is going to go because unless you re write the controlled substance's act that seems the best youre going to get is a a tolerance from the federal government and anac could be very o a hay you change administrations an this is sylicid bin by o prescription from a medical doctor or your talking about therapists in who have masters degrees or pces or self appointed coachis or something that administering sylicide ban o but without any oversight this is all getting figure out an the oregon case and again there is that two year period of basically were in a figure the sout and and what is it with oregon not youth an ii i love the sigarogant is but its interesting how you have these pockets oregon vermont seems to be one you get these kind of pockets where people are experimental with plant compounds they seem to be green woodzy areas for in at least in my mind but there there is sort of hulture around plants and the use of plants as therapeutic and combined that with the west just were geographically of more of the the anti oun a federalism the anti mean the oregan ranchers from several years ago that hewld up the ot the e whatever whild life place you knowin that was a big shut ou with the feds and the cot ou no just kind of the west is kind of known for more of thos isiou he combined the two the hipp dipp california oregon by lr isi heming less hippy dippy the the although it was the there is always been a tradition nochasin the culture around drugs but umcertainly nacadamia and intact et cetera that the west it has been a place where people have tried to throw off traditionalism and kind of lineage and queer parents are what school you went into and and the past as a determinant of what is nac an exciting about the future whereas om an here we are in east coast institution gyand a west as institution got i think that it is this idea of cun of innovation and the future verses do we stay grounded in history in tradition and of course their great institutions on both sides which interesting is that am hopkins johns hopkins a medical school i think of as a a real east coast academic institution it is on these coast but here you are a doing these very pioneering and important and exploratory an studies in a certainly not a hippi dipy environment rao er hopcins ar not a i ico department even among psychiotra departments and as a psychologist in ha psychira parment psychiatry is certainly more conservative than psychology even within academics but even among psychiota departments it is a very conservative department we got the law at the federal level we have got the law at the state and local level and then we have got this question of whether nots can be physicians emdies people with peaces or masters agrees or whether not it woill be con of a free for all i for for consumption and lacilages the life cot nd the general public and rianabis y i'm not a potsmoker o a dis it it is never appeal to me a a's just me in my my pharmacology but you can buy canabists most places in the u s without a tone of risk it is mice right are we going to see a time in which you can essentially goin to as a shop on na abot caning boulevard in vanice california and and riht now you can go by maruana if you have a maran o cardans my understanding i see a lot of people going in out of these stores the police certily o no promwe t is there going to time where people i just go by siliciden do you think to ou an amsterdam nd have youre long don time an tey i think as at at a certain point and a i do not know how long it is hard to imagin or current level of drug criminalization holding up for andi'm thinking large spans of time really in a hundred years ware beging to be doing this five hundred years how could that it is nocking to be suscen sustain but infive year infer instance i do not think in the united states i i i do think eventually you are going to see something that cases going to be no way and and i think we aregan a i hope that worgan eventually come strongly a weregoina move on from this model of criminalizing drugs that were really in a focus on regulating drugs at the right level for that drug and i i the word regulation better than legalization i mean i could imagine what one day regulation smart regulation might mean for psychedelic maybe it could mean th it there will be yet whether or not you have it a dignosis of a problem t it may be that even for personal exploration you can do this legally but you first hapf to may be take a court get a driving this has been i mout the fest to say this beget to quivolent of a driver's license you have to go to a get some sort of training may be your first number of experiences need to be with ut with trained guides who can facilitated and then the the public health information for any one using this that this is what riskyor uss all uses going to have rist this o what riskier uses this is less risky use these are the factors i think of ventually were going to be for any but i would see the same thing for methempetomine and and and yew heroine and cocane all these drigs it is hard to imagin the current approach of just feeding a black market and really exascerating a lot of the harmess from drugs in a that happens under te current model it is hard imagine that maintaining that is not to say i think it should be in all of the pseven elevens mea sold to kids at at the other i wer older non but but i do think it is probably not going to be soon in the united states i do want to make the major point that the even if psychodocs had never been made illegal i think the exact the tragjectory of the medical research right now woutd still need to happen if it is effective as an anti depressin we need it to be ye there is all th evidence suggesting that whatever disorder f tolk amount the efficacies can be increased and the risks are ging to be mitigate it drastically and the types of models were talking about with the screening with the preparation with the inegration of cognaperotheripy or what have you depending on the disorder your treating with the enegration afterwards with the professionals on it it it we would be doing it any way sso it is not this first is that i do not see it as a race between the decriminalization or legalization of these come out ferses their medical development some people who are psycholic fand get get all into a bunch about the medical development they say egise wen alike you want it you want to keep it only for for your medical research in t i ry tower and you want to be yet in control of it as academics and mi take it i did not make it illegal for any one werily moving the meedl in one direction and it gare not even if it was already legal ant an' bect in i done plenty of servey research of people reporting they took mushrooms for fun or for personal exploration and they said my god why my smoking an the quit smoking twhenty yeas because of it or its help with their depression or its help with them overcoming alcalism or these depay sometimes that happens out of the blue when people you psychodelics none the less obviously the efficacy rates are going to be higher when you bringing into tese medical models and it is going to be sure safor we going to we need to be pushing that and my best guess is that india may is going to be approved within the next three years and for rescription by a physicion yes in in not just ye take toin call me in the morning but in the clinics the way that those those petesty trials are being runs to the indy may would be pro for ptst in every disorder need to be looked at separately and ans can only be improved for those things now ther's rank is a i lose an anlegalize and regulated or now we are getting into the new ants i think when people here it is going to be approved into years they think that they will be able to by and selling usamdia ma without legal consequences and i do not think that is going iga situration it is not tway it is andi will say that i think the quotinco psychodelic community i mean that they have been doing what they want to and will carry on doing what they want to anyway right it is not the the legal satus has a has prevented them from doing what they are doing in fact unlike leary and a timetelery and hoxly and and and and some of the others that were very vocal and lost their jobs in some whent to jail et cetera i mean you got a lot of public figures now macanta and others or just basely out their talking about psychodelics michael poulan who is more of a writer foody gui on psychadelic dabbler writer guid a i know he is that he is gon of a polymath but the leag the legal status in seem to hinder their a at least online career i i do not know and on even look to their bank accounts but the i'm imaging they are doing justifine right the fact that work is happening inside of a big institutions i think it is important that you point out and i'm just tryn underscore that that is that is in in no way antagonistic to what people are doing it is in support of a different sort of mission which is to explore the validity in different contacts in a really controlled way a which i really a you knot its i think it is a really importan mission a i wont to make sure that i ask you about the other really important mission that you are involved in with respect to psychodelics which i's not about depression persay but is about neurological e neurologic injury or had injury i realize it is early days for this but i think u a ee's lot of concussion out there sadly there is lot of tebii dramaticbrain injury ynot just from sports i think people sometimes forget that it is not ththe major sorce of tramatic ad injury is not football it is not hawky it is not boxing it is not any of that stuff it is construction workers and i nan if you have ever seen the helmets that construction workers where i mean the da hammer yi a aha a not be s y i have a calling the worksomeness and byou engineering and when you look at the yen we always think sports but there are many people who make a living in a way that is a overtime is detramental to the brain and they do not have the option of just not being a professional rathlet or something of that sort and i theyare not doing the construction some one else nees somethone else iist it right and and we forge for some reason and i too idid not occur to be until i heard it the the people who doing construction man tof courts of bycacidents and falls and things that as well sos hery nno very absolutely om what do you think is the potential for these compounds om particular sillicide en but other compounds as well for the a treatment inpossible even reversal of neurological injuries and what what sorts of things are you excited to do in that roam yes this is detinally on the more exploratory and it is based upon iu at this a sort of beyond the the improvement of psychiatric disorders depression om in depression anxiety associate it with the terminal illness om or a substance used to sort the addiction thas are psychiatric disorders this is om these ou know there are anecdotes of of people saying a that that psychodelics have helped heal their brain ou know they have been in one of these situations in sports a sport where their's prepetitive had impacked and their claiming that in using psychodelics has actually improve their cogonive function for example improve their memory am including it improve their ther their mood om but but it is kind of more of the ouno the cognve function things memory are now caviat is if you successfully improve someone is depression you can get some cognonive improvement too but thats o more of a a weaker more indirect effect but if you take these anecdotes and you combine at way across orders of analysis to the rodent research from am several labs gave it allsin brying a roth it these folks that have shown different forms of neuro plastisty unfolding o a after it sort of close acutely after in the days following the administration of psychodelic compounds aa note o riety syche thou compounds in even some non psychdelic structural analogues om a that you see these he different forms of ner plastistis o a the growth of dendrites and new a connections being formed with with with different nurons that those effects may be at play and the improve in the psychiatric treatments that were dealing with that a we do not know that it seems a decent guess and weregan to be figuring out whether that is the case but another potential that that sets up is that maybe that is what is going on with om with wit wit with these claims of improvements from neurin neur logical issues that there is actually a a repair of the brain a a from injuries underlying in things that situations where thees repetitive head and pack perhaps here is a potential for for helping folks recover from stroke a indisorders that a it is a wide ridy of disorders now that it is a bit of magic and a bit of it is it is something that the enthusiast kind of cando some handwaving and claim that this is already known it is more exploratory but when i am hoping to do s some work with retired athletes a a who have been exposed but by the nature of their sport for example in an a athletes in the you have see who have been exposed to a repetitive head inpacks a lot of sports a lot of a you sports exposed people to nd and who are retired from the sport and are suffering from say depression which can a impart result from those types ive of of that history of head in pact a see if we can fix the depression but then also as a chery on top in a more exploratort tory aim see if we can have evidence of of improvemen in cogging of function and associate using im mour eye see if it affects gray matter over time these types of things to see if they are actually some evidence of this improved a this more direct repair of the brain but it again it is very sort of wee got some road in data we have got some human anecdotes w we we will acknowledge its early days and we look forwards to seem the data a a i appreciate how cautious you are intented ive you are you not drawing any conclusions i think a from a purely a logical a and somewhat mechanistic perspective i mean if we assume that lack of ability to focus or degradation and mood is the reflection of nerons in the brain i thing we can agree on that some dialogue between your ans of the brain and that what needs to be changed is the nature of that dialogue a a neura plasticity we know that reordering of neurl circuitry require in the adult requires these things intense focus followed by rest et cetera but the basis for that bik beneath focus is the mechanism is a mechanism rather beneath the the been that we call deep breast is a mechanism in those mechanisms or neuromogulator driven to me your a i'm not reviewing your grant a but a from a rational perspective it seems that drugs that increase certain neuromodulators ceratonan or dopening in a in a controlled way and then coupling that with learning of some sort censory and put of some sort it make sense that that would lead to could i should say lead to reordering of circuitry that would allow for better thinking better mood a many the same things tha you have observed in the clitical trials for a for depression the rational is really strong i think that is a very exciting ara i could asked all the time about tebio and tramatic brain intry and right now it is kind of it a there is not a whole lot that people can do whan people are dabbling in the space of a hyperbare chambers and people do sona and breath work and you now and people are kind of clipping at the margins of what really is a proble that resides deep to the skull i think i just want of pplot that the exploration i think it is great provided that exploration is being done in a controlled way it sonds that is what you are doing with the you f se yeres that e we we tey they were really gracious and had myself and and a few of my collegues out to their headquarters ind vagus in present place rand iit is in process ener there is a dialogue going on there a'm hopeful that there is going to be i'm some some work with them but it is it is in process now in terms of exploring that there is a real interest ind i i'm just really impressed by the organization in their commentments a athlete house and i amill see ye i am to we a we have a a colli out there a were doing all a bit of work with them donk in french whose a serious academic in his own right and i think when people her you have see they just think about the octing on in fighting and paper of view fights and things but in talking with them and i'm sure you have have these discussions as well they are very much interested in the healf and longhevity of their fighters they are also interested in the health and longevity of their fighters being a templet for how to treat tramatic brain injury and improve human performance in other sports and in the general public and i think it is not a an image of the ou ave see that is commonly comes to mine cause they have not been particularly a a verbal about it in the press bu think it is great ther bringing in academics soming geeks us going in out to the you have see performanc center m you do emama but im basically just a geek walking through the place but the fact that their interestin talking to scientists is really a'm bised here but a point in their favour m along the lines of other groups and individuals that have impacted the space that you'r working in in this pioneering of of the psychadelic space a a few years ago i think if some one submitted to grant saying i want to study how sillisi been impacts human depression i'm guessing having worked on these panels before that the the response might have been closer too well we need to do a lot of studies and rodans and a lot of studies and primates and then maybe just maybe we could explore these drugs because the nationalstitutes of health ashe has a a a whole institute devoted to a diction right of the exploring compounds only in terms of their negative of facts i which is a nire which is where i've got in all of my age fundy which is interesten i and it is a superimportant institute i wont be clear the amazing people there but philanthropy and foundation have been v ry important in supporting pioneering research a and may we just talk a little bit about about that youre lab receives funding from taxpar dollars through the natuonal institutes of health is that mainly where your sort youre your funding comes from our group has gotten some funding from say the nationans don drugbes nita for some a small subset of the psychodelic work but only for some work a gear towards understanding these things as drugs of abuse course me you do a study though youshs hother ut ex i dont other abad riht r but wone you doing that you can explore ad a the good stuff too but but the the large majority of the work and the most interesting work has been funded by philanthropy priveun now i i still have some grat a support from nita outside of psychodelics i shipting more and more of my a my time towards yo focusing only on psychodelics and in fact us getting that the the sentra level funding from am some really big picture philanthropists helped me to start to make that transition but groups to have to research organization denis mckenof which is one of the founding members the brother tansmac ckani who ise by the way an athnobotanists that is what i what is nate s an no mon studying the the essentially the anthropology of a a of psycholact of plant use the only get a degree in the ye ye ye hanging out with cultures and studying their use of these compounds in the traditional ways a hon there is at that degree exists it johns i do not i do nothink that degree exist at hopkin o tat i mean the the kind of the most ean as as you will as from macad me i i'm not yes sometimes folks i'm not sure how many people's p h s actually in aske no botny or s a as er an for something else but the real focusis my degree is general experimental psychology a o i sualls out there just de psided their gon a major an ethnobotany wush i mean woneder the pioneers of the psychodelicharea before leery and before and actually he was late even for the human researchers foks humphryosmen and evr hafer an sidney coen were earlier but even before those folks om richard sholties at harvard he was i mentioned him earlier in the conversation discovered all of this i this the terious tribes using i wascor yaga different name for the same thing u throughout south america and these deemt containing snuffs and all of this you nadout was a athnobotany this kind of the the conintersection of anthropology in these psycholact of a plant a compounds sso to have to research institute which denis is a is o it is afounding enactive a a member of aboard member they have funded a lot of our early work theres also an organizasion called the the u debeckly institute a basin england that the lady aman of fielding is that has been the head of that has a they provided the first funding for our umsylicivan a smoking cessation research in halfder came in an provided subsequent funding but it is and then therere other groups a council in spiritual practices a great guy and ame bobjese umfunded some of the original work at hopkins looking at the nature of mystical experience outside of treating disease states ar disorders thot gis understanding these people take these compounds and astonishingly in a frequently well say that was the most important everything i've ever experience i hell is that i hav iad some one mention resently i think this might surprise bulla bits t certainly surprise me out of friend who adores his children he is got th retorden adores his children ha happy marriage great great father the broth greeprnt and he told me that as part of a clinical trial he had a demty experience that he claims he said i'd love to tell you that it that the birth of my children was thas profound but if that was a more profound experiece than the birth of my children any one of them an all of them combined ils wilt nove never done the empty bolls i well that is a pretty strong statement how he did it in the contexts of one of these clinical explorations i soon tnow was part of a legal clinical trial but the ti mean that saying something the saying something and he is a very rational very grounded guy aotherwise but philantropy foundations and then i most recently ands i just in maank as i cannot skip it our senter lain clans a giving hars year and a halp i se thats we mean the hafter group the beckly group i meen these are wonderful onming these are people that have been holding the flame alive during the darkest hours the rain same thing with imdeet with the maps organization on or indya maside holding that candle during the darkest years that mean us a we but smaller organizations connected e smaller but growing over time you now pockets of wealth but we basically limped on limped along on a wing in a prayer until recently when we got the seventeen million dollar gift that we could create anominal senter and as basically to the university that means you get a certain number of dollars and a lot of them you can call yourself a center it is a capital investment a youno staff you n equipment umsalary support which is always been the huge thing for us but the seventey million dolli get gep which was split between the the the the coin foundation stephen in alexandr coen a they covered half of it in the other half of the tem varis collaborative basically tim and a few a frends ponied up that the you now divided the rest of that half of that seventeen million dollar gift and came together tojust i mean it just its completely transformed are the work that we done in our bility to to foolly del into this area and not worry that a if i fogus on this rather than putting another three not a grance on some other topic that man may not get fundat if i fog is too much on the psychodelics and i putting my career at japardy but likes a bour knowing not only attendered professor also a full endowed youright o that othe waye must say somemondy is a fully endowed profess an m very clear what that means that means that the ar manan ol o the above it now i have no knowledge of your particular situation but a you you probably do a but sure the am an these a what wore sumcshy saying is that funding which does not change somebody salary level i jus one to be cleark as i think the general public is in m there is no reason why they would a understand all the the nots and bolts of how this were acadin as weye acnym is weird because it we are not talking about increasing we are not talking about an endowment that were philanthropy that went to increase am mats salary that that something that set at the universiy level am it is always been said in it a this he least is still true now which is that your nobody goes into science for the money at least not at the academic level am not it inacadamia but am allows people to to vote more of their time and energy to these a exploratory a realms psychodelic recerge or on the case of my lab the work that were doing the david speale's lab on on respiration breath work and hypnosis for madually inbrain states these are not typically areas that the national institutes of health another major organizations have institutions set up to support now there is an exciting initiative a which is the enc c agh which is complimentary health a mes to be in cam yo ye ad a asn and now we are not just throwing out acranyms just a to bat bac and for thacranyms but i think what we are looking what we are seen now it is a movement toward science and scientists and clinations and the general public and philanthropy being engaged in this dialogue which says o k there are problems in the world depression head trama a psychalogical tramapetst eighty h te these problems clearly exist the solutions are going to involve behaviors theyare going to involve nutrition supplementation social connection however there are drugs there are compounds that can change the brain and allow the brain to change its circuitory through experience and psychodelics are one of of pseveral others but one of the powerful levers it sounds and and i just wone to say i think the reason i reach out to you in excited to sit down and chot with you is because i see very few people inside the halls of acadamia who have thrown their arms around this issue of psychodelics in a way and gone through the trouble of trying to find the funding to get it done gone through the trouble of trying to set up clenical trials i know what is involved in doin this it' complicated time consuming an painstaking and you have made real progress i meanigue as are publishing papers there is a new dialogue emerging that is not just books on bookshelves and i'm and psy psychodelic psycho not geruse on the inner net a who also plain importaint role but you are really moving this field forward and i know their others as well their colleagues in england and others as well will will weacknowledge them but i just want to say personally that i'm inspired and impressed by the way that you have gone about this and the level of rigor i mean when i ask you a question about seratonan most people just kind o kick back to me will you got receptors an got aligan but mean it is clear to me that you care about the details and that you care about the future of this area and you also really cre about these patients an these individuals i know 'm s beyon behalf of a ton of people now and in the future that do not even know what they are going to receive as a consequence of this i just one of voice o real sincere i'm thank you for for that affor it is your lab and your work matters and that is a really special and unique that appreciate that i had a a good collague bacshareds an grand support under the multi pia system years ago and and she she actually took a jovin an at at in i ages as as a review officer and remember her telling me unw ain she actually left when she had maltipl ara one it is ike she did not know ar ones are of that the ray of yoter an big yarants that every i'm every card carrying a it is a mark of respect in our community to have you are one or several of these e yet ye meno in it is i you you ou whic you kill in acadena gets si over talking out later it is you do not make more money byut pulling morgrants but you are able to pay the salary that the university does not pay you your salary your your goes through them you dousablely any more work yet in you are able to likean if you do not pull in the grands to cof your salary your jhopin come to in it even if your ten oured at a place hopkins they can do tricks slowly lower your salary over these is let you non ta you oryo yor they just take away your space yet they put you in a clas and give you no support for traineys and basically make life hell for you i i've a cat an balltomone call yoursolv a full professor hopkins truthfully that you nare not have no ability to assure the oing the done but im but ye renever one of things this collygue shaid who is successful but left on top said i r eally not nowthat o making a difference in the world and she did some great memory research aand an and connected to drugs also connected to aging but she she said i do not ou now i do not i do not feel the impact of what i'm doing in the world world an it is unfortunately there for a lot of acadene whal we do it stays in the ivory tower ou know the world is a not an in mor thats as a place and a lot of this does not diseminate and and and because of the various structures the way the world is set up and thankfully this i mean because the work that that our group as well as a few others around t the world over the last twenty years it is you do hapean emerging psychodelic start up industry now with buildings abollige of investment and yet that is goon a turn into both good and bad you kow it is up ing the ance there is can be a lot of good and bad that comes from that but any new technology is goin to result in that but we got silicive and designated for two separate enities as a break through terip by the f te and people may not realize an india a is designated as a break through theripe for nd for ptst this is a really big deal that is a very high am farm of companies would pay millions of dollars to get there new drug a designation that an what it means is it early researches shon saying it chose a high potential for treating disorders that do not have very good treatments we are and were probably yet again a few years away from both emdy mand probably a year two after that silicive and being treated for ptst and depression respectively this is e we have to wait for the face three studies but if the results hold up an even if the effects ies is have of what we are seeing now it is still ging to be a lot largers whach you are seeing with the traditional medication and it is going to be a proved if the day to hold up and it probably wild for my judgment i feel what i'm doing is actually having a positive impact and in the world in a way that and i feel i feel lucky that i got interested in area that happens o plug into a place in the world were there is that opportunity were soms me o great colleagues and friends are folksed on areas were i wish they had the opportunity for the work to be disseminated i wish tha amei was likely to be interviewed on on sixty minutes because of this work and las onl my got i dos soing there is a bit of a in poster sendrum lie anl my got i know many scientist that deserve no more than me to be have that level of exposure o but if you happen to be in that place were it you got to do your best t to make it work to take advantage of that luck in that intersection of the world and to to push it and anot i've been lucky but also did take a bit of a leap o a faith oearly on i did have some ou kno advisers that told me you got a really promising pedigree early on our sure you ant a focust i you ni an thi ycadelics ev yhouvebeen you have embraced rist coming i think that i' min the world's changed and since that in twenty twenty certainly but your channels social media pardcasts and things that sort y your exposure is is because people are interested in these topics and not's whi people myself or are interested in talking t you i mean it at stamford there are now a few labs starting to explore psychodelic s mort the mechanistic gloveel but amson animal models am excellent labs am but also i can imagine and because of the pioneering work that you have done hopkins ill start to become more common i'm certain that people are going to have questions about how to get in contact with you and learn more am if people have tro a pitios te depression a you it is likely that they are going to start seeking ways than which they can pretentially prerticipaing clinical trials you are very active on twitter active i should say you have got other obligations but where you are active on socia mete your active on twitter it is it is drug it is at drug down score research or rit rit ri ki drug under score research or a that is how to find me great account by the way am matthew and i ave recently got into a dialogue there about some of the deoper of facts of psychodelics an the literature verse is how they are being discussed in the general public and i follow his account it is a really wonderful account for whether not yoove a science background or not a if people are inand i'm gein a trime persuade you to be more active on in stergrand but i do not know als esom non id an int your usy i an i i get it i runnial aptil i get at you are busy but but a we your drug downscore research or there as well and am the same handl a youre lab at hopkins is pretty straight fort to find through gugal search of your name matthew johnson johns hopkins university or their portals for people to am to explore clinical trials a presuspicion clinical trials of various ye and in ar gru is a you go to hopkins psychodelic dota word that is the webs i and y be cannot remember that just john time insidid elic ye w yet and you are going to find us i it will be the first thing the pops op and we have trust me if we have a study on something it is going to be on that webside tha means to he is there being very polite i will be a little bit more aggressments ayd do not emell him directly he will not see that email wait until there is a posting for a study and then sign up through the corrent rional and i try to get back to those emales but frankly and it is a it is cause mean a i'm lucky the area has taken off much but there are many days where i simply get many av to dosrests that i yon can do thereser i ge ye if i answer oy yet trust me if there are not are not something that a lot of folks do not get in being an acadeni we are it is easy to forget how people do not understand we do not no realize is this is experimental research it is ft a approved as an experiment iu os who were working for its formal ft e approval for straiht of clinical use but right now some one cannot bring me a case of some ediosancratic thing and and say i'm suffering from this complex constallat oure not a clinession and yet im not aclet an even if i was i would not be able to treat them with sylicibe an or to send em anywhere that was legal to to to to to take it ou know if if if we are going to be treating you it is it has to be or any one else in the united states or most other countries for that matter it is going to have to be under the guise of a very specific protical this number of melegrams to treat p t st to treat major to pressi disorder to treat ou a treatment resistant a tobacco use tisorders obnicotin addiction very specific studies this is not one all treatment nt folk say all i can pay to go out to baltimore if you see m a my son has this ou a complex it in their tragic cases but you if you are interested in a study go to our webside if it is not on that website ou no we do not have a study on it ther'll argoin to be forthcoming cities on can be starting studies on opuata diction and ptsty and analiste study for chronic pain it the day that those are open for recruvement they are gin to be up on our websiders o that is where you look i'm to see everythin in fact i would just recently cope o days ago put up a couple surveysays also where we posting sour surveysudy if you if you had psychadelis you have taking them for ther peuto content intent for petist or for depression or anxiety you can find a link and also if youve done breath work for those reasons we have a link for a study of that type up there now which is a a holotropecstyli t very sychadelic type of o a a breathing tachnique that can lead to some of these similar experience oso it is up there more broadly outside of our group cause thre's a growing number of groups in the u s doing this and in europe doing this research but you can go to to clinical trials dot gov and if you look in for the the the main search term up of sylicibean or india may or psychodelic plugin those terms you cane get a list of the growing number i m i think theres i think there is over forty maybe it is been a while it there might feel for fifty now i do not know but a studies with jucilicive an going on right now on clinical trials dot gob check out clinical trials dot gof to see what is going on but it is going to be if you are ging to do anything legal it is going to be in the contacts of a very specific study it is not going to be one all treatment right yet i should say is not just legal but also supported in the right framework that you described of having a team et cetera i obviously peoplewill do what they will do and the sene if o yo i was not if people i never incr urage people to take drugs of any i do not encourage cafins every drug has its rist i encourage my own cafe i baya helses i'm drinking upright now is the great ans is very strong mate is what we are

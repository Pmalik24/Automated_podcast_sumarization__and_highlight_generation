cet wye that my o number ii be go bac myfol number the mik on o te fo number t you do med up actually myfol numbers these stories reminded me of an old chinese saying i once heard actually i learnted a couple weeks ago and i have no idea how old it is but it goes this boosall butochu that is my friend u and u an d booshall butchu and hoat is if there is no coincidence there will be stories no coincidence no story to implyin thents of course life ao i don now t devoloped in the ways that we cannot predict is it if you heard a story with he coincidence afterwards he might be now coinsidens in a story that yes just a expression you use the tucolt i say a cornything to say mostly i think of no i i will not be a crikii should you ever is it when i'm corny yes shat the risk of being corny i'm going to say it to days show no coincidence no story while the big man's away bergt a sneak these coincident stories on to the air all the stories you will here to day first aired on our show and twenty thirteenth about four years ago and they are all verified true stories that my colleagues hit for me until the actual interviews woudn't spoil is surprise which is also why there is much on professional giggling this hour and full disclosure i came into this topic a coincidence sceptic believing that a coincidence is just a coincidence nothing more i judged i confronted weakness i countered wide eyed faith with statistical probability and by the end well stay with us at one grandmas blake oliver is living in nikaraga right now we talked on skite about four months ago he was on the phone to his friend cimil who goes by cammy he mentioned to her that the screen savor on his eyephone had been the same picture for a long time that he wanted to change it i ask toe sou im jsemia picture of something a and and it was really funny she inded up sang me this picture of her as little kit is a joke aslyke ah yes can a funny snowtas expecting bu tis funny and then i glanced back at the picture and i saw my grandma walking through behind her what ye how crazy is that right very crazy the picture was taken about eighteen years ago but you recognized her right away i i assthere is no question asioshois is that question gemages coincidence is this one usually have a dense nest of details to bolster the craziness here goes blake is from michican that is where he met camil but camille's family is not fermisshingan at all there originally from you taw solli sity ou ta that is where she grew up ye thats she gre wat i was this photo from youta no n that is the funny thing is my grandmalis in melburne florida and i'm thinking al she must have been in youton what castid cammys no now that that pictures taken in ferkfill i than couver island in cannada what ya right blake figured out that at the same time that cammy in her family were on vacation an bancouver grandma joyce had gone there to visit some of her husband's relatives ik what is that would it ansis to think that not only tid i meet cammy but she since me this picture of her in the background of my grandma i do not know what the chances are mit is itall right yes innolily i do not if you seen the picture but not only just in the picture butly perfectly behind her at that moment a fellow producer emailed me the photo and there it was cute four your old cammy in the foreground facing the amera and not far behind her a blond woman walking past wering blue shorts and a matching top yes she is noing it she is in the picture even y wrihte it saunt opye she does not seem aware but i hav to say it is it is a little am you knats not a very crisp poto i'm sort of surprise you would recognize her right away well ya there is not a lot of it is my groma noesly r i twenty years ago for my first reporting job i interviewed a woman who just turned a hundred years old i asked her admittedly a rooky question what is the most amazing thing that is happened in your life she thought for a while and then she said the most interesting thing that happened to me was that on my first day at phatchog school the principle said to me what is your name i said estra tuddle and he said i have a friend in shelter iland by that name i was twelve she said and that to me was remarkable this woman had seen the advent of cars and movies and computers and space travel and this was her answer but the time i thoght it was lame that mayby ester was losing it a little but since i our t hearing all these coincident stories the last couple of weeks iv reconsidered coincidences feel rare and that sticks with you even when the coincidenceis barely a coincidence at all and icademic study of people's reactions took coincident stories from the early nineteen adies found that we have an egocentric by us toward hoer own coincidences thet people find stories that happened o them far more surprising then the same stories happening to other people castined point mi name if julian a bon tager and in fifteen years old juliana she is got a problem with her grandmother my grandma have been afe with e coinfidencind and she find them in all the time in yhe alway want to tell every one about them and we gegan o annoyed with er i i e you di ye think ther fo in cretable and hav i happened to her all the time nd if every time we fe her all my got you would not believe what happened to me and l eve am i was at the

about that on hon i was o confuse about it case o julina's coincidence as a common one we have all had those moments when you are reading a certain word and then some one says it on the radio or on t v but remember juliana sixteen maybe this is the first time as happening to her still i'm on her side here i think it is more remarkable than her grandmother's example of the people in the waiting room being at the restaurant do you are dyou have a phone where you can dial up your grandmar i know i can try tr it i ca on recon julian a conference toer grandmother in we could settle tus i'm here you a open he layin old son nice to meet you ti tet you gr i laid out my argument freelane about the purity and therefore superiority of juliana's example but he lain argued right back there were several hours between the two sitings plus the restaurant was about four miles from the hospital and in that four mile radyet you mi thak i could a glat to any number i re bat t ha tat that i man in er at ha i ba i think a qui iit i think it she cold a gon any plate to that is that is true i mean this tere in somethin im noting it is not a coincdence i'm just saying it is not may be as pure as you can break down this sort of probabilities of w certain kind of person in a certain kind of ne g e do you do not think i i ad do you think you are somehow prone to coincidences coincidencas fi new hore than they find other people i do not kno that wut i you now in my own amily a a a a happen to you and do not get don' yo mi o be rebot by i a you o a when you av er goin a we have nothing to give to you because you have youre han you randi ny w i a ai what would juliana what would juliana have to experience in terms of a coincidence that would impress you toyou think what would it need to be wel you no ci to cal a i a couple of week o go i had mi i ca nopit anothe got i at gitting in we fettarr jentlmen a plot we in this time it was about an agen man in the waiting room whom she laid hersel buying a melon a trater jros which alane admitted was not as good as the other one a to in god we trust sprobably no surprise tat we got a huge number of coincidenc's pitches about love romantic loves a fe years ago after stephenlea proposed to his girl friend helen theye brougt their families together for the first time to celebrate the engagement my motha my tep dad came to new york to meet with helns parent and batically over the course of dinner and coffee afterward we discovered that o ba we my father had daded my wife's mother tacan crea back in that ninteen tix and you

sofas in beds probably have the boys at his college had change stuck to them i told rhyan i do not think there is any coincidence and balved at all i do an begon because i'll tell you i now i do wat

it i swear to god start asking start asking no i i c cannot cn frs icon i knew rhyn would not actually start asking i started asking is because while rhyan's life is sure to contain many special and unique experiences i am positive that this is not one of them iff i went to prove him wrong because finding others would be easy i happened to live in a college town state college pennsylvania home of

that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our programme continues it is this american life i'm saracanag sitting in for ira glasse we have borrowed to days show from a chinese saying no coincidence no story we first ared the show four years ago after asking you to send us your coincident stories and you flooded us with more than thirteen hundred pitches we found triends we found gems we found stories impossible to classify whend i'ms jeff on jeff don o ha jeff grup in su city iwa when he was sixteen whe was hanging out with two of his friends at some one's house the parents were at home theire goofing round smoking pot they are in the living room that had a huge window on one wall and we are sitting there and were kind of sitting on this glass wall and there is a dirt road outside this house and up this dirt road barrels this then and the thing that happens nexts is what you think i'sgoing to happen when we see a a white dan that at night t guides get out theyre atl can of bundled up and they pretty quickly just run to the back of th van open it up and pull out this big black bag they get out they take the the bag ous and they quickly run up this kind of small hill this behind his house and it is all woit there is no house sus bact ther they run up this hill with this bag and less than two minutes later the come running back down and they get n the van and they take off jeff an his friends do precisely what you do not want them to do if this were in after school special this is the point where you are yelling at the t v saying do not do it stay inside tbut they decided they haf to find out what the strange men in the van have deposited at the top of the hill they run up there we get to the top and can a look around and then we see that cand of on one side of it there is the this man holl cover a circular man will cover youl see anywhere an coming from one of the edges of the man wholl cover it is in place is long brown here human here long brown human hair they are teen ajers they are stoned they are freeked out they halfe to tell in adult about what they have seen a police car happens to drive by they flag it down and the officer tells them to get in the back it became clear that she was really concerned because she then said gathers and our girl thiy sing on the west side a town for the last coup of days my ad a gawn our hearts just sor of drop and you had not known that had not bet on the news or something li cand we anoint it ideaso we we just conen got scared at that point can i can i staf ye for second is the story gin the get funny or is the saharfying story wait actually do not tell me do not tol me toll you ock ay do not tol me she calls another officer and the other officer comes there is couple cars and they both get out and tell us to get out an they sayo they waiht at the bottom of hit awaitin they go walking out tot and it is dark we cannot really see them that well but we can see them well enough and we do not really want a watch whit is going on because we see them thend over pull the cover off and i'm trying not to look but of course i'm looking am she pulls up a human figure out of the hole on and than she says it is a manikins i do not know what my fimvin but i was sitting there tinking as own how does this story and that oquet in a cousin in ian universe ik unless you say it is a ma jeff goes to school on monday tells his story in physic's class and the kid next to him says that was us we did it we went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them we stuffd them under the man hol cover the manican by the way had been the virgin mary and some one's nativity scen i think the real coinceidenceis thatit is our close friens that cause tus to hapen o they were gin friends er sir i i now jeff turns out that is not the real coincidence of the story my producer bryan read was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both missd the point brin is to splain out that i mis you and i ere both mistin an in o coincidence of my own story i sumitted at o the coincidencethes thing the main coincidencs there is a girl missing at the same time yet i have five words for you jeff boo shall wu tonthal no coincidence no story here is a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidenc is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection it is that middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because when events line up just you cannot help it you cannot help but wonder if there is a message in that in that way coincidences are kind of short cuts to very big questions about fate about god even to people who do not believe in either one the notion that somewhere out there some one or some thing is paying attention to your life that there might be a plan conjured through coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you are young we got one story about a young couple visiting maricash in morocco thereat a restaurant talking you do about old flames the boyferin wanted to know about one guy in particular i have kate he

the chances in order to let a good coincidence live a long and healthy life to get told and retold and take its rightful place in the narrative of your life sometimes you have to stop yourself from thinking it all the way through why it happened really is the fact is any statistition will probably rain on your parade well tell you these things happend a lot more often than you think but a good coincidence is a good magic trick when you see one a struggle and sis instantaneously but tween the thrill of the apparent miracle and the urged to dobunkit this final story is by carry weeks he is a prop guy for the movies but he told this at a story telling competition here is my story nine years old first ti'me going to summer camp and my grandfather gives me before i go he gives me his old pocke knife is pressicly in antique and the first thing all is boys do when we get to camp is we pull it our knifes who start throw them at things trying to get them to stick the way dan or bone did and because his nineteen sound es there is nothing unusual about a bunch of young children throwing sharp knives aroundi got mined to stick in the floor board ils i long and is grife that when i pulld it out the tip broke off o but anyway cannot goes on ind a few days later i notice my knife is missing and i'll look everywhere for it i look hilook low it is gone the one day and walkin through camp and see this group of boys thrown knife at a tree and somethin tells me i should check this out and sure enough there is his boy there throwin my knife now there is no mistaking this knife because the handle was red and green but the coller's met in the midal n count swoll together in the trippy psycodelic way and i've never seen a knife that before since walk up to this boy hou's loitotle old or be walk up to him as say hey that is my knife he says now it is mife ass a no that is my knife my grandfather gave it to me he says no he did not is is my grandfather gave it to me and i'm confused all the sun maybe i should have thoughthers through bet more i thought he would just hand it over and the other boys the movin close and un thinkin could it be possible that his grandfather gave him the exact same knife that my grandfather gave me i mean is this a thing and i just did' know it but i'l look at the knife he is holding his hand and i look at the blade and see that the tip of the blade is square it off is though it were broken and i say that is my knife because i broke the tip off when i stuck it in the floor he says what that no it came that way he can is it a screw driver and i look at the other boys and i'm not getting any help from them and i wander off just thinking to myself screw driver and never thought of that well as you can imagine this really bug me and i do not mean just while i was at camp but for the rest of my life and i cant think why did i fold easily why did not i go to the counsillors and the only thing i can think of is this i'm the sun of a physicist and i used to ask my dad these questions all the time dad how far away is the sun dad how fast is the speed of light dad what is the closest star and he would give me these answers in these numbers that would just ing huge i could not get my mind around them my my point is this i better than most other children had an idea of just how bast the universe is and there por how infinite the possibilities are my the thing is at the time my tht wot may be the kits telling the truth the only ries when i bring tis up is because this is what i was thinking of when some thirty two years later i become the landlord of a small apartment building and one of the first things i did as a landlord was i i threw the sky out because he was a small time drug dealer on the day he is moving out i get a call from his neighbor across the hall a gi i call budwiser bob and budwiser bob iys a that druggy is stealing your refrigerator and i hop down there and sure enough in the driveway is a pick up trok and in the back of the pick up truck is a refrigerator i charge up the stairs and a demand to know just what the helse going on and neck the druggy calmly tells me is says dod when i moved in here that refrigerator was grose i bought my own refrigrator and swapped it out and i put that when hou storge and now on just put in at back and i look in the kitchen and sure not there is another refrigerator it is a little old a little dirty but it is working and i'm trying to think thi threug i mean would someone really go to all that trouble of just swapping out or frigerator in them putting in storage and bringing it back or would at gi go to the trouble stealing a used refrigerat or just as crew as landlord and replacing it with and even more used to refrageraand well the answer to both these questions is yats but i look o and there is neck and he is expecting me to say something and there is is budies or helping him move and they are expecting me to say something i walk up to neck i look him in the eye and i say to him you sweep up real good before you leave cares there is just two many possibilities in this universe carry me exclanin new york his story was recorded

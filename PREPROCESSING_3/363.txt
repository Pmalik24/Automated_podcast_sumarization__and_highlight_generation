welcome to the huberman lapone dscu science science pace to li i mander huberman and om a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin to day my guest is doctor suzanna soberg doctor susanna soberg completed her doctoral thesis work at the centere of inflammation and metabolism and the centere for physical activity research at the university of copenhiggen ind denmark he research as focused on how deliberate cold exposure and deliberate heat exposure can be used to enhance human metabolism she is the first author of a seminal study which discovered the minimum thresholds for deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure for increasing brown fat thermogenisis which is essentially a mode of increasing heat production and metabolism in the body and for establishing actionable protocals that can be used outside of the laboratory to improve metabolism and human health doctor sober's research was published in the journal sell reports metabolism in twenty twenty one adding to a long and important history of research focusing on the roll of cold and the roll of heat in altering various aspects of the body's physiology including hormon health metabolism and changes an narrow transmitters such as dopamine and epinefran in fact to day's discussion with doctor soberg focuses on the roll of deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure on metabolism but it also includes discussion of the effects of cold and heat on things narrow transmitter production namely dopamine and epinepran and norepine from the call cata colamines which strongly impact mood and metabolism in addition doctor soberg anserch many common questions about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure including for instance the difference between cold showers verses cold immersion up to the neck verses total body cold immersion including whether not going back and forth between heat and cold changes fundamentally the way that heat and cold impact the metabolism hormones and neuro transmitter product ion and we talk about almost every single nuants and variation on deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure protocals as it relates to the underlying science in particular how cold receptors that the level of the skin are impacted verses cold reception and perception at the level of the brain and how all of that impact systems of the brain embody relating to mental health physical health and performance based on her scientific research and academic training as well as her understanding and use of deliberte heat and deliberate cold exposure protocals doctor soberg is considered one of the world's leading experts on these topics in fact she is the author of a recent book entitled winter swimming which is i have to say a terrific book because it breaks down chapter by chapter the different aspects of deliberate heat and deliberate cold into its various constituent parts including cold aclamization the cold shock respons dangers and safeties of cold water the impact of cold and impact of heat on various aspects of human health as well as specifics relating to sanaverses ice verses cold swimming showers et cetera it is a very thorough read in a very easy and accessible read that if you are interested in deliberate cold are deliberate heat exposure ere both will allow you to embrace those protocols with the greatest degree of confidence that you are going to obtain the specific and points that youare interested in and to do safely before we begin i emphasize that this podcast is separatefor my teaching an research rols at stamford it is however part of my desiron efforts to bring zero costic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of todays to day's episode is also brought to us by elements elements is an electrolite drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and patassium but it has no sugar of doct many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerv r sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodia manesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and ifhydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the proparatios of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is eleemente docam slash huberment and you'l get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element elemente docam slash huberman fodcast and now for my discussion with doctor susanna soberg doctor susanna soberg welcome thank you great to have you here i feel i shuld give a little bit of the back story of how we got connected which was that for many years i've been interested in colthermagenisis it was the topic of my senioristy assystan college and i'f of course followed the a popularity of wimhoff and we have had doctor crag heller my colleague from biology department at stamford who works on cold and it is impactd on physiology and sports perform ait for a long time i've been interested in this area but there is been a real a lack of new let us say high profile quality scientific information in terms of how for instance cold plunge is and sana how that impacts human physiology i know there is been some information out there but it is been sort of scattered and then little over a year ago i see this paper in sell reports medicine and was immediately struck an the first ofall the fact that it was in cell reports medicine i've been on the sel pressod edito ryalboard for a long time now as journals are of course phenomenal journals and the title and the content of the paper was directly in line with the sorts of practices that people are very curious about and then are striving to emerge things sawn a cold plunges and there was your name first on the author list and i reashout you through socia media and we have done a little bit of live content there together and i've been tracking what you have been doing in the world in terms of your book and talking about the results in your manuscript and talking about the science and impact of deliberate cold exposure and soona and i have to say that it is been a wonderful and remarkable thing to see and your bringing much quality information about this area that for a long time i think it was kind of niche and is now becoming more and more mainstream i'm in a start off with a thank you for being here and a thank you for the work that you have done and i'm looking for to talking to you about it to day my first question i'm to get things started is what is happening when we get into an uncomfortably cold environment for instance if i'm really hot on a hot day jumping into a cold pool feels really good but if i'm already kind of i at room temperature i'm a lile bit chilly getting into that same temperature of water does not feel good right there is a shock there if you could just walk us through what happens when we get into uncomfortably cold water whether not it is by way of shower or cold plunge at the level of our physiology and if you would our psychology i think that is a good place for us to start because i think it will orient people to their own experience if they do that and for those that have not done it im might start to peel back some of the the layers as to what the underlying mechanisms of cold are ye thank you for that cuistion it is pretty good sugjestagdrest what i tually happens in our physiology when we get cold and you can get cold in many ways say you can just heat out though the one ti gives you the most potentest tresser which is submercing into col water and but you could also go in outside in the col wind that is also gon a exivate your an you sympathetic nervous system get all these neuaterancs ment af going in your body and you you catacola mines an let us just address that we are taking a col plunge for example if you are very hot for example an before you go into the coat is gong o feel less is going to feel less tress wot what the the temperature a difference from your skin to the cold is definite goin ant give you a a shock but your col temperature is warmer and that is going o feel a live a better that is why when people gointo sana for xembl and go out an in into the col water they they they can do it easily a ye see are then if they were cold beforehand could i as im ask you a few questions you you mention the sympathetic nervous system which for a people listening who are not familiar with that is the the branch of our nervous system that is responsible for creating excelerations and heart rades a feelings of alertness it is accompanied with stress and the stress response but it is accompanied with waking up in the morning for that matter it is not always about stress and thn you mention the catacolal means which em our dopmean epan efferen and nor up and efferend maybe a lo it later will talk about those individual nor transmitters but you raise a really important point which is something i get asked about a lot for people that are curious about using deliberate cold exposure which is how cold should the water be and i know it is very hard to give a straight prescription for that because i think it boils down to what you just said which is it is really the difference between your current temperature and really the temperature of the surface of your skin and the temperature of the water if youre very warm getting into cold feels good if you already cold getting into more cold feels stressful a is there any way that we can start to gauge what is the best way to approach a deliberate cold exposure protocol imshould it feel le uncomfortable and that leads in the question of how do we balance the discomfort with the amount of time that we spend in for instance if it is just a little bit uncomfortable we will spending more time in the cold get us the same benefit as getting into very uncomfortably cold water for a very short period of time yet t is really good question and i dent notly think that this could be and future studies on this as well really unravel a what kind of protocose it are the are the best way or also for which out comes of course if the temperature is a very cold and you feel that at you also feel very cold then you cse tould stay in the water a a bit longer s i think it is just you should get uncomfortable cold as long as you get uncomfortable cold it is cold enough and you get this what we calld the cold shocks to the cosuk is actibation of your sympathetic nervous system and desay actibation of the the catacola minds with you just mention before jos the shock mean that i'm having trouble controlling my breathin is at a good gage i ye you can say because that is can alike how we define it you high povinsulate you have a faster and a breathing rate and that increases also because you actibate your gasping reflects if you are new to this and but if you are adapt it it i kind of subsides with time i with aadaptation what you can do is that you can train this cold exposure and you can cannalike get adapted to it you do not hape this high povinsilating response every time you go out in the cold waters this is building up your raciliens builling building up your adaptation is gona make thi shock subside a bit is it is always harder in the beginning but you should do hard things riit i's not something that we you should not think about cold water and cold were immersion as something that is comfortable iu should be hard because that is the point of it rint if you enjoy it then yet then i'm i'm thinking something iswrong i's not r you sid not an geit for this is an important point that you are making because i think that many people shy away from deliberate cold exposure because it is uncomfortable in a way that at least from my experience is very different than the discomfort of exercise because with exercise for instance if running har in a running fast and breathing hard is uncomfortably can slow down or walk if lifting weights is uncomortable you can remove some weight or produced the number of repetitions or stop with deliberate cold exposure i suppose you can be sort of half way in half way out of the water or partially underneath the cold shower but it is very hard to tigh trate an adjust the level it is an of all or none and i've seen i shouldjust i can tell this by anecdote i ave done some work with military special operations i will not say which country this was outside the you ask and these are very tough individuals there used to going without sleep and doing hard high consequence high risk kind of work and they were asked to do some cold water exposure training and i was there that day and it was remarkable about a third of them just went straight in ans cone of grinded through it lake they looked stoic anyway to me there were a few whimpers no cries about a third talked a lot and got really you could tell that they were agitated and anxious but t he made it through and then about a third of them just simply would not get in pass their knees or fies we are just it seeme they were just dreading the whole experience some i she did not ashally go in completely which was really surprising to me and that you could not tell based on their physical appearance wor anything else about them the'r all high performers as to who would have this response seems people very tremendously in terms of their ability to embrace the discomfort of the cold is that from your studies is at your experience as well or or there the weird mutints who seem to just love going into the cold for the first time some people just feel better in the cold and some peopleare dread the cold even more and yu can say the more people are pushing the cold away they might feel the cold pain even more they they they would definitely people who are may be the soldiers you just talked about they some of them might be already adapted to the gold cold if they are not scared of the cold they go out and they embrace the cold in a better way it could also be that some people have a more sensitive nervous system and when you are but sensitive to the cold you of course try to get a away from it riot and you wil also have the cold pain more and feel the col pain more if they if if you avoid it the more you a boy at the cold the the more pain painful it will feel and when you go into it ye you mention being outside in a tea shirt verses and cold immersion up to the neck werses shower i think and this is something a lot of people wonder about what are the differences in terms of impact short term and perhaps even long term between cold showers cold plunge to the neck i could be an ice water just very cold water a immersion with dunking one's head and then coming up because obviously you w oge to come up frare at some and then simply being outside on a cold day in shorts in tha tea shirt or something of that sort the different outcomes and because ther they are very different e exposures of the cold to your col receptrs in your skim them more you can say you cover your body in the cold which youd do in cold water because theyre of course cover totally and then and the molecules ate a closeto your skim youwild have a more codent and exhibation of all your colt ereceptors in the skim that one will definitely activate your oreno anomous a nervous system more and rapid e ke compared to going out in a teashirt in the cold wind just go for walk and but that is also something that is gone activate your a sympathetic nervous system meaning them that you wu have an increase in noor peneferan e and you well activate something cold i th the brown fat this is a healthy kind of a fat tissue that we have in our body and when you activate that that sconner an increase your metapolism before e tureabout brown fat and i'm glat you brought it up am because much to talk about there what about cold shower ivin obviously coshor somewhere in between am being out outside in the air cold ar verses ar being imersed up to the neck if we had more studies an un col showers we would learn more about how does that activate on metabolism how does that increase or and nouritrous medis in the brain which could also have an impect our on our mental a balance i think that would be interesting for the future and but what we do know is from from a from ectivating brown fat and both from rodenstowed a studies but also in inhumans is that as soon as we get cold on our skin we wil activate our brown fat it is cannalike our first responder in in the body to keep i our an temperature up our muscles is the second tissue in our body two tissues which can increase our ethemagenasis the brown fat which is always temperature regulating our body and then we have a the the muscles which will secondarly a stop to shiver and thats gonner increase our an temperature in the body but as soon as you go into a col shower you will activate your brown fat a also immediately it could be good also for increasing establishm in theory because we have not really any studies showing how much does actually activate the brown fat if someone out that once to gest think i thought about why there fewer studies of cold showers and cold immersion and i think the answer to my mind is that from a methodological standpoint is just harder to do because if people are getting into cold water up to the neck they are getting into cold water up to the neck were as if people are getting into a cold shower some people are larger smaller some people ar gant stand under the shower with it hitting their heads some people aback o the neck you could direct people to do it but it is a little bit more difficult also i think of for you and i are both research scientist there is a little bit of a methe logic cold shollenge that might seem silly to people but it is a real one which is if people are in a cold shower also the water is going to be 'm kind of pushing their clothing against their skin there is a certain vulnerability and a for most people am coming to a laboratory in the first place let alone being absorbed while they shower at ras when you get into cold immerge in cold immersion youe youre gettin under the water and that some peole might roll their eyes and sailicate really is that the barrier but science exists in these real world contects and this will very by colture and things of that sort but we run human subjects in my lab andi'll tell you just am the process of getting people to laboratory and having them park and find the lab and it is a whole new environment with people in lab cots and people moving around and where is the rest r me mits there is there is a certain amont of stress just associate with taking part in a study for most human subjects a i a tollly agree however we need more studies of of cold showers it is just a harder environment to control a in my in my mind it sounds any form of cold to the skin that people register as what you call tha cold shock or an uncomfortable i this is kind of a jawring activates the brown fat do we know what the pathway is from cold receptors on the skin to the brown fatomind how does the brown fat know that we are cold reay good question and it seems that i i think that of course in the fuwture wwill know much more about these pathways but what we do know is that it the colerscepters will send a signal to our tempato regulating centre and in the brains the h thelamus and and that sgoner be am the taking in this message and we have many coperceptors in the skin it is going tn be very fast as you can say if you emerge the body into col water this is going o be rapid a it will have a rabbit increase in a no transmitters in the brainton nora dranolan at drenoin cotisool and a which is not that much but it is but it is still there you w have this increase in a nor a dranoline which will then immediately activate the brown fat an because the you can say the activator is the most potent one cold and nor dranolin does con activate the brown feput there is also a direct pathway from the coperceptrs inthe skin to the to the brown fat which reallys s shows that if because of these different pathways it shows that that it could be that this tissue to keep us warm as was is developed in in our eivolvement e as humans to keep us warm and to save us whenever the temperature o on our skin veris suggested little bit to keep us in that riht whom ourstatic balance we do not get hy pothermic and but also we do not get hy perthermic but because it seems that the brown fet is lso activated when we get warmer nour skin it is o and may be a temperature regulator in our in our body bour the pathways is different i think it is aso a third pathway from dakly from the muscles the brown feat is also activated an even though the the muscles are starting to shiver there is a an extra pathway that way to keep our eour temperature up muscles and brown fater working together to to keep us warm we do not asuffer too much in in the col water superinteresting in word here you pointing tue is the existence of three parallel pathways and the sotion a parallel patways comes up over and over again in biology as you and i know and and i think it is important for people to know about because as you said eloquently the when something is very important to our survival or and or evolution the brain and body a install multible mechanisms for it not just one tan to and it sounds its cold skin cold on the skin triggers and a response in th hypotholemas which the nactivates brown fat cold receptors in the skin directly to the brown fat and then shivering in the muscle to the brown fat u i want to talk about brown fat in depth and learne from you more about brown fat before that however i want o ask about shiver i've heard that shiver causes the release of suckanate which then activates the brown fat is it known whether not inducing shiver is important and when should be people shiver i i've gotten into cold plunges and shivered while i was in there and then i've also had the experience of getting into the cold plung your a cold shower than getting out when even standing outside on a warm day after swimming in a pool and then starting to shiver the shiver comes later how important is shiver and does it matter when shiver happens yi was shivering is s good because that increases your matabolism and that was goine to burn some calorys in your body you should not be afraid of shivering i think because de shivering as long as you do not get to hipe with them i if you do not if you do not sit in the cold water foor too long and and what you just sat by shivering after you get up that is because of the after drop something cold after drop is when your col temperature it decreases even after you get out of the cold water and it always does that am your body because it w as soon as you get into the cold water a old dey your blood vessels has gone a con straict because you need to keep your the blood in your core and and keep your a bitle og and swarm as soon as you get up that thos blood vessel would open again and the one blood would flow out and get colder and then flow back again into the cor and that is goin to decrease the temperature in your core of course that is the drop that is the drop i o lad you explain that heard a years ago whimhoff i heard him talk about the drop and ifort collys mine talk about the drop that is the first time i've ever heard it explain clear limin let me make sure i understand thas a i get into cold water obviously i'm cold vessels con straict to keep blood near the centere my body keep me alive i get out the warming up of my body allows those vessels and coplaries to dilate again the blood goes out to the surface but the surface is still cold and that blood is coold and then my cor body temperature drops and that is what your referring to as the drop and that is what induce o shiver exagrat and then am i right in thinking that then the shiver activates brown fat which then warms me up again yes god is why you should end on the cold we can get back to yellis over yeending on cold is a it is what i refer to as and what is now become known as the sober principle which is a a really important principle about the importance of ending on cold an and not doing what i do which is to get into a hot shower or ever back in the sounto but u will get back to that in it in a few minutes em that is wonderful a that you can explain that clearly because i think that shiver is something that a lot of people do avoid people think o i do not want the and shattering the teeth then am and feels a loss of bodily control which really it is it is it is an nod anomic response yebut i do not thinks the popishould should avoidit that much it is just seeing shivering as away off your body in in a liht it is training it is training for your for yourselves is training for your muscles it is training up your metabolism and that is gont increase your it what is called the insolensensetivity if you can in your mind iget duse to the thought of shivering is just when you go exercising in the training centr and get that feeling off of tisis tough now it hurts tha little bit yet's gone a hurt because that is what shivering also do us but it is just a different way of training yoursells and your bodiets going to create what is healthy stress is called homesis in the cells and the more you expose ours your muscle cells are your brown fat cells to these kind of healthy stresses exercise cold and heat exposure it is goin o make them a better at excibating and also and at i keeping you healthy as long as the the cells get exposed to this it is going to keep them on its tos you can say because it becomes more rubbest and increasing gease heat yock prodines and colsure crutines in the cells to and make you and more rubbest for the next time and that is also what happens when you go to the training centre and i keep to i drawing that parallyn becaus p people to day no more about win no more about exercise and what that is is i's going to do to your muscle cells and and but the same kind of training is also what you do when you go out and and into the cowateran submerg in to col water because that is just your coalt training center you can sand and also your heat trainings end o going into the sona because the cells are getting stronger with hometic stress it is the same proces just different practis i'm gladth you brought up the fact that the discomfort or the embarrassment or both of shiver is still crucial to i see to reach for in try in experience the same way that with exercise i i think a lot people do not realise is but when we did our series with doctor any galpan it becan clear to me what should have already been clear to me and i think that most people do not realise which is that if we were to measure i'm hurt rate blood pressure i'm stress mormones and inflammation in a human being during exercise it would look as if they were eady to die blood pressure would be high inflammation at at through the roof but all of that is setting in motion an a adaptation or set of adaptations that allow blood pressure to be lower at rest that allow a inflammation markers to be lower at rest all the things that everybody is seeking with exercise in inaddition to of course the esthetic changes that people are seeking with exercise sounds the exacting things are happening with the cold am the redundant message here seems to be that the more discomfort provided it is done safely just with exercise the more shivering the a'm the more cold shock provided it is not to the extreme and stop somebody is heart i we can talk about thresholds for that wolbut later it sounds all of that is going to set in motion some long term changes that will make people feel better and will improve health could you just touch on a few of the longer term changes that are known to occur i'm well aware of the study showing that thing was european journal physiology it was a european journal physiology showing long lasting increases in catacolameans dopome nor up and efferen and a'm epan effering for many hours after deliberate cold exposure what are some of the other things that happen at the level of metabolism and brown fat in let us say the hours in a day after a deliberate cold exposure as soon as you go in of course there 's the ectodation but it seems ni no youar asking for the the later outcomes blood pressuren stuff lie gat is that what you mean you have blood pressure but also interms of metabolism i know that ouknw in your study you should and will talk about brown fat in depth here in a moment but that there were changes to the brown fat that it quait to changes in for instance people's ability to be comfortable in clolder environments when they are not doing deliberate cold exposure or in the same way that i can a exercise on an exercise bike r goout for a hard run but than if i go hiking a with the family on sunday and whits a steep clime i could do that steep climb more easily because i'm quotent quote fit as a consequence of the of h exercise what is a what ir some of the fitness adaptations of theliberecalled exposure yes what happens is that you you get adapted a liid every time you go you will exercise get a lipet stronger every time you go into the cowater for every time you will be more exposed turt you wil you feel more comfortable in the coad the youwerl gon ugonbuild you adaptation which happens on a midsabolic level which is gonto be the brown fat we have more activation of your brown fet the mito conjur in the the brown fetselves are gone a be an you have more of those and they will be more efficient at heeding you up because it expects the body expect you to to do this again you are prepared in a way the cappilars in your skin is sausicy peowill also become better at constricting you wil have a better shield of your body to a prepare you for the next time o will be become better at a going into the co water in that ways o the the body makes these mechanistmen changes your body in a way you can expose yourself to the next time right and e and also you will have and also a your am strest response will also be a subside a bits a yo have a less increase of your a catecolumines an with time with time also you have because of this accivation of your a brown father your mussls you have not increase in them a in in your metabolism which will then i make your insolent sentativity a better and this is shown and in studies for example and there is this interesting study i found just before i i started my pigsty which was from em gep or stomer and it al from two thousand an sixteen where they measured an mittabilism not in or not on bown fat but they measured insolent sancetivity in middle age men and women at during one wintsers women season they were not very yong they were in my s study e but they were ther were middle age than i think this is very interesting they iduring these four five months they were when to swimming they saw that i had a low ubrup pressure after the ceason and i had a lower hot raid and they alwa that they have a better incelenstensitivity and i think that is very interesting because if you can have a better incelensensitivity you can prevent life style ceases a man we lower ubrup pressure which as at very strong outcome also for selling how much inflammation to havein the body and because t it did not messure a brown fat a i figuree that it could be that was the misting link that was to one of the explanations to why we see this am less inflammation in the body a the longer out come said the long turn outcomes could be that you lower your brup pressure and have a lower hot raid m you also m have a better inceles tansitivity and a better blucos balance but that was shown that is sown in my study i'd to take a quick brak and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs i've been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast thereason y story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athltic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate in long turn health and those probiotics in athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athltic greens contains a number of adaptigens vitements and minerals that make sure tha all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste grap if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash humorman and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road an the car on the plan et cetera and they'l give you a year supply of vitemin d three k too again that is a let ic greens dot calm slash humerman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitemind three k to it well get back to the a insolent sensitivity in glucofs balance i'm that is it in an impressive list of benefits im ouno blood pressure of course most people are aware of blood pressure an what it is it is what the measure wene we go to the doctor and i it is not very sexy nowadays on blood pressure peus yon blood pressure it is not yoon't be wantng here about the inflam at tome and the micro biom and all of that stuff is really interesting but im i think that blood pressure does not get enough attention im and we have spoken to on this podcast to doctor peter ata who im is an expert in longevity and health span and things of that sort and and i was surprise to learn again i should not have been surprise that the number on reason people die world wide is sreetale vascular disease and carty ofvascular disease and ther're busily three things on the list of things to a dress one is not smoking i'm ore vaping by the way i'm not's going there are few other things a relate to blood marker's apobeien things that sort but then the big one is blood pressure and it is it is interesting because we do not think about blood pressure that much any more as a a's the kind of people interested in health optimization and health but blood pressure is vital to control it is wonderful to hear that deliberate cold exposure is one way to control blood pressure i'm guessing in concert with other forms of exercise im let us talk about brown fat and im if you would if you are willing i lift to drillin to brown fat it at a deep level im again my understanding this is is far more elementary than yours obviously you are the expert my understanding about brown fat is that it is lo atan specific areas of our body i maybe more widespread than when i learned and school i thought it was i was thought it was just at the clapicals in the back of the nack and upper back but who knows i learn that there is more of it when we are children maybe more distributed throughout our body and that it is rich in mitocondria but what is special about the brown fat lige wtif we could just go into the biology brown fan a little bit what does it look ave you have measured it in human subjects where is it distributed really can it expand its distribution can we activ ate and expand the amount of brown fat as adults and am for those of you that are cringing already thinking we are talking about getting fatter it is quite the opposite we are talking about not subtutaneous fat but fat located around the the organs but please educate me am tell me where i'm wrong and am expand my knowledge on brown fat yet you are not wrong but an it is definitelis true thate they are more locations of the brown fat the than we previously thought an tere is this very nice to study from two thousand an seven seen by light nor at elm whet they they have made these sepetites a overlacs of an they r subjects whet it can see where in the body do we have brown fat and where can we grow more brown fat an to tay am the brown fat is can is very platic means that it can it can grow intot can decrease and disisproven an in studies whet we have seen am and people with the fao cryo citoma is a very specific canclets type where peopewi were from the seventies when we can see that if they have the specific kind of a cancer type and the abitit to have this tumor on them a a general gland they have an ahute increase in noi at drandolem and because of that they have this continuous activation of the brown fat and they have grown a lot of brown fat in the whole body ey ar ap don' know where it is locatein these six different places but it is less bet very much compareto nomal people and and what they then see e what we learn from this study is that brown fat can apparenty grow if you have im and increase in no atranalin the body it is not you want that because when that happens you have a high blood pressure you do not want it chronically rigot you you just want it on a short amount of time and then it can grow forbit but you do not want a chronity of course not but because it it activates also your sympathetic nervous sistem they have also showed they hav highblow pressure they had a they lost a lot of weight of course because this is activating your metapolism they they found luckily that when they ey remove this bit benign a tumour a that it the brown fat im decreases again to nomal size and they gain weit again and they had a nomoblow pressure o the story ands well but this cannolike proof of concept of that brown fat can actually grow it is plastic in it in its way of it can grow and i it decreae again that is very good good studies to to see whot it what the body is capable of but we do not of course want all that brown fat we just wanted sold be am wo just want to keep it actually and and keep it activated because what we see and studies is also that after the age of forty an people am it the studies have shown that there isnat a sociation with having less brown fat but increase o becity of course we we do not know yet whether it brown fat decreases with asend therefore we get o bes or we get o beasen therefore we have less brown fat but as brown fat is and insolent sensitive orcan in our body and we get u bes a just the muscles get less sensitive am inslanc sensitive the brown fat does as well and therefore it may be decreases it could be a theory that i think could be one of the reasons why we we do not see that muct bound fet an an elderly e people some hab a lot thes yof people working outside thathere ar study showingness who people who wife outside do physical work outside farmer massand yet theyot interesting n y think to dust themselves to its tho don' do not just keep it in tha way it is and i suppose we should clarify for people in kiss they do not know that insolent sensitivity is a very good thing you want that you want yourselves to be sensive to insolent insolent insensitivity is type to dibeties an is associate with obsity such as a point of clarification there a ye it is interesting to me i i i usually work out at home but i go to a jim once or twice a week if i can because it is good if i see a the outside world u and there are a few individuals at the the jim who they are not particularly large or muscular but theyare incredibly lean and they are postures great presumebly from the muscow skillital work u and they they are in theyre seventies and eighties and it is remarkable right n and and i know all the tell tell signs of pormon augmentation i'm very good at spotting that or if you tell tell signs i've talked about this on other pod gassin they are not that is not why they they are they are theyre fit they are they they are clearly of that look and you see this an outside the jim too of course for people that look they have done a lot of physical labor they are whole life ye theyre just moving a lot that they have strong hands and features and t they are they are not necessarily excessively lean but you can tell that they have been using their muscosell al system and i to talk to these people nowsom lik not what are you doing now for your work out but what what did you grow up doing and i would say in obviously avent run statistics on this but more than seventy five per cent of them respond that they drew up on a farm or that they did some sort of manual labour or were a postmen or a postwoman ore doing something where they moved a lot for their earliears and threw out middle age and most o them are now in retirement but some of them are still working and they all still moving a lot the relationship between shiver and brown fat make sense to me but is it the case that as were just moving around i'm afeaird of t need non am exercisein these sthermo genisis sof were just moving around am that we are activating brown fat or js does there need to be this stresser does there need to be shiver and a cold stimulus or a heat stimulus to activate the brown fat in other words am is just thing active enough or do we need to do some sort of temperature a shock type thing deliberat cold exthe exposure yet i think that is really good question because how how wat why do we have this tissue than if it if it has to be extreme then you can question what what we need this tissue for but it seems that you can activate the brown fit with just a little bit of exposure to to coats the codest of the most podent stress or ectivtor of our brown fat because it is our temperature regulating an organ and albodis a first responden to that the muscles will be a liit too late a and that or we have may be these two kind of tissues excelly it just exposing yourself o o hand actually just to col waters the studies have shown and that if you just put your hand and co wade r not that youare going to going to do that all day or or every day or anything it is not it is it is not something you have to do but it just shows that you can activate your brown fit just by getting a temperature change on your skin you can go outside and teash u that is why also we were just turging about while people who works outside or move a lot or get out in and out of it changing the temperature of the body all the time they will have more brown fat and e activating that is going to keep your metapolism higher and your insolen sensitivity is study have also jown thes the brown fat can be activated as soon as you just change your timberture in the skins o going outside in at tea shirt wearing cooling best also studies have shown this for ten days it is gonee a grow your e you brown fat you can get more brown fet if you expose yourself to the cold you do not have to start in a coat a shower you do not have to start in a cold a clunch if you are not really ready for that yet but just exposing yourself to the co wind has also shown to activate your brown fat or if you do not want to be a in this awake state in then you can also jo sleep in the cot and you will not notice that that much may be but studies at shown that if you sleep in nineteen degrees sulsuous and then you will activate youre a brown fat and you will grow your brown fat you have more of it this in very nice studies and from hanson it out from two thousand and seventeens showd that a a group of subjects who slept in a room at twenty four degrees and then they made this petcite scannings to see how much brown fet do they have from the beginning o what we call baseline then they measured again after an a month of sleeping in nineteen degrees and they saw i think its remarkable just one month at nineteen degrees sleeping there they had a do bet on and they were still had close on wen to e sleeping to they are under a cover under yav runder under tat ya yanger the subjects o sleeping at nineten degree for one month had increased is insolent sensitivity then next month they stepped at twenty four degrees the measured this again and and ther had decreased actually a little bit and then they slept at it twenty seven degrees quite warm room actually for for the a fourth month am and they saw a even less a activation of the brown fat and also insolensensitively it seems that you can expose yourself and pret rapidly the brown fat will respond to this because it is sensitive to noi drenalin riot if you keep exposing yourself to little bit of cold youwill also get a libit a daptet to it but that is because the brown fat and has grown these more mato contrie in the cells these small energy fatbreaks that is going t activate the cells and that is going to take up glue coss and fat from the fatty assit is from the blot stream to keep the themigenesis ock and that is going to clear up some sugar and is going to cleaga iso inte in the blod stream and some some fat as well the brown fat can in that way decrease a our unhealthy fat which is the white fat and and the white fat is what we do not one too much off but we ston need some of course in and it is our energy storage it is very important that it is there we just do not need a lot of it on our thighs and also around our inner organs that is where it is it is locate is if we can have eccivation of the brown fat just by going out in the cold and just by sleeping in a cold room or if you are have courage for it you can go out and expose yourself in a coat plunch and coat showers is also going to do the trick you can do different variations of this just exposing yourself to various temperatures is going to excivate the brown fat because it was invoved to keep us in a perfect whom yor static balance regarding temperature to keep us alive incredible i would not just get a clarification round this nineteen degrees selsies i'm room that their sleeping in their under a comforter duvay and 'm any mention ther clothes on a the room is nineteen degrees selsies but the temperature underneath their blanket might not be nineteen degree selsys presume ly it is the cold on their face that is activating ar the the increase in ar brown fat that was observed is that is that a reasonable an expectation i i think yeare because it is you have many a coverceptres in your face as is is actually it is enough and i think corresponds very well with the studies showing that you can exivate the brown fat just by putting a hand into a a bocket of cot water and i did this experiment myself in in my studies just to see how well did they a respond to col water it was sa four degrees celtus a col water for four minutes and then i just messured blot pressure and heart wright to see to they have an accavation of thites i actually also measured the brown fat during this era cot exposure for four minutes with an inforet thermography camera to see can i see that the brown fatis accavated and just bjust to tell i go back to the location of the brown fet usually you cannot really see excivation of your boufa e casits located es sensually in your or around your sensr nervous system an and and the biggest depo as you mention before is up here e under the the clebicular bones an and very close to the skin's surface and because it close to the skins surface i could measure it with this very expensive camera eand it is not very feasibt for people to go home into this do not because it takes a lot of practise i can tell and but we measured the brown fat with this an and and i could see that after a few minutes that the excibation was there and increase in temperature i arose from that in accavation just four minutes it is very rapid and i'm also measured in my study how deep was the brown fat under your skin it is very close to the surface which also shows that it it needs to be there to to heat you of and he e hed your inner organs but i'm delighted to hear all of this nnot t i'll tell you why and one is by way of enecdote i mention a lole bit earlier that as anoner gratue id i work on all hav the studye from ma jancis and were ean that in animals but we hare this room that was very cold the whole room was called i the gi who ir worked for at the time an am very carlyleas a very accomplished physeologist he came from this linean i do not know if this literature still a discussed much by its a beautiful literature am from wrothwell and stock they were the ones who discovered a non exercise in duce therma genisis the fact tof people bounce who bounced their legs a lot and move around a lot and have a lot of kind of a starcastic movement a burn up to eighteen one thousand eight hundred callories more per day than people who sit more still asnt incredible and just incredible a i do not think that work desert a gets as much attentiona as it deserves publishin journals nature very a fine journals but in any event a one of the things that i notice when i started working in that laboratory was that i was cold because the room was cold and a doctor carlyle harry a said well the key is to wear a teacher in here for about two three days and then you will cold adapt i thought well would not i want to put on a hoodie and get warm in there i was comfortable n he said no actually what you want to do is get yourself uncomfortably cold active at your brown fat and indeed when i did that i think iwas just two days of being in that cold environment then i could come back on the third day and be perfectly comfortable because the brown fat had expanded a were it were added mydocondrio or both and i was perfectly comfortable in that environment i also got very very lean in those a in those days on weeks now i've never been somebody whose very lean norm y somebody who carries a lot of excess at of postissuum t have somewhere in the middle i'm sure i could adjust that with feeding if i won to but it was it was striking a what a powerful effact it had on my entire system of thermal regulation and one of the things that i a also delighted in when sell reports a medicine published your study as they had in an accompanying a press release that went out to to those of us that reove press releaseis in it described a a a saing and scandinavia which is a essentially i'm not an attempt to i speak a danish eventhough i have a much of my family as in denmark a belive not from denmark we have lot of danes in my family i will not embarrass myself my trying to speak danish as i did before the the microphones were rolling but that there is a saying that i think essentially a translates to in the fall when when you are approaching winter you want to actually wear fewer layers not bundle up when you go outside that you can prepare yourself for the cold of winter and be able to heat yourself up using your brown fat and that in the spring as the temperatures are warming rather than removing layers you want to wear more layers in order to be a little bit uncomfortably warm that in the heat of the summer you are better at cooling your body do i have that right anaby do the saying and wuld you be willing to share it only the swedes and a and danes will be able to understand maybe the norwegians to if you do not know it that is o ka ya i know that i know that the concept of it because we say it ye should you should wear a less before winser and they and more before summer there it is in the hallor itheecause it ato be ecerteri ye and and you are completely riot and i think this is ta this is just something that we know in the scandinavian countri es i think that we we we inintoitively know this but if we just go back i the bin i history i think that is im around in nineteen fifties e the russian government went out and said while we should do something about the to tobaccolosisa in pen te make i or epi ta make the worse at that this time that they wanted to have to the people am be more brascilian to the cold and also increase our eumuns e system in scandinavia an extiosintrussia we have put our babies outside to sleep a in the prom and that is to ia to to get more resistance to the cold but also to increase our uman system ad we still do that and then mike tha we you really yet we do abies are taken out in the cold an the snow and frosty rain everything my to boys have been sleeping out in winter or at least the fir their first many free for five years because it is very good for them an they get a the a better a umion system and get vrasilian to the cods that it will have less cods and also they run around in a tea shed when it super co because they have actibated all their brown fet i did not understand at that time i mus s i must say but i canno into it to be also new because we have inherited this a way of doing things with our culture and have heard people coming from the yew as saying a dans a crazy they put their babies outside and promps and leave them there the nickle inside and drink coffey and the id oll the dains are crazy i i i i adore the da a the other amazing a culture and people i'm fortunate have family members a from denwark but i did notice when when we were in copenhagenan and i know am we we saw you there not long ago it was june am the water in the harbour was cwas cold yer for even though the pacific is close to hear on which is very cold i felt pretty cold but i it was summer time ish a people were in summer time mowed night ty shirts in short somethings that that sort but it did strike me that people in copenhagen are dramatically fitter then they are in the united states me for saw everyone is bicycling everywhere a not many people wearing sun glasses trying to extract as much foton energy from the sun as possible which i support ah as everyone knows at a bicfan of getting sun but also am when we did see swimmers am they were swimming in this cold water and it was nothing and there the rangin age of the swimmers was what was markable you saw the kind of fit tryathlete looking types but also young kids i really young kids and the people probably in there again there the seventies eighties made even nineties really a remarkable a vastly different than what you see if you go to the ocean here in a loss angelisern or elsewhere im a you skananavians are on to something with this i'd to talk about your study i'm if you could give a solobit of the backdrop about what motivated that study and then ium and then walk us through what you did who the subjects were ium what you had them do what you measured i'm inas much detail as you would to share because i think it is such an important even fair to say landmark study because it also explored not just cold but sona and the the co use of cold and sana as a way to probe metabolism and brown fat and other markers as well and as you do this ii'm hoping at some point that you might an tell us some of the observations that you might have made that interested you that perhaps were not in the paper ase that is one of the great benefits of sitting across from somebody who who did the work in details i'm ef ou could tell us about your study and o what you did in what you discovered think you for tha questiona andrew i i love to al explain a liet what did we do because when people read this kind of paper they just see the numbers they do not see what what happened before that an human studies are very different from from my study my study you can do a knock out of something and then everything is perfectly matched and control you in human studies is very far different from that because people are different even in the groups ya but what we in when estoted this receart in two thousand and sixteen i did not really know what the brown fat was tu s tot reading op on all this and i was very interested in preventiv medicine am also to studies that i did be orbri brown fat was al very much nin the preventive side how can we that was about something else but it the sweet tooth and how can we lower our sweet toth and stuff tat but after that i wanted to to do something new i look into the brown fat got highe in this a fantastic research group were they it is the sell groups a day mostly did sell studies and they did not have any one to do a human study yet am an them but they really wanted me to to do that i ret upon a lot of research about how does the brown fet gat activated what have been done already and i mentioned the paper before with sleeping in the cold i foun that particular paper very fascinating and that was where am at that time as ocase cold exposure as an intervention of sleeping in the cold could be a good thing to go out and say whall people do this but on the other hand is first of all it was already done there was one thing but the other thing was well i wanted to to see if we can do and some kind of activity we can have people move al goor do something do something together or whatever an and an the cold imade us think about well wat about swinter swimming and it was cannol a bit of a joke in the beginning as i winte swimming yes can i extivate the brown fet riot but but when we read the literature we could not really find anything about exhibation of the brown fat with cold water besides hand in a bugget of cold water that real there was already there we were just think it oq it should be very podent em exhibation of the brown fet if it is cold water but very different from cold aire it was cannol also a new thing we were going in to and if we knew that we were going to do a more of a m a a proof of concept study a at the beginning of at because it was winter swimmers am must in theory exibate the brownd fat right but we canno did not really know with was this kind of stresser too much too little or what will happen actually but we had this idea about wile we always say that cold water winter swimming will ecibate your matabolism but do but do we know if it did does that know we do not and and while this idea was a little bit a fun fun at the beginning and we cannever accepted it waus lie o careless just try this out but because we did not have the funding for it we was occa let us do a prove a cons up study and let us go with a small number but enough to see and at difference between the groups the power calculation of that study is done on eh what we know i from petsity scannings of the brown fat that is the main outcome of that of course and and we wanted to go little bit smallen e numbers of participance because we wanted to particulatle bi deeper into the different mechanisms and also we do some of the e the days i really wanted to do that to see if i can replicate also the fine things and that is gon to take a lot of a lot of a funding but its also going to take a lot of time to do it and the prove a constet was just going small but looking at different mechanisms we also took and fat bi ap sease for example and looked at the white fat to see if there was any differences between the groups before and after and stuff that that is canna how it started and then the first year was i feel study for me i was not a winter swimmer when i started this it was just or really no i was not an at all i non ever say ours a bit o hit of the cold myself and bit of a cold sissy an always cold having big socks on and sweaters and stelt that' thoug us i am comfortable i'm just everybody else very comfortable i being comcompletey temperture neutral and but i startna laing with thi thought wele if this is healthy in theory i should not pack myself up i should start not doing that but the first year observation i when to swim us undertetty they cand ofe joked about as they come on as under ou neet to try this you cannot study this an unless you have tried it i nows how very funny of course i can do that but i could not i i read the laty to i understood an theory what happens when you go into co water but i completely understood it when i first tried it the first few times not funny it felt painful it was just running too long i after a long break and you and your muscles hav the day after ridt you you completely regret that you took that extrami woutd aout when you say uncomfortable you mean uncomfortable when you got in and when you were in or uncomfortable afterwards because i find that im on rare occasions i should just at full disclosure i i do deliberate cold exposure every morning for about a minute to two minutes in a cold plunge there are days that i miss but when i'm at home i do that and when i travel i do a cold shower i do finish with a worm shower im and we will talk about why that is probelly not the best idea but im and i've ben doing it for some years now im on and off a but i' just full disclosure on a devot tee im and i have family members that i hate the the cold but have gott into it and and are starting to it but they do not and i do not necessarily the experience in the cold water but i love the way i feel when i get out and i e i'm a hundred per cent on that statement about loving it when i get out occasionally it feels good to be in there it feels invigorating i think i've learned to control the gas reflects and the hyper ventilation and i just have told myself what we know which is at the forebrain struggles to engage for the first twenty or thirty seconds but if you canget pass that wall it is it is far easier to to push through im but when you say that it was really uncomfortable you mean the experience of getting in or you also telt lousy afterward now iand very importante to clear that out i only felt very uncomfortable doing it at the moment but afterwards the first time i went ir with with a group and actually my husband was thus as well because i i really wone is some one i knew am coming along because hi's very normal if you have not done this before you feel a libet anxious about it did not this is jonin studies as well because blo pressure and harbreg goes up in in those who are new to this kind of activity am i was libered anxious about it it was really uncomfortable just doing and put afterwards as soon as i got up i fel fantastic and we went in to the sona and i did three rounds because i just loved it i love the feeling afterwards because you have all this newton's miders going in your brain and you feel more positive you feel i feel invigorated had much energy and that i i could totally see why people would do this to get energy throughout the day because i definitely had that i did not have to do three dips to to get that i think one would be enough and i often do that also now to day i to one dip sometimes i do two o three it dips im in in one round you cutin one day but i often is just one or two times to week for me that is enoug to to get that energy and to get that cositive feeling and and i think that that is also why i i put up my study in that way i wanted to study the lowest dose you can say the lowest amount at we can get away with but still see am helve benefits what i observed there on the jeddy was that some didit a long time there were in the water for a very long time and me it seemed maybe a li extreme to give me an example a long ter well maybe there were really swimming and they cu bit twenty minutes of half an hours a long ter thit is a long time and there was ice and people who came up i mean i just did not really feel that this is a something that i wanted to go out and recommend to people after im mi wantinyyyser subject dying yter egas i you are not adapted an y people of people cannot do thet also at twenty minute col shower or twenty minute col plunge i know people do it but is probably not a good idea not probably not itsconexhaust yourselves and a then make them age too fast exectlly that is e when you pass that hometic stress as the healthy stress level that is what is happening be quite opposite s is a almost chronic stress exually in themselves well what happened then was that am i found out that if i want to have this protoco get through ethicol cometcy i i really needed to go very sleep with they not too long and and make sure that they were also very healthy and and to get approval of course of thi study an but what i did was to to recruit win to swimmers who already have been swimming for two or three seasons and i just observed them i said i'm not gone it do and intervention study yet i did that after but i i wanted to do a proof of concept where they were already adapted to the cold and then compare them to a match control group who were matched on am on you is a diet werthey vigetarian or not am and one of them worse in each group e also they were not all vegetarian no no no ist one in each group i can say with all the amazing fish in meat in ia then marou to have a hard time ma yetteri no rads or amazing the fruits on veguales to but ice to ther were couple f vegetarians in each group yetone one in each younger and they were mattled onvegetarian i have teen remembers yo regetarian i'm just coken e ye but ther were they were matchd on different things what we usually matchd them on is also be am i am we chose one gendre in this study and we would always choose both men and women o mily but we do see that there are different a brown fet levels a depending on gendera women have more brown fat than men really interesting ye a thng is interesting e a deserve study ye ye why actually i think it is interesting because women are also smaller in size and mass right but they also have and an lower peripho temperature especially on hands and ears and is a right that is that is document ed the women do run colder than men ye and there is tologically i did not sy psychologic no no no we will not we will not go to the psychological ythat is different yer nomething else tht's a different part cast yanother time women are just colder physically is on hands and ear sits meshed on that an and and an feet as well compate to men and men have bigger hearts thand women and they can pump out more plot a peripo than in a women's body they bhe could be an explanation for the colder handsfick semble comfortable state is also different between gen genderas men are more comfortable at twenty two degrees selsius and women are the mre comfortable at twenty four degrees selsius and these are the thermostat wors of home have been now valid thares the study degrees elsies by the way prior to a starting recording a i made the executive decision that we were going to go with selsiest throughout the podcast an because the majority of the world uses selsie for those ye that think in faren heite am the internet is your friend in making those conversions wes were sticking wi selsies men tend to be thero comfortable at twenty two degrees selsies women at twenty four i interesting explain a lot about aso some arguments in the homes where men are turning down the eater and women iof theeader and they cannot really it is it is really is i'm on both sides here i understand the men we understand the women but there is a difference there which was also one of the reasons why we had we in this propocons have studie yos one gendr it is not only because we wanted to study men it was just to see to liminate e old the confounding factors which could have an impact on on our resourts am that was one of the reasons am but also because we yes women have have more brown fat than men notherwise we would have to do four groups or something that and not having funding yet we were oche we need to do which is one a group just catro group and then i and a group who always ewinters swimmers i recruited when to swimmers wo have been swin for two to three seasons m because i wanted them to be already adapted but not going too long in the water they told me e i did a lot of screening here of course beforehand and intivews to see toas tom how much do you do and am how much do you how long o you stay in the water and i am monitord how long did did not stay in the waterd recruited based on am that they only did to to three times to week it seems reasonable e for for denmark at least to do that and they stayed only in the water for one to two minutes the coser subsides very quickly and you would get this exhibation of your restan ti just system which is your paris impatic nervous systems of the the other branch of your order e nomous nervous system and you get that exhibation because you submerge into cold water and when you do that you have an exhibation of your diving response and the that is gone a slow down the you can say the the consumption of oxygen also in your body and that is gonslow down your heart rade and i pause you on the scan i hear this before that when we get into cold water showe or or immersion we get this sympathetic autonomic response o increase blood pressur increase heart rate release of norupe an effran from the locus rulious in the brain release of i'm a gentleman dopemean a gentleman from the from the jrenals do not b mean presumbly within the brain but that the pari sympathetic response is actvated when we put our face into cold water or go under water and that is a calming relaxation response this brings us back to i do not ont take us off track from you describe in the study but this brings us back to the first question which is if i go completely under water for a moment when i start my cold plunge does that change that physiological outcome as comparative i just submerge myself up to the neck in that enactually now dis there'isthat seems to be a little bit of a movement on line of people putting a bowl of ice water on their countertop and submerging afface into it you see thus as ta start ive tanon arposts about yes m con you just touch on what the divory flects is and why it act perhaps activates the per sympathetic response o this calming response let us tha the diving reflects is exibated when you submerge into cool water am even just to the neck ye or i thoughtyou had to get your face under im not not arguing different yourly icpert i just want ou nel i have not really i have not read that iv just seen i that you can ecivate your that diving respondse as soon as you go under water with your body and you do not have to do it with your face as far as i understand i could i could be wrong though im ye when when you exivate your a diving response you slow down your im your oxygen consumption and your budand does is because the body tries to respreser am oxygen you will not get hypotherme too fast is kind of a survival system in your body and this survival system is very im important for use of course that will be excavated and tey because of that youil after maybe one minute or im ta cannot be precise on that because i may be also very sabitten inhumans one to two minutes you have full exibation of the sympathetic nervous system but also the parison pading othe system em and that is going to exabate for examples something likes tonin in your brain which is also got for menca balans and people feeling in mental bellancs afterwards they after they go up i that is mess your dona e question airs and also meser ligan an and a dotes of course people tell all the time that they feel good after whath we need studies on this if any one sitting out there thinking that is interesting then please do some sudy som that i ary to get more out of that ye you had you observe these winter swimmers who are done this for a few seasons ye they are coming around for a new season of winter swimming and you have decideto recreat them he subjects they are getting into cold water u climbing down a ladder or jumping into the water up to their nack ye climb ya get climbing down a ladder into the caus is done outdoors what a fun study to do my my adua thes is was done under florescent lights with no windows in i in a building at am ad aton o fon as a pac e soon asyehat lived in the laboratory as apea she soon i loved it much but m not something require to do a pea she by the way but they are climbing down the ladder ye getting in up to their neck staying in for one to two minutes and then getting out and how many times a week er they doing this sa tit do this two to three times to week and for each time they go each day they go if they take three rounds o fedips and two sonacissens they stort in the cold and they end in the cold water o case it is get in for one to two minutes then get out and get into the sana ye what is the temperature the sona about eighty degrees selcious o k th en how long are they in thisonor they stayed there i for ten to fifteen minutes depending on if they went two times pe week or three times te week ok and then they get back into the cold for a few minutes ya fo minutes up to two minutes yo then back into the sonour fifteen minutes or yet then back into the cold for a third round yet back into thisonour then then then the're ending on tem then back into the cold again and then ending on cold gain i and we will tolk aboat wise important end on cold the called soberd principale am how cold was the water in this particular given the average cause i rase its out door winter swimming its can a very depending on win shill and things as wealth of course it is the very uncontrold environment to do this kind of studied and but i wanted to do something that was al very close to something people can do for free going out in nature and u stad and also have the nature it is very healthy inpack on us it lowes our stress astress level at eswell by doing i also mesture the temperature every time they went i haveless graf and is sexually in winter swimming book it shows the temperature and then my going from october to april and its slike stups at twelve degrees sir think it urround trevel to twelve degrees i selsio sim the water and then it goes down to two degrees in on average and january and then off again and it is within the spectrm up very cold water i was save from around fifteen fifteen degrees sultuous and and down but it was section not colder than two to four degrees lin in on average when it was the coldest does not have to be that cold to be good enough and and enough to extivate our metabolism and and what time of day or om the prercecipence doing this coldsonor alternation i think they did this a threw out the day i did not control w hether they wanted to go in the morning in the afternoon or or in the evening at that time where i set up thi study i wil i was not controlling it in that way i wanted them to go whenever they had time and i also think that is the most important message to give out to give to peobo is when do it when you have time it is not if if if doing it i when you get home from work and it is six ofclock in the evening and this is the time where you are wher you can do itin an en try out if it is gon impack your sleep or not if it does not impack your sleep than fine but you have to try for yourself and find out what works for you its the same for coffee fi san marid some people can drink coffee in the evening and go to bed and they can sleep i cannot er exercise or exercise exactly i cannot i cannot do that and that is because the coffee exercise cold water and immercian s gonno exibate your a sympathetic nervous system you have an increase in strest response in your body and an that is going to make it really hard to fall asleep for some people at least and maybe you are soop exhausted anywas and then youwill just crash n anyways but yet but and thats that is the only thing i'd just told them to do this if they can during the daytime and and that is pramally what they also did and then all long your measuring brown fat by way of this infored camera right im what did you observe in terms of changes in brown fat how quickly did that occur and and then i'd to ask also about sona a bit more because earlier you mention that you can activeat brown fat with sona is well with heat i wud your for get the surface of the skin how long did it take before you observe significant increases in brown fat and was it increase density of my brown fat or distribution was it showing expansion to different regions throughout the body and i maybe could also touch on some of the changes in insinsolent sensitivity in metapolism ye a very good question and and i did not mention the spirit before but besides measuring im a temperature as an outcome for brown fat actibity we also i did pi am or iye scaning ar of the brown fets of disdislike the the golden standard a for measuring brown faen in is not very feasible for nomal people to get and and a pit eseedse or pit am or i a scanning of the bron fat is superexpensive and we had both a to see if we kid have a continuous a measure of brown fat inhumans because that was already not not out there wanted to see during both the experimentsal days but also during day and night what kind of succation a rhythm do we have in our brown fat actibity that is why won id have that as well the petsisy scanning a or ther pit am or i scanning was to see upon cold exhibation and stimulation for some hours do we have acibation can we see the brown fet in this subject and also during theminautrality of them comfortable state a how is that exibated in each of the group of course as do you want to see how comfortable people were away from the cold water and sonor to at different temperature inmirements is at right yes i also measured that how comfortable are you i had i made the scale be sule an alogue scale and asked them how comfortable do you feel with this temperature and and threw out the study days during cold exposure and the mor comfortable day thet had a whole day where just kept them a themo comfortable to se do they accibate the brown fat if they are just completely the mor comfortable as good as we could get with tham kus you were asking people an on a scale for ron one to tan and five being the m comfortable where are you on the scales of one would be very cold and ten would be super burning heat and ye and that was the way to it try to figure out how do they actually feel ey also doing the studies also measured i in electur a miography a of of muscles to see to they shiver during the cooling they a sometimes people shiver before they know that really shivering i have interestin ye sa is or a conscious perception of shivering might not be the best read out of shiver yelo you if you also get adapted to the cold water you wuld have if less shivering ther would be less vigorous there would be very small you would not probably know that your shivering because this te shivering is small and e ma to condera in the mmuscles selles would be thence that it does not need to shiver may be that much to get it that a some wor genesis coing an compate to when you are completely new it to col wer water exposure you are not adapted than the body needs to create these mito contrad these energy fabbrics to keep you warm and that is also what is the exercise is in the beginning but am when we measured this we we did see that the winser swimmers were shivering less e or e having less a vigorous shivering when they said i'm cold even though they they perception that perception of the cop was pretty similar and n in the in te groups and we could see that the the exivation of the the muscles that we measured on an were different and more biccurous in the control wer the subjects in sent of ises to be in the study when they paid or anything of that sorter they just happened a doing a coldens honor and that is why they did the study an while they got paid a little bit a for i but not much and an it the that is how we do this soer i was jus tacura ye yo i just curus there migh be some folks of wonder what did you discover in terms of changes in brown fat inslent resistance or insolent sensitivity rather and am matame moiselle what we we saw e was we had this kind of different measures an to see what is to tran on wrol what was actually going on when they are already adapted to the col water compared to a control group who was i matche on on barbarious paramad us we we did see that the winters swimmers had and increase insolen sensitivity they produced less insolen on all the experimental days besides from just cooling them and measuring the brown fat on each of these cooling days oer two cooling days and one fo more comfortable dey ran i wanted to measure insolen winder just they were fasting meaning that they had not eaten in a eight hours before the study day and and they werecompletely lang still not moving just in a bet and and we measured insolen a during the experimental day just to see how what level are they on and we could see that the the dthe winter swimmat had lower production of insolen and they al when they hat and bluecost trank we give them that to see if they to test before we enroll them in studies to see if they have dibedis for extand and not knowing for exem i that that would not that would ruin may be the studies we test for that and see if they have a normal curve what ways tid seein that was at the winter swimmers had a fast a gluecost clearance in the blood stream after two hours we could see that they had a lower level and went the curve went down faster than ancantro groos dis pay having lower insolen release they have better blood lu cost clearance which is really what you want what we all see careyoul eccessive insolent is bad insolen being a more or less a shaperon for a blood glucose i a can do all sorts of other things as well of course but a and having hig blogle cos obviously terrible we for ls especially brain cells i do not think people realize how talksic high blood at glucos is have not higecotis turd b if you you want to kill narans you make you make ther ach put him in in environment where there is too much sugar a oh ye very a very narrotalksic i mean that is and ther mechanisms insolent that buff for that we keep en keeping blood glucos in a reasonable range that a that does not happen o man i think that is why people will go into insolenemic shock a hypoglisemic shock is also possible that range in which nurons are happy is not a bit is not a tremendously large range incidentally the range in which nourons are are happy in surviving a is much greater as one gets colder than when you heat up i mean that you n basely destroy brain cells by getting too hot for too long y a you can doviling destroy brain cells permanently by getting too cold for too long but you have to get really really cold for a really long time ye a the raims fifty ye weere thinking about doing a an episode on i his for survival of the brain after death kind of things which actually happen o you heare about these people who are declare dead and then came back and there exactually now lot of crower preservation type approach is for that disis a an way we a risk going into the the a the esoteric now swell stere aback to our discussion about your study but am if i do the mat these subjects are in the cold let us ay theyre doing three rounds of cold for one to two minutes three tup two or three times a week what were the thresholds that you discovered were important for getting these positive changes in such as reduced blood sugar or clearance of blood sugar a being more efficient a reduced in solent am improve brown fat distribution and density a how much cold exposure do people need how much heat exposure to people need in order to extract these benefits yes theu when wethen calculated the numbers together we can see that this was ended up being eleven minutes a in total per week a not in one session of course but they had to to free visits to the water and de sona per week when we divide that out it corresponds to being in co water one to two minutes at a time but also in the sona ten to fifteen minutes at a time an i think this is very a also similar to what we see in other studies when we look for example to the observationol studies from the finish a cohor study from a a lowcin it ell for exembled that published this very macing paper in two thousand and fifteen am some resorts from this long cor study where they show that am that up to thirty minutes a in the sona was a healthy and they you you lure your risk of cagubasculincees and that is the tresshold and if you go further than that than there was not more a im healthy benefits to to gain from that and before that is nineteen minutes then you will have this dose responds relationship up to nineteen minutes that really indecreasing your risk of cargubescular diceases and i think we are lelitte week ninedy minutes per week a ninety minutes percession icessionly a percession if we im a then compare that with my study which was ten to fifteen minutes persession then i think it fits very well with what we call the hometic stress o healthy stress you exposed the cells to this kind of potent very istress for situation a whethey a increase heat shot perines in the cells and that will repair the cells but if you withen overdo it and you go beyond there may be thirty minutes in the sona this observational study from a finland with more than e ought to two thousand sona bathes wit have fall of these for twenty years they see that a thirty min is possession is enough and if you go above that you do not get more health benefits out of it i think that is the window where we can say the healthy stress corresponds to ten minutes think it is lirsession persession and it is not itxs not much actually you do not need to it shows that you do not have to expose yourself very much to te heat or very much actually to the cold to get this healthy a benefits er from me going into cold going to heat and have healthy benefits on your cotibescular system think thits is very important also message to to to get out that you do not have to go extreme you do not have to a swim for half an hour in the col water you can go in the water for once or two minutes an persession but go up to eleven minutes per week and total and for the son a my studies showed a fifty seven minutes in tota per week and if we alsor then divided out on these to tthree days and two sessions each day correspond to ten to fifteen minutes it is a low tressou but i think it is it is good to have that to maybe we can aim for that if if people neads to have something to to aim for and i think and i think it is really good to have that because then you you do not have then you do not overdo it and if you overdo it you exhaust eselves and that will increase your risk of cadubesco vidicease also i get a lot of questions about this and i did solicit for questions for this part casson on twitter in one of the questions to day tot was as one becomes more cold adapted to the benefits start to wear offer can people do too much cold exposure of course the answer to that as yesir you become hypothermic but i'm sence in a different answer now which is if i understand correctly and the threshold is eleven minutes total per week of deliberate cold exposure divided into two or three sessions of maybe wone to three minutes depending on how long somebody says in and then fifty seven minutes i want to be careful not ta round up a to an hour but divided into maybe three twenty minute sessions or im one does not have to be perfect as longs you get apmout beyon that threshold but i i wonder something which is is it the case that if somebody said oh i'm just going to do one eleven minute session per week that might actually not be as beneficial as dividing it up because what you told us earlier is that the hormetic response depends on having that cold shock you echually do not want to become too cold adapted i mean once the blood pressure response drops down in minute four five and six you are etting very cold and your shivering but your one is not getting the autonomic stimulus that they want i guess i could in this to if exercise worked in a way where it was only the first few minutes of exercise that really triggered the adaptation of course is is not houtworks but m in fact probly quite the opposite but if that were the case then it is not simply the total amount of exercise but dividing up the the the sessions into little bouts where every single time it acts as it as a stimulus that seems to be the key here im this is very important im because having watched the landscape of this on social media but also in books and generally i i think you are the first person to really touch on this that the goal is not to get cold adapted that you can sit in for the full eleven minutes in one session where the goal is not to be able to do an hour of very hot sona if you want to i suppose people could d it for other reason but if the noal is to improve these health matrics yethen the ideas to keep the stimulus a stimulus short exictly yetgreat will this also i think there is practical feasibility as you pointed out as getting into a cold showr or coldimmersion or natural body water for a couple of minutes is far less a im challenging to most people thin finding a full morning to go in a sp n theare but i've never really heard it articulated that the longer sessions might not be beneficial and might actually be detrimental that is very important a were there any other observations that you made that did not make it into the paper or that were kund of in the the margian notes in terms of psychological benefits it were anything of that sort there was this recent study and soldiers that talked about waiht loss a sort of a controversial study for lotter reasons but one of things they remarked in the paper was that there were a lot of psychological changes improved buffering against anxiety they even the men and women in that study reported one of the significant effects was a significantly improved secual satisfaction of ort they did not tell us what that meant for these subjects andso we will not go there but but a number of subjective improvements was there anything that you observed or took note of ind in your study that perhaps did not make the main abstract bet ther we should be aware of i ythere was thom am and i'm a to day i regret that i did not amessure on sleep for example i i frankly did not really think about that when i gi when it issigned the study and we were very m much occupied with the metapolism and canno had the thought maybe this could impact a sleep quality and and i wish i just i had the thought that why do not you just asked the in a question now but i asked them every morning or everyone who was not many morne is to just two morningsectually i'm we messured on and but the winds o swimmers and told us before i wrote them that they had a really good e sleep quality the contok who also had that but they told me on the day when we mestured a brown fat on na on te day and the night ar i tually two days and two nights and they told me that they did not they had a good nights sleep but they also woke up i's just telling me that they also had a quick wake up and then they fell asleep again em and the winter swimmers as did they have a really good sleep he s and in general they alls they say we we sleep very well i sleep very well said it is anecdotedly general it corresponds to what i heard in my study but nothing that i messured on and which wi could be fund to do in the future but we did not measure ter on sleep quality that would be have been a really good idea to do they also told me that they were very comfortable an when they were cold they they do not mind a winter swimmers ther do not mind im going out for example and in in the colt with a tea shirt they were also less e scarred off showing the skim that as o sevect and esnt th sor can ofr reduced social anxiety yet they were just comfortable in the lap youes you just menture befor coats on and everybust yorning around us very busy and and all the other in sins tist out in the whole way and the also my supervisei had her out office down down the whole way and and one of the winter wimmers one day just got out of bed after i have been in the study for it eight hours we the was a long day right he jumped out of the bed and had his clothes in the bath room and he went out completely naked he did not care he just went out it was that is a side of fact ra of getting a too comfortable what i colld on i were not recommending that now though in your book you did they a you dedicated some ll me said th e again although in your book you dedicated some a pages to naked winter swimming work i should say naked cold water exposure as opposed to a with bathing suit ye are there any data on this observed charing bun i think it in most places in the united states its i skinny dipping is not am is not legal a most public beaches ther are few in fact wherei my laboratory before moving a stamford was in saniego and i at the salk institute for miological studies beautiful building incredible scienceis done there the beach right below that is called blacksbeach and and it is a no newd beach and whenever tourists were hading down the stairway there i would yourserve let them know especial if they had kids id let tem knowg yet t and it is a new beach of a particular of a particular jonerus i i give them allo warning about what what they could expect down below it is e in any event those those beaches are quite rare in the united states may be compared to europe i do not know but myeso is there anything special about am clotheless verses clothed am exposure you have thinkin in that sense ewe ave be more free with this kind of bu but remember we also have this winter swimming colsure for up a hundreds of years and then mine and the wnc it the oldest winter swimming clubs that we have especially the one we have in copenhay can where i did my next study which we have not talked about but and its also not pub published yet but and in that wen to swimming club it is the oldest one we have in its hute and this thi swim naked at it is e facility men and women men and women and they have sa no where they can go in together and i also have the separates on us but it is very much i a danish thing and and i think it is i think it is i think it is good if people want that and and i had it in my book because people want to know if they have to swim with their bating suit on or if they can take it off or what te what is the difference is the any difference in this and if you ask me there is no difference if you have your little skinty bekinyon is not going to do any difference to your a cold exposure or youre adaptation is not going to do any difference for your benefits of course but i think that it has something else it has something to do with how you also upsert yourself how you u suet your surroundings is some si some seme o freedom and skinny dipping i think people in ben ma cudustis is they do do went to swimming because they feel free when they do they to come home from wherk they go to this club and they skinny dip and they feel in touch with nature and they have may be done this the whole life this is an old tradition and den mak in some of the clubs an but the new york clubs there coming they do not stey do not a skinny div every one has bathing suit i never skinnydip because the people aeround people with phones and taken precious old i time this is differenc different nowadays everythng ni'te refrinente yet ya and oh tis this old tradition is saso fating away because of that ye i i you sawnan old at home but when i travel ther there is a a bnya russian bonia has hotsona and cold plunge m there is one in samicisco called archimades bonya and that one is clothing optional some people are clothes such as myself and then other people are not and it is coed most of the time i think they have mel a female separated a evenings or something that and then the other bonas spy eighty eight which is n on wall street in new york is an amazing bona as well u and these are trying to crop up in different cities or maybe they have been there for a long time and as the liberat cold exposure and son a gets more popular more people are using them tha the one in new york that i that a spidy is always clothed u and that it is interesting because people here a naked or skinny dipping and that they they might get certain ideas in mind it ye all these places are very well lit and they all have a tone of kind of a of health that is about the kind of health and and and wellness i guess the point being that there is no requirement a to do one thing or the other although in the studies that a you did obviously people were clothed but i i did i did pay attention to those pages in your book tho n istin tha you put som some dedicated a passages in your book of relation to this and i think it my publish o anee that o you no a a a i was not me an y publish a really antid to have a little discussion about that e oke wel i think it points to a larger theme which as i think for a lot of people who already do these practices there is no shock there for people that do not do deliberate cold exposure or sana i think that there is thi s idea perhaps that owiug o these are traditions that are are kind of fringe or that they are cut and i just i wanted cu that point because there is many things that are happening right now in biomedical research and medicine iuno serious quality pureviewed studies publish an excellent journals your paper on things deliberate cold exposure sana the use of particular supplements natural natural herbs and supplements an me the is entire branch of the national institutes of health inthe united states dedicated just to the study of supplements and behavioral interventions for health meditation and breathwork blecredible incredible and psychodelics of course being something that for a long time was part of a certain community and feel and now is being u frankly adopted by mainstrean med medicine even farma it tha the times are changing and a yes i thing it is importen to know that it is perfectly acceptabble and encouraged to wear clothing absolutelan absolutely nn one other thing that is i wanted to to mention going back to your questions around with there were any observations an the studies which we really maybe having discussed yet maybe it is in in the back of the the paper i'm not mentioned that much was on of the wince to swimmus did not have any brown fat when we measured him zero cero and e in we do see this im in in in previous studies as well that some humans do not have any brown fat was he did he carry wot of white fat at of was to sho was he was he obes no he was not know he was not obise because that he would not have been in the study them i all right a yes ye mention is terweld fr him an knowo but he was them but what i did ubserve before i knew that he did not have any brown for was that during the cooling experiment where i cooled them for e two hours before they go into the petsyty scanner e he was not able to control his a shivering the winter swimmers i could he got he got verye a cold very easily i compared to the others and without our did not know what was different about him but we could l all or me and the three others were working on experiment we were oke what is going on because we turned down the temperature but he started shivering and then we had to turn it up again and it was just all over the place the temperature is not it was not that controlled the others was pretty similar protecol i could just do pretty much the same because there wase same size and e also said jameder it it it was easier e to foresee what was going to happen when will tey start shiver i quickly learned that but with this subject it was just with to say volunteer was just very much different and then when we scanned him and did not find any brownd for i i i did not even think about it when we scanned him we did not see anything i told the petsi see peoples who oh you put up the wrong escannier it wasn tits acknowledg ye it tin iacknowledgy was this scanning look the thirm a neutral day the thirm comfortable day when we also scanned them to see if they have any brown fat you had made a mistake i was pretty sure and the reanalys anal analyzed this im scanning and they just concluded well it the scanning was fine the experiment went well it was just that he did not have any brown fat he was what we just in the paper called at a brown fat negative he did not have any and in micer studies i would be called a knockr out het did not have any brown fan wut the observation with him and i think that would be that is interesting is that he both shivered very early on and did not regulate his temperature as well he also told me that then he was a five on the scale of how comfortable he felt with the cold an e it was from one to ten and five being more comfortable and tand being a very a cold e and and one very thought on this s scale of an op and down and he he was more up and down on this scale than any of the othes it was an observation that i did and but we did see in his blood samples also that his blood sampes looked a bit more the control group and also his i insolent levels were the control groups o a la bit higher than the other winter swimmers and he also had an a a a ehe his block tlo coast clearance was not as the fast as sim as the he the other winter swimmers he was an outlier what we call it and indianalysis we also had to take him out e of the analysis because he was an outlier and the resolts showing that the brown fat e is a more efficiently activateit in the winter swimmers is without him having him in that group thoug it did not ruin us the study if i tried to put him m in as well and didn' it did not ruin the results or anything but just to to keep it more clear we put we to come out of the analysis yes heas a me utent a nockand i'm sure there out there a very interesting few siver early am then perhaps you have less brown fat to begin with all thats hard to conclude from one person that sort of the the the implication there are you have an adapted to the cot you musht it build that outner yet ight in addition to looking at regulation of blood sugar round that metabolism and on were there any markers that you examined in the deliberate cold exposure group as compared to controls a that reveal to you that deliberate cold exposure could have additional benefits imsay for i a mean system function im or for any function for that matter yes for imwe looked at ininflammation of course measure out te outcome of lot pressure and on but we also measured the ile six in the study just to see also and inflammatory and inflammatory margre il six went up anded also follows with the ile ten that is is also very known in th literature we measured that and i think it is very important to to think about the cold exposion te heat exposure as something that then lowers the inflammation in the body and woulh if we can do that we will have an open door for an a prevencing lifestyle decease is rin for an typtu diabedis but ectually also for some menso a deceases as well as known as depression and anxiety and also elsetime is decease we share all associated and in research also new a reser showing that a that inflammation increases the risk of depressenting siet and and else imus ivin nological deceases we can decrease inflammation in the body we will decrease or modern lifestale de ceases but also these increasing a e a mental deceases that we see in these modern lifestill times an i think that it is i think its very interesting that we can o out in nature and we can use these natural stressers and t it i do not want to have it sound very romantic or anything it is just it is just exposure to temperature actually just a cold or to heat that its gon ed t work our body into an natural state again and and re said it were the tthe homerstases the balance has is lost a bit the body is gone to repair itself in that way and nothing is beautiful that we can do that just by changing the temperature of our body and although people are very scared of doing this because in our times we have been a way from cod away from heat temperature if for some for decates now am since we isolated our houses better and tere we are more sedentary we alwayso sit more endoor we do not move as much tis very im modern sedentary live style has made us more temperature comfortable just neutral no no wonder i mean that ubisity is increasing we do not exposed ourself to the naturalstesses that we did earlier on am in in our embonement but us ooponte may be the seventies the sixties where we started having more a comfortable live styles right and ubicity increases in the in the eighties we can see that from statistic i think that if we can taken cold and heat and you mentioned other things also beforbut of course exercises very important here and also a bit of fasting actually because it all increases the hometic stress in the body it is does not have to be other than natural stresses to the body which than could keep us in that natural balance again could we talk about what i referre to as the soberen principle which is te end on cold and the reason i call it the sober principles because an in reviewing o by the wee was not a official reviewer of your paper but i mean in reading and am reviewing your paper for it is after published contents i notice that you had people end on cold and this has been a long standing debate in the the adeliberate cold exposure community should you warm up in it with a warm shower afterwards o get back in this honour what should ou and on colder end on heat and the sober principle says end on cold as i understand it in order to force your body to heat itself back up and thereby increase metabolism further still is that right yes when you when you end on the cold you you force your body to heat up by itself and that will require that you exibate you keep your brown fit exhibated and also your muscles which is a good thing it is a good colleboration to keep your themagenestiself and that is and and exercise even when you go home in that way you do not have to think about your cold exposure dipping in in your plunch a wwil can see yo what it is as just a and exercise that you do for one to two minutes and than i's over if you i end on the cold you have not exercise for your body going on for hours afterwards and that is not only on your metapolism but is also going to keep youre new transmitters i exhibated as well and increase that because your body is still cold you need that i ex those netrancemitted to exibate the brown feates well that is going to make your brown fets as more efficient and also your muster sells more efficient increasing myh conjure and selves which will then generate heat very fast if you have done this for few times may be three for five times and bein new to this but have tried it a few times you wen notice as witch where you feel that you get easierly warmer and you can keep yourself warmer and that is also what we shown and in my study is that the the wenter swimmers were physically a warmer on the skin compare to the control group that wend they are out of the cold when they are out of the cold just relax thing and we tested this an in on the days when they were sleeping in the lap we could see that they had and more accibation of the brown fat higher temperature probably becausethey all loose heat it tey have high heap loss to the body a compat to the control group an because to have a more bescular a skin t because of the contrast of cold and heat they loose heat faster from the body during that day but is that a bast thing no probably not because that is gone to keep your brown fat and your moss as ilupid activated we you would have to it it has to work to keep you warm and i would hypothesized that it also might lead to some of the subjectively reported improvements and sleep because in order to fall asleep you need your core body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees yes it is not just sufficient to be sleeping in a cold room and under the blanket you also need your body temperature to drop yes and what your a sanufi nderstand correctly is that by forcing by ending on cold and forcing oneself to heat up naturally am that increases the brown fat stores which i ser see as a come the oil in the candle of the furnace that is thermogenesis and that in turn leads to increased heat loss which people might think o i do not want lose heat from the body but yet there are not tome an want to lose and from the body busy it soundsly what we want is to be a very efficient heating and cooling system yes that it is not about being cold or being hot it is really about keeping the system tuned well keeping the oil in the candle is brown fat am functioning yes whencould ask one question about fed or fasted is there any r rather are there any known benefits of doing deliberate cold exposure and orsan a fasted aversis am after a a meal say within the last hour something o that sort i do my deliberate cold exposure first thing in the morning in general and fasticause i do not eten tol bit later in the day a but what is known about that and was that looked at in your study i know you measured gluecos but that was as a separate tus i we at from the cold i way from the codia but i was sobtested blucos on the days on the cold we misse yip that as well an on the cooling days em specifically on fasting and fat i do not know i do not think that i h've seen studies specifically on this more science needed a number of people ask about the use of deliberate cold exposure to off set some of the symptoms of various diseases now heare we are not telling about curing disease were taing ou offsetting symptoms one question i've seen quite often is whether not people with rainod sindrum this is a sindrum and my ha school girlfor had the sindrum and i'll never forget a we went er at a school dance together and this was when we first stared dating and a she had rain notes which a leads to very poor blood flowed to the the o the extremities and and she was very culzer she left to go to the bathroom and warm up her hands in the warm water and i was left standing there at the dance and people came up to me and asked why i was there and who i was there with and i kept telling them who i was with and they did not believe me they coldn't believe that she would be memade total sense if i knew me at the time u i was i i was way out of my league with her u at the time i to think of ventually i caught up but in any case a she was in the bathroom for about an hour saw at one point i did consider the possibility that she had just leuft but indeed she had't she warmed her hands back up but people with rainowd sofferer from this from this thing a very very cold extremities be their finger tips will even turn blue as if they were starting to get frosbitten it is quite dramatic an that question gets asked whether nothers any use of cold to try and increase the om elasticity the plasticity of the of the ar small cavalaries an vessels by everything you have described am op until nowitsens that would be a logical thing to do om and in addition to that weather or not people with automun conditions people with o any other types of conditions are known to benefit from deliberate cold exposure i'm not aware of any studies but i get asked about this a lot and they were a lot of questions about this for you in in the tirter steet yethank you for those questions an i get them as well on sociar media and i have to say that i i have not seen any studies directed on this outcome and messuring ronuits a cyntrum and i do know that it is it is it is not that ray i actually a problem and i know that many women ar more men women than men e suffer from this and but logically it would help them if they expose their hands to cold and also heed to make the vest it more bescular but and i have hurt from people saying that it had help them but also hurt for some others saying it did not help them studies are needed on this specific tupag i think i herd my hands when i go into the coan i do not have this cndram at own i but i keep my hands above the water you do ye oh i do that an often i take a little bit of a swim and then of course i have to have my hands in the water i but it helps me when i then get back to the deady an and then take my hands off because then i can stand there for a little bit and get mi one to two minutes exposure and then i can go of because then otherwise that would stop me from it being in the water enough time that i as long as i i would to people suffer from having this pain in the fingers and it that it can be better intense just take the hands op a bit from the water and the and that is gong to help you also hichs near prin boots i's gon o help on defeet some people have the e an feel the pain in the feet and in the ankles and that is gone to help them a soot of bit cso there is no problem with keeping hands out or feet inna near prim booties it if people feel the need to do that if that is th what the if in a pain of the hands or feet is a berier for people doing a deliberate cold exposure than it seems it would be ok to do at to keep hands out or to keep your feet yes because then you you do get the exposure i thought of course hands and feet are very podent a places in your body to get a fast exivation e off youret nervous system of course but if you can just you can also just dip them and and take them up it is gonstilk gon a exivate that but you have your full body is covered in in a cope receptirs you will have a full exivation anyways youve you mayare providing very reassuring information to people cause i know a number of people that do not to put their hands and i find that the more of my body i get in the more comfortable i am psychle i doft know what psychologically and or physiologically i find that if where there is an interface between the water and the cold it is most uncomfortable i provere just get everything under i keep my head out although i these days i've been dunking all the way in and then coming out and the dunking once more with my head under before i get out after the the plunge a that rais a different question now we aregetting into cint of the practiccalities of deliberate cold exposure which i think are are important asometimes i'll experience and i her from a lot of people that they will get a kind of back of the head headache at the interface of the of the water im when they are in doing cold imersion to the neck a no i assoon this has to do with blood flow that there is vas of constriction right up until the nack and in the region surrounding it but that may be there still blood flow to the head but do we know what the origin of these headaches is and again this does not happen for everybody but some people do experience o ye i have not really heard about that one specifically an but i would say that there are different reasons for may be keeping your head out of the water an but it seems i may be for some that could be a reason for just getting a quickhead dunk going all theway and yes yes what i've started doing gan liminate iit was not getting headaches but i did i notice that interface o c and i was not in the rest of the experience it muc experience of it much i surried dunking all the way and i noticed in some of the photoes that you have put out amand in your book that you will sometimes wer a cap yet while you go in ye foquett and well it comes from different reasons ar let us talk about some of the physiological reason when you submerg in cold water up to the neck and study have shown and this is from denmark studies from a besefipya hospital an that is a when you submerge into col water up to the neck at cero degrees as ser degree celsieas very cond and you have a decrease bloot flow to the brain by around thirty to forty per cent and make sense because you actipate the sympathetic nevou system aand and therefore youwil have a less blot flow to the brain makes you maybe a libit this e year and proof again that ye you need a heart more than a brain becausewhen the symathiic nervous system gets activated a blood flow is maintained to the heart to keep you alive wut obviously taken away from the brain to keep you from thinking that is wit is hard to think when youre strust you at the muscles and then then your vital organs need to you have to be able to run away from that tiger wi lik the ratio now as total fancy who am i to disagree with mother nature well but yes one of the reasons being that you should keep your head out of the water is that you could increase that bloi decrease in bloot floawt to the brain further if you dont the heat thereis is a very nice paper from an from a aa resuch croup in cannada where they have collectively looked at different papers where they a compared heat laws in a crew in the papers where they dunk thehead and compared to heat laws a submerging up to the neck to see how much extra heat to we loose from aur cor when we dont the head e and no thing is very interesting that which you submerge up to the neck you have a hea lws of eleven per cent from the body for and when you then a also dunk the head you would increase that heat lows rate by thirty six per cent that med i'm not saying that i'm not i'm not here to say what is right and what is wrong i just think that people should know the information they can for themself evaluate what is best for them but if you increase your heat los rate by thirty six per cent from your core thatsconne increase your after drop which we judge upon libeolia even further that meaning that you are closer to high pufthermia than you are if you just submerge up to the neck you should really think about whether this is something that you want to do or if it is just better for you not to get that cold in your core the beany is also because i have a litbet a sensitive ears it meaning that if there is wind and because we wom in the open sea and denmark we have a lot of wind our win our conditions are just very rainy very windy and when the temperature is also freezing you could get this in what is that cod in very cold and light headed just from wind if you also submergchin to col war on you then get up you cyou would get a brain phrase immediately it is enough to just go up to the neck werabinneac shou just not get thissy also because the the i the heat lows is increased of course but it also the blufffloat to the brain has decreased the benny would keep you a little bit warmer you can stay for one o two minute it is just a way of g tting around some of the conditions also people can choose that if they they feel tat bout it is quite quite noble iits to do in inscandinavia wera bini of it and for those of you afraid of doing two minute cold shower whent a doctor silver just a described a let us a you see how she and others are capable of doing things far harder than that when in the way you describe it with the cold wind and scandinavia and a is is quite striking it along the lines of covering the head there is this seemingly paradoxical a thing of people going into hot sanas and wearing wool caps if you go to abana or you i go to asana and thereare people who are uam well from eastern europe ar dipically ar finlind or am russia you crane or elsewhere what you will see is that many of them are wearing wool caps in the sana which many people think it is to make it hotter that is i shally not the case it actually insulates you from the heat environment the urge the sense of urgency to get out of the hot san is a brain driven mechanism and the reason that people wear wool hats in the sana is it actually lets you stay in the sana longer m because takes a lot of heat to the skin before you feel that you half quotic half to get out wereas when you insulate the brain u you do not get that signal it is pretty interesting iave tried this before just by puting a towel over my head in the sana and you can stay in there umuch more easily and for for much longer you as we talk about these different stimule for a the hormetic response the adaptation distress it occurs to me that ththe big ones in our evolutionary history have been light right i mean youare tiing mout seasonal changes we know there especially as you go up to nordic countries there seasonal changes in the amount of light by time of year dramatic ones in fact a as i'm less at therater of course u light temperature food movement and it is sort of interesting and and at the same time perhaps it should have been obvious to us that there are stimulee that our bobdies have evolve to adapt to in very powerful ways and the idea that temperature heat and cold could evoke these tremendous physiological changes that are beneficial for us probably should not surprise not all i min emmin this is wii mean that these are not uesso esoteric mechanisms they are actually that the foundational mechanisms by which are our body and bodies of other animals adapt i do have a question about the a different ways that people could approach deliberate cold exposure for instance children i've been to bonyas where the're kids ouknow six or seven years old with their parents at the bonia u and they are in hot sona i'm not suggesting people do this if they are if they are not adapted to it anyo doct your parents kids and taught your kids parence im touct your doctor but is remarkable i mean a children doing sana from a young age or deliberate cold exposure are there any date on this and is it safe assuming that you kno obviously the they can swim in or they are doing this init in a tub or shower u and then i'd also to ask you about are there any additional male female differences i know your study focusstimate am on men but other studies have focused on both and you of course are women and can attest to your own experience with this children men womenum differences there i'm in terms of protocals is here anything that people should build into the structure of their delierate cold exposure that is unique to thapt i yes o dis as an uncote exposure am ye i think that em stining with the the question about children u i think that is important to to think about a as hildren are smaller than at all we cannot really completely transfer all the information and the benefits and also protocos for how long and and and stop tha two children we cannot do that because they are just smaller in mass and one study that actually in approve this is a study where they have a compared the heat lost a in children the boys who were twelve years old e compared to a adls in men and looked at h heat lost of the cour temperature and exposed them to a a one or one or two minutes a cold expose to saw emotion up to the neck and what they saw was that the the the boys in this study could actually defend their court temperature in is same way as the adles could but they had to use their muscles way fast it means that they could not stay for as long ay and they used more energy to defend their court temperature compatually to the dles but for one minute it seems that they could actually com but they would be colder when they then come out because they are smaller in thei mass to their ratio right it means that if the surface is large on children and their mass and muscles being smaller to that ratu it means that they can be in the water less time before they get hygh pothermic just think about that they are just smaller they cannot defend their temperature for a very long time but in this study the sow that forup to i think it it was a minute or they can one milian god yyu mention i prefermi and small bodied people children a is todue som on pacific ocean swims in the morning om without wat suits and i adapted to it pretty quickly and thes fairly long swims hen we brought an excellent swimmer with us u that was in turning with me for a while e's sixteen years old at the time and very lean and he was not small for his age but he was smaller than us atinlea the was all keyes on the swim that day i'm sometimes women join us u and he got hypothermic u and he is excellent swimmer and he did not report feeling overly cold but fortunately we got him to shore and heated him up again he lived i do not think his mothers can ever let him go swimming with us an hes thriving in the world he is a universites to now and he recalls that swim i m this why you always wante ocean swim with abody with evil yet he he became hypothermic his teeth turned yellow he was got slurring is words he was not making san he kno we got him on to shore and he was an jeelling in a lle esemi oufora haaad was it u hypa therme is no joke i think im y yes i i am really glad that this is coming up because the cold is a powerful stimulus and nigt and kids are at a and smaller bodied people are a greater risk of hypothermia a good reason to approach it with caution maybe there is our recall showers yet i then cold immersion an still water natural water and open bodies water of course are always going to be more dangerous for other reasons currents an thask that ok nfonin ye important note there what about any additional male female differences or similarities that we should beware of and this comes up all the time on socia media any time i post anything about a study it is what about women because oftentimes there are differences oh ye an an an thi we we also just talked about the difference in in in in temperature in men and women it means that if we did wef we raplicated my study in women it could be that they would they have enough you can say cold exposiur with just nine minutes per week it could be because they apparently a ouso just colder and and they have aincrease mentabilismen tha brownfed is just to have more brown fat it could be but this is just something that i i i i frankly do not know but women al do colt exposure winter swimming with the eleven minutes protoco i do it it myself and feel a good about it i would say that an women a also regarding exhibation of the brown fet it should be the same an in theory but i do not know if women ectually do need to have another protoco when it comes to this rapid cot exposure i think that it is another question if we are talking about ice swimming when it comes to how far can you be in the col water without getting hypothemic then that will we difference as in menen and an female been but if you do this colt exposure for very brief amount of time which is what i try to to talk to b talk about it what we call ol some microstressing the budy to to increased te hometic stress to healthy stress then this is such a short amount of an it is exposure that it it is fally the same i think i think women can look at this as a fally a good proticol for the for for them as well i always say that if you really dread the cold and am do not the cold than you are a perfect candidate for using deliberate cold exposure because the sympathetic a gay the stress response will be greater and thereby the adaptation to that shorter one or two minutes is a is going to be much greater rithe for people that are perfectly comfortable in the cold it is harder to get at aadaptation response the same way that if somebody is very strong and they can lift a very heavy weight that hat very heavy weight is unlikely to evoke the same kind of ir seem degree of that of a adapt ive responses if somebody is not quite as strong another reason to keep these exposures relatively short and more frequent than to do longer duratio n exposures frequently however let us say somebody only had two days a week om to do deliberate cold exposure maybe they do not have access to ussona maybe they do would you suggest that they get in for one or two minutes then get out then get back in for another couple of minutes then get out and call that for e know four or five minutes om to try and get to that eleven minutes total per week om as a pussty getting in for a full five minutes im and then getting out and coming back a second time that week i know this is getting down into the weeds but these are the sorts of things that i think people really want to know because no a lot of people either do not live close to a body of water or do not have a cold plunge om that they can do this with although col shower apparently works to almost people live close to a shower yes the definitely i think tht the changes in temperature is what is strangetheing your you set m your cells in the body if you can do the short amount of a exposure and then get out and get back in that is goneyou can say im im strangthen yourselves because you are challinging them to to adapt to im changing temptemperatures during one session you can change this ridy you can do it if you are able to go to col water but also a sona then you just do that automatically you woill have a change in temperature but you could also do it what variating the temperature and your col plunge if you have if you have a plunchoy if you have th open sea ye you have seasoning seasons even you have we have ten been mark we have four seasons and the temperature is gone to vary with that souh we have nature who can just change this farse and we do not have to think about if you have a col plunge well then i would say that changing the temperature is what is gone a create this hometic stress and also keep your sells on its tos you can say because you are tri the body will still be im stresse to try to adapt to the new te m butyer as they would seen us something exually toxsic to the body rid is a small small piece of sucidity that you are exposing yourself to you do not have to swallow it but it is enough that you tunced it nexily a the great a great way to frame it am that brings me back to thes ideaf circadian time y in your study you did not control fers the specific time of day and now i'm realizing that may be a great asset to the whole thing we know for instance that our bodies go through pretty dramatic shifts in temperature from the time we wake up i my body starts heating up as we wake up and i'm continues to heat until the afternoon and thet sarce o drop in the later afternoon and then assuming all things are working correctly im that body tomperature drops whan we sleep i could imagine that doing deliberate cold exposure at different times im just by way of convenience or by way of intention could be very beneficial because my body temperature is going to be quite a bit warmer at one time of day verses another and in that way keeping the istem tuned and that is really what i keep hearing coming through in as you explain these data and all these a beautiful studies yours and others is that it is not really about getting cold it is about going from warm to cold and from cold to warm it is not it and i love this idea because i pri said this a hundred times on my podcasts in a million times in my life and i'll continue to which is that biology is not in event it is a process these these a metaball can therm o regulatory processies are indeed the turning of a knob it is of verb yet it is it as supposed to anown and i and i i think if people can internalize that idea that they are going to a have a lot more flexibility a lot more fun an and get a lot more benefit as suppose to thinking o cay i need to get into ex degrees of water for ex amount of time on ex number of days yet in a verentii is way all the time on how much and how cold and and i mean it is not it is just well because e also do not have studies sowing exactly if you just keep five degrees in your water and you do that for month than what happens we maybe the future we will know much more about this and i'm i'm sure it is going to come and i really hope but i just think by logically changing that temperature up and down up and down and you also do that in your water it does not really is not that important what temperature you youill have your water than than just keep changing it going up and down it you be all up to twelve degrees selsures you'r gong to exivate your brounfet anyways i mean twelve at nineteen degrees cold air is enough to ectibate your brounth is maybe we do not have to go as cold as i think many people think and and putting ice even all the time you do not have to it is not i do not think it is necessary to to expose yourself to that cold it temperature all the time an but veryat o bit keep the system off balance and you all the mare geve it tund ye you mention at i study that is more recent an on going that is not published er m if you are wiling i'm could you share maybe some of the a data from that or findings from that study m with of course the the cue to everybody that these are not yet published data that the conclusions could change the date i could change for that matter yes we we have not analyzed all the debta yet and i i know from the studyd that we did publish that we we would need to look more at the that a i do not really have any resaults yet that i can share because we are still in very preliminary analysis of this i've i would not know yet what to exactly say about it but whal we look that was both men and women lef them that is that is comming oh thats fantastic at and that answers going to please a great e numberk people and an entrigue everybody well soni i want you really thank you for coming here to day to talk about your work im an nd the incredible direction that it points to because i think that am no one study is definitive but your study really again stands as a landmark in the a landscape of exploring deliberate cold exposure and heat how it can impact and potentially impact our health because frankly there just havent been that many a high resolution detailed modern studies of this there have been studies of sawna there been some studies of cold there a lot of groups in physiology that work on a hypothermia and very cold exposure but am most of the temperatures used in those sdadies just are not practical first all i just want to thank you for doing the work that you have done and for the work that you continue to do i'm a a waiting with baited breath as they say to a a to hear the results of this a study that is on going on both men and women a ll ave to have you back to orm us about that soon and i want a thank you for a the incredible public education efforts that you have been doing on social media am and in with respect to your book am and we of course we will put linkt all those things in the shownote captions people can learn from you and can continue to learn from you we we certainly need more scientists who are both experience with doing hard core research as it is called and who also do the practices i think tat' awonderful additional astset you are not just behind a lap cote or bundled up in a in a down a in a down featherd jacket as everyone else is getting into cold you do these things and that you are open and generous in the way that you share a knowledge which includes coming here to day to to share knowledge with me and our audience a thank you ever much yo very wellcome i am please to be and thank you som mi plain biding me and i cald explain my study and i can share them op my insides fom from doing that i'm very grateful for being here delighted and we will have to have you back again thank you for joining m for to day's discussion all about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure science and protocalls with doctor susanna

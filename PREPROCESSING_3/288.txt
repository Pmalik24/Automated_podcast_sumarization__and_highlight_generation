makes us wholthing even stranger is that the two couples knew each other the millers were at the mc donalds anniversary party they mutual acquaintances they lood a short drive from each other's houses

what happenes when somebody takes your family throws it up in the air a deck of cards an bheybe be easy chicago its this american life om marer glass we aveating the full hour to day to what happened to these two familis jake hawburn is the reporter and before he starts just hop you keep everybodys straight in this story a quick overview of the two families the millers are the bespectacale dark haired one from the letter miss miller's husband the reverend norbrt miller was not even jelical preacher the voted to the church and they were a bookish serious bunch thissus house with a lot of rules and there were a lot of kids too seven kids in all the mc donalds are the lighthaired one from the letter and is a much smaller family just two kids and the feling in the house is very different from the feeling in the miller's house they were easy going quick to laugh and joke ground miste mc donal ran a tevia re pairshop in town here shak cowburn it was the four women at the centere of all this the two mobs in the two daughters who were affected more than any one it is take them one by one starting with sue missus miller's baby it was raised by the mc donalds before the letter arrived the facts of sue's life had seemd pretty orderly she was a married mother of three living in michigan her husband worked as a khemists she was close to her mother she called and visited her parents regularly she also had an older brother bob named after their death itwas all pretty straight forward and yes sue was different from the rest of the family in certain ways dark and tall and skinny in a family that was none of those and a pretty light hearted a household she was nervous studious serious but at did not seem strange in junior high i remember my friend said to me you must be adopted because you do not look at all your parents and i said i do not know i asked my mother i said at my adopted and she said oh no no she says i was pragnet and you are my child i wanted a baby an and you are my baby you were not adopted that that con vinced you oh ya that was not nof i mean she that was right mhy mams at all well you just take after great grandpa thes sir aund one saer then i just forgot about the whole thing years later when she got the letter that told her the truth she was stunned and she knew she had to break the news to the mc donalds had raised her but she didn' call them right away mister mc donald had a bad heart and she did not know what the strest would do to him first she wanted to be absolutely sure it was true bloodtests were done with the millers and they proved missus miller was right about the switch weeks went by and sue began to fret she wrote letters o her parents but did not send them she worried her mother might reject her sue knew her mother had never been a big fan of the millers ever since they met and now suddenly e turned out sue was one of them it was confusing and then after i knew that they were that i had been switched and that i had different janes and my parents kept talking about these people that were odd the millers because they reverend miller he is not even jelical preacher he wants people to know jesus christ and that they would be saved and and i'm really that too sometimes my mom thinks i'm a little fanatical i'm really a miller what does she think of me imea that is my biological family i i did think o she is she is goingto know that is not my daughter and she is goin and she is going to get this popular marty who is fun loving and and looks her and then she is going to say w i do not need that daughter any mor she is part of that odd family a month after she got the letter su went to see her biological mother and father this sis avidiotape of that first meeting a atis noe e o thai i is his ye der my der right there she looks happy rever miller was affectionate with her putting his arm around her was everybody smiling su know had four new sisters and two new brothers and the miller show her pictures of her other relatives e's roso bo ri i might a argan ge way for gat gorn trol o there is a lot of nervous laughter and there are some awkward moments when sue talks to miss miller about the fact that she never got enough breastmilk as a baby my mono r iy but over all the millers seemed giddy that their daughter is finally come home and sue seems eager to know them aii lo i hero later that same day sue drove to the mc donalds to the parent she grown up with after dinner she sat down and told them about missus miller's letter told him point blank she was not their child at first they refused to believe her but then she told him about the blood tests finally sue handed over all the letters that she had not sent them in the past month letters telling them how much she loved them and how much she wanted to stay their daughter and my dad said you are my child i changed your diper and my mother she nothing was going to be different between us but it was just it took a while for us to how are you going to think missus miller has for forty three years been longing to see her the child shed giveen birth to u she is excited about it and my mother's what happend to my life it exploded one sings come down sue came to to conclusions one she was not going to become a strange from her mother and too it was her brother she might lose my name is pi mc donald and i am sixty one yeris sold i would say thet don is sue and i were probably not that clas am for whatever reason the reason was pretty simple actually they have almost nothing in common bob as for and a half years older than sue a sweet jovial guy who never got along with his broody little sister and when bob found out about marty found out that she was his biological sister he called her right away in california when she got on the phon i was just totally blown away ah the way she pronounced her words were identical with the way my mother talked she could have been my aunt er my mother talking on the pan i knew that she had to be my sister and i was esuperanxious to to med her an the in person an then until that timele just talked all a time with every fhon con that we mad in on wy open tat or teach other n and we had the same personality and west to think much alike my brother and marty are just thick as thieves in what seems and when ever marty comes to my home town she stays with my brother and they stapped tall alwol all ours ot the night talking for sue her brothers enthusiasm for marty brought out every insecurity she suffered as a school girl she did not fit in she did not have the social leavse that came naturally to bob and marty he was popular and i was not i was a serious person nobody would dance with me at the dances and i i want he had a band i mean i was shy or i was whatever and i wanted to be a cheer later i tried out for cheerling i just could not do it i did not get picked as hears went by when there were family events with everyone sue would get anxious if marty was there too occasionally she would break down in cry ie remember at the wedding when my nephew got married my brother danced with everybody he dance with marty and you can see thar jas haven much fon and laughing to gother and and just dancin away and then he dance with my cousin he danced with my mother he danced withere he did not dance with me and here i am you knoce or ma tena jer gainin not what he dance with wih me no wat's it was bad but the bed good part about that was when i got home from the wedding and my brother called me and he said at i did not even dance with youand i said who told you to sa he did no i to but it just brouht up feelings that youfeel crommi again and because i wonder what is gin happen when my parents are gone is my brother gen a care to even see me any more this brings us to marty the other baby in this baby switch for she found out the truth about who her mother really was marty's life was not all that different from sues marty was also marryd also had three kids she is also moved out of wisconsin in her case to southern california she is also religious sue but that is pretty much where it ends marty worked all of her dult life and still does as a nurse she grew up as the six child in a family of seven kids besides her there was mary lydia faith ruth sunny luke and ester her mother rant a disciplined household everyone had to work she remembers washing and drawing all the dishes by the time she was five or six there was not much money around the five girls shared one bedroom the church was the center of their lives and the family never went on vacation or even to the movyes instead they were all taught to paint and couraged play music though marty stuck out in her family for one thing she was the only one who joked around she says even now the millers cannot tell when she is being ironic ad the there was the blondness in the perkiness in the socializing marty sai she felt everything she was interested in was lost on her parents i do not think that they ever came to watch me sher and again that was not something that they would have done cause athletics was really not a value to them at all i was just not ever meeting their expectation of intellectualism and my mother has told me since then you i really did not expect that much from me because i knew that you were not or child that was a hard thing here incredibly when marty was twenty one years old some one actually told her that she might not be a miller one of her older sisters ruth came to visit with her husband rudy rudy had a couple of years and after dinner he got to talking and he started asking me what i knew about the mc donalds and i really did not know anything about the mc donald's and then he told me that i looked them and he said what would you do if i told you that they were your parents nd i i was kind of stonned it was the first i had ever heard anything about it and he did in fact ay some hurtful things does he told me i do not care what anybody says from as far as i'm concerned you are not really ruth's sister i thought it was just rudy bein rudy he just has crazy ideas and he dreams these things up i was just horrified and and he did not tell me a had a time he just came out with it that is ruth she and faith an mary lydya a the older girls had sorto always known about the possibility that marty was not their biological sister couple of them including ruth had vague memories of their parents talking about it after they brought marty home from the hospital about how this baby looked different fror missus miller's other babies and that maybe this baby had been switched then when ruth was about sixteen her older sister faith came home from a trip on a mississippi river boat and told ruth shead seen soo mc donald on the boat and that she looked an awful lot them the decided that ruth ought to have a look too the two girls cooked op a re connistan's mission on one sunday they got their boy friends o drive themis seventeen miles away to the mcdonald's church and prairie to shene ruth sat down in a pu nior the front next to faith wright before thi service began she says there is sue walking down the centr ile and know i i thought she even walks mary i ways i was just you woll well that could be that could be herd that could be my sister and yet i think it might be and at any pointering this time does a crustion iam well whyn't we just asked mammandat about this now that is not how their family work it just did not talk about these kinds of things and as ruth and faith saw it it was not their place to messin their parents affairs which was why when her husband rudy blurted it out a few years later ruth was shocked and marty refused to believe it at that point she denied she says oh now now that is not trip then i thought well o kate and it is not bad if she e she believ she is my sister and that is goot the next week though when marty was visiting their mam missus miller she asked her about what rudy had said missus miller gave her a non committle answer saying that once upon a time they thought that maybe perhaps it might have but even if it did happen there was no way to prove it that was that wover the years a thought that she might be someone else's child festered in the back of marty's mind and much later when she was in her midthirties she decided to get to the bottom of it she was working for a group of pediatricians which included a janettic counsillor she told the councel her story and said she wanted to get blood test done the councelr asked her what the macdonalds knew about all this i said i do not think they know anything about it she said well if you were to find out that that these parents that you have are not your parents and the other family does not want to have anything to do with you how were you gin a feel and i said well i do not know i do not have any idea and she said you really need to consider how that is going to change your family for you and how it is going to change relationships for you she said unless there is a real i ave reason that you need to know sat i do not recommend that you dig in to it that is sort of spooked marty she left it alone that is what might have ended if it had not been for missus miller's letter at decade later it is hard enough to learn that your mother is not your mother but it is even harder when that news is delivered by some one missus miller tact is in her strong suit in fact she seemed to have it tineer for the whole thing for starters missus iller did not contact marty ensue at the same time she first sent the letter to sue mc donald the daughter she barely knew and then waited almost two weeks before mailing the letter to marty the daughter she would raised she said she wanted to call marty first but never managed to reach her as result marty got word about one of the most basic facts of her life second hand all the while waiting to hear directly from her mother and in the meantime i had gotin phon calls from people i did not even know that were telling me hey i'm your brother hey i was switch t that worth with you when she finally heard for missus miller the mother she would grown up with not only did she get the letter but missus miller had just been to the fiftieth anniversary party of the mac donalds marty's biological parents and she took a one of the programms from it and she mailed it to me and basicly and this is gun ason kind of a small thing but it was a big thing to me she circled the names of people that were participating in the programme my one of my uncles on the birthside earle genzallas she circled his name and she wrote this is your uncle and she circled my brothers in name and this is your brother bob and case she would circle their names and say these re your parents and you kow iam reading this thing going what do you mean these ere my this is my uncle this is my brother this is my mam and dad this is not my my family i n't even know who they are and i took that as a o ka i'm saying as of right now you are not our kid you are their kid you are in their family marty says her mam missus miller she is the world in black and white she fokus on the facts o the situation maybe hoping she could fix things by simply setting the record straight she was not malicious she was not trying to be hurtful after all those years she was just tired of secrets and now she wanted every one's roll to be clear but was hard mardy says to be on the receiving end of this sudden adamant truth telly there were a few years there where every chance my mother got she made it perfectly clear that i was a mac donald for the longest time whenever she would write to me she would include mc donald in my name my cot are he serious just absolutely bazaare things that she she that is just how she is she am there is no great area actually my mother wanted to im god at court and have my name legally changed back to soon mac donald and have sue's name changed that was her idea it is kind of she tells me that this is you are you are my daughter and but at the same time she says when she refers to kay she says well your mother am is doing such and such your mother said this and when i think of my mother i think of her during this time it was mardy's dat reverend miller who reassured her the started talking on the phonal lot he explained things why all those years ago he refused to return to the hospital and switch back the babies and he let mardy know that he still loved her he did not im ont her to push me out of the family he was he in fact would call me and tell me i do not care what she says you still our kid and i'm glad we had you did you feel that then after this happened a little bit closer your dad than your mam yes yet definitely at that point my dad had this herandas guilt because he felt it was all his fault that he should have believed my mother for all those years and he just i think he honestly never thought it was a possibilital he thought she really dreamed this up in her head and just got obsessed with it and the other thing was that he really thougt what difference does it may a child is a child she is with us she is ours now the other polm from mardy just how to approach mac donalds her biological parents the were nice enough when she spoke to them on the phone but they were not exactly welcoming her into the family i remember talking to mother about this is your blood daughter here is bot mac donald who remember was having these great phome calls with his new found sister this is the daughter that actually was in you and hat i mean i understand you did not raise here but she is her blood you biological dauter im and dam i do not know that im she was as excited about it as i was and i could not figure that out at the time she was guarded there were ice enough when she spoke to them on the phone but they were not exctly welcoming her into the family from mardy's perspective h jenettic counsellors prediction from yours before seemed to becoming true i felt she was losing both her mothers marty wrote a letter tdo ka and bob mac donald her biological parents i want you to know that i will except whatever contact you choose to have with me even if it is none at all i promise you i'll never try to make you think of me as your daughter i know that sue's your daughter and no one could ever expect you to feel otherwise marty eventually decided that the only way she was going to resolve this was by getting on a plan and flying out to wis consin to meet the mac donald's face to face give them a real chance to get to know her to get together at bobin came mac donald's house did not go exactly as she wanted from the mac donald's perspective marty looked and acted remarkably a mac donald she got a long famously with their son bob she hav had the exact same oil painting hanging on her wall in california as they had in their living room a landscape with trees and water but sue was the girl they had brought up and they felt loyal to her protective i kind of felt thet lik boban ka ore kind of keeping me in an arm's distance because they ware not really sir how they felt or wanted to feel and i do not think sue had that since in fact that is true maybe because some of the miller girls had suspected that she was ther sister for decades ind because missus miller always knew the truth sue was being embraced completely by the miller clan and well suead feared everyone would choose marty the outgoing churly to rover her it did not work out that way here is marti in fact it was the exact opposite she had both families wanting to make her that she was included in their family that millers wanted to incorporate her family into our family as quickly as they could and se i i did feel in the beginning she was taking my place in my family and that was odd very odd and sometimes i do not no exactly what her relationship is with my sisters i i honestly do not know o how much they communica how much there in tuch hard of me really does not want to know because i think i would feel left out of something goming out what is to be a mam and to learn at the age of sixty nine that your only daughter is not actually your daughter at all and that were not bad enough that lots of people in your town people around you knew years before you did buts in a minute from scagobobegredio went on program continues tis americand life mirea glassed eveyou just yuting in jake hobern is telling the story this hour of two girls switch to birth one mother marry miller knew and kept it a secret that nothing about it for forty three years the other mother came mac donald had no idea the two fathers in this story were not interviewed mister mc donald's health did not allow it mister miller died to thousan and in this half of the story we hear from the mothers again here is jacopren at the hospital in nineteen fifty one came mac donald was told that she would given birth to a nine pound four hounds baby she din't question that every day she was at the hospital the nurses brought her the same baby girl nothing seemed o miss to her and as that baby sue grew up the one thing that puzzled ky was that missus miller whom she knew only vaguely from thurch seemes interested in sue she always referred to the girls as sisters after they were born she had written us i christmas letter and do and said she would always to keep in' touch with susan because the girls were much sisters and i crass i thought that was foolish but tim i went along was at because i do not to me waves i guess se might say and that is why i started sending them a copy of our christmas letter that is how missus miller kept track of sue over the years missus miller would do were say things concerning the girls things that just seemed strange to cay when cases church was celebrating its one hundred and fiftieth anniversary for instance kay was shure person for the event reverend miller had once been passed her there he and missus miller were invited and the millers came and i was in the halway and missus miller said to me did you ever think that our girls were switched at birth and i's i said heavens know i thought that was such a ridiculous thing to say and am and i cris i was very busy because i was cheerpersan and i had many other things to do i pass it off but that is all she said there was nothing any further i did not it did not bother me because i just thought i could not see any merit to it i did not have a doubt in my mind and i'm not one to barro treuble what came ac donal did not know was that there was a whole slew of people in her church community who had heard about the rumored baby s witch from the beginning missus millern came a donal were actually in different churches kay was a methodists in the millers reevengelicals missus miller told people whin the evengelical church about her suspicions friends of hers and people she hope would keep an iout un sue but later the two churches emerged bunch of people from the evengelical church now knew who came ac donal was and who sue was and realized that this was the girl missus miller believed to be her own and this whole crop of people knew but never said anything to came ac donald one of them was darling wolfgraham she heard at first from her own mom who heard it at church she said everybody kind of at church after having seen marty beside the rest of the family a just could not believe that that was their child it was pretty concealed an rig within our own church probably the ladys ad maybe o the little grue that got together in fact my mother said what is do not tell anybody a we all we never said anything about it i darling wolfram did tell her daughter thatd orand the daughter there with me anded up marrying sue's brother bob the older but even she never devolged the secret to bob or any of the macdonalds here she is her names also sue o i know i did not because it was always just the rumor and i thought well he will think i not you knol and he was very angry at first with me and ni he said why would not you have told me that ni said would you have believed me i mean id say she guess what bab i'll think your sisters yours well there was no de ani tasting that that or anything else i den the would have been no prof that is what most people in town seemed to feel it was not their place to bring up such a thing especially with no way to know of it was true for sure what that meant was that after came ac donal finally found out the truth an nineteen ninety four people started coming up to her in church mostly casually mentioning that they would known about it all long i was surprised that nobody really ever a told us the booms the te nors the langs the haszens i gi just could not believe it i just da i just thought it was odd that many people would know in a town of our size which was fifty five hundred people when that many people were aware of it that the news did not get to us slowly anger began to set in cay was angry that missus miller had not corrected things back in nineteen fifty one missus millered high jacked her life in this way and she was angry that missus miller put sue in the difficult position of having to break news this to her parents and angry that now the millers were asking much of sue's time and attention i got bad ca had to go on medication for high blood pressure well course they were really clamouring to get to know her and a i felt excluded i felt they were trying to take her away from us and and susan always had said to me ma'm why did not you have any more children after i was born she wanted to be a part of a big family then she found out she had all of these i brothers and sisters and a the phone calls were fewer and i nd of course marty did not really call a whole lot she is a very busy gal and i was not having that much communication with her and a i thought i was losing both of them ca mac dottle began getting notes and phone calls from reverend miller he told her tat he thought it was god's will of this had happened even he asked her for forgiveness again and again ae just outright he just saying can you forgive me just just that on the telephone iwt yes and quoting scripturs i all the time for me to read to console me because i had said that i had i had shed a lot of tears and and i i had probably all of the emotions that you have with the death in a family i think i would not into a kind of a depression about similar to what i did when my mother died and crse was trying to get me to say that i had forgiven them and how did you feel when he said this was god's will and what was your action i could not believe that because i do not i do not ta have that feeling about i do not think god punishes us an anyway i think what wed do is pretty much our own doing but he had everybody convinced i think that it was god's will but i had talked to several of our former pasters who knew about the situation and they ya assured me that this was not god's will they said that was a copout and i do not think that was too well received when i mentioned that i told missus miller i felt that it was god's will when she realized that she i not have the right child i think it was his will that she do something about she wrote that letter to missus miller eight years after she learnd the truth that long it took her to sort out her feelings canmac dotle in the millers eventually reached kind of day ton cayis no longer angry the way she was but she said she will never understand why missus millr stayed silent for all those years if i h d does stronga feeling as she did that i had the wrong baby i would have pursued it i i do not care whether my husband objected or not i i feel on i should have made it a wrong in to a right i i only had ths one daughter and she had five daughters the fact we were even orn'd even sure we would have another child i crisi we were elated when i did get pragnant and and then to think that i did not get torase the one that i ad wanted to much an do i never will probably understand why i mean i forgiven hem but that tdoes not mean that i forgotten i can still wonder why and probably never will know why it did not come up any sooner t mary miller was ninety six now she lives by herself in the country her house is filled with the remnants of her and norbert's life together in the church they were married for sixty years there is a large statue of an angel in her sitting room when se as planning to put on her own grave when i first talked to issus miller about what had happened when marty was born she told me pretty much the same story she told in her letter how she knew as soon as she got home and wayed the baby that the nurses had made a mis stake yes i told ini w i think we hav the wrong baby and he said well i would not isgrace it docor bi telli em e gabe wit the wrong baby and he tais this is a nice little baby will keeper when when your husband said to you not this baby's cute let us keep it did you agrie with him immediately or was the a little bit of arguing doctand forth ofor what to do not we did not not get bat th but i kept lookin forher and na was lways atking any one whom i hathing i and fact i when i would go don have any toch wit ne ma dont we we got introduced to them i i kid to taltoher about it in she she told come b thi was crazy at wi gregen woman thought i a her girlit was a little sereal to hear her talk about it in this way laughing that especially after hearing came an donald side of things but then missus miller told me more of her side of the story for one thing she explained just how six she was after they had gone home with marty an nineteen fifty worn she was losing blood having spasms she thought she was going to die she told me that she even started calling round trying to find some one whould be a mother to her six children the sickness she said lasted for six or seven months but the time she was well fixing the babys witch problem was that much harder even if she could somehow convinced every one it was true but what happened if he suddenly took o six month old away from the only mother she knew and the family's relationship with doctor desloc was no small thing either reverend miller had made many visits to doctor deslock's wife when she was sick and now doctor deslock refused to charge the millers for anything the millers did not have much money and they might not have been able to afford the health care otherwise but cor we tok can ded din't fer doing it tis doctor been cind to in good do i and why ruin all that the be consideration because missus miller did not want o cross her husband all she could do was hope that maby if she dropped enough hints calling the girl's sisters and such cay would eventually realized on a rome what had happened it was an odd strategy if you can even call at that when sue got married for instance the millers gave her a trivet norbet had made the card was signed from your other possible parents sun dismisseed his part of the whole sister thing but she also thought was kind of weird missus miller's most ambitious scheme happened after the girl's graduated from high school when they were about to be eighteen missus miller arranged for the mc donalds to come to dinner she figured if she could simply get cay ta look at marty cay would figure things out the evening justsended up being kind of baffling for every one involved since only missus miller knew what was going on but they had not notice any i do not know why they didt notice that that marta look them and wa's thim i do not know why they did not oti at the fact is missus miller longed for sue for her biological daughter ever since she realized the mistake back in nineteen fifty won but it seemed fudal trying to convince her husband norbert i i i thinkly it is not right to o do that yor culd keep somebody off e baby i didnt than glit right to do that and everytime at talk o to me at it u it is all right itll be right and i cannot ga o hard a li that lis ar ot me all along were you afraid of norberd at all well ino i was not afraid of e mi i knew thet would thing i could not do in and keep his frenc et beou knowit if i turned against him li gotn on that and i i guess you can understan i i did not wi have a dust grin an that likeing thi that would o weren or marrie it would't rund it iad no rigt ru i the clut sogan to take care o was therever a time when hou thought back and thought i should have stood my grownd more with him on that no i guess i have not because i i knew it wouldna work i could not do anything abat it narbritan i had a good kind while we were togethr bet narbri shad gone back in sat is is not or babe and this was a bad disi him bhat he did not real i li t a tha tha wen a notn r to make in disin i tth neither sune nor marty blames missus miller for going along with her husband they say there not angry with her they knew reverend miller they understand what their relationship was they understand why she did nots speak out sooner forty two years after the switch reverend miller finally laid eyes on sue at the mc donald's wedding anniversary party and the moment he saw her he knew that she was his biological daughter she looked exactly him at last missus miller felt free to act a month and a half later she wrote the letter o i wanted him go we with me and he didnt he finly did but but was really for me begad that was terrible tht that hang al wat yell and an isat that happen it gook kay an off along time a am sarry b one thing missus milther does not regret is raising marty she remembers marty always lightning the mood in their house as i gid she wi she is really iliblie she always had jokes she had joked everyday it i deepes laughing you knowt was it was good for a i lat i wi really good frat ever out i mea the my kid jar olf was serious that t life yet now theyar more i am before when id asked you if she thought it was god's will you said yes and is the reason because marty brought something important to your family you she did she brought happiess dear sue i'm writing you this short note to officially give you my welcome to this miller family and relationship this is sue reading a letter she got some time ago from her new found miller sister faith though there are many many good things about our family and parents and being raised by that family there were also some definite defacits if youre ever curious as to what they were i would be very willing to fail you in you fully appreciate the parents who raised you between ourselves ruth and me we or at least i always figured you locked ot probably martha with her happy golucky nature could take the climate of the miller home better and we hope you flourished in the mac donald household well well i'm she is basam tets she is basely saying to you you may have actually got in a break here being in the family i loced o i locked out i mean are ther times when you when you feel little but guilty about and of having locked out with the home that was neno maybe litle be easier to gro up in was sure i guess sid ye a little belte gilt but it is not my it is not my fault there was nothing id did not have anything to do with it my sister faith called in she was talking about the way her mother would talk to her n i'm think how would i have survived with that kind of upbringing you kdo not i did not grow up that at al i do not know how i what as survifed but sue says here a lot of things she missed out on too by not growing up with the millers the family did all kinds of hobbys painting and rock polishing in three de photography they had dogs raised an gor rabbits all sorts of interesting people came to the house guests from out of town and missionaries it was a different way of living one that she admires as for marty she does not to dwell on the notion that sue might have been the one who locked out does i thought ever crosse your mind an what if the switch had not been made what thac donalds ha just taking me home and i had grown up in the house with my biological parents my biological brother who would i be oh that is a funny question i i really om i really only thought about that one time i only let myself think about one time it was actually right after i met them and i ways going back to my my mother's house i left pray to seen and i was driving and it was then that i start to thinking o my is my life would have been different and as i the more i thought about it the more i realized i cannot think about this because it will drive me crazy if i do and tho i cant a made a promised to myself that i would does never go down that road again that i was not tan o does not get to go there ne i really havan because there is no point it is pretty rare that marty and sue actually meet face to fays once every few years they get together for a large family gathering a wedding a graduation a funeral the summer bob my donald's younger son got married and prarried asheen when marty showed up at the house for brunch the day after the wedding she could not have seen more at home with the family that she did not meet to er fortis she teased the groom and handed bob's older son at present for his baby it is a little ate as fr er to an ain e gardens goia oa s up ye i te birt tey bresent when sue arrived she slipped in quietly this was the side of the family she was raised with but she seemed tense watching as marty made the rounds everybody laughing having the two of them near each other was a little awkward people were definitly aware whenever both women were in the same room at one point toward the end of the party as sue stood near by mart started talking about the room that she had grown up in and the miller household all the girls were in the same room marty shared o bed with her sister fath

the benshfir show sponserb express ife the pan protect our onmine praxy to day expressi pian dicams lashben there is no substitute for american strength and here is no justification for american weekaness that is what the world has been finding out over the course of jobidon's presidency when jobidon entered office aron was under heavy sanctions and its proxies increasingly ind poverish the abraham a cords were beginning to consolidate a powerful antiranian soony juicial lines with sauty arabia widely assumed to be the next shootadrop afganistan had not been surrendered to the talabam grain had not been invaded by russia less than three full years into jobidon's term aron has been emboldened and its proxy strengthen all of this is linked to the by dedministrations decision to seek a deal with ron involving the un freezing of funds and the freeing up overanian oilflo as well as the by deinistrations early attempts to marginalize the souty government and two weeks ago aranian back terrorists group comas launched the worst attack against juws since the holicost casbala another eranian proxy which effectivally controls lebonon and has at least one hundred and fifty thousand sufphisticated rockets aimed at israel's north has been firing sparatic rockets into israel's north aswell thanks to comas the tacx on israel and israel's necessary response dhe sauties have now table talks regarding normalization with the jewish state and things are getting worse just yesterday the aron backed hoothies wve seized control of much of yemmon's north fired three missiles at israel an america had to shoot them down using a carrier in the region there is brigadseer general patrider pends gon pressecretary explaining just what happened by postering these us navalasets and advance figter aircraft in the region we aim to sand a strong message intended to deter a wider conflict to bolster reginal stability and of course to make it clear that we will protect ind defend our national security interest to that and the crew of the guided missile destroyer us s carny operating in the northern red sa earlier to day shot down three land attack crusemissiles and several drones that were launched by whoo the forces in yemmen this action was a demonstration of the enigrated eir and missile defense architecture that we ave built in the middle east and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interests and this important region there were no casualties to u s forces and none that we know of to any civilians on the ground information about these engagements s still being process and we cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting but they were launched from yemmon heading north along the red sea potentially towards targets in israel remember it was jo bidon's administration that dlisted the hoothies those the people just fired those missiles as a terrorst group ins twenty twenty one despite the fact that their charming slogan runs quotes deft to america defth to israel curse the jews victory to islan it does not rin but you can deo wht it same also yesterday aronian back forces launched ta drone attack on a military base in southern syria where you as troops have a presents one drone was down but another causeminor injuries the base is located according to the times of israel at a sensitive juncture often used by aronian backed ghatis to therry weapons to the hesbel a terra group that same days suring opposition ack this said that drones were used to an attack an oil facility housing american troups in the region and that is not all on thursday night according to the jerusalem post drones and rockets targeed the in all asad air bates which hoses us and other international forces in western erock and multibal blas were herd insidethe bates this is uron testing the united states ithout question and sho last night jobidon had a really important job he had ta reestablish america's credibility particularly in the midleast he had a shro ron and its proxies that america would not allowl the regions spin into chaotic violands he had to demonstrate strength of will he had ta show he would not be side tracked on to other issues an that he was not under the misimpression he could simply throw money at his enemies by early indicators presient biden has failed last night he gave a discombobulated and confuse speech a bazarmics of solid promises to back israel againstkamss and off topic promises with regard to additional aid u crane strange blatherangs about american is lamafobia combined with a weird utterance regarding the necessity of a palstingan state was not prticularly reassuring for anyone which means in all likelyhood that aron will continue testing the united states tey will continued to poke and prod and up the anti in the expectation that jo bidon is bluffing and will fuld and here is therael problem no one really knows if they are right including maybe jobiden right now on the northern border of israel casballa is mobilizing according t the walstry journal israel orded the evacuation of a city close to lebony's border reflecting the is really militaries growing concern that a second front could open up to the north as it continues its bomming campagn in gaza including a strike on a church compound overnight now by the way that strike on the church compound which was originally report bekhamas it turns ot was 'nstrike on a church as a place near a church as always comas they la israel on friday also released more details about the hossages captured bachamas israel's defense ministry said residents of curiochmona a city of twenty two thousand people will be moved to guest houses now provided by the states isrally forces and lebanon's his ballah have ben exchanging fire continuously in recent days now casballa maybe attempting to up the anti in the north to draw troop presents away from the gasestrip or they maybe testing seeing how far they can go without the americans getting involved casbalah has been attacking idea posts yesterday two cusblan members were killed and one moderately hurt isrally tank shells were preparing attacks there ware drones that were hitting mortar launching sells aswell things are heating up on israel's northern front all of that as happening because aron is testing everywhere from a rach two seria two yemmen they are testing literally everywhere in the region to see how far they can push before they get push back which is precisely what you would expect from a regime that believes that its opposition is week and that means that it is up to the wess to demonstrate strength obviously with that means for israel is they ned to destroyhams wholesale without is out every one agrees on this comas has to go iiv comas word to survive the accistential threats of the state of israel is quite real not just because cams would continued to exist in the gose strip and continued to prepare further terror attacks but also because this would in flame the palsining authority and his lomac ceehod to start to increase the violence in the called westban tuday and to mery and it would prompt hes ballaw to increase its violence in the north providing israel with a three front war if israel is prompted into that three from war by the way israel have to strike back with all of its strength which would presumably prompt the entry of seria and ron into any sort of war which would prompt american ntervention sof you wish this thing to slow down if you wish for this thing to cool nown what you need is for israel to be given a free hand to destroy commass in the gozistrip wall making clear to the rest of the region particularly oron eronian proxies that if they get involve they to we will be destroyed an a second own t give you the latest from the situation in goza because it is becoming increasingly clear what has to happen over there and then we will get to jo bidon speech from the oval office last night again it was meant to be a speech of strength and resilians and instead it was confused it was dis combobulated it was off topic it was very weird he seid some good things andhe settle lot of things that were either orrelevant or werent attempt to essentially cram a crap hand which down the throats of the american people in terms of spending willget to that

hundred people still unaccounted for on clear ho manyo those people are dead israel is every day discovering bodies that mutilated beyond recognition still in the south of israel this is why whenever you see comas issues statistics five hundred debted to hospital by the way it ended up being ten according to the urpins from a rocket fired by pallsing in his lomitry hod just to put a cap on how many lies commasstellsin it what in extraordinary clipp the they tell thos lise israel is still digging bodies out of the rubbl and it could be the deir two hundred people our hostages or could be that their one hundred people who are hostages in one hundred of those people are dead and burned beyond all recognition at least thirty children oure among the confirmed at gaza hostages according to the idia we shuld recall that ecaus everybody seems to believe that they are uner the weirdmess impression hat we do not have a massive hostage crisis by the way worse tan the ranian hostage crisis in the sense that these are a these are actually small toblers there' sm small children women wor almost as suredly being raped the rest of the world is ignoring that calling for a sease fire and by the rest of the world i really mean the international left lot of governments are our acknowledging the israel has to do what to has to do in orderto take out commositis when including the european parliament shockingly enough the m the gosistrip again continues to be a sorce of rocket fire apparently the run ot electricity an water bat not rockets thay continue to fire those rockets israel is is faced with a a basic choice and that is do they wait to go in until they have thoroughly devastated the areas surrounding the tunnels such that they can blow up the tunnels and thus save thousands of hisraily lives or do they go along in the internatiral community put a fousand soldiers into basically semalia a black hawk down sinareo or there ust walk in through heavily crowded urban to rain with high buildings with terroris in them and terr supporters in them and terra symbothizers in them there has been a lot of conflict inside these ral government over exxactly the timing on this thing you have former preministirenoug tolly bennet for example who ise been saying that israel needs to crush its opposition that is going to take time and if israel needs to wait to do that until the i f can do everything that it can due to clear the ground then it should absolutely do that that seems to be the prevailing thought among more israilly members of government these days an i thing that that is the right thought by the way if it were america i'd be saying obviously same thing i have said obviously the same thing i do not the idea of american troops going to heavily crowded areas with lots of terroris in them in the mistaken impression the mitimizing cevilinan casualties is in some way more important than th lives of american soldiers that isn it that is not correct if the reality is that any country worth it is alt has to protected soldiers you have to give them rules of engagement that they are capable of carrying forth effectively and sacrificing blood in order to pro tect civilions tat are being used is human shields by terrors is a bad strategy gives the upper hands to the terroris obviously israel may continue the bomming campaign for while that presumbely is why husbli is can ave broiling up in the north in any case israel is still warning the possibility of ground invasion may be iminent according to the times of israel seniors railly officials talked up the prospect of that iminent largescale ground campaign in the gosestrip to root out the commoss terror group thursday mang a series of visits to idea soldier station near the territory prodicting the fighing will be difficult long and intens the fence minister yoal gallant told troops near gos of the ord to enter the commoss run at palsting an on clave would come soon you said you see now gossi from a far sunualty if from the inside the order will come now is quite possible that that is a misdirect by the isral the government that what they are saying at this point is notrael because what they want commossibelieve is that the ground invasion is imminent get all the civilians out of the way in the sense that we the ones we cannot use its as shields are oingto be an obstacl tos killing is rally soldiers to get them out ofle that is a possibility it is also possible ground invasion is iminent not clear exactly what is happening one thing is clear israel must get rid of comas and this conflict should be contain now that was supposedly the purpose of jobidan speech last night drobidon gave his second t oval office dress of his presidency and again the idea here is to prit project support for israel strength in the face of terrorism that is really all it about showing to turrent strength two aron's proxies and aron to contain the conflict and making clear that israel is going to have the material necessary in order to evicerate kommas from planed earth by the way a secondary conversation is going to have to be had by the israel govern about what to do about cusbell on the north because cesbala obviously after watching what is happen over the corse last couple of weeks cannot be alowed tromain in southern webonon either because the're firing rock its it isral have a hundred n fifty thousan rocket point that it israel that wuld take out twenty to thirty thousand jews if they were ll fired israels can have to do someting about husbala president biden correctly for american interest is saying we do not want that border heeting up er things are you tn get very hot very quickly but israel in the future is can have to do something about that northern border and everybody knows it it is beginning to amerge exactly what israel wants youg about gaza it is exactly to have suggested at deua demilitorize zone that is significant in territory all around the gossip strip and then a new security regime inside gosa capable of allowing th isralies to actually go in and target terrase in the same way that israel still has the ability to go target terris in large scale cities with huge terras presence gonine in the west bank juda an smaria in a second will gets tou jobidon speechen will see if ye ashlly hit is marks will gets that moment first we take prayer really really seriously in the jewish community you will regardless of your religion you need a lo more pece in your life ind hallo is an incredible ap that offers unique approach to prayer and meditation unlike other meditation aps hallo is tailors specifically for people offaith to deepen their relationship ofh god the hallo ap is filled with studies meditations and reflections rooted in

to pray with you tract your progress along the way and we in the jerscammee we pray three times a day minimum and i got tell you without that i'd be going totally insayne right now if you are looking to deep in your relationship withd god and ipprove your mental an a motiona well being try hallo for three months free at hallo dot com slashipiro again that is hallo dot com slash chipiro o case to last night jobidon gives his oval office address sat's relbet late and then he get started the beginng o the speech is totally fin and then as we will see it goes off the rails because jobidon strategy instead of being the twofold strategy than i am talking about provide israel te materiael that it needs in or to destroy komas and contain the conflict with the turrents i those it that is the only two things in you to do last night instead of doing that he decided that heis going to somehow link israel aid and ou crane ads can make two thords of the speech vatu crane which makes no sense at all ond anygio political level that makes no sense at all o you make the case for you rane i've made the case for you crane aid i believe that a continuing military aid package do ou crane sufficient to prevent the russians from moving into further u cranian territory would be good i've also suggested that there needs to be some sort of all frem there because everybody knows thas te frozen conflict and the lines of conflict are not changing very much to spite the amount materiael being poured in something can be negotiated that st hardens those lines and and we move on with our alives that would probably be a good thing with that set continue to aid untill that point is reached would be a goo thing what in the hell does that have to do with israel fighting back a terror s threat on its own bors in real time why are those two things lenkth make can make the case that those things are lingh because they have the same opposition and that is a fair point aron russia they are basically on the same side however the the urgen sy of the moment is being generated not by the situation you crane remember that urgent situation arose a year ago it is strange it is it is connecting what happen on nine eleven with america's conflict with with china or something i gettlet yes many bad things happen on the planet at once these things are not linkd and one the problems with linking them up is that all the people why are not supportive of ad u grain i're now going to be forced into the same boat as people who are supportive of with of aiht of israel jabina is trying to rap everything into a nice bow here and and iit does not work on any sort of intellectualevelant and he is also in this speech minimizing exactly the threat that israel faces which is not useful will go through it he starts off by pointing out the the correctan ov is the commassis evil tar cepomonly pure oni oin evil in the world bu satly the youi people no perhaps peinin anyone that there is noline to te te pravity of people on that on on te panonon and it israel i a people tong te terminisiin also angry an sa ini keep deep pan g that would be correct obviously but then he moved in to this weird nether region this weard grav region where he starts talking about the two state solution and the peace process dude israel just got hit wit the worst terra tacxons the holicost i'm pretty sure that come oss nes be wiped off the maptheran no two states solution there whone comes to the palicnan authority is lomacyhod there are not no two statesolution they are either those of the governing parties in judan sumaria the called west bank and in fact as i will show you the palcinian authority is fully supportive of commass's mission to destroy the state of israel where exactly is the two stateslet what is he even jappening about now maybe you culd take tactically what he is attempthing to do is cool the waters a little bit that he what he is attempting to do is thorow a sop to many of the arab states in the region do not worry the united states is going to still put pressure on israels who should let israels what they need to do maybe strategically that is what he is doing if i're to look at it in those positive possible life for present o bidon sure or he couldn just shut the hell up because this is not the time to talp about a cuincld two state solution in the middle of genisidal juw hating murderers murdering fifteen hundred juws and their body's over in the west bank rallying in their support which is exactly what is happening right now here is jobine ae po te presen abos te polic nyn authority a retera te yontta comman committed to the politinin people rit to dignity andiself termination the axtions a lonters do not pay that right away i somany other i'm heart broken i the tragic losico polisini lie concluding explosion i tassoin goss is not on byis relli we on every innocent lie lost we can nor you manity inocent polistinis o on livin pece and have an opportunity get what he should have said then is and the only way that can happanings of come oss gos but he did not do that in it by the way this is ay li okan when he is saying here that there is a full full skall supperation between say the palsinin authorityin homos or between the population of the goses strip and commoss hat's a few bad apples in the gosses trip an th rest of the people to totally diserithmos there is no evidence aback gat none in fact obviously there is tons of footage of civilians frum gosof running into the kubould seam stealing things in taking part inthe violence does not mean that every one there deserves to die in some sort of is really air strike it does not mean that they are cannot be some sort of the ventuall deal that might be able to be cout with a brand new leadership and a transform population not in doctrinated with several generations of jou hatred sure maybe some time if that time is not now in fact when he says things the palsinian authority tho i'm telling i'm tolng mahmuto bos that that the palsinin piece prosses still on the table moch moud a boss paid three million dollars two the terrorist who perper trated this attack he has a paid for slave programm it is still fully in place is against american law for us to employ that money does mate pausin an authority is still paying the families of terris a monthly sypen for

guites according to jobine those ha t ose then moderates an official document that the palcsinian authority just issued to every mosqe within its control to to give its it sort of friday sermans here is what it says it says apparently there is a document publishd this morning youcn see it in the ar bic er by the ministry of endowments and the palcinan authority an reveal by research departments of the jewish voice and rik of you movement the tels a series of instructions and messages for friday sermans among them strongly antismetic inciting messages including the famous hadeth quotation quote the hour will not come until the muslins fight the jews and the muslins kill them until the jew hides behind the stones and the trees and the stones of the trees say ol muslim was servants alla this the ju behind me come kill him that is literally the palcinan authorityes telling its mosques to say to day those are themoderates the jobidon is saying it is ouralmost cut a piecdeal with in the middle of a of a crisis spurred by genicitled you hatred and the great lie of the palstinin piece process since onset has been tht you can negotiate your way ins piece withpeople who literally want to exterminate you that is not the same thing is t e territorial dispute any moreon who compares this to the called troubles in irelan an anybody who who compares this to one party having a territorial dispue ith another party religiously base but yes a dispute that can be solved territorially that is not even remotely what you are talking bout hereyou have one party openly calling for the genicide of the other party and the rest of the ror on wold miucan deplomasy our way into this thing yet good luck it is worked out amazing over the past thirty years at ly any one with half a brain could ave told you from the very beginning oslo was destined to failbeges again you cannot negotiate with genicidal terris i do not know why this is hard to for anyone to understand it is why again maybe maybe the vestcate you can make for jobinies he is trying to be tacticall here to minnimize conflict to cool the to cool the temperature but you coldvolseger shut the hell up becuse he is wrong on this just deadwrong then he decides to link tus with you rane that gain utterly superfluous no reason what isoever to do this the conflict in you crane has its own logic the conflict in you crane its ton ration out's also been going for a year and a half at this point for eighteen months that conflict has been going meanwhile this conflict is broiled up in the last two weeks and seems significantly more urgent and yet yuris jobidon spending half the speech on you crane you kno po ty tallonis ecosiny twenty monts of wor tragety e caliny in flickin on the people of you crane people thet er very batly her san po loncis all outi a we wot forgotdin the mase craves the body tor berin signs of torture grat you is weapon bythe rish in thousanand thousandy rany children forcibly takin into rushi tollen from the carns itsi mossand put represent ifferen tras they hear thisni't common they both want to completely an ilatan naberintomocrisy completely an ily at well i mean that may be true it is als o troueh that china wants to anihilate i wan i but what are are all things the same when wha is the rational for connecting thse things seriously it turns out the rationl for connecting these things i that jobidon once in out hose one hundred billion dollar package through congress most of which will go to you crane not to israel most of which will go to you crane now it may be that congress because it is completely disfunctiona pass the pass the craps andwhich as a posed tue what re publicans could do in the house if for example thehead speaker of the house which is issue a single isshue buill providing ade to israel which is really what needs to happen raht now it may be that the best available bad option is just to get this thing through because the urgency of the situation requires that israel get the ma terial a' necessary to finish come ofs right now but that is a pretty cynical play by jobidon obviously and linking israel and annou crane totally unnecessary the speech last night should about should aveben about to rwn casbe law come oss the threats to the united states interests inth mideleast that is what itshould a beabout but instad half the speech was about you crane and now hem he was trime again there are two purposist ton speech theoretically one was standstrong with israel andthe other is throw the araneans off the ball an push them off the line and this part he tried to do and the question is con o be whether an un believes him in clip fivef he talks about why we are not with drawing and why ere ging to trying and push aron off the ball i just two weeks tago he told the world that if yhounit e states an our allies with drawin if an i sates o drawr ow as well as well nolicase toport you crane would have cot a week left to live but we are not with drawin i know these concess can seeme far away is nat to last why does this matter to americ any sare with you why making sure is on you crane succeed is vital for americas nas o security no hiscis catus that when cares do not pay price for their care when diccators do not pay a price for their gression e cas more caos and deat and more destruction they keep going now again all that is true the question is whether he actually has te doe turn power to do anything about it and whether any one actually believes him and i agree with what you sang rat ther i also agree with something he said last nighe whery said that american leadership holds the world together that of course is true american leadership does hold the world together and in the absence of american leadership the worldfalls but not everything he sat was bad last night is just a mishkababble it is the mass se here he was is cliped seven talking about american leadership in th orl againd this part is good there 's a lot of good mixts with bad which by the way is what he is now going to propose to congress will get to that momentarily merican leadership as what holds the world ogether merican a linces what keep us america san american values what make us a partner that an taceis on a work put all that a risk we walk away fom ou crane e turn our back an israel jus not worth at's quite amar i'm i and to congress a urgent buter quest the fondimaricis massi secures to support our critical partis including israel anu cranesaagain all that is perfectly well and good that is that is that is totally fine and then he lunchion the truly bad part of speech given gons the bad par of speechat the bad part of his speech begins with him talking m how much pressures can put on israel and how much money he is goin as son to commoss not getting hure he is talking about how he talked with the leadership of israel abot how they nean to operate by the laws worse ho first of all being lectured on the laws of war whell you are under terrorius ossault is the most insulting possible thing israel spends the wlives in the treasure of it citizense to not kills civilians commass is deliberately hiding behind and wh again what where where is this sort of care being taken with any other ally of the united states anywhere on earth after seven seven was there a lot of talk about no british human rights oh what why is it that when it is israel all the sendets ot while we we do have to warn those jews off of their brutality as at what thethell is run with you sere's what tells run wih you here is jobidon again this it this is foolishness of the highest order it place directly into comas propaganza you wonder why the media jums to that comms propagan and nonsense at israel had bom to hospital maybe it is because the president of the united states pretends that israel's routinely violating human rights when in fact israel is they country that on earth there only two coundrieds on earth that have this kind of standard for preventing detics villions america an israel was the only ones and israel has do at far more frequently than he united states here is jobiden we tthe same corn present nan now and i discustigan yesterday the critical neature is o te operate by the laws of war that means protecting sivis in combat as besis a can r he people of goaza personay fud whatin medicin yesterday an discussions with the leaders of israel anegypt i secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitaring is sistence from the oations to polisti edays in gosi tomas is not deverterstilltess shipmentthe shipmens were in a provide an opening per sustain delivery of lifesaving uminitaring i sisence for the polistinas o case what in ookingquestion thereis still two hundred hossageis being held by commass in gosap where is ththat money's can go what distribute of mechanism d you have for that money the answer is they have no distribut of mechanism how d we know that it is because they are openly aminiot for example here is he biden state department spokes person explaining his name's matmiller that sure come oss might seal thecash is literally yesterday the concern the is railly government has they said this publicly in the servly sedito privately dos is that any assistance that goes in will be diverted once its inside goza that there is not a there is not in is raily military force in gosat irs not a you in peescaping keeping force in goza the people with guns inside gaza ar hamas and hamas ma try to divert this is istanc in keep it from getting to the civilian to to it is intended for we than that the loginmac concern ah we have mane clear that this a needsto go to innocenc civilions a nahamas were to be watching very carefully a how it is delivered a because we want t becence of those concerns which we sare owell youn' watching carefully lhat's that is that is important is that if you watch really carefully if use your bonoculars from afar which is what you will be doing then probably comosulant still tha day by the way if youdn't believe him you crosolistens the byn deputy an isay director jon finer who basily said we truscomas the terras what we will just give hem a hundred milion dollars for prvy fine the president plenge to hundred million dollars in in a packans to palistinion civillions innocents o vilions and gas in the west bank how is the unite tates going to in shore then non of that ands av in the hands of hama a getting asistant in to gosit is a complicated undertaking it involves a essentially securing an understanding among a hamas fighters a who control the check points on the other side of the border among ovy government of israel and among the government of egypt but the question is wy y a fad i tin neu atnda tan stand os tis o were it haf ton take the war o hamas that it will not be take in what other n guarrante in their be we believe there is an understanding now among all of the a players who control that crossin the roff acrossing in egypt oh there is an understanding is there with comas well that that that changed everythings long as thre's an understanding sigain this is the kind of weakness than invites further terrorism than invites further exploration of american weakness again gobin kept going along these lines again he kept over and over and over pushing on this to states solution stuff in the middle of a war against people wor dedicated to israel's destruction an the murder of juseo get pushing olic over and over last night and when that was not enough he then started ripping on american as lamaphobia i've ive a question there there is a horrible horrible evil case of a tomented person in evil person wh shoud get the definalty killing a sixoral palistinian ked in america that horrible evil condemned by literally every one every one meanwhile there in mass protest across the united states on behalf of coms naturally gobidan is going to put heavy emphasis on is lamaphobia in theunited states alecturin the american people that we cant be is lamaphobic in this moment and then reminding us of hows lamaphobic we were after non eleven which is weard because there is not a lot of evidence to suggest masses lamaphobia in the aftromafonon alevenot by hate crimes statistics from the apia in any case here is a gobidon again this s themiddle of speech in the affmeth of the worst terror attack onjuws the worst slaughter of juslors pogrum against jue since the holicos followed by widestread public demonstrations in favor of the massocurring in favor of the terrase and gobinzic well we would you have to worry about how in tolerant you the american people are you might be is lamaphobic watch yourselves here is gobin last night no yere at home ret be onswor we can yer to maca is giving too much ocars and fuly racesm rise of an semitism romic phobia right here eric salsmen tensified in the wake of recent e vants he leg to the horrific thraks in the tacks of both sackus and break our hearts a coci sevent tar tack hav carerd deep scars an terrible memories anthe deish communi to day ei famlys worri about being tarkin in the school oin sinles o the face walking down the street e going out about the daily lives i now many of you in the mus on american conini the aboma the polistiny mm i soy others ar out ras an hardy sayisels her we goigan irs noma fobia an this tress weso i know that is mychef lorry to day i know that as as as the jewish people are under excistential threat in israel my deblury is that they are offended palsing in americans in america who are marching with cmoss flags i know that that is that is deeply worrying to me by the way what he saying about the jewish community in theunited states that is a hundr recentrael a every jue that i know in the state of flord is arming up every single one without exception i spent party yesterday to gunrange the entirity of people at the gunrange were orthodox chues all of them there is a reason for that andis because comosi call for goblterr and cause los cal for globlterror and there is a d h us notification that is gone out globily to basically everybody about the riseness and jobidan focussing talezar bem on what matters is lamaphobia as always cause americans t it were the rael problem were the rael problem the also made sure to point out that done he that that he lecturad israel agansomore ththis discommobulated speech it is supertis commot again a strong essage oul ben this israel is democracy israel is i juis stake israel deserves american support in the face of excistential jenisidal terrorism israel we will have american supporting the extermination of commass and everybody else better get thet f off the line aron and it is proxies therare evil and if they step off that line they will get cloch hard that they will not be able to walk in the morning that is the message because that will pusher on off to ball and 'll giv israel the space at ease to get rid of comas that could ha benth entire message last night instead he decided to midy the waters tons bat you crane and american is lama phobia and how he is een electure israel about not making the mistakes of nine eleven by the way thos mistakes of nine eleven hen me just point out that did not in clude america's destruction of the talaban and a'll kit an afganistad the reason he has to talk bou the mistakes of nine eleven is because of his mistake in reversing all of the progress made n afgannison by abandoning the place of the talaman but here he was trying to petend the big mistake of nine eleven was us sou no trying to kill uson ben lod and goinen depose the taliban thow is the ig mistake a what tells he talking about here osi is yesterday i a said that when america experienced the hell of nine eleven we s a rase as well awe sat an ga cussis we made mistakes si castin the govin of this of not to be blind an by rid not to be blinded by rage gulf a tikast take a long walk offa short pere blinded by rage yet your you are right that that is that is the message americans nen to terifon on eleven also when we watch three fous an american citizens being slaugher and people having to jump to their defts from the eighty eighth story to avoi being burned to death probably what what americans really needed was a message of you kno tickea the easy guis super insulting stuff now not agan not everything the president sai last night was bad him calling for the military aid to israel is necessary but the fact that he keeps muddying the waters in the middle east the only thing that matters is perception of strength it is literally the only thing the matters moral suations is not work in th middle east bappeals to western notions of liberal enlightenment and the individual worth of every human being those are things that do not work in themidle east pretending that they do is idiocy and the fact that bidan keeps going back to that well well if we just if we force israel to be kinder or ma concessions the pout if we give humanitarian aid to gaza that dude you knon't's going to stop cus bel off frm attacking it are not humanitarianade gaza but genisto cus beloff from attacking in the north is the notion that if they do israelwill be rearmed to the teeth and thos american mericraft carriers ogen nleache their power on cus bela that is going to stop cusbloff from doing the thing in the first place aaind it is jobidon has not has done a lot of good things since this conflict broke out last night speech was definitely definitely not one of them an a second e're gong to get to the aid package that jobidon is pushing naturally he is tempting to rap everything up and ball cannot have a bell passing through congrss these days that is not a crap

wit my best friend and co founder of the dlaware jermy boring it is terrific here is om the trailer a little over a year ago those tapes from cris rupo leaked of what was going on inside dis noty and you said we should do something which had launch into kit is content i wrote you back and said you do not know how to run a bna tt impossible what you what youthithin culd never possibly happen andthe i'd laid back and bed to go back to fleet for another forty minutes and as i sat there i thought tamit he is right i drive int to work by an hour theoo john leuisis his involved in the conversation and we have decided that were just going to dit were gan announce this initiative were gin ta change the direction of our company an a deeply profound way this is not launch in chocolates and we deside weud holthosta live town hall that day and i would announcethat to the world while announce in tar staff the daily wire was going to launch into kits intertainment with one hundred million dollar commentment that we are going to change the paradot and that is one to work or an's always great to talk to germy even if he is lost somewhere in europe listen to he whole conversation check it out on sunday i'll get meanwhile jobidin has put forward a bill this bill is at one hundred billion dollar bill now you might ask yourself how much of tat is afterl going to support material ad for israel since that is what we are really talking about yeres an emergency aid package for israel the answer is of that hundred billion dollars fourteen billion fourteen now listen it may be tha because the republicans could not hit the side tof the barn if they were trying to pea on it t that that they have to vote for this thing ait may be that because republicans hen you have a speaker thet the best of ail eloption because of the urgency of the situation and because israel meeds the edlic right tho hell now they need to be rearmed to destroy comass they need to be rearmed to to the to tork hasbala and prevent the region from spinding into a broader war that there may not be a choice but push for it which again just exposes republican and compatents in not having a speaker of the house was if they had to speaker of the house they could do they could separate these into individual bils and foure democrats to vote no on israel aid in order to get them to push an omnibus package which would expose the real lagenda here which is the omnibus package in any case wbut jobidins to actually proposing is hit one hundred and five billion dollar urgent funding request four the next year it includes sixty billion dollars for you crane now remember vary spent seventy five billion dollars on ou crane minnimum sixty billion dollars on you crane a lot of that is for replenishing us weapons stock piles ha have already been provided fourteen billion dollars for israomiffits of excitential threat ten billion dollars fore humanitarian efforts you might ask yourself what is that ten billion dollars for cumenitarn efforts i've beenassured by members of congress that is for gaza your word about a hundred million dollars being given to hammoss righte now in the midle of a terror war where they hold american citizens hostage get rady for ten billion dollars to be given to completely unreliable sources in the goze strip now what we can hope is that at least some of the senators republicans end democrats in the senate elactually prevent that aid from being deployed absen certain conditions in the bill we can hope and pray because the idiotic idea of giving israel fourteen billion dollars in millitary aid to destroy commoss and then giving the people on the other side ten billion dollars to re build all of the terrorist in for structure that israel jus destroyed is totallyinsane totally crazy givin billions of dollars to the paliseng an authority is totally nuts that is totally nuts again this bill is eight total craps sandwich now the bout stoption n only opsion may be toevote for it because again republicans have no leadership at all but if they did have leadership ther'ld be separating yeuse buils fourteen billion dollars is in theire for managing ou us mexical border and fighting fentinal trafficing seven billion dollars for the indo pacific regun wendn which includes tiwan of that one hundred and five billion dollars the actual amount that this buill should be theoretically is thirty five billion dollars fourteen build for israelt fourteen buill for the us mexical border and seven bill for tiwan that would be the stuff that is truly urgent right now nwhen it comes t ou crane i'm not surely unity sixty billion dollar allication obviously tobidn is trying to use americans good will for israel to cram down significantly more aid four u crane in the form of sixty more billion dollars to ou crane now again i'm in favor of more aid to u crane i am i'm not anti ad u crane however the situation you crane is not anything remotely the urgen cy of the situation with israel is the fact that bidin is trying to rap these two together in ord to get his u crane aid is pretty grows considering that again americans are pretty split on the future of ou crane ad absent o plan to exit that particular conflict an americans are not split at all on aid to israel bidon is trying to use good will for israel to cram through sixty billion dollars nad tou crane that is what is happening right now as i say it may be that the only opsions to vote or it becaus republicans do not even have a a speaker right now because of posturing idiots but that is what bidon is trying to do into really really cynical play speaking of white house stupidity yesterday the white house axually docx american forces not getting you a cuarne o fox news the white house took seriouslyn on social media thersday for posing an image of jobide meeting with u strups in israel without obscuring their identities the whie house o count to leaded the photosoon after sharing ou an instogram but twitter lash ex users re ripping biden steam for the dangerous mistake because i'm it yu do not want is four terrorist who know what your soldiers look is whi israel very oftenwill obscurer the nameis an identitiese and photos of its own soldiers in reall dangerous areas becaue the menut the territs identify them they try to kill them jobiden once again the t white house doing an amazing job day by day over there meanwhile speaking of the wite hus terng anamazing job it appears that the american federal government is honey combed with commas supporters according to huffington post a pece from akbar shahed acmed at the huffington post he has a piest titled mutiny brewing inside state department over israel palistine policy morral is low and some staffers are preparing to formally express their opposition to jobidon's approach according to officials now the sate partmenthas always been are a pository of ju hatred and arabist propaganda fors long as i'm alive the tate department has been anti israel in the extreme for ever nows just coming to the fore according to the huffington post officials told huff post that secretary state ancsny blinkoln and his most senior advicers are overlooking widespread internal frustration fine fire them fire them seriously it is what jo is twhat donnael trumpture to done when he came in sion of cleared out thestate dpartment fired every career staff on replace them with people harngarbage down trom did not do that i came back to bite him now tony blinkon shol do the same thing some department staff thaid they feel as if blinkon and his team are un interested in their own experts advice as they focus on supporting israels expanding operation and gaza there is basically a mutiny brewing within state at all levels one state departmen official said two officials told huff post diplomats are preparing whats called a dessent cable a document criticizing american for im pollicy thy goes to the agency's leaders thre ad protected internal channel now because it ispost be in a a internal channel 's must be secret naturally ther weekn get tothe media to try an undermine israel's war effort an america suport for that war effort the cable would come in the wake of josh poll veteran state departmen official announcing his resignation on wednesday he said he could not morally support thoug us as moves to supply isrel's wareffert quote in the last twenty for ours have bin getting an imense amounts of outreae from colleges with really encoraging words of supports andt e lot ofpeople saing they feel the tame way and it is very difficult for them tht of course of the state department official who just resigne and he resigne because he supports come oss in this war effectively speaking he does not want israel rearmed but do not worry the entire federal govrnment is honey combed with people more than four hundred caffita whole staffers are apparently calling for acees fire ind gaza again a a huffington postwriter game rowida obdalazes apparently muslem and jewish congressional staffers but by the way what they get is a few tokan wild left jews ware very interested in intersectionality signed the sort of stuff ask them one's last time tey had a shabotmeal when is the last time they had a kosermeal wen'sthe last time they the gave a crap bout israel and wielding your ethnic jewish identity in order to undermine jewish stafety all over the world is true garbage human being kind of stuff an theire a lot f people doing it from not in our name to jewish voices for piece all the recities jokers the letter which huff post has learned ma has been sime by four hundred eleven congressional staffers coms thay small handful of members speak out against the bide administrations approach to the conflict the letters has nation whidand and congress the voices calling for desclation and piece have been drowned out by those beating the tr ms of war as muslems and jews we are tired of her leaving re living generational fears of genacide and ethnic cleansing all are you i'm sorry that ou're tired i'm sorry thayou are tired of jus defending themselves after fifteen hundred of them are murdered raped kidnappet i i'm sorry that that tat makes you feel very sad in your in your cloistered pulkers in the cherished halls of our congress im that 'm sad for you you brave sols you who will not even sign in your letter by name your nonymously signingyour letting pathetic specimens and giant shock right there again meanwhile it is worth noting that the as govern actually hired a pro homas piello spokeswoman to handle asylum clames according to the daily wire is an investiget o report by lukroziac couple of days ago ous simigration in forceman agents he hired a spokeswoman for the piallo and put her in position to determined who gets asylum which seems canniscary shem lat you ight be oka with giving asylum two people who hate jews for example and hateamerica now the t chess officer is repeatedly posting pictures of commos terras paris shooting in with guns and writing f isrel and any jew who supports israel nusai leave worked in twenty sixteen ad twenty seventeen as a public affairs officer for the palsine delegations to the u s which served is the piello office in d c that officer then expelled from the country by the trumpedministration but good news she then secured a job at th chess as an asylum officer shis now an in judication officer for th u us citizenship an imigration services where she gets t determine who exactly gets to come in the country that does not seem dangerous at all she literally posted vidios mor picture's graphics of commasnec flying over all oxa with a a with with hangliders and guns to murder uknow dancers an shes working ford cha she still is far as i'm aware an oficy of members of congress rushing to th defence of thecomoscok is corrd bush is an aturing member of komoscock is yesterday sh treated out in defence of terr supportershud i to lead quote i denounce any action to centsur riciuta to leave the only palcinane american and congress these as lom of fobic and rase the stuffre turn antempto dis credit her perspective and scared those courageously speaking up for palston in human rites solidarity with my sister in service again intersectionality is one hell of a drog wit is more on the intersectional coalition in just one second first the benshvrsho is sponsered by grand canyon university un afordable private christian university with vibrint camps in beautiful phoenix arizona at's rank to top twenty in the country according to nistok kom g c ou is sobmissional christ senter university that strives to foster a culture of community giving an impat g sus goal is telp you develope into a servant leader who makes a diference through finding your purpos with three un herd thirty econemic programs on over two unasemndial line as of june twenty twenty three g c ou integrates the free market system with a welcoming christian world view into your bachelors masters or doctoral degree thou'l have support from your own university councilor who takes a personalized approach to helping you a cheeve your goals find your purpose a grand canyon university private christian affordable visit g c u dot e d u to day speing of the intersectional coalition i think everyone is excited to heare from gredat tunberg the idiot woman child who was trotted out by the media for years as the spokes person on be af o an entire generation she a she tweated out a photo of herself sang week two seventy to day we strike and solidarity with palistine and gaza the world leas you speak up and call for an immediate sees fire justice and freedom for palistinians tand all civilians effected she has tweated zero condemin commoss zero in support of his ralesvions zero thiis the picture of this moron holding a holding a card that is stand with gaza an behind her there is person holding a since is climate justice now it the picture of the palistinian flag because obviously if there is one group of people on plan eart who cares deeply about environmentalism it is the palistinians they they love invironmentalism which is why they burn ghine piles of traction t less bank without any regard for the environment damaging historic csites in the prosis they love it they love it why is that happening that is happening bes again the environmental movement the radical environmental movement of which reditoenburg is an intigral part intiral cog and she is an adult nous ie can make fun for f being the complete dim witted mooron she always was tat the fact that she as trotted out again as some sort of spokes person for generations ays more about the generation an less about the a the intelligence of the spokes person shouting how dare you at cameras and yelling at adults i understand that that is the left wing substitute for actual thought fut the fact that she exposes herself day by day for the complete mental mentally defunct person she is and morallice funk person she is should tell you something the reason for all of is is because the radical environmentalist movement was never ever about the environment it was never about that whose about the i ea the western civilization is at root evil and that is wy environmentalis ar siding with the palistinians that is why youre seing beelon side withthe palistinians that coalition is pretty damn telling again the red green axis the communis comeas axis is extraordinarily realin of course includes environmentalist as well that of course is bled down in to our schools because american schools from high schools to cologis have ben infused with exactly the same level of a morality and moral relitivism here is somnvidio from a san francisco high school is hare kids running through the halls in what appeers to be the worst remake of high school musical ever there the're running through the halls wearing terrar supporting outfits and shouting from the river to the sea palistine will be free i wonder how jewishtons the school feel fremember safety and feelings er safety only apply if you are a if youare not yuish apparently and not why those are those of the restrictions from the rver to the sea palistne will be fer betto is genisitlesloge because that you may notice that the river is the jordan river and th seeis the mediterranean sy the're talking for them thathisis a slogan that calls for the masslauhter of jews ii always one my favorite things is always seeing liberal minded young women wearing tang tops standing for the palistinians see of that goes in palis in palistonian control territory the othet goes for you ad the queers for palistine routine is one ofthe most ridiculous routines ever i saw ashally assign at my a and my speech then inigt universe afflorida and was the transfl ag collors that set on at free pallice and yeh try that in the goses stripens yet that goes for you y that that is all fun an games until they cut off your head ah but they gain it is not about that they they know that they know that they are not toldly stupid they understand that and they know that and the reason that they are doing it is because again the coalition isabout destroying institutions of the west and standing against the west and then they will figure out what to bild after when thy'fe to fight with each other in fact there are some fifteen hundred baarrea studens who walked out of school to demandises fair because this is the generation that we have trained which is you can be as ignorant and stupid as you want to be ande we will trea yuas a herosalongs you walk out of school we ave now created n entire system of students walking out of school to get less educated and be dumber and we reward them is what bealum was all about and now they are jutgingto carry that ford to whatever the next intersectional causes and today's intersectional cause is genicideold you hating terrorists re've aviv a palesthina remember the coalition of the sudo oppreset they are going to rise up and strike down whessrn civilization that is that is what this is that is what this is meanwhile it has of course bled up to our colleges as well as bled down from the colleges and blood up to the colleges as on yesterday a you see davis faculty adviser literally called for the murder of jews this was exciting stuff is to be gemo d kristo e sisten pro fessor of american studies undergraduate faculty adviser she wrote quote one group of people we have easy access to in the youass is all these ionest journalists who spread prop agans and mis in formation they have houses with addresses kids in school they can feare teir bosses but they should fure us more mogi of an ife emogi of an ax three iemogis of blooddrops that is an a sistent professor of american studies at a major american universityesponser by the state that is a threat of vat that islat incitement to violence obviously but and tha the question is why people feel comfortable post that stuff and now why people think yeople thinks people think eop ale things all the time why do they feel in university land that it is c etset that it is acceptable to post all the stuff and the answer is they feel it is acceptable because it is acceptable to post all the stuff a faculty senate statement put out by the staff at pen is pushing baff in favor of antisematism ther's from the faculty senate trichirs quote as try chairs of the university of pennsylvania faculty senate wee write to a frirm our commentment to freedom of fhought inquiry and speechors foundational value of our university the're talking here about support of comass we stand in solidary with all university of pensylvania faculty staff and students whose research work or study has been effected by the recent efforts of intimidation by intemidation they mean peoplewhare pulling their money from university of pennsylvania because they do not wish to subsidize terror support i all this culminated in a columbia professor last night going out to the lawn of columbia and telling parents stop sending your kids here and stop funding this university i ae a i ii iy iie i o all orr ta i ii w ia i ar i i a i r al a ii e ia o i i ii all o i i e wi ow i a a iei newe i et you a e our i wa iyiiry a verygintn a iverytii a in o ouni i w you all to morrow morn al ya aet iii ia i ta mi a i a arsto i ar gie an that will be the big question they will be the question again american sport for isral over all is very hig but university campassis are a disasterary the been disasterr for twenty years i wrote a book in two thousand for i was twenty years old talking about what isaster area the university camps is war int there'is an entire chapter about the anti zionist anti somatic garbage on college campsis wot people last at that this o what it was not matterwat happens on college campsis and the answer is they end up in the halls of power making policy for you and making the educationals decisions for your kids that is why it matters an meanwhile you non't be super helpful at this point i i got a say whe will be really really helpful at this point is of the republicans had a speaker of the house it might be really helpful you mig gablashy impact policy on a lot of these issues good news the republicans as alwaeys are busily just kicking themselves in the nots over and over and over according to the walstry journal republican speaker nomineate representive jem jordan wat set's fall short and authorid round evoting to secure the gavl on fridayeight morning which means there is basically no one left to run for speaker of the house and no prospect isto what the speaker of the houseis actually going to to be able to do at this pointe this is all going perfectly well i'm glad that the republicans initiated a circular firing squad in the middle of a very serious time then the number of clowns in positions to power in this country again clownishness is all well and good and it is all well and fine up until the point where life gets very very serious then it turns out that having clowns in charge of your country on every side is really bad policy and a coss lives presumbly this is one of the reasons why the pulling is now showing for example that jobi n is lagging donal trump in a wide variety on swing states he is down to biding his down to trump in georger by five he is down by trump to arizona in four he is down by two in wisconsin he is down by one in pennsylvania now remember trumpwelt actually have to win all of those trump and bitin are tide in in michigan seems unlikely but all of that very very close now again it would be who republicans to think whether trump is still the strongest candidate given the fact that oneof the big breaking newspieces here is that sidney powell who you remember as the crack in releasing lady you remember that that crazy lady when he is doing about itwsthe voting machines that were hacked an all the kentegarbage and resick she will she is gotin release the crack and a all the idiots from from november eighth to a to january sext the're all al my god she she is she is about to release all the evidence the sho e and not none of govern materializen the tion of being sued into the ground whell now it turns out but she has cut a stunning pleads ial in the georgia election subversion case on the eve of her trial which means she is now going to testify presumably against donald trump in that georgia election trial that that all is going to be wonderful what could she testify about well she is dint attend to white house meeting in december of twenty twenty where some of trumps most extreme support is encouraged him to name her as ha special council wto investigate supposed voter fraud michael flin was there was rudy the plee documents make cleare she is expected to testify about her direct involvement in the breach of election systems in coffee county georgia as well and what exactly trump was doing in how he was involved none of this is good news for trump in a serious time cerious candidates would be a very very good thing already coming up we are gon t be join by igiff major general yahko imen thror hi's formerly the anessa to the prime minister of israel he is goingto give us the latest from the

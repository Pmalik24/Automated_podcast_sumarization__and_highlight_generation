the first re publican dbate is to night we examine all the candidate strategies one of donal trumps former employes slips on him in florida and trobidan apparently went to sleep at a memorial service for victims of the mallywild fire i'm bentuur of thisis ventshburo sho tay showsponserback press ve p m thousands of my listers v already secured ter nertata join them n express vepianzi cam slash men it is to night the fight for second place in the republican pit is big republican nomination battle to night except the donal trump is not on the stage is that going to hurt him in any real wayi means certainly noken i herd him in the poles given the fact that he is curnently leading the race by some forty points over the rest of the field combine the current pulling status right now according to the real clopoltics palling average has donal trump wi fifty five per cent and as ronto santis at fourteen per cent the vak gromas uomiats seven point two per cent biht pens at for nickyhali at three nixs tims got at three cristy at three and then every one else including the innevitable dug burgham the absolutely unstopable force that is dug burgham at below one per cent what is this mean what means that pretty much everybody on the stage to night is going to be attacking ronto santis and that includes the trump campaign the trump campagn already to day put out a puta a plack ar a bingo card for ronto sanctomanis te sangto and margery tailor green put out this the sanctoman is to bate night bango it just shows you who teeme trump fears because really they look at that field and they say there is really only one candidate there who could theoretically threaten donal trump that is true in the early states by the way in the current iwo pulling he is within shouting distance of donal trump and it is still very early remember it is still august the first caucses are not until january lhoh can happen in allwhat does happen on daily bases in poltics a lot can happen between late august and lae january which is when those first iwalcaucuses are trump is basely trying to take out to santis early he he is putting all of his focus on to santis none on any of the other candidates margery tailor green put out a a bingo card for debate night it is entirely about to santis it is entirely about to santis and it shows you the nature of the attacks on to santis byteen trump there is not a single attack on a single ronasantus policy not one now as agans or revotor i find the sort ofthing insulting i verynew attack other con servatives on stage you should pobly do it over their policies if ronta santis were to make a trump debate night bango of trumper to take part in the dobate it would take things it gave a medal to anthony fouchy did not call in the national gard during mass riding in twenty twenty spend seven trollian dollars his last yurn offite ray there tere's a a bunch of stuff that he could the biggest one of course would be lost to jobidon in twenty twenty wich lget two in just a second butt if you look at the bingo card that trumpet out about to santis i understand that a lot of trump supporters find the sort of thing charming and they think that this sort of kitchen sink attack tells againt sdemocrats and republicans it told the gans ciller clintn cas hiller clint was alreadyo deeply on popular withthe american people weill see if it works but hurous hereis con of the bingo card here some ofthe things at first wall if it parrots left wing lies it says things ron defend slavery that is a left wing lie ronisantus has never defended slavery it is just a lie it says things nervous laugh wipes snot gaslight covid record o gehe is not gaslet his cover record ronisantus had the strongest coved record of any governor in america things ron backsdown saved by fox noews dismissis pole end of the day gay leg the whole thing is just designe to to can a sneer at the santis which is trumps utter strateger but he has a seventh grate strategy when it comes to going after his ponents by the way it works in seven grat and a works in twenty sixteen there is no reason to think it culn't work now he use a very similar strategy with rid crut bush he is very similar strategy with a grin to little marca he is a very similar strategy with great to lin tad right s o him doing it to ronisantis is not exactly a shock but it shows you were trums focusis trumps the front runner this battle still believ the're not is a two man race even though the santis is campan has not caught fire in any way shape or form a's of yet will the debate to night it is going t be odd because trump is not on the stage which means as we say some one else is going to try to take down to stantus and tryed to supplant the santis as the other possibility in the re publican primaries because again forty five per cent ofthe vote is still up for grabs even at at least at least rightin its it is early theoretically to be above fifty the debate stage is filled with people who should not be on the debate stage that includes people again including a sa hutchinson the way tat hutchinson got on the stage known cars about asa hutchinson don trump is certainly riht about dowt n is ada hutchinsin nut andverm ebehert that is true a shutchinson has no place on the ebate stge he is pulling below canser right now in the republican primaries but he was able to qualify four of the debage by essentially going to people and asking them to work around the the rules because one of the one of the requirements of getting on te stage is that you have to have forty thousand owners what did he do way got hundreds of college students to donnate one dollar and then they were given twenty dollars a pop for every family member friend or acquaintance they could persuade to do not ate one dollar totchinson the smmer sy gout a punch big doners given to money then he took that money and he plowged it into giving it a way to people to donnate back to him one dollar see he getsto that forty thousand mark there are other campaigns that did something similar this is ridiculous a gat again that the people on the debate stage the truth is that there are approximately six serious people on thedebate stage maby maybe it is really more five and that that that debate stage is filled with with no names who should not be on the stage am he dug burgham on the stage is give me up brake whe gets more on this in just one second first that is alli my sleep quality it is sucked last night lie welst because my little baby onfortunately has some congestion again which means that he was up between the hours of three and five which was a good time from with me and my wife but what didn it mean it mends that once again i relied on my helick sleep mattress to save the day i required sleep in the hours when i's on that mattres cn be tossing an turning can feeld un comfortable that is wha i'm glad that i have thi mattress made specifically for me well now he loks mattress has thei're best versin yet the helicks eleet he loioks his harnesse years of exstensive mattress expert hees to bring their customers are truly elevated sleep experience that helik to leek collection includes sixsdifferent mattress motels each taylor for specific sleep positions and from dis preferences i've had that helik sleep mattress for as i say seven or eght years it is great it is firm it is breathable that is count what i need from a mattress if its tusoss to get back pagn if it is not bereathe bull i ten to heat up at night heliks o nows that which is why they sent me the best mattress for me go to helik sleep out comslie fending get the tbest mattress for you with that two minutes sleep clos find that perfect mattress in honor of laberday heloiok is offering twenty five percents off all mattressorters pluss two three pillows for my listeners go to helick sleep d out comslichsmen heugh's cot helicks partner twenty five is the best offer yet it is not going to last long with helicks better sleep starts right this very instant o case su what exactly do the candidates on stage have to do well the cantsrg goes through each candidate and we are going to establish thei're goals for to ngh kno as i say the entired to bate is going to be about attacking to cantus swhich means that basically rontosantis first cound of taskure is survive he has to make sure that he is zum not the person who is the subject of all the hadlines tomorrow for all the attacks against him mean as we are seeing in the pulling data disantis has been experiencing e rather marked tecline in the pulling data s i said a few weeks to go tha he is basily stagnent since june her but the reality is that in that real crpolitics pulling average he has lost momentum if he look that re publican nomination real cropolitics pulling average it shows that in april he is it twenty four per cent he basically maintain that all the way through june and then since june he is dropped in the real cropolitics pulling average from bout twenty four percent all thewy down t about fourteen persent which is significant trop by the way that' support largele went two donal trump some of it went ou ther candidates a lot of it once donal trump which means that hees to do a cuple of things has to fend off all tepeople who can be attacking him to ight trying to can ta finish his campaign and yes to regain is mojo the only way to do that truly is that he has to make the case that republicans have failed to make which is why donal trump is leading the pulling by leaps an downs he es to make the case that he should be the nominy and not trump he not trump is part of that case the notion the you could can a citicide and say i should be the nominy and never dis cuss trump that is obviously nothe case trump is trusing right now somebody is can have to make the casis to wyet should not be trump it seems the're really only two attack lines as to why it shoudn't be trump at tack line number one is that trump was not is great a precident as people want him to have been the trump ded a lot o god things that be he appointed good con servative justices iy showed me i din thin he is cin do that and he did that which is certainly true he move the embassy to jerusalem he created pesteals in themidle east that booming economy but he also did not bild the border wall despite all of his promises to do he did not do anything about the mass rioting in america's major cities troughout twenty twenty he em power danthan he foutyu to basically run his covet polisy and put out a completely confused and dis combobulated policy with regard to covit in whch ho was both ripping brying cemp for reopening gjeor rup and then ripping states michigan for not reopening down trum spent more money in the last years oif his ad ministration than any present histry by leaps an bounds a all of those things would be th case that can make against trump if you say i'll be abetter president than trumpwill be the problem is that is having really no impact on the republican voting base the republican voting base in the primaries seemis not to care very much about what people do it care's much more about what people say and even more importantly about the attitudinal origantation toward the left whoever i seen as sort of the most provocative the person who seen is the hardest puncher is the person the republican base ones and the re publican bays seems to equate saying things with doing things which is wy your seemg tovake rise and to santis to cline the santis is done all the things the the vague talks about doing in florida but it does not seem that is having a market impacts on the rate in favor of the santis a sanswill passa bill fighting woke in the state of florida the vacal rite a book about fighting wok and the base treats those two things is exactly equivolent and av point number one which is i should be the guiy and not trump because trump under performed as president particularly n is last year the republican base does not seem to want that one which leaves you with the electability argument now the electability argument under normal circumstances for to santis would be a pretty easy argumen after all if you look at ronisancs is electability numbers that dued one the state of florda which used to be a prurple state by twenty points a if you' take a look at florida voter's registration in december of twenty eighteen democrats had a voter registration adge of two hundred fifty seven thousand by august of twenty twenty three the republicans had a voter registration edge in the say to florida by five hundred and sixty eight thousand that is not eight hundred and twenty two thousand voter registration twing and's a massive massive shift crated by to santis and by the republican party of florida and ye could look at that and they couldlook at trump andtey guet taylisen trump does not pull well he is polling at best tat even with jobidon that is not a great number considering that jobidon is a very unpopular president i're not blowing by an out of the water but thats because nobody knows by name yet i have not assue run a general election campanien now here is the thing in order for do sancis to make this case he has to say the thing than many republicans have fered to say because trump has been lawing since november of twenty twenty when he said that he actually won the election he did not actually win the election there is no metric by which he actually won the election in fact to santis could theoretically make a twopar case one i one my governor's rase by twenty points donal trump wea we do not know we do not know other i'd beat gjobidon what we do not is that jobidon beat donald trump hou'd actually have to say that because there is no other way round this i mean that is just the reality if you do not want trump to be the nomineede you cannot say that he beat bidon already if you say that he beat by an already than why would not yu nominate donald trump on the electability argment the electability argumen has zero legs unles you make the case that trump is not electable and that we have proof that he is not electable because not only did he under performan twenty eightee n with congressional candidate but he actively lost to the man who is currently runting for presidents on the other side in twenty twenty and you can point out all of the flaws in the election all the voting procedures all the mailing all all that stuff is true but donal trump did lose you jobiden in twenty twenty do you want to rerun that race furthermore if you believethit is donald trumpsize that he was jobbed out of it donal trumpes provided no plans wafturally win in twenty twenty four if he says the election was stolen even if you grant that what is his plan to unsteel the election of twenty twenty fwore he was president in twenty twent he are not president now which means he has no control over the leavers are power much thathese being currently in bated in four separate turisdictions an that is the case that de santus could make now is that going to be a case that the republican party baseis going to take up well if it is not then to sancs has a trot and no one else does heither if the republican party base believes the donal trump clearly and convincingly on in twenty twenty the electibility argument does not exist and as far as the i'd be about a president them trump the republican partybasin bin that in either then there is no argument against trmp do santis is going to have to make at least that latter case that he is more electable then donal trump the big obstacle to night for to santus to that the santis does not have a history of being amazing n tobate he is actiol pretty good one on one with members the media whenh gets combat iv but his debates with andrgillum he was not a stubbler debater by any stretch of the imagination here in the state of floridup in th th the rap on to santis and you can see teem trump seem to i will say the fat trump the othe somth grat insults he is very good them but it is noncious that he is good at them if ever argued with the seventhgrater they have extraordinary ability they ook u an ex men ability to target your weakest and most vulnerable spot and then say ite at is the thing that they always do or they pick the thing about you now you have a bald spot all you hve a lolebe of fat aroun yourabut things that are if irrefutable irrelevant and stupidt but irrefutable the media ar picking up on this the rap on to santus to night is goin to be no personality which is which is trumps rap on him a sweatyeeating putty putting with his fingers andall the res f it this is mek a bruzinsks think now i should point out here the media have a heavy rooding interest in donal trump and to night the media coverage almost regardless what happens is going to be about a terrible to santus was suth jus the prediction right now but here is make a bruzinsky laying out ther personality lading case against to santus now balls i mad morean a have to iteren't ou between now an fi nit gat a personality i'm serry ah i mean ow is a not of be sa

theother candidites in the race include vor vak romaswammis tof vake has made a what they ould alli dramatic pulling rise a dramatic pulling rise in in the case of everybody who is not trum involves moving from basiclys euro per cent to approximately seven per cent which his movement forvake no question now the vake is going to be in attack dog on the stage because he really has nothing to lose trump is leaving him absolutely alone trump does not care about romas womming trump is perfectly happinto see romas wammy rise he knows that romswammy's not only not a threat to him he refuses to cross him there is pre gould vidyo going around yesterday showing howv a vake has changed his position multable tomes on wether trum should debate went from trump is definaly going to baby's brave to well trump should debate to well i do not care trum to bates pretty quickly now the tvis ging to be the rap on on ve vak writ ve vakes in coming he has two tas his is task to night i's to a loud to chancis to be the target sit he is not the target and really again he has nothing to loose causehe not a politicion as salliny he has a political office to defend it is not as though he is running a simultaneous race it is not as though he is expected to even be in the race of this point the vake is having most fun of anybody on th campaign trell me the jude's releasing shirtless videos of himself plaing tennis and saying this is tis debate prap and all the rest the rap that he is hm o take to night is that he switcher's positions a lot and then he goes on media and hn he denies the ever took that position his seting bretbarrows pointing out last night here is bret barron fox news talking about romaswommy denying something that he pretty clearly said and one of the things that i con t do with the ex presso the out it states is restore true in government for fat candidate clettical outfigder and now he has climbed in the poles o bat and hi's taken a lot of incom y his massu and he is come back toit to dan an the gam is that we can ham dld the truth the government should be more truthful for us with us i think it is some of thise interviews he get caught o and the nine eleven de tour ah hes explained it to day but no he said that was not the quot that he saidan than you play the quo aton a glaic i i think that ah he is very smooth we will see how that translates on t stage and in or aftir with other camdidate who may be try to go after ham as he climbs in the pules right that is con be the inthe incoming for for vavake is goingto be his inconsistence his switching of positions and all the rest but all he really has to do is survive and hope that the sancis takes all the incoming meanwhile the pure a gresshon machine on the stage is chris christy at chris christy right now is pulling shockingly well in new hampshire the latest pull from emerson has him in second plac in new hampshire at fourteen per cent he does not really bear any chance is an iwa but if he can compete in new hampshire his hope is that that will knock down trump may be somebody elsewen's iwa he wins new hampshire and then by the time he gets to south carolina may be it isto more open race now i do not think that is the way this race shaped ups i think that unless one candidate when is both i want and new hampshire trump whipes clean the table come south carolina and the rest of the race sof there is a splipt betwen iwhen now hampshire then basilay this thing looks it goes the way that twenty sixteendid when cruws one iwa trump one new hampshire but not bylic leaps hin bownce an then he white the floor with everybody else i think that you you will you will see something that christy has a history of just being basically as su side momeron the stage he did to marco rubyo he will be the one who says the meanest thing sait as sancis 'll be the one who says the meanest things about trump now that we will give both trum that ther'l both give to santis and vivake the abilli you would gafter christy christy will take incoming on the basis that he is the due to his hugging obama that he was the guy who was basely fetching water for donald trump up until the point where he decided that he lec donald trump any more that he is a person is willing to do anything and say anything in orderto get his time on emas and be see in all the rest he will be taking some in coming as well this leaves two other candidates on the tage both of whom ar well qualified and pulling at near nothing they are both pulling at three there is three other candidates such pence wet's no shot at the nomination because the republican base dos nolic pence because trump decided that pence was a trater for no apparent reason because he was fibbing about bout pence is billi yto overthrow the election pencewill be on the stage he will be taking the sort of classyeor christy position which has donald trumpshoun be present ent because of his positions on the election and because o the things that he is said a's ow can be pretictuarly popular but i also think that pence is not kingto be the one taking in coming halyan scot are the other to on the stage we will get to halean scot in just one second first let us talk about your employes we havent employ here let us call him jonesy and tha he is in my ear pretty much every morning telling me that the clips i ready everything's great and and yet and i pek him literally every morning and yet every time i glup to nashvill he introduces himself to me as though i have never met him and have no idea who he is the first time it was kind of charming the eleventh time i started's wonder if jones he had some form of short cermemory loss leffy if you are wondering if your employs have short rormemory losson and

dailyware again that ziprogrordi com slash dailywar zipigreters indeed the smartest way to hire o gay the last two candidates on the stage are ar haley and scott i'm not speaking about pens very much heir because i do not think that pens really has a rollon stage ocept to make the former case the tde santis campmake which is that trumps should not be preseet entof the united states because of his moral short comings again that one is not kinto be popular with the republican base at all which means that pens is theoratically going to take in coming trum people who are defending trump on the stage nellison you are not goin to make a lot o head wak whith the trump bays by defending trump on the stage it is a great thing for avake to do ri thay can do that if he is running for vice president or something nicky haley andtim scott are both on the stge both of them are basically stuck in their lane nicky haley is is stuck in the traditional republican lane that thrisional re publican lang is basely fragmenting in in a large number of ways it is being broken up between scott and pens and haley and some to santis a little bit criscristy and tat is why she is currently pulling in the threet prosantring the reality is that that the case that haley and scottney to make is going to be a case agains to santis because for halean scott if they bumper car each other and if they bumper cart to santis trumps the nominae wright now the field is not consolidating if the field stays not consolidateded trump walks with thirty five persunder the vote the case that haley and scottercan need to make is why they should be on the station the other one sion not sown me surprised to see nickyhaleantim scotkl at it a little bit to night in thes particular to bate meanwhile trump is just avoiding the whole thing which as i say he' shured debate just on principal bot is it a smart thing to ivite the shur why not amy h's leading by forty points he is also whining an dining all the journalist again the one the great lies about the trumpet yeuro is that the media and trump we are in a complete hate hate relationship it is not true to love hate relationship yes the media hate trump trumpates the media also everys often to have a passionate flang that is passionate flingstend to happen directly around election time in the re publican primaris not the general in the primaries that is about the time the media fall back in lob with covering trump becauses he is ratings the duty is radings gold he knows he is rading scold they know he is rading scold which is wy according to politico teem trump is whining and dining a number of topereporters at a stake cost called rare and passing out putting snack packs again this is likey the p curile attacks on assantis based on a in un substantiated story about to santits once eating putting with his fingers or something who is there here is a list of the reporters who are there you aready danabash shin golmocker criston walker bob costot fin golmaz dosha burns richel scot rik cline josh dalsy rob crelly maria parker and david chalayan along with a bunch of campain surregutes crislevieta lus vida and adjason miller i'm yacht you can see le team trump whining and dicting the samedia that they say are the enemy pretty obvious what is happening right out also they are still attempting to get their surregutes into the spin rooms that they can just crap all over the candidates suspect iffact to their candidate in uven sho up kemberly gilfoil who is a the paramor of donald trump junior lew she is going to show up and she says let them try to stop me from coming to tedebate while im inchin come to thebate but weather she is let into the spin rom is really up to fox news channel we will see a fox news runs this debate with regard to trump it will be kind of fascinating to watch those dynamics in fact fox news actually sent out believe it or not a debate guide for the mediat to cover this thing they are are their mines they are out of their mines i got a point this out o case here is what they say this is nuts a they say that during these sevenday period describe during the bapelob me during the timebalow meating seven days from the date of the debate and on no media outlet can yare more than a total of three minutes of e excrpts from the debate in any one program including vidio an audio they areare their mines that is totally crazy the're treating this a football game or abaseball game which is nuts o cave that is nuts this is newsworthe material involving the presidential candidates the people who are gon a represent you at the top levels of american government and fox news is saying thet you are not allowed to hear from them unless you watche the debate live or unless you are watching fox news that is totally crazy that' totally crazyat means that when people me recap the debate and explains you what happened in the debate last night fox news is now threatening to people me if i play you four minutes of the debate tomorrow despite the fact that mi show would bring them an extraordinary number of people who are who areof yours and listeners to them to take a look at their next tebate an how the owlow's anybody suppose to actually figure out what happen in thebate less they watched the thing live understand they'e now trying to telescope all viewership on fox news to the debate itshelf but good luck with this i mean just really ridiculous ridiculous stuff they say that you can only use the debate are ecerpts there of on the inenut by way of the imbed vidio function at fox news dot com vidio i'm that this is that is totally wild stuff between the arons he is handling in this debate and fox news is handling of this debate i got a tell you i am i'm just i'm dum founded you wish to you wish to actively let people know that you are debate is importantand you are doing by blacking it out essentially from any place that is not fox news live that is that is a wild thing to do truly wild what fox is doing right now actually helps trump and it helps tucker ironically because by restricting the ability of other people to engage with the news making that they are doing in this debate this gives a leg up to trump an tuck ar are putting all the stuff out for free on ex slash witter and ussoves now vailable to every one which gives trump a leg up in trms of yiewership and fox news a leg down i understand that fox is trying to grip harder and harder to its declining userbase but i got say this should be relevant information fairy use classic fair use kind of stuff for consertives all over the country for fox ter strict to access to your ability to listen to clipse of the debate with commentary which is the normal way that fair use works threatening litigation against everybody else is fredy insane i cam meanwhile we will we will see whether trumps ditching of the debate has any impact on him in places ia i o governor com renalds he is been a target of trums ir she says that voters do expect trumps to show up and actually be there ti ti ti in cat from owen o oth no i tin i dot i i in to be er i enin er act i wen in er act with all if a can e ta i we ha we ra turn out i o air fi tat i had a lot of i wen tin people up i i fate come up an o ti ti i ti in in at i i ra o e canedy iy ir an a cannedate an ti we no i wi tik very ar win e a ow is o all an i wan iiner act with the candedate naw we will find out whether that is true or not meanwhile donald trump is gin a counter programm the debate with ha pretaped interview with tucker carlson on twitter again i think we have seen interviews with donal trump and tucker before now i do not think he will be particularly illuminating or or fascinating in anyway but it is smart of tucker and smart of trump ye get give credit where credit is due in troms the medea business and then meanwhile he is gtin a counter programm the aftermath of the debate by getting arrested in georgia he has to turn himself into arrest in georgia he had up until the twenty fifth to do it he is tiding tud on the twenty fourth ou assume in order to counter programn the debate fall out frum to nighte drujulyon he was arrested to day in georgia rudy of course was his lawyer one of his lawyers throughout the election deboccel and post election in which rudy was making claims about voting machines being hacked and all the rest of the sort of stuff making accusations about particular fultan county employes who hehethen under a tract those comments s that he would be sued into te ground i here is rudy's comments upon being arrested out should realy be arrested for his failed legal stratagems it seems to me and many of those failed legal stratagems fall squarely in the rom of free speech hore was juliani but to george i feeling very very goo aout o e a a feelik o to anin o mi to all amori s as i di many time ta er an i sti o turn te to lik to sam diver a sam rudy yulin ot i o o amo e win mear sityther thin to sitin in amarier e due crime when than any may history anystr anywhere and'frinting for juff g wether or not yond that is true the fact is that the counter programming here is going to be re publican's feeling that team trump is victimize that is the entire stick here and it is kind of true but this is why again the case thats can have to mane on tach by somebody is that trump is not going to beet bidon that is the only case anye other candidatecan make now again the twenty sixteen says that you do not know and thats true yo do not know however if you are making the case against donal trumping electable donal trump losing in twenty twenty plus for indictments does not he lay ount see how donal trump electoral results twenty twenty pluss for indictments means that trump performs wildly better than he did in twenty twenty you just have to assume that jobidon would perform marketly worse than he did in twenty twenty ge well meanwhile n trump is as we say he is going to be showing up for rest to morrow apparently there is a an open betting pool on how much trump is going to weig inat se pople r trying to figu ated how much how much trump ways i gess the overrunders in the two seventies having that tiving he is probably in the two forter to fifties but in any case a the a the the trump is fasing hom additional legal challenges according to new filings frum special counsil jacksmith this wouldbin the washington d c case which again is a mischarge one of trumps employese a marlogo has now flip atapparently is testifying against the former president according to rying vadrate daily wire the employe i dentifieding quortzoccuments as trump employty four qcuickly changed his granjury testimony a for meetng with the lawyer from the federal defender's office in washington to c he said he no longer want to be represented by trump's political action committee a person who is recommended him by trumps lawyer the revelation was made in a cortfiing frumsmith's team in response to you uss district cort judge ilean cannon that is the federal judge over seeing in the case achaly this is not in the dc case this of the florida classfied document's case which again is a political prosecution but also is better founded legally than any the other prosecutions apparently during te in vestigations the government gathered evidence that trump employ carlos do oli viera tried to enlist the director of in formation tacnowlogy farma formarlogo o delea marlogla security footage after the granjery in the d c had issueda sepena for the footage theuus cumman approach standley woodward the lawyer representing trump employ umber fort to notify him had a potential conflict by representing with him and wallmata that is the trump eight accused of obstructing granjury investigation mister woodward responded he would not have a reasonablievf his con current representastion of trump employ for and nota raised a conflict ofvinterest when trump em ploy fort testified beforthe granjury in d c in march twenty twenty three he repeatedly denied or claim nots or call any contact or conversations about security footage apparently the goverment's evidents indicated that this testimony was false troscur's in forp trump employ he was the target of the granjury investigation this guy apparently didn' wantgo jail and to noi he is a flipping lawyers an he is going to testify that people at trumps direction were destroying security footage s again that tha the most serious case tho trumfases on a legal level is not the george cases not that he c case not the york case it is actually that floridi case meanwhile trump's legal teem's experiencing a number of set back sdavid shape for former chairman of the george republican party one of the nineteen defendenes in the georgea election nterference case is now clemingin cortfiling ce and othe republican electors who trid to certify trump is the winner in georgia where acting directly at trumps behast this may signal that again more people whore in trumps orbet are ready to flip on him legally to avoid jail time themselves which is one ofthe things that comes in to play when donal trump does not pay your legal bills i it turns out that the their bunch peoplel up ton including gen allis whos legal bills are not being paid by the former president of the united states that is a major danger for the present the former president of the united states agan meanwhile speing of legal troubles hunterbidon continues to get himself in legal troublwill bring you the latest on that

are team visit daily wiredo com slash careers that is daily wire do com slash careers to day o meanwhile as pety much the entire world is focast ind on the republicans the demograds are doing a a terrible job mean jobidon is doing a truly awful job and obviously heis stone broiled with all the hunter question over his trip to mally the media tried their basts do clean up see an ends bill weir was big bid an fan he suggested that jobide was empifies ar in chief which is weard because typically when i to empathy i do not go to you nowt place whre people watch the relatives burn to death then talk about withat one time i there is kitchen fire in my kitchen im but apparently coing bill weir jobidncs te mazing at thus local fere workin clasmatowins multi generational locals i worried of tezaster capitalis people moving in to exploit this and by up is much lan is they can in this paradis an rebuildit frgarintrus is well president says promises that tat that will not happen and remains to be seeing r's a lot of forces a play here rigt now he did service empathiserin chief after five days or being mostly silent on tiou publicly wbut the governor that he was working behind the scemes to e sure a first responders that thethans had ther back on this old man who can barely walk serves as empathizer in chief while telling people about that one time there is a kitchen fire that is put out in twenty minutes also big controversy of the day is whether jobi nactually fellow sleep at the amalwy wildfire memorial service this dil not be the first time that he appeared to not off in the middle of a service the medio were doing the best to spin this as know he was just being solemn ah yah i i do not now man i don now we are at relive on family on hon that is sleep breathing right there wither my on wy french and he wakes himself up that is sleep reything and en you can see his chest moving up and now by the way that is the deep breathing that you get right when you'r i the iddle verencychle right there y the chance is that jobidon was just super solemn right there is sopposed to he briefly notted off becaus in eight year old man and he has not had his early burdinner yet and justic a flight i that do not worry guides he is his vuro and wonderful and empathetic as ever he is not the kind of gi who had check his watch repeatedly during a a service for a fallin marines or something he did that when they brougt the body back from auged annistand mewhile the hunter bidan stuff is not going away it is going o get worst because jobinen has spent literally his entire carer in riching his family on the back of his political power it is a thing he has done he is entire career i'm working on an entire companion in the stuffer now its taking me a long time mean every one around jobidon is richer because jobdon was in politics and because presumably he was offering favors on their behalf a pretty obviously that includes his brothers frank an jim that includes his sister vow anincludes his sons hunter and bo and all of these people have benefited by their very close proximity to the senter and then v p and then presidents of the united states according to the walstry tournalmn yus relations with china were stedy in december twenty thirteen when then vice president jobdon stepped off air fore stuin bation with the seemingly unre markable companion his son hunter days later chenghoh authorities to prove the formation of investment boutik under written by the chiney'se government then named hunter bidon as a director and thet er cought him an ownership share to discounted price roughly formon staffword o began earning up to one million dollars the annually for sitting on the bricmaboard the younger bidon's business activities loom larger than ever a decate after that trip tith president bidon seeking reelection as a grinding deo ja investigation and a determined proe byk congressionl republicans scrutinized were hunter bine made money over sees and what exactly he got paid to do now it is funny is that they say tings no evidence has emerged to sho pressen and bin benefited from his sons international commercial endeavors now i i just i'm i'm wondering why you would say that again if i do you a favor andthen your favor back to me is that you give my kids a rap load of money i benefited it is my kids i'm i'm confused as to the idea that jobidn has to personally cash the chack in order to benefit from this sort of thing it is it is it is sort of bazar now hunter bidon between twenty fourteen and tweny nineteen company's a sociated with hunter bid ing cla twenty million dollars hunter biden personally made clear up to seven million dollars during that time he is a drug added a drug addicted deerolic one of the worst people in american public life and whose polling down bookobuchs because of his last name and yet everybody knows this that is the part this truly astonishing about this it is not as though this is a giant secret everybody knows this including members of his own family mean literally hunter said that his last name was gold to foreign vesters admitting that his father's job qut open doors that would not be opened up to other people jim used to tell potential business partners what we got people all round the world to want to invest in jobidon frank jofs otherbrother called the bide nam made tremendous asset for business val says quot i had a better seat at the table because my brother is at the head of the tlic he is a he is a penny anty racket theer jobidon for his family he has always been this ever since he was in delaware which again is a small business run state meanwhile rear learning now thanks to an in vestigation by luke roziack over it dailywire that hunterbidon's business partner used the federal position he was handed during ye obomi ad ministration to corting eastern european company whose bored hunter was eager to join according to abach vemailes obtained buy the dailywar through a flayer request eric schweran was appointed to thecommission for the preservation of americas teridage abroad by brokobom in march twenty fifteen that appointment gaveschwarand who ise managing director of hunters now disolve form the ability to present himself as he as official negotiat with eastern european huntries about the preservation of holcost yeer cemeteries and bry moneiy to the table to fun those preservation projects raise from private businesses and individuals and he attempted oget a loian bank acknowledged on a plak on a commission project during the sa month hunter was seeking a boartzt at that exact same company agood stuff as always from the jobidon and hunter bidon team up it is all going just amazing meanwhile the economy continues to be down in the dumps as i've said before what goes up must come down things are coming down both dick sportin goods a goods and macees our flashing warning signs on consumer spending basily consumer spending his

worth while notting the warning crane has utterly bogdown which er was bound to do because nobody has an incentive given the current an cent of structure t actually figure out a deal according to the ner time's big fan of the wor ou cranes grinding counter offensiv is struggling to break through in trench trussian defences in large part because it has too many troops including some of its best combat units in the wrong places according t both american and other western officials mordyour crani an forced on your bochmoot and other cities in the east then they are near meletopol and burdions

structure for as lencegy to cutdeo and they provided no alfram for booton tso cut a deal meanwhile you ask chinatentions r increasing as the chines economy begins to sink the consumer economy is going to sink as well onces again joviding doing justaspectacular job a can meanwhile the the lefts use of wawfare at this point is utterly out of control i'm in completely out of control whether you are talking about the wild innightments being brought by the manhatton d against on trump or whethe youre talking about this latest insanity the d c atturny generals apparently now proping lenard leo it is a full disclosure we kno leonar leo here at the daily ware we think that he is one extraordinary work with regard to federaless society it is leonar leo whos largely responsible for the cultivation of an originalist bench that has alowed for the selection of justices to the supreme cort ifyou what non trom pick for the springcort that is lenard leo hoactually did it then will nole washington to see attorney general brine schwallb is investigating judicial act vis lenared leo and is network of non profits goring to a personent direct knowledge of the brobe the scope of the investigation is on clear but a comes after political reported in march that one of leonard leofs non profits registered as to charity pait is four profit commany tens of millions f dollars in the two years since he joined the company a few weng later ap progress of wash strog group files complaint with the deceaturing general and ir rass requesting a probinto what services were provided well i mean this sort ofstuff actually does happen on a fairly regular basis of course it is never replied to say the hillory clenton foundation whenever you 've a non profit that pays private contractors this appensall the time ever tem me go to a big non profit event thenon profited to pith catorer for example david rivcan an attorney for the parties in th investigation the complaint i slopy deceptive legally floud where dessing this fully with the dc atterny general's office and what this really is about is trying to scare a bunch of conservatives from involving themselves in conservative politics is trying get doners out of business leograns ou interviews going to politico he featured a two part pok has wen main wire conserved news organization leosided his commantment to defend the constitution as the as the reality of wy people are going after him this of course is largely corract now you have the d c attorny general going after leonard leo political reported a total forty three million dollars floaed to leos company over two years the bug that came from the eighty five fun a non profit run by his hallis which ispend tens of millions of dollars over the pasteck age promote trumps supreme court pakes is now rummi carries ofreno ano the friend ith sho a turning and former clerk for justice clarence thomas and the the kind of notion that there the'e n'nagh to prove this i mean because this really really looks going after political enemies by the dc atterny general which would not be a surprise at all meanwhile the medio have dedicated themselves forsquare to the idea that they

read the offending pages of gender queer out loud on his show to the camera to the adults i dare him to do that heuuld never do it because he knows exactly what it would mean if he did he is not going to do that its totally is total wildness by the way this is to my mind these story of the day this is really a funny story thereis a prsonamed roan jete t nocks a preson nowname rolins ta this it is a female isa byological female and she rote back in twenty nineteen june twenty nineteen quote i live with two transpeople i interact with thousands of trans an on binary people every day i write and speak about transtissues have i look deeply my own gender identity is result definitely have i ever felt that i'm trans t nope trans is not ta contagion nine eleven p m june second twenty nineteen fast forard to august t twenty first two thousand twenty three is a headline from the tron to star his child than partner came out as transgender now rowan it shuta nocks rightes on the freedom of coming out as trans himself this is a a womand who says that ta she is a man there was no contagion until precisely the minute that the con in till was contagious oops long essay in the tronto star about how roan always lived within her getting pregnant in nineteen solidified my decision to walk away from rowan roan was a boy i was young i knew my child and i would be judge for it i lean heaveline o the roles of woman and mother embracing of playgroups and bakesailes oe eventually becoming a wife and raising three busy kids when rowan would call to me as he occasionally did i llowed the ommotion my current life to drown him out but life as a chaos theoris in and dynisor moving once said finds a way in february of twenty fourteen are middle child came out as trans then in jualliave twenty fifteen my spous of nearly two decades came out as transtoo the person i thought was my son was not a boy the person i thought was my husband was in fact my wife and now it turns out that she is the husband oh magical day and now she has a book ah amazing tok that is that de shas her second memoir about this the first one was called love lives here a story of thrivingin an transgender family now there is a new memoir out this september about how a she is a dued yah a your argument about it not being contagious and then everyone in your family has it is weird it is ala it it it is it is a little weird i i do not believe you i do not bdo not believe you ok brernaskips some things i can go to straights ome things that i hate to day things that i hate the anti defimation leagu i'm is now defending bradly cooper's used for prosthetic nose which in in a in a portrayl of leonar burnstein of course if sobteptable why was this even a controversy i'm confused o following the films first trailer releas on august fifteenthtaccorning to the ucane dependent the forty eigt year old actor who is not of jewish descent cause a stir on line as she was accused of fueling antismaticteriotypes the adial however says thereout history juses were often per trade nancis medice films in propagand as evil caricatures with large hook noses this fellow may biopek of leonard burnsteine is not that that seems a reasonable response shockingly from the antite defimation lag well i mean dah he put on make up to look leonard burnsten i'm confused does he look more leonard burnstein or less leonard burnstein but apparently were supposed to bradly coopert supposed to look bradly cooper but were supposed to believe that he is leonard burnstein i cat lemie's put it this way leonard burnstein and brdly cooper do not look alike unless bradly coper whers a lot of make up they do not look virtually anything alike their noseis in par ticular are wildly dissimilar i'm i'm burnastin's family by theway totally fine with it as they should be i'm super confuse as to why this was ever in issue except that we live in the stupidest time in which we are supposed to pretend toffence id things tat are in offensive just to points out the same people by the way who i'm sure are very upset about bradley cooper in jewface are perfectly fine wit the funning of comoss to murder jews in israel ii think the the vendiagram there is just a circle being offended by things that are not antitematism in order to at the same time excuse things that are clearly antisematism seems to be one of the hot topics of the day if you are deeply offended by bradley cooper wearing a prosthetic nose to play venderburnstein to look more lenner burnstein i nought to tell you ye'r you'r dummy i got that is really stupid it is really really stupid again but i will say this should force the left into some sort of soul searching you would think about what it means when people play people of other athnicities but do in a way that is meant to be flattering and not offensive i know that we now live in a stupid world in which we are supposed to treat every form of dressing up as equivalent magan kelley was fired from c b s for the great crime of suggesting that dressing up for michael jackson for hollowen is not the same thing as wearing blackplace and nineteen thirteens wing in amos an andyrotin which is clearly true but the left will ever acknowledge that that that if you dress up as somebody because you actually think that person is worthy of emulation that is not the same thing as dressing up as step in fetch it iagain very very stupid time braley cooper it is ovics ly cceptive and by the way hellen maran plangle the mayor also not offensive in any way shape or form thits is it is it is it is all stupid man everything is stupid ive to pretend offenc tof things that are clearly in offensive already got's the rest tof the show continues right now you are not conormis it

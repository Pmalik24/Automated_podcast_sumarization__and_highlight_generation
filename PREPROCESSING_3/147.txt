millions of views the tweet in which we announced that i had actually seen the barbey movy has something sixty cinfuse at this pont in the outrage in the media is astonishing because i did a forty three menute review of the filmin which i went through it point by point talke by ha terrible the film is and it is truly awful if you want to know how bad it is just listen to the sunday episode of this show that we released this week in which i go through prety much all the aspects of the movy that are particularly bab and a lot o the refvyours knew that it was bad going in you could see it in the reviews they were doing what i to call peeling peeling is where you see a movy by jordan peel usually and you pretend that it is good be cause you the politics of the films you pretend that get out is not just o good movy it is the greatest movy ever made you pretend that us is an actual good movi when it is actually quite a bad movy you pretend tha you care deeply about nope because jordan peal made it and because it it does not matter if te moves good or of its bab you could not leav you c call i gurwigging to rigt tis where greta gurwig makes a filmen av ris un or the sovery but she made it and has theright paltics therefore it is wonderful i do this review i put out this tweet and everybody loses their mine i me losis their mine there articles about my review of this movy in sources as diverse as newsweek enbisy news the daily beast a everyone is covering the fact that i did not this movin that i made a vidio in which i parodically op and himer bar the barbey materials i take lik a match and i the barbey stuff on fire and this apparently is terrible how no no it cant be the reaction to me burning a barbey car with barbeyan candidate is the reaction of the aslomic world when some one burns a koron in sweden it is totally crazy i do noting it wa gus wow amn there is an article in enby se enbesy news dacom the intrinet its roosting benshippero for hate watching barbey well drests ken apparently being dressed ken now amounts to you wear blackgines in a black shirt and the question was whether i had purposefuly worn that outfit to the barbey movy no i had not seen it guis that is just what people tend to weralat is a yo a black te shirt and black gie din't realize this a rare and uniqu bird it was sigo its it is omest shat of rare pheasant in te wild to wear a black par of genes and an a black shirt when i go out yet it at in any case enbys ne says polerizeing conservative commentator bench appero hated barbey much he erred his complaints in a forty three minute revidio review which included an editive himself setting fire to barbey dells in protest but the intrnet has been flaming sho puro instead my favorit thng is when they declare the internete sike when they say history has judged the internett the entire internecties did that i meen sure ninety eiht persentof the inernet is people watching porn right now but the entire nternet is very very upset they are super superduper upset oh no it is terrible many onmine poked fun at te intensity of his imparent rage highlaning you wants to fars to buy movy tickets and obtain barby dells to burn before you are acquarted himself protesting it for more than a third of barbey's at run time that this is whone my favori critiqes is is where they are oh my god you spent money on the tickets togoska movy that you reviewed ya now now i'm explain to you how how the market works do much money we made off of the u tu vidio tat has now been viewed in access of one point to million times wreviewing that movy i promise you it is way more than we spend to go by those barbys and soe matches and a barbic you i promise you and and then people re t atwertreats of bench thopuro is forty years old right i'm i may amit what thirty nine i'm a thirty nine year old dud with a very very popular show who reviewed a cultural phenomenon that is barbey en unlike all of these single women with wine and cats who went and loved this movy i have four children ya i have a very full and product ive life andi took time out my busy scedul to watch this two hour bleap show and it was bad sas upset that i'd spent two hours watching a very bad movy that has been told we have been told is the greatest movive ll time the daily beast of this to the daily beast has an entire article menshi puro roasted roasted but the real question i have yere and that this is a serious question and nactually have some fairly serious ranvications is why the outrage over me not liking the film i'm just confused 's i understand tha we were ought everybody on left has this face tatto sin from nonsense where you put something out that is wildly culturally controversial barbey tas i said in theirof you barby is hay movy that was marketed to children it is a movy that though it is peachy thirteen was clearly marketed at moms in teir eight year old girls cus who plays with barbys eight year old girls i know becs i've a nine yearol girl its o it was clearly market at that crup and then whoas a bat and switch because the entire movy is a feminous die a try about the evilds of the modern patriarchy and they do this they they they man stream they main line in a bunch of left wing social gobbledy gook into a movy that is supposed to be sort of a fun rom through barbeyville and then when you notice they get very upset that is the face tatto sen trom that 've talked about a thousand times on the show y when you going to starbuks ther some weirdo wit the face tatto hen you look at them the what do you look in at lo ye are your face tatue the thing on your face that you put there that i woul notice it in comment that thing but if you comment in the rought but what they really want is approval if you comment in the wrong way about gretta gerwig who again they are giving the dorn pel treatmen or the tailor swift treatment or he beyond satrymen there certain cultural figures cultural idols ere if you criticize them you have violated the sigred honor of the vestal virgins you must not criticize if you criticize then you will be roasted on a spit upon the internet woo i want not explain why this is his there' something i think deep going on here as there is certain thingswher if i criticize them if i make fun of them if iif i talk about them on the show then no one cares but there is certain things where if i do make fun of them on the show that everyone cares and the entire internect goes bezurk and if i make fun of carty be on the show frike fifteen minutes the entire internetgoes aflame with means about me making fun of carty by but if i have as bout in the cn men otguobety cares bike there is certain figures wh are just beyon there in the pantheon and if you

what exactly's happaning here i'll get to understand yef t understand that greta gurwig is now representive of an actual religious world vie when i made the cu kind of corky comparison between the reaction to me burning the barbey dolls in this re view and flaming the movy and the reaction to funda mentalists muslens over the burning of a kuron it it is not all that frivolous comparison there is an actual religious world view that cannot be attacked and if you a tack that religious world youth you say that religious world you is bad and wrong hen this means that you are a heretic and you must be punished is a really serious undertones tol lot o this of himan i actualy gots an de threats over the barber i'm not getting you there people on untwitter we are literally treating out about can we do something about thi ship purlike over a barby movy an yo hove to wonder why well the answer is because there is an ideology it is the ideology of the sectual revolution tat has been promull gated by the social left in thss country and it lies at the centsor of everything they think everything they feel and if you question it then you must atone you must you must be brought to heel spanish inquisition style it really is fascinating that ideology places at the center off human life the the sense of self identity that cannot be abridged by anyone else if you say for example that wom in should have children that they should get married that men should get married that men should have children if you say that the height of human aspiration is not in fact sectual pleasure or gon n what individualistic pursuit of subjective success tat actually there things you should do in this life that are higher and better if you do that that is a violation of the agreement that we all have which is to place at the center of our being an narsicistic view of self ah how do i know this because greagerg says and this is the reason the gretagerwig 's now religeds figure for left i mean truly now ta worship an an allternolic that shou bring her sacrifices or something that but in the sense that if you violi the idolatree of gretegerwig if you if you say the gretagerwig is an overated directoer and an overated writer and that her ideology is false and does not ring true nd that it is not even cohesive that if you watched the barby movy one th great ironies the barby movies there is a deep unhappiness that floes throughout it why because the very beginning of the film is p is is little girls discarding dolls that teach them motherhood for dolls hat ar about consumerism andthn the entire movies about all the unhappiness that results there from hem and then the very end of the movy is barby actively embracing the parts of her that allow her to be a mother and that there is this kenof bezar undertone of gretger rig's own unhappiness with her life and gretagerwig's actual view of what it means to be a happy woman in to day's life gretagerwig has a religious world view and me she truly does and she talks about it it is not me tong thaw this gretagerwig the director and writer the film talking about it gretagerwig did not interview with vogue in which she talked about writing barby and she talkes about co writing this film with no abomback heri's e long time at romantic partner they they the're not married they belie hey ver coblicates together and dum and she said that before she made the movi she wrote an abstract poem about barby she she would not read the poem to vogue but she compared it to the apostles creed it is her language not mine the apostles creat of course for those un familiar with christian doctrine is at in affirmation of certain quar christian beliefs it is been part of christian litergy for centuries at this point gerwig apparently wrote her own version of the apostle's creed but about barby and she is sh wrotten apostles creed but about barby not only that apparently she saw the the barby movy as a way of rebutting certain presumptions about the bible itself for example the vogue articale points out a biblical parallel with barby according to slash film tat com it is notable the barbey was invented nineteen fifty nine but her boyfron ken was not invented until nineteen sixty ind the film itself neater narrator hellen meran points out thae barbey has the great day everyday but can only has a good day of barby looks at him it would sem that ken was begat of barby created specifically to be her companion and worshipper girwig draws a direct parallel or perpendicular to the book of genesich sikuot ken was invented after barby to burnish barby's position in our eyes and in the world that kind of creationmith is the opposite of the creationmith in genesis again there is thereis something that is deeper than mure sort of cultural stupidity happening here and that is the greta girwig is channelling a reverse biblical morality into a moveyou barby that is directed it children that is the thing that has happening here andyou are not smost to notice that and if you do notice that it makes you bad because this is in fact i religious impulse modern society has gotin rid of the saints modern society has gotin rid of gedocriscian traitional values or to mean them as completely superfluous in fact intire barbey movy is about our relationships between men and wom women and men are actually stupid and im possible and fraught with tension and basesically separation is the only separate but equal is the only way to do a proper barbeyland in the in the bazar barbey world that has been created by gredagurwig and kno a bomback her long time romantic partner bomback of course is also famous for having written a a marriage story which is bout too absolutely self absorbed inour sicistic people when not getting divorce becas they wnt to pursue their petty careers in new york and hollywood and hey do not give it a damn about their kid im you ththese these are people both thing drink deeply from the well of sort of secular humanis leftism and that is and idolatrous world view in nov itself but it to man's that you be part of the idolatry and ifyou say no actually the morality theu're promulgating is stupid and count ter productive an tht when you promal get it to kidsactually bad when you say that sort of stuffy you have violated religious precept people are treating this as tough youave violated religious scruple because you have and there is ithey are lot of poilers in yesterdays review of barbeyar the week ends review a barbey but there is one speech that america for era makes in the barbey movy that basically is the apostles creed of feminism and it is spilld right out there in the middle of the movits not goore hiding the ball here there is no subtlety to this movis being hit in the head with a sledgehammer repeatedly with the nostrums of thurdway feminism america forera gets up one point in the movy an she says this i found the exact quote quoe it is literally impossible to be a woman you are beautiful and sosmarche is talking to barbey at this point and it kills me you do not think you are good enough we have to always be extrordinary but somehow we are always doing it wrong you have to be thin but not toothin and you can never say you want to be thin but you also have to say you want o be healthy but 'll you have to be thin you have to you have to have money bt you cannot ask for money because that is crass getting now none of this is true by the way they'r women of all shapes and tize is who live happy marriageis wh have happy lives the notion that that women cannot ask for money because that is cre you have to be a boss but you cannot be mean you have to you have to lead but you cannot squash other people's ideas you are suppose to love being mother but also do not talk about your kids all the damtime by thegwai'm not yur who whose this is describing tevery mo my now talks feother gets all the time nis whats wonderful you have to be a career woman but always be lookin out for other people you ave to answer for men's bad behaviour which is insane but if you point out out you are accused of complaining you are supposed to stay pretty for men but not pretty you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women ecause you are always suppostobe part of a sisterhood but always stand out in always be grateful but never forget that systemis rigs tofll find a way to acknowledge that but always be grateful you have to never get old never be roue never show off never be selfish never fall town never fail never show fear never get out of line it is too hard it is too contradictory and nobody gives you a metal or says thank you and it turns out in fact not only are you doing everything wrong but also everything it is your fault i'm tired of watching myself an every other single other woman tie herself in to notstle people will us and if all of that is also true for ats all just representing woman then i do not even know that is it that is the the apostles creed apparently that a peers in the middle of the film i mean mericor for a lit literat says this hir's a hero shot of her an upshot of her doing all of this an margo robby looking on adoringly as she says all these ridiculous silly things that i's impossible to be woman in modern society yet tribing your grandmother seriously tribing your grandmother operatin without a washing machine with six kids in nor home worship it is it is her shop to makes sure that everything runs on time yet you you are real victim but it is it but this the whole thing the whole thing is that if you violate these religious scruples wi people think on the left that they live without religion they do not they have a religion their religion is secou lert left ism and the apostle's creed of it is the apostles creed of the sexual revolution and if you cross them they become just as angry as any other inquisition the comjost is upset if you trigger them by pointing the stuff out they get extremely upset andthen they play it off all ye that ah mygoch i cant believe yout all you looks it when we make a review of a film that is for he thremenence long and we put that intitle wher pettesere we know were oing over here when we set fire to barby's you kno for the shock vallue of it and because it is funny we know we are doing the joke is the joe you can pretend not to get the joe whory can just be offended by it which is really wha's happening here i've a question for you why you's upset jus wives it i do not to movy you tho movy o ke we have those differences why ou's upset what it is make what is getting your goat much i understand why i'm upset when i'm upset about is the lie i'm ma set tht you created ta movy tat is specifically designated for little girls you see it and then what you decided to do sliding a bunch of left wing image re and propaganda atot how terrible little girls havenit the united states iv thng that is awful nthink's an awful thing to do i der sen limusit whe hundre sinis white europeset youre move ade a crapler money over the we gan this moving made a hundred sixty million dollars over the we gan it blew the dors off the box office opening we can now i don' nots can have the kind of repe business that that it is gon one to have anoythings can aving foreign businessbut tat's a diferent story what you sups about one person who you already didn a growth politically did not the film and yet you are upset why isit ever ocured you because youre more religeus than i ham i'm h whon yeur where in the funny little hab that has tings my believe in god byt you guise are whearing your barby shirts in atastation to your idolatry of a sexual revolution momant that is played out and is rift with deep unhappiness that you re fuse to acknowledge ance hor can externalize that in to i cannot believe somebody sayd something bad must protect the precious that is what is happening here it is a form o vidolatry and t's amusing to watch ig 's try to spend it away hn the you hear people on the left say things my kid is not gon to pick up on all this message ing o wut what do i care you now it is it is subtle an it is first fault it is not'suttle at all and there certain movies where things will just fly right over kets has i know i have four of them now there there certain things where youre watching n your the joe kit is maybit does not hit mackids there is no subtlety to thi film at all i mean it is right in your face there is litteral ly speech about it the're multible speeches about it in that same scene tere's a line in which in which barby sad either you have to be weird and terrible or you have to be ignorance essentially an those yeour choices in life ou'v have to pretend that everything is fine or youhave to be weird and terrible weird barby and weird barby who is played by kape mc kennan who no is a is playing essentially les bein barby i that it is hurt ashecious nods knowingly that this soves not subtle does this have an effect on on little girls sure any movy that tells kids that if they have a particular situation in life that they are there for bound to be purt and harmed a patriarchy that is not good for kids and it was specificlly directed at kids and it is amazing to me that studio bosssin matel decided to hand over e billion dollar property to greta gurwig who is an idea logical warrior ofnm behalf of the second werl left as nonsense anza and then we are supposed to pretend thatit means nothing gen i anderson am upset ige dnurer sow i europe set that i'm upset and well what it what use upset about what is getting your goat here maybe it is that if somebody crosses your apostles creed this makes the maheredac and the heretics must be burn and just sanuals thung b another heretic there

small town people do not tend to stand for riots this apparently is incredibly bad the media have been on him for a week about this an jason altine is doing the thing that you must never do he is re fusing to apologize good for him over the week and jason alden tid a concert in which he slamed the b as of people attacking him over this good for him wawit aa good for him good for him hes again he violated the thing that you are not supposed to say which is that may be small town community life has something going for it whet your suppost to believes that cosmopolitan values left doing social values that come from new york or san francisco ore a that these are the things that are supposed to govern everyday life that their view of the universe ought to be your view of the universe and if you say weit hold up a second i actually think that people very often live a better more fulfilling lives an small communities with community co hesivenest that is a thing tht you are not supposed to say at all and you are certainly supposed to apologize if you say and just now deane is not doing that and they came after him thet tried to trump up a charge that he is racos that of course is not true and he rebutted it and he said no good for him but this is what the left is is into these days if you violate their precept they just lie about yue that is their thing now is tht they just truth is of no consequence the only thing that matters is the agenda a gender hober alis for these folks you can see this in the current nontroversy over the florida corriculum with regard to african american black history if you look at the black history corricuon in the state of florida it was written by a couple of black scholars and the corriculum there is nothing wong with it i've looked at its joner toll pages long it is it is basically a series of guyd lines nd a couple of the guy lines thor controversal as one side that slaves some times developed skills that they could use for themselves and this was red falsely by commela harris on th rest af left to suggest that in florida peopleare being taught that slavery is good that is absurd literally what the criculum says is that slaves took advantage of even the worst situations in order to better themselves which is about the merit of the people who are being held in bondage not about the greatness of slavery that is stupid in fact doctor william b allan whois and whn h black scholars wrote this he explain the agenda here it was there ers said that slavery with ban aisial to africans what was sad and anyone who eats this welsee this with cate it is the case that africas tro re soso resilion and a taten and were able to thevelop skills and atituds reserved to theiren both wilean slave and acte slatemen you would say that you are get you are standing by these standards am even though the bast president wis very for bost yesterday am i will repeat to is to the cindy an a noctin otise thtand certainly willing to stand behind the work of my embers in tassporse and the stand behind the conaped cases i have then of course ol the standads i am quite contitent in there the lidity an istoricof acrisy and there modivations inso the metyo are just glossing right over this from th most art in order to prompt in or to prop up the lies that comea harris is telling and again comela harris 's lies or directed against to santus ind the reason that comla hrris is telling lies agains to santis is because as ov one knows there is that quite a a decent possibility that there is some extrenious events in the election of tweng twenty fouring comela harrisons up the top thedaget tobiton does not look good he looks he is clapsing in on himself nd whit that means if he is not healthy enough to run is that comela harris becomes that fact of democratic nominy if that happens she thinks she may have run against to santus and she is been trumping up this garbage tha de santis is some sort of cruel vicious racis a last week should a whole speech claiming thet blacks were of that black history was going to be twaught in such a way that slavery was upheld as some sort of higher good in the statof floor which has ridiculous in a sort here is ronto santis responding those charges of the weeken in i did not do it and i was not involved in it a but i think a i think what they are doing is i think that they are probably gin to show a some of the folks that eventually parlayd i you don' being a blacksmith into into doing things later later in life a but the reality is all of that is routed in whatever is factual they listed everything ow and if you have any questions about it just ask o the partment of education you can talk about those folks but i mean these were scolars who put that together was not anything that was a that was done politically anagand this is not about the actural contents to th program hir'snoting wong with content o the program the entire thing is a trumped up charge in the same way that the attacks on aldine ar trumped up charge he attacks on ta san to s on race our trumped up charge that are design to uphold comela harris that is really what this is about about propping up harris who is deeply un popular with the american people because she is the least talent to politician of our generation or maybe any other bidn campaign chair sand re gretchmen as she went on sannon with jim acosta and ladies find you somebody who loves you let toe macostale of ja macosta and tas sendric richmon then blasted ron to santus for qontin what attacking comela harris what your response to what for the governor to santus had to say about this clearly factually i he is wrong slavery was an abomination and wautterly evil an at had t seero redeeming quiet noi link that of it further illustrates how far i this republican party in these candidates are going i to the right and to kater an panded to extremeness an outer to get some port and i think that i governor i to santus i his campaign has been floundering he is been looking for at tention and i think that he is i now i am barki on goin as far to the right as he possibly can just to see if he can be the extremest cannity again they are trumping this up in order glafter to sance that this one of thing youhave to understand is that if you are seen is an enemy of the regime if you r seen is an enemy of the ideological rechime again the charges will just be trumped up it does not even matter it doesn' even matter which brings us to the january sixth indictment against a donal trump now as i said before donall trump when it came to the classfid document stuff on a statutoy level there is very little question that he probably violated the classfie document statutes does that mea shol be proscue now and he here is the thing thet are bee own the righ to san the real rason or going after trump is because he violated your scruples not be cus your actually afrad of imviolating the wall the thing that trump has done that offended you much he did by running in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen he 's your best friend until then you are handing him emea wards until then andthen you turned on him because he violated your religious precept while this is the perception of the right and they are not the're not wrong again when you look at the contrast beteen the treatmen of donald trump and the treatmen of jobide which wren to get to an a second because there is now breaking news on the jo bidon business corruption frunt which is wayworse than anything that trump has ben accused of yere when when we worgan get to that in just one siht when you see that double standard this is why people on the riter intensely angry first acgood life in turns plan gives you peace of mind if something

going t come down some time this week according to the wallstratrnal it is still unclear how soon trump will be intited but jack smith has has sent him a target letter apparently they did that on sunda july sixteen toven four days to say whethe yhou a peare before the gran jury granjuris have continued to here witnesses in recent days at could be this week it could be next it is unclear what exactly trump will be charged with here but according tothe wallstraturnal person familiar with the target etters that at re ferse to three statues that could be the basis for the prosecution conspiracy to defraud the government obstruction of an official proceeding and a civil rices violation that is offen used in voting fraud cases all three of these unlest they have serious evidence of obstruction are really really realy week conspiracy to defraud the government is usuallyo tried to steal money from the actual government of the united states when atcomes to obstruction of an official proceeding ou actually have to show the donals trump called somebody up and told them that he would say bribe them to change their testimony a civil rice fiolation used in voting fraud cases is typically i stop you from voting or i actually falsified balts and shoved them in ballabox it is not me saying something about a vote that i didn'n particularly according t the wallstrturnal trump could be trarged with the least one of s yous statutes pass following the civil war and originally signed to prosscute conspiracies to keep new we freed black people from voting but he did not keep anybody from voting again is can be very difficult to see how that works when it comes to the conspiracy to defraud the government again that that particular statue was chiefly written to stop people from stealing money from the government the brobably wrtten statue prohibits agreement to obstruct a lawful function of the goverment by deceitful or dishonest means one federal judge had suggested from violated up ut again it is ver i've never seen it interpreted in this particular way on a practical level and when comes to obstruction of of a official proceeding again they are going to have to prove that trump essentially try to bribe somebody it is pretty clear a this point the same people went after trump on everything else all of the all f the false take russhob garbage all those same people are very very excited aboutl this including of course adam scheff here is atmshof tatthefected adamshift is still treated as a sort of a person worth talking to over on emisonbes he

serious mis tonduct he is tiresome he is tiresome and this is the game right that the game from the left is it does not matter what you charge trump with yet a charge him with something and then of

well an reallyes mazon we have two stories out over the course the last seventy two hours at calling to serious question the cuonku non corruption of jobidon first of all it is pretty obvious from the ginning that hunter was doing things abroad picing up sacks of cashin i some that was makig its way back tojo again i urge you to god look at all the doccuments that are available from a hunter bdan's

that everybody knew that hunter was a go be tween for jo joe get onth phone an save vague phrases and then hunter would spin that into an amazing amount o money for himself and for his family members which presumably he would then distribute to his dad now by the way the money doesnashaft to hit dad's bank account for hunter be spending money on his das expenses hunter could e covering house

here is the motive the means and the opportunity and the thing that actually happene hat'swhat you have here according to not one but two witnesses rihte twoning bobolinski has already talks about this davon archer is now also talking about the srmember that time than hunter hunt that jobidon said he had no knowledge of his sons business activities remember that and he was lying remember that

yoardy have emasan be sees aly belshi jus blowing off all thse investigations ther're waste of time according to alybelshi taf you thought of hearing with two iress wistle lowers was can be tan you would be wrong that hearing quickly devolved when the cogres foman bargery tailor green displayed explicit photographs of hunter bidinto the committee this is the reality of the rerepublican investigation into the called bidon crime family it' seemingly riddled with stunts and conspiracies another fass it of the hunter biden investigation senters around his business dealings with the ou cranian national gas company called berisma that little part is true hunter bidon was on the board of berisma and jo bidon did cush you crane to remove its to prosecutor but that was because the prosecutor was seen as catic gorically corrupt by the international community ok well lot of yeople are se in his categorically corrupt by the international committee including half of you crane anse jobine putting lot presher on that did you this one just happn to benefit his son and you now have multiple sources where testifying to the relationships on bereezma huntering joe yous can a plow all that away and all about donald trump in january six were till doing thus he knows the president right now t oy were talking about know who occupying the white house hunter you still walking roun he wite house after pleading gilty to crimes amazing amazing stuff ocame meanwhile we are supposed to believe that the situation in israel is about to break into civil war thi s all the headlines to day bhet me explain was happening when benjamin it tonow whos current coalition in israel took over it to right wing coalition it is lecoud plusssome right wing settler parties plussan rght wing religious parties the most sor right win coalition that is that is ever been elected in israel they propose some changes to the israelejudiciary as i've discussd before on the program these relyjudiciary does not work the american juditiary the american judiciary is there to interpret a written constitution there isno written constitution in israel the judiciary in the mid nineteen ninetie's basicaly decided under the auspicies of man into honon broch that they were going to simply weigh in on every debate and one of the tools they wre going to use to do this is they would simply overturn any waw pass by the legislature in israel tht they said was unreasonable now that sounds vague to you it is because it is wild and insane in vague it is literally te court o saing i n't a law were throwing out it is con uhat unreasonable imagine if you had basicly nine routh bater ginsburgs on supreme court and any time re publicans passd any law she just said unreasonable an throughit out that is basically houase working in israel tere are the probims of the supreme cortin israel including the fact that effectively the supreme court select its own successors sere can never be a political shift on the supreme cort when the new colition came in to place they vowd that they were going to remake the judiciary and there are several things they wanted to do one of those would be change how those judges are selected which has corrected make the more answerable to the legislature that was jedisons at least for the moment becaus a protest the current pease that the that was just passed in israel by the canesset by themajority inthe canesset was just saying the judiciary still has the same ount of power at ever had butit is not allowed to just throw out laws on the basis that they are unreasonable does that sound crazy tou it cunsound crazy dits seems pretty obvious you should not ave a judiciary is not a legislatures and unelected body of people we are a pointed by their predecessors they should not have the power to simply say i do not a law therefore it is not a law that is what you normally all it a tatorship if you have a person who as unelected who sits there and said that baseon any reason whatsoever i can simply sadle a law until we are just not kin to do it that is effectively iditatorship it is effectivelyaditatorship pretty clearly what happened the cannesset the majorn th caness have tried to pass this after months of protest and after they would already water down ter original proposal which was a lot more ground breaking they wartered down to just this provision which is incredibly miled and the protest continued becaus a basely turnd into a big party in thestreet tof tellefeve and a lot of people in israel serve are enjoying the spect tacale of being able to shut down streets and ther sort of enjoying the idea they can shut down the government and whatit is turned into what is morft in to is the opposition in israel has effectively tried to grant a vedo right two people who are against the elect the elected government of israel one of things that s happen is that israel has a sort of bazar military system where everybody is drafted but then their certain grups of people whore volunteer reservus it tos prerticularly troue in the air force son the air force their people o hve to volunteer to come in once a week in order o keep up on their training in case of a war and then if there is an emergency they canac to be called back into durate the can be activated s ther still part of the reserve but their volunteereservice they said we are not on to come in for our training unless the government backs off of this proposal and ten the re ten thousand volunteereservice we are we are not gon to come in for our training unless the government backs off this proposal now imagine in te united states for a second that members of the military large numbers members the military simply said that if jo biden for example passes a law with congress not even a bades ecutive words the law with congrese we are not shrowing up for duty and not only that we are going to shut down all the streets and not only that the the major labor unions of the united states decide to shut down a malls oll the schools everything unless the elected government of the united states stopped passing a law this would not look very democratic what it inf fact to look the opposite of democracy because democracy is where ou astually elect the leadership and then the leadership thats to pass things an if you do not that you hav another election and believe you me isrels had lots ofelections five in the last four years they do elections lot over there since notion tha the people's voits is never heard is not true they hae an election again every five seconds over there you'r bunch people in the streets claiming that they are standing and favor of democracy by obstructing the workings of the elected majority in the casset which is absurd and the the boycot of the military by members the militaries on precedented even going al the way back to if you if youknow lober of is rally history in two thousand six the is rally government under the auspicies of arelcheron pushed forward a pull out from the gossi strip they are they are ten thousand or jews living atthe northern end of the gossil strip and the cheron government decided they did not want yous living there and they handed it over tothe palcinines an an up beautifully chomostic over but when they did that the called gos that tis engagement the are mass protest people did this they shut down the streets but no one said i'm not going in for military duty that is a new thing and no one said endefinitely were gin to shut down the country that is also a new thing and there is a differency in civil disobedience and we shut down the country for weeks on end we shut down the malls we shut down the banks we shut down the schools imagineof this happen in te united states ouuld be utterly un goemocratic now the way tha the prest covers this in the united states that the protestors are actually prodemocracy and saying that judges cannot simply strike things down on the basis of reasonableness that' somehow now anti democratic which is totally grazy and if the current colition in israel were to acquiesse to this if they were to say your protest mean that we will not pass a lawfrom now on then they obviously do not hae a government ant that point the protestors rum the government they coul sey we want a taxcut andthe protestors go back out in the streets and the revers the reservis they were not serving and the you orne nactialy have an elected government in the state of israels they realy really had to do this theyn't have a choice at this point they try to bunch of compromises they offered everything there is been no budging no movement from the left the the the coalition i gain water down their own proposal over and over ad over and over and the left simply said no they are intransgen well this being used now as wedge by jobiton who wants to sort of attenuate connections between israel and the united states jo bine is now using this as a wedge yhou's pre tendin that he standing with the s rally left by standing against judicial reform now again it is kind ofby ronic his jobinon's own party in the united states has proposed things packing the united states supreme court jo bitn himself has said that the suprime court his undermind its own credibility here in the united states he would you rest power away from the supreme court you mayre member but in israel when they try to do that on much more solid ground to tanti democratic it t's really about is jobiden is trying eliberately to under cut a lot of these strong ties between the state of israel and the united states he is abetted in this by idiots tommas freedmen an incredibly stupid commentator whose only merit in commenting is apparentlyhe goes to form countries and he listens to a taxi driver every thomas freman colonies i went to a i went to i went to eron i talk tor taxi driver apparently taxi drivers elect greatest source of information all over the world if ever uber ends or taxi's and andwe go to automated driving thomas free man wil peal gradi columnshas an entire peace however called only biding can save israel now wich i'm sary is just a ridiculous statements sexing only biding can save france or only bide and can save the uk name another country where somebody would save this kennigarbage it is just silly it is absolutely ridiculous thomas freedmen who is a joke of a commentariess fifty years after the nineteen seventy threewar this jewish democracy urgently neds another airlift to save it from being destroyed from the inside it urgently needs re supply of hard truths something only you can provide oh yes jobide has counprovide hard truths to the asrailies about how to run their internal business ridiculous supposedly he wants the secretary states secretary defends treasurye secretary commers secretary secretary of agriculture everybody to call up nittinawho and let them know that if they pass a judicial reform that says that the judiciary count ranimly strike downlaws for no reason at all that this will under mine the cherd trategic interest in th idaliest just to be clear this an administration that is curently trying to make common cause with the arannian ol iatolas whare trying tobuild a newcleor weapon and thomas freed an it is encouraging the bide adinistration call up bebin intogo whoan tell him that unless you do what i want you to do on the judiciary in internal matter that we are going to start cutting ties essentially redit that by the way i gain the idea t that israel bout to slide into the tatorship is just crap it is just not true but it is been promulegated by the left that because when you suggest that your opponents are about to actually enter into dictatorship ebasicly justifies you doing prety much anything up to an including apparently adbising members of your own community to divest from banks and move their money out and get out of the military an allthe rest of ths kenninonsense it is really really stupid the government had to do it they rely dn't have a choice because once they are once once your government is basically down to you'r passing the law or you give up all control to protestors in the streets and to unelected powers i mean one of those things looking mworelike fashions tm than the other and it is not the people who arelected to a position to pass what is by any measure incredibly my old rebuke to the judiciary and by the wike you nor this gomand in te judiciary apparently the the yet you are lapede is the leader of the opposition he is already goen a file lawsuit a and he is gan go the jdiciary and the is every shot the judiciary will strike down the wall as unreasonable an that is the stupidity of this there is every possibility that after all this is done the judiciary is going to step in and say well now that now that they have said we cannot rule on the bases of reasonableness we think that is unreasonable and hey just trike it down unbelievable oket time for a quick thing i and then some things that i hate things that i today elon musk it is apparent he has now changed the logo of twitter to acts i assume to to sort of unify his brands because of course he is am te space ex guide and twitter acts it is apparently going to now be a a more full sum imediate eko system which you'l good for him if he can find owin monitsties that tha be good because of course he is far more free speech than many of te other outlets e better out there his goal is to presumably start doing vidio streaming and to monotize all of that bring in house aught people are talking a little while ago about the threat that facebook was going to provide to a evea threads to twitter becase they pickd up ly ten million vuzers in the first week or something and i said at the time that is not a com because there just porting over everybody from instogram two threads and it turns out that as prmost situations i ways right rights is already losing it is a lure for users hadding urgency for new features apparently data show user engagement has fallen seventy per cent as executives focas onoptions a chronological feed the reason for that is of course it is not where the newsmakers go if your newsmaker he gos twhitter and musk knows that well now it appears the threat is atho going the other way twitter's can a star getting much more into the vidio business and that is going tothraten facebooks strangle whole on a lot of vidio entidies and in short form vidio and all of the rest her'll be interesting s to what yelon must us he is doing some see to the pants flying here but it is worke forhim far a time for a couple of things that i hate hary something that i hate number one i've absolyte craft all over barby land and othe barby movy because it is bad and it ands vallues are terrible and as i've said gredigarwig is essentially an icon of social left wing thinking cho better then to direct the chronicles of narnia i'm not kitting you according to entertainment weekly the barbey director has now been tappe to right and's erect at least two films for netflics base on se us lois is novels she says i have no in start wrapping my arms round him ut i'm properly scared of it which feels a god place to start i think when i'm scaredits always good time maybe when i stopping s scaritill be mabetion do that one no i'm terrified of it it is extrordinary and it is exciting im i'm just gon to point out here that the chronicles of narnia are heavily christian in content see us lewis of course oneof th great apologis for christianity of the twentieth century the chronicles of narna are a very very finly vailed retelling of the gospels and the line the which in the wardrobe is aslan is jesus i mean there is clearly and everyone knows this i mean it is is that as those hidden in the same way that the subtext of barby is not sutexi just text the subtext of thechroniclesof narnia is not subtext it is just text well why would you take somebody who ise apparent social ethos is whyll left wing feminism and then hand that person the chronicles narring what is the see us lose estate doing what do they think they are doing by handing this over to greda gerwig onest to godits the caving spike le direct pride and prejudice but what are you doing that is not his ideology what pidn' prejudice has him come interesting ideological perspectives spikcalea is not mirror those perspectives only holly wood would think well what if we took greta gerwig and we handet her one of the great christian novels ever written forkids let us do that i very much look forward to learning that the white queen is victim of the patriarchy and that she actually whos victimizes a child by evilmen and that is why she became cruel and which and the only way that she can truly be healed is by aslan sacrificing his own patriarchals nature on the alter she can be queen once again i look for to learng about that thing of perversion of a children's entertainment the new snow white is goingto be an abomination how we knows can be an amomination whle first we have those pictures that showed that dome snow whites seven dwarfs are actually six large people normal size people and one little person a but now we actually have some verbiage from the a from the lady who is rachel' zeggler who is playing snow white i get is kind of weird because the left is very big on the distinction wet on white and brown ay therer theyre verye big on this racially speaking and rachel' egler is of course diverse she is a person of diverse background because she is as bannic as i've said before snow white is a story about a woman whose skin is as white as snow that is not racist it is just in the story in the same way thet pinochio is about a wood and all and if you make the dull out of a luminum it is a kind of different story well i'm i i i noticed that done now she is saying some things about what snow white is going to be that cafhling kennedy the entire cruew over at at the at disney headqurters have decided and never again will they do a traditional fairy taile because traditional fairy tells hare very often about boy's being heroes and girls falling in love with boys and that cannot be that cannot be it all no no more of this every main character will now be a female and every man character will ben empowered female hero who is a tickass lady anza and this is what rachels egler says you said you are bringing a modern aege to it on sai redimin bether i just mean that it is no longer nineteen thirty seven me absolutely rotic sno way tand is tot in to bive by the prentis not in to be thin bit the princ ance she is not gon to be dreaming about true love she is a dreaming about becoming the leader she know she can' be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she wass fearless fair braven thruge and it is just the really incredible stry forything young people everywhere to see themselve then wit is running for present an as a pologin i campaign andothet ther is right thet right running wanching mi ket it is all political it is all political why not why not take a piece of ie pee an elect son no white first of all one f the great animated ee pies ever and reck it you can do that also youcan take a fairy tale that has been dirable that it has lasted for centuries and we will just destroy it we will make it the same female ampower ment story that every single disny movi has been for the last twenty years we will do that except more she is not dreaming of trutho be because it girls by th way girls should definately not dream of true love it be very very bad for girls to dream of true love instead what they have to dream o i's being a single wine slashed cat lady at forty years old and maybe making partner at the big firm before realizing its tulation shoul af roze reggs that is what we can all aspire to be no more of thes true love talk love bad now it is weird is it no matter how much you tell little girls that they shuldn't aspire to true love he still do and then when they do not find it and very unhappy i'm sorry to break it to you but feminism has been a giant fail along these lines he natural orientation of woman he is too fine man and to settle down with man and to have children with man

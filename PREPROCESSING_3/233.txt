easy chicago is this american lie ameri class say wit ak win wou can check out any time you but you can never leave si shoterdayis about people who are stuck and years ago one of our co workers on the baker thouht herself trapped in a hotel room with her sibwings held her by a stranger ut at was the family is all staying at this marriat but there such a big family for the kids were in one roim with thealdis kidin the parents next door how i was fourteen years old at the time in the room with ten year old julia a year old briton and five year old jail on i was sharing a bed with hell now the fourteen year old the eighth greater was more or less in charge then one night through all asleep it is ae middle o ther night my memory is that it is i i saw a sliver of light which is what woke me up and the sound of the door closing in there was the feeling that there was someone standing at the foot of the bed i reached overin i turned the lamp on and there was this woman y and i she look startled to see us and the first thing she sad wys your just chiltrin i did not expect you to be chelder that is pretty creaming rit what did you make of ther saying that i instantly felt this is an on sat for tuation hen describe her remember she was my mam's age she was propably in her forties and i a brown hair w it kind of frompy loking somebody sit next toon the bos or something did she seem menacing she seemed really distressed she was crying to she is crying she was crying yet she cried the whole time she was there she is crying as she said your children i did not expect you to be children yet and do the other could get up everyone is widoing i distinctly remember my little brother's sisters faces cause their eyes were just huge but no one said anything and ar they sitting up to or they just what there still laying flat nobody m is what obsent she is talking it this is not how it isppas to be and then she is also crying and she stuggin t herself i remember being very hard to follow what what she was saying and da eventually i said am i'm sorry i think you have the wrong room and she started to cry and she said i know i know i dnin do this i do this i do not know whyi do this and then she is im pacing back and forth i and and ind of crying and she sits down on the bed at the foot of the bed did she seem crazier to she seem upset i mean it is interesting i was i think i'd i was too young and unfamiliar to identify what a crazy person seems but what i could identify in that moment was that this person was unpredictable yes i go i've got to be really careful how i do this i remember feeling that pressure and in that moment very very very aware of my brothers and sisters a they were little and that something back could happen to them and that the way that it was not going to happen to them was me there were no adults there i think it was the first situation i was ever in where there was you could not defer to some one else to to keep you safe or tell you what to do and what do i do and it had that quality of time slows down and your kind of your there but you are also watching and th then i did the mass in my head and i was oqay i have a couple options they are i cry for help scream but i do not think any one will here am remember looking how far away the phone was from me and i ealize i can reach and grab the phone and i could call for help or an even lik if i could knock on the door where my sister was sister in the connecting room next door i could at least they would know something was happening in here and they could get to us in time ye but all of that felt lik dam an escalation i would provoke her and what can i do to not provoke her kind of play up the fact that were children nd what i felt i needed to do was i needed to calm her down and become her friend and if i could become her friend she would leave and she would not hurt us li get her to see you was a person lie make her think i was on her side as then it did not feel she did not see us as people it just felt im it felt dangerous and i did not understand why and i felt the key to being safe was slowing everything down and i remember saying i'm really sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm here i'm sorryi'm doing this i'm sorry and i do notremember this but my brother remembers that what she said was i'm sorry girls i'm sorry girls and that his whole memory of this night was just bing i'm a boy o mad im i ask her i said i'm are you oquet is everything oquet and that is she kept me no going on about how her night was hard and iwas i'm sorry that sounds hrely really difficult i as youre troing to prefrend her ye a this me trying to befrend her but it is reaght i feel i was hyper alert till ie if i can understand what is going on with her i can help sall tat but i could not understand cause it did not make any sense did you feel sorry for i felt conserned for her an m and then she took out her purse and as she reached into her person then she gripped on to something and i remember thinking oh no what the way a thot it is a gon ers all i gon or a night for something i murderig my heart just dropping and then she pulled out a hair brush and then she just started brushing her hair at the foot of my bed well and at and at that point i was this is really weird insus latr at and i do not think she is gon to lea and then i'm she sat on the vanity in front of the merror at the desk and she took her earrings off and at oho and she started take shook her shoes off she took her cot off she was just elly a making herself comfortable till i be here now and i let her do all that i'm an was sort of listening to her go on about what was wrong and then eventually after i felt enough time had passed i said i'm we im we h've a wake up early to go to school to morrow and we are really tired i think we we should probably go back to bed now and shee's i know i ow i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm here i'm here i'm sorri'm here and i said im no it is is tolly find they are here almost lik can to think you ring here but i'm do you mind a leaving now and i very slowly stood up and walked over to the door and every moment was making sure safe and then i open the door and she said oqut oquet and she put her shoes on and then she started to leave and just as she was about to leave i said oh you forgot your earrings and then she was started crying all over again gitas this huge thing walked over o get the earring and then sat backe down on the bed and i remember thinking why it i bringing up the earan a wear cloes to being safe then i then the whole thing it bas gle holding started all over again wer a head to lake listen to her cry calm her down and then fi andly i'm am we have to wake up early to to school do you mind leaving and i walked her to the door and i she walked out of the door and as soon as she was out of the door i just slike push the door as hard as i could to close it and when i pushd day li basily slammed it shat she screamed at the top of her lungs and is sere a bolt or something on the door i think i did boltet after i slammed at shal and then i heard her screaming in the hallway and then she ran down the hallway screaming and she ran back towards the door screammin and a that must tomen toher or fi was scary and thn then igot was quiet and then i heard this loud lake she is banging on the door gi's hard as she can write and then i hear a voice since my dad am i dat open the door opend the door and i reallies is not hurbing on the door i an when the door and my dad standing there in eas did you hear some one screaming the hallway sand then i tell mis whole story an mi there is this woman she was in a room i tell imhall the details and he is furyos youas mad a and then he told us to stay

there she said yes her name was a lan a baker and they looked up the name a lane a baker a lane a baker and your name is elna baker yes oke but i do not believe this part of the story i think some one

purpose that lifts our spirits and livens our steps without the mamentment purpose we founder ap as 'm without a future is a life that feels less worth living because it' the life haunted by a shadow of futility and quot i've to say i've thought about that much these last few weeks because many people that u'm cose to i just see how they are stretched out by how weird we formless the days have become the norma routine is all gon and all uys have only the cloudy a sense of what the futures going to be at three of our progatodays about a family that is in that wenbal hunger down tryin in it by when you stuckin doors for long stretces of time weird things can happen let us get to this a this is actory cold case see know i those locked room detective stories were there is a crime in some room in it is uncer how the culprit even got into the room this nextory is a kind of about that sort of situation what of our produceris noty rament explains this thing happened resoly that made no sense to me at all my families been isolating and suburban rochester new york where my parents live and i mean hard core isolating we see no one we go nowhere we havent been inside i store or ban around other humans in two months for food we do curbiside pick up our delivery which privilege i know then we do this insame disinfection prosses where we wipe everything down with a nighty per cent rubbing alcohall ten per cent water solution we made our selves when we are done the room smelts a sterilized doctors ofvice when we go for walks if we see any one we cross the street a block ahead we pick up all mail with disposable gloves leaven in the garage for twenty for hours we used to spray with licell first we agry that was overkill but to be honest i still doit behind my families back in my mind there is noway any derm could break through our impenetrauble disinfect and fortress but somehow after doing this day after day for seven stree weeks yi work up fairly early in the morning an felt it an theg oof a cold that is my husband jerremy i was run down a running owns a sorthrod and a couple of days he was fine but i was how the helded that even happened how could he possibly have gotten a cold we been supercareful because he has an immune deficiency when that affects his respiratory system it keeps me up at night sometimes because if the cold virus madeed into our house then the coronof iris could to and then there was a crack in our armour i needed to know where we had failed jermy and i consulted an expert and a very safe social distance where are you i'm in cot if wils you nih o kingdom aan im on the consty is on looking out over the see sim really well isolated this is roneckels who really knows about colds study them for fifty years he ran a place called the common cold center at cardifuniversity almost immediately i told thim all the precautions we were taking i do not understand how this is physically possible an just really one to know how did this how did this happen how could he have gotten this w it is a bit of a mystery let me see if i can ask you some questions to what mig rther li ca deteco a you say you have not actually ment anybody si a son you have no sisily cuchd anybody shakean hands or adying that no oo a what abou the dorhand out side as anybody else tuch ac tohandle ihavs to openi to ten ot ol i o letry man well here is that i've done on every time we go out the houses sterted to spray the door handle with liceall and on and now i made the paint comeons there is a baks street going down the tittle an ot because if s pated much i can personally guaranty the door nob was safe at the next way you cald pick up a cold from some one he is by what we called an haro sol thes a just tiny particles am i is there any way that some one could have been out side on coffing an sneesing m may be small particles of coming is that a possibility that seem the only possible way because we will see people jogging walking towards us in the cross the street and if there is any potential for them to have sneeze tor caft in the trail ya as possibaliiv you calght down wind from them i mean sure but pretty down on likely echeles mos on to a different line of questioning i mim homing in now on two possibilities for gerame did geramy experience any itching o told with this ar at be that he had itching in the throat or now because if you had any itching i would tend to think that it could be some sort of aligy no no not that i can recall and he is been tested twice no haulargis which leaves one last possibility when i did not even imagine not in my wildest dreams the thing that made him sick it was inside him all along we are carrying a lot of backteria around throat and nows normany now if we get strest and you did mention the geramanity to have a bit of ha slighti me in deficiency but stress course he says to get even more immune deficien that it is possible that some of the bacteria that a normally hanging around in the throat or nos of geramy of takin that opportunity of low immunity to make a bit of an infaction si think on tuding that it is probably a bacterial infection because i cannot see how an earth you would have got a cold with all the precautions tit your taking se e o insight of him already not fireus but he bacterium but it is mascerading as a common colt that is his best guess basically the call was coming from inside the house t o not aptere how long would darymy have been how lon would ave been just hanging out there with him could it be muns could be something that he had since before we before the seven weeks that we been up here old yess e could be years really years it felt good and that there was no hole in the armour all the wite being the spraying it was working everything was fine deare me also felt good kind er i think in some ways i might feel less relieved o know because now feels it just lives in me an that is just way it is just it is just always there waiting to trait anly arme we all are we all have the sang baccteria had it is coming after me i have a small confession to make him when dearemy first told me he felt sick onestly i did not really believe him i

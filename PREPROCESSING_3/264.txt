dabe beasy chiga goes this merican life i or a glass quick whantin't everybody's listening to this pocas version of a show there some words that we have unbeeped you do not hear that maybe wisng with kids you can get a beepe version at our websiht this mcan ived out ord cought a coffy whalt one of our producers has been reporting this story it is gonby the whole hour to day it is a really good one yu shees when vivian started reading about the men in hollywood and the media and their sexual transgressions she thought of the men in her past who had behaved porlie the man who assaulted her in her twnties and the others a few unwanted kisses over the i me truly unwonted drunk and guischa sort of pushing themselves all in ma and the usuful array of jokes and colments in this an that she thought of them and she thought of don her partner of twenty three years and vivian wondered don was a bos to dozens of women he ran alternet a progressive newsweb sight an he was a flirt it was easy for me to imagion that doon it miss onspoken signals of being a little too present a little too close a little too eager a little too en of those kinds of things she would seen it she would seen don's attention make women in comfortable at party s in restaurants and what would ent uphelpings i would catch hury and we would roll our eyes together a god man therewould be a sort of a bond there and it would gont be ant on things would go on this is don flirting with some women in front of you yah he was a flirt yes i knew he was a flirt i also really knew that did not have anything to do with us that had to do with a need of need for attention did that feel did you feel embarrassed by it of course of course but he hoad passd quickly it was usually very easy to move things along then i could step in i could sit up between i could nenow in gave her in conversation whatever riht would you talk to don about it rarely because i didnt think i bee believed yen by him ai think he sort of laughwoud off an say o you just donk gat it at's all en fun which i do yo think was his atitude i cha now was he soutso a couple ments ago when don told vivian that busved news was writing a story about him vivian was not surprised people who used to work for don at alternette were accusing don of sexually harassing them tivian read the article a number of women detailed encounters at don unwanted advances in appropriate touching sending them explicit emails vivian recognized don an some parts others thout they were describing a person shed never met mostly she had a particular experience reading that story that actually had nothing to do with don a memory came back to me what i was twenty eight that i'm sure i had not thought about since it happens she was training to be a psychologists with a bunch of young trenees at a clenic she is in the backgroom where the staff took breaks and wrote notes the supervise er was a manes virtually all the supervisors at the time wor in his forties oh maybe ven early fifties vivian was on the couch with a friends a women in her forties nd a two of them watched as many of the young psychology in turns women vivian's aged in ther twenties crowded around the superviser ther surrounding him an and sort of hanging on his words and leaning in and it is just got that ah no offense his words wort that interestenewhait is they were fine but oh my god and he was eating it up vet you could just see he loved this that i'm sitting a the back throug an the cut and a with this other womanlim she looks upte the cup cakes vivian lost it she loved this word it was perfeced and you understood immediately that that was meant to refer to the women who were surrounding absolutely absolutely ah and it i was really proud that tros basically say you are not one of them yu know i did not want to be one of them she is reasily sayin your cool and they are not exactly exactly we are grown up women they are not look i deat that is who i want to be that is were her mind went reading about her partner of two decades in the news the cu cakes vivian felt full of regret she regretted her contempt for the cup cakes she regretted her exceptance that this was the way it would always be between men and women men would have power and women would have to deal with that what i thougt interesting about this was vervivian learning the news about dons parked this memory that was not about don but in some ways it felt it had everything to do with don it explain something to her about who she is and how she is and choices and a sumptions she is made in her life now i want to tell you about another group of people i've been talking to the women who worked for gon including women who say they were harassed by him i talked with them s and thech shold me their don stories but they also did the same thing vivian tis they brought up specific experiences from their pass things that happened years ago because for them that stuff in the past feels related to their experiences thot hoverthe less few months of me to stories i keep wanting to hear more from the women who were in these news reports their broader history not just the bad experience they had with one man at an office or on a movy said but the other moments before the harassment because there is no me to moment that is actually separate from the rest of our lives to days show we are goin to do that five women tell their stories tivian and four women who worked for her partner don heasen over the course of many years at different times with he wide range of experiences we are goingto hear from each of them wanted a time about their experiences with dons and their experiences before don don resignd from the job a few months ago and told me the bord that oversees alternate insisted he could not talk on the record i can tell you some about his version of events bhat you will not be hearing from him 's not a story about him it is about them these five women what these women are doing is what i think many of us whave been doing lately they are doing it in ways i found braves invulnerable there rea valuating who they are how they have related to men how they came to think of certain things as normal it is a reckoning not just for men for women it is this american wife am cono joffy walt they with us h ent this is probably evident by now but just to say we will talk about sex in this show not just its etxistence but some of the specifics and there are some moments of abuse take this as a heads up look at the women who worked for don at alternet beginning with act one dianna the list started when dianna was eight years old the first on it was fase from the eighteen diana got a postcard of him that year when her family went to universal studios she put a puffy red heart sticker on it took it with her during the day slepptd with it at night and i actually and 'm eight and i felt as in a die if i never met him i actually thought i would die i was i will i will cease to exist if i do not get to meet this person the next one made her cry he was twelve was she diana called her aunt rose from the basement distresse she would written him letters dedicated a song to him on the radio and nothing no response ant rose was quick to deliver advice this is the way boys are they do not understand you they are dumb they do not get you your strong as marand into pend in and dot just is never in a makes enstimen ant rose explained it would be diana's job to mak sense of things to men if she was gona had relation ship i them it d never be easy and ad be on her to figure it out boys were too dumb to do it for themselves ja's dad was a minister jia liked mon to pithon and had a car and very few opinions he was incredibly sweet and he was very much whatever you want to do what what do you wanto do not promotivated on his own i was ik come along with me when diana went away to college ja said all come too when she broke up with him his mam called hermam to ask if there was any way they could get back together chris worked at the dollar store in them all chris wanted more from his life dina was nineteen and got him a job on the other side of them all at a sam goody she used to work at she wanted more for him too he was funny ad moody and he was the first person diana had sex with mark wanted a job in film or tev but nobody wanted to give him film or tev jobs it was his idea to move to new york and once they were there diana got a job first as a bookkeeper mark got no job she called his friends his friends friends and found mark and itee job which he hated she found him another job at a magazin he worked there for the next teny years diana moved out three weeks before nine elevent there was the german the as raily with the burger join men seemed to want wives and dina did not want o beu wife men elsa seemed to want her but had no thoughts about what else that might look tiy do not get you hermam would say on the phon you have to show them how to be with you diroch war was starting and was the presidential race dinna volunteered for the howard dine campaign hihad a rally in new york before her twenty eighth birthday the while she was at the rally ah the sky comes up to me and he is got a reporter's pad and he said hey after he is done talking an know can i talk to you and i said sure and he said your volunteera said ya and we talked for really long time and i actually got to an argument with him i'm about deniscasinich he was pro siaunderstood but come on that got could never win and then he said well i can have your emeladress all e'll send hyg the article when it is done and i was sure yu know when you writing for whetever he was ow'n the executive editor of alternet don he ison alternette was not a major publication but diana knew it she read it all the time the next day don senter his article very pro dean and a personal note to her see how much you influenced me already and i's well that is cool i just convincedis editor guy that is all i was that is really cool what made your change your mind it started up this emale conversation he asked about her wat she hoping to get into politics what was her job did she it what else did she wanto do it seemed really kind in a little bit flirtatious but i was fine with that i was i liked having this superinteresting compelling man interested in me don lived in california but had an apartment in new york for work diana could not quite guess his age she thought maybe mid forties he was fifty six he would becoming out to new york again did she want to get dinner a kind of figured it as a dat and i did feel flirtatious with him i did feel whos is fen it was fun he walked her home they talked about the party she was plenting for her twentieth birthday where she should have it they made out outside her apartment in the next day don asked her out again dinner and this time back to his apartment they were making out got neeked and when she felt him push inside her diana was startled it was abrupt and he was not wering a condem in dianna's experience some one always went and got the condum that had never happened before she felt slow she wasfloating in a silent conversation with herself ah to should i say something ah the get's pay i mean i do not really want a stoptings he is older she thought tas that are not getting around be nice to him youre own birth control you are not getting axbert erd right now you are having a good time you are fine riht it last just do this it was new and adventurous and thats who diana wanted to be plus she felt powerful in that moment this is something thi am bestowing upon him this useful gift this useful body or something i ylike i did feel that way and kid of it was doing him a favor and he steemed very grateful and and i'd not hav that ecurieds before with twenty five old why no as it turns out a different real different yi definitely felt this was o hadr thing for him ah she thought about the condem thing again on the way home dianna's story about don that he was a good guy a grown up self actualized man who as taken by her was asso a story about herself she was powerful interesting could change his mind on important issues the fact that he never even thought to ask about protection it just did not make sense and i myg default was to trust that it was going to yokat it did not make sense to me and i made sense of it and that carried through the entire relation don sarta giving her work he wanted her to help manage a big project for alternat diana said yes don thought she was a poor fit for her corporat jab she agreed when he was in town they get dinner spend the night or week and which she loved and then he would leave which she has loved don did not need things from her as her other bay friends had it was the opposite he set things up for her he had an apartment for her to crash and he had contact she should meet he bought her her first mack lacktop he helped to quit smoking dinner was on him and he did at all without demanding she would be a wife it was seven months later that dianna learned don had a wife a partner actually a distinction without a difference as far as diana was concerned since don explained that this was a woman he would been with for years vivian you heard from earlier they ownet a house together and she did not know about diana she says it was one of their first fights hblieve you lied to me and hewas i did not lie to i n ever lied to you an i was a lying by ol mition is still lying and he was you knew and i'll never forget this word he said you you have been colluding with me all along and i was i do not think but she went back to old emals to reference is don would make to his domestic situation maybe she hadt wanted to knal she stopped sleeping with him she kept working for him by now theyre working on a book together that meant seeing him and when she saw him she would inevitably sleep with him again she liked him their conversations their connection he wasn'n throne by me in a way that felt other men had been he was not he just was not afraid of me he saw her as she wanted to be seen she seed in the secret affair ignored his daily phone calls home to vivian diana wnt ed more time with don more contact as he did with her he could be annoying about it she started a fulder called his where are you emals he did not lack of contact were the wrong kind of contact he would say why did you emal me about personal stuff there is a work in fo in here i need to know what is happening i need to know where things are i need to know what werre working on an ni oce o i said in the workimel why is not there anything emotional here do not youd love me i guess you do not care about me ye would send these supervicti me emels that was also the point where he started talking to me more about about the staff and his frustrations at work in his i doft want to do all this anymhere but everyone is that worse for me is incompetent that i have to be in there all the time doing all these things for them by now diana had met a lot of don staff he would starteflying her out to california as a consultant for alternete she would see him in his office he was just a fery demanding poss just she yelling at people why cannot you get this right in what is wrong with you diana tried to make sense of this behaviour he was angry and insecure this was not the easy going confident man she would signed up for she wanted to be supportive the way he would been supportive of her but this felt all new to her if wehad been to an event together he would watch how much i was drinking and would accuse me later of drinking too much from being too tired i'm to one have sects with him and starting a fight about that whul you mean why not why you tired i had a really da hs whel you knew you were seeing me to night why did you have a o it why did you do much im well whyn i was working for ye and too you known i would defend myself and then he would get really a sertiv and red faced eyesbold jing thigs poppin and he was sceryo tit when he was angry diana started giving in to sects not i do not feel it by love you sects this was sex to end a fight having sex could shut down the behaviour that was not making sense the parts that did not fit in to diana's story of a powerful woman who was having adventures with a man who was not challenged by her power tat too the dinner anatia had just started at alternette she was still getting away of the land she was bright ambitious ready for her chance and here it was the staff was friendly the bos don was too sometimes don was very very mecurial very very moody some times it would be compliments in praise other times it would just you would be furious about the pettiest thing but she generally escaped his anger anitia learned early how to anticipate his moods keep it professional she kept her distance a couplemonths in the whole alternette staff got together for some meetings every one came don flew a couple people out from new york including a consultant for alternette named diana anitia did not know diana really she seemed nice after the meetings they all went out to dinner and anitia saw that diana was sitting next to don but made nothing of that it was anitia's collague laura who noticed at first here is laura and during that dinner i i glanced over an notice that she was cutting up the meat on don's plate his stake or something and i was just what i was just lie what as happening this s this is strange to me cunting his meat she was leaning over his plate mea yet they were sitting right next to each other in a tight is he big table but a crowded restaurant they were sitting very close together and she was just leaning over it was her plate but ameta's not normal yet just not normal it is just why why would he need that why would she need to do that why was he letting her do that did he asked her to do it i do not know yot ven dow do was something about it that was just very profoundly i disturbing oh was weird was she is cutting his meat for him anitia eventually noticed it too and she could not figure out what is up with this woman i just do not understand this diamic the manual i'd constructed on how to navigate n dea with ton i was just flipping throgh ll the page tos no no no no what no i have no gied for this u were to place this behavior laura could not place it either here is really no rationalization i could think of no possible reason for that to be a thing happening wrighte that that moment the made sad be yn the'r sleeping together but it still did not make sent after that dinner laura and anitia left and never mentioned it the dintacke to each other about it wer any one else in the office anitia says it just did not feel fun office gossit i felt something she did not want anything to do with she did not know anything about the woman sitting in that chair next to don but aniia had always known she did not want to be in that chair iced three anitia most other girls quite being friends with boys earlier but anitia was thirteen and she still liked her friends that summer she hung out wit the same boy she always had in the same places the kitchen her friends basement playroom or wewould all go o the pool together and i had this tide eyed bathing su this one piece and you most mother friends were wering bekeenis but was no i'm good at the snackbar they would get pobsicls they are always be talk about the scen at the pool i talking about differen girls hey wuld occasionally be part of conversation i think they probably rainded in when i was aroun but there would occasionally becomments and they were they they had named some one the hypnotizer there is this title for some woman it would have been nothing if it was the other girls they talked about a passing thing but this one persisted for weeks it got to a point a recall were they talked about enough that as ik oh who wis she i wante to be onin on it iwas sore to me and they ere all criptic about it ther o the ypnotizer the hypnotizer oh she is here ear did you se the hypnotizer a and i cannot morri found out but eventually found at it was me it was the first time anatia had the feeling there was her and there was some one else she had not known was there a first on who looked good to these boys her friends i guess a part of me was pleased by that but the more prevalent feeling was whiplash they were talking about me in front of me i's there was the me that was present in there interacting with them and then there was ust other separate objectified body it just feels this whole other person enters the room another person who has ou yet ah wuller i guess o fundamentally ive i felt the same but suddenly i had to reckoned with the fact that i did not look the same to other people it was obvious to anatia how to reckon with that she needed to crush that other person she did not wont to wear the tiedi bating suit ever again she slouched she were baggy clothes it was not a decision or anything it was just instinct she watch the girls in bichinies that summer considered if they somehow had the op posite instinct or maybe they had made a decision to actively try to merge the two girls the one with breasts and the one from before it really seemed easy for some of them they welcomed it and a part of you wishes that i could do that he sort of own it in you use it a power and and it just never struck me as a power it does it feels a false power it feels if if that is somehow gitting me a tention it could turn that is not a safe kind of power to traff agat by the time anaia met don she would not have been able to say if wearing loose clothing was her fashion sense or strategy she was twenty three years old she would been guarding against that separate person the hypnotizer for a decade by that point alternete was anatia's first real job the first time she had a desk that was hers the first time she learned a male collague was getting paid more than her for the same work the first time she asked for a raise from her boss don which did not go how anatia expected yes i build this holcase and i get in there and i'm nervous i how my opening fore where i'm just i've i've been doing actson why and the quality the work i've been doing iven wee kan really hard ah and i make you knowin in it it it is it is hard to survive in the city on such a low salary he just latched on to that me can ileand an hipmis o you having trouble pain rent and i rere that specifically caus it was my rent was oddly personal and unnecessary and out of wa field and i was completely disarmed ah i did not know how to respond i think i just sort of stuttardand was no it is not that he was not offering to pay her rent directly just did she need a salary increase to help pay her rent which anetia did not want a talk about i do not remember whether i said know i'm not having trouble paing ret i think i tried to avoid answering that because i did not want i felt that was none of his business but when i tried to shift the conversation back to this about being compensated i do not remember if he got angry angry but he was definitely visibly displeased and a he he did not want to give me a race instead he offered her a title change wait but had you what would have happened had you said ye i am having trouble paying my rent he would ave you would have won would woun' mean won what have want a little a little corner of of more power over me we but it would he have paid it would you have hadly money probably would have aso you would have fon you would have gotten more money no i would have lost anitia felt don was not talking to her but to the hypnotizer that he did not want to engage her as a professional discussing her compensation but as an attractive young woman struggling with her rent he did not want to be a bos paying for her work but as saviour paying for her life anitia did not want that can a help maybe's cun o petty butos you were not in a win you do not get to have this she one but she did not get ha rase act for the cliff the summer venitia's first year at alternete don left for several weeks of sebatical a friend had offered don the use of his vacation house in big sir california he had it out and wrote diana asking her to join him it is the cliff of the universe he wrote what some one calls the greatest meeting of land and see diana wrote back bring me soon please don flew her out picked here up from the air port the drove to the house together a we went to bed and started fooling around and ah he stops and he says we probably should not have sex and i said how come don said he had an as t i a sexually transmitted infection he would tad it for a long time had not had symptoms in years and i was just started i actually got dizzium hold up what wait we have been having sec without condos for two years and now we were telling me that you and he was s not a bi deal i've had it since i was sixteen and i was it is definitely a big focking deal and i got really angry i cannot believe you would risk my health this way and that aout this is really fucked up and he was why are you getting sut about this his is no i a deal i was yes it most certain this is not as yet and heis cannot understand why i am usset at all eventually done did seem to get that dino was upset and began to comfort her she calmed down wanted to go to sleep he am started wanted o fool around again and n ot a frthis you rat now the soft feels and he was wha widow of jepsex an whatever and then he was we can have antlesex and i was blank blank no she did not want to do that and he we were naked and bed he was spooning me and he made a move he was going to penetrate me and i jumped up and yelped what the fok and i was what are you doing and he was wee me what i mi doingam just to ouknow i wone to be with you won am and i was your starting depressure me and it is starting to make me really a comfortable this is mesed up and he flipped out he stood up and hages sstarted screaming at me he was how can you say that how can you say that impressuring you i am the most feminoust man when it and that is focked up he stear screaming at me the eyes bolding of but screaming i am the most feminous man yes and then he the bedroom was sort of right on the other side of the kitchen and he goes in the kitchen and just start slamming stuff and throwing stuff and i'm just hearing shut smashing in the other room and i am naked in some dude's bed in facking big sir i do not know how to get out s and ieventually just stopped i just sat there the whole time i did't know you are an you were in the bed yet i just say to the bed he came back eventually and supt with his back to me which was his cultholder move and i just laid there thinking i do not know what is going to happen next because i i really did not want to challenge him i just had to start making sense of everything around me and being okey with everything if you'rde not going to challenge him or talk to him et then how are you going to make senseshut this out do not thing about this again and do whatever you can did not make cit happen again diana would manage manage her feelings his temper managed them away from explosive moments this is what it meant to be close to some one managing a relationship was a role diana had practicin he made sense to her i have been told my whole life that i was and have difficult relationships with men that not none of this was goingto be easy that they warned me that this was how my relationships were going to be they were going to be very difficult in challenging and this was oke that was hiw was goingto be for me i took three years for diana to break up with don after that she was not angry when she did just tired and sad she told him she loved him but she could not keep doing this he was not angry either she thought he would be but he was gentle he said he knew the day would come they both cried after that she would still run in to him a professional or social events they were friendly a few years after they broke up diana went to a protest up town and my friends were staging part of the protest or i went to to be supportive and i ran into dawn there and he was well this is sove that we are just kind of chid chatting i had not seen him in a while and whatever whatever and were kind of walking along with a protest and talking to different people there was a young woman walking near by with a reporter's note pad she was looking around and quickly scribbling notes and i actually watched tik i felt watching the terminar a little bit he just looked and a zeerot in on her and just belined over to her and said who he writing for and she is oh i miss steven't and heis you do not have a place for this article yet i'll give you a place for ou went pitch me and she was you who are you and he introduces himselfs as all raters a go would be greaterat for alternate he really just came out of nowhere this is christon christon was a determined twenty one year old who bought the same breakfast sandwhich from the same cafe every day because she knew what she liked and she had no need for wasting time christon had never actually heard of alternate but she knew she wnted to be reporter and thiski had a business card and she did not i was a jernal as om studen undergrad at and why you don told her to send him her article and if it was good he would publish it christon said she definitely would diana was off to the side watching and i got mad because it just seemed gross and i heard that tone of voice and i had remembered how he had said things that to me i'll give you a dot i'll help you i'll support you and i got angry i just looked it awoes i ca' f an believe you and he is what and i was lak otit her i'm geindone the story they had created together had just been obliterated they were not co creators this was his story diana was a set piece ye it made me sick t histo i was not that special an seeing her kind of brightness and enthusiasm wou someone was to give me an opportunity cool i was angr angry ah got diana left went home christon went home too she wrote and rewrote her article until it was too in the morning and she knew she had to get it off to done and i was excited yet i thought wout whata this is a crazy oun me kno chance incident and maybe this 'll be good and turned into something and it it did turn in to something coming up the story starts over but it is going to go differently next time that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our programm continues it is this american life am connajoffee walt to days show five women we wented to take one of the meto stories were you hearabout encounters women have with men who abused their power in the work place and expand that to look at the lives of the women before that

at anoay you christon isi going to come back you need to meet some one else first act five tanna tonna was asked to have an opinion about anita hell it was nineteen ninety one and she was in the third gread her opinion was that it was wrong because she knew that was the opinion she was supposed to have the opinion tana actually had was not when she imagined the adults were asking for i rember thinking that it was not that big god deal but i think that my natural instant an mee agan i was a child was maybe people were going treaking how li bit too much maybe i will not shoud be a little bit more chill by tenth greed she was stronger in her conviction she knew about sex and she knew about feminism and she believed that if monicaluinsky wanted to have sex with some one or below them or whatever actually happened in the oval office that was her choice men had been allowed to follow their bliss forever they went a little too far but that had been corrected and now tana could see things had swung too far in the other direction oh nobody can av sex any more that is terrible that was the impression i got i just in vision the you mus work place as a bunch of bure crowded funn

jeff was middle aged miserable she would heard his wife kicked him out a coorker said he found jeff in the shop one morning waking up surrounded by beer bottles he made tona uncomfortable but he was pitiful that it felt unreasonable to attach any value to her discomfort when her friend at work he guy her age told her jeff always talks about you it is a really creepy and he goes jeff always talks

a section at alternat they recently created about sex it did not seem totally out of nowhere that toward the end of the ride he sort of pon a casually put his hand on my knee and said something i hear you and your room made prety while the crazy sex lives i think i said something goilikes precrazy or something that id just on some level i very passily did nothing and did you feel bad neutral just whatever it felt bad but allso was ecstatic because i felt a had a reall shot ot the job she called her friend to thank her she said as you warned me he got a little sectually herassy but i'm excited i think i got it she did and from the beginning tona understood that her attractiveness to don meant she would be seen rather than ignored tona was seen by don all the time heu'd take pictures of her sometimes when she was not looking and send them to her he was generous with his attention and controlling yusually at the same time there is no way to tease thet to apart and she accepted them both he appreciated her legs which he told her he did not seem to love her personality i remember once we were at when she was tona would you have to say you cannot even talk and i was really six whi coni e coughed a little bit s i had the flue r something and i remember he in front of every one fate cought yhes o all you do as avr cough that is all you ever doe that the only thing you can ever even say at a party don rebbed tona's shoulders and asked if she wanted another drink when she said no he grabbed tana's wrist twisted her arm and pushed her into a table het to be physically separated from her he apologized later and she forgave him easily don was old to her pervy but again sort of pathetic i thelt dan appropriate to read him as anything else i remember there was one woman in the office who started freaking out and crying because don told her that the color of her shirt looked nice on her in my reaction was allright everyone i ron's being hysterical here t's nice color sur chilledtifuck out was my in her thot there is another woman who was really fougty actually when she found the porn print it out in the princer she as that now we are all a giggling about iecause we all knew who it was a obvious and she sent this holariaus emale to all of editorial that was something to te effect of whoever decided to print up porn and the office pec substain from wy who did prontout te pornt it was don obviously one of tana's coorkers another young woman quit because of don's bullying liks ravelled fit is i can handle that bulling in the sectual harassma she could it did you feel canny prout of that yes i did i can take it tana was the cool girl who could take it she was comfortable in that rule it gave her more power professionally to have the attention of the most powerful person in the office even if it meant accepting the attention that was not professional when don kept telinghary wented to buy her a black cocktail dress he thought would look great on her body i just hught it was really a kind of sad or bitter sweet or sommy pathetic he thot i needed for him to buy me this dress when i coul have justbought it myself and midway through that indignant thot tana felt guilty don wanted to be generous to be a wealthy charming man who could give her beautiful things this was not the way she saw him which made her feel bad for him and then actually did and e buying it n this is where i wonder was i not clear enough about setting dout boundaryies i bought the dress i told him o ya guess what i bought this dress t have nigety dollars don seemed to pleased but then she did not the dress she the way it fit her which she told him ad hewas o give it to me i'm goin to give it to my girl friend it all look better on her because do two years of yogat she has curves and muscles that are in separate places than you do wol thet crazy rit that is pretty crazy i when you say this is where i feel confused about what is not they feel confused about if i did not sat clear enough boundaries to more clearly communicate that this exchanged met me uncomfortable that is what you are suppose d to do you kno you say no that first time don drove her home and put his hand on her knee tna did not say now instead she entered into an unspoken agreement between cool girl and flirty boss he would look after her career and he flirt with her while he was doing it the rules were cleared a tana you do not say no saying no would destroy the agreement from which both parties have something to gain you do not ask why d you went a buy me this dress you do not say please do not rub my back or please stop taking pictures of me you do not reply when h e says by emale what he wants for his birthday sex with a mysterious blond women and then adds or you could just put on a wak when don asked tona to his new york apartment for meetings she followed the agreement she said nothing there was no office in new york it was easy to pretend this was appropriate one night they met they talked about work and then don wanted to keep panging out he was getting hontily and we were drinking and he was holdon just one second when wy got wit fors to get to come out wat comes back out runs back out to the table with a a paper bag filled with photographs and he says i know these are photos from my path whee sorts showing the all these old photographs from the seventies neighties nd there blike bastically almost exclusively s very conventuonally beautiful blond women se was this was my excoal friend at this point this was my excrol from at this point was arit cool lot of blonds ono what why you showing me this stouh and then he gets the a photo then he says and this is an artistic photograph of my penus and he hands me this photo and it is a black and whi photograph of an erect penus i just ted it casually aas conta look out i and handed back to him i captain macbell to show me picture of his dick tit as li yet yicu did this did seem a violation of the agreement i mean it was an artistic picture was black and whit it was from the seventies i mean i duffinly did not say hey whati'd love to see right now a picture of erect penus from the seventys tas definitely not the most appropriate thing to do to a female subordinate right right yes right thehadtims very true i are you still doubting if that was appropriate or not it was obviously an appropriat i doufly didn enjoy the experience i told a million people about a contemporaneously heas guess whose dick i just saw against my well rite out but also we were in his apartment as late at night we were drinking it just seems e sixty something your old man whos in charge of twenty five different peopll she just cone him know that you do not show i young female subordinate a picture of your penus evenus it is from the seventies even if it is late at night and even if she does not say hey this is wrong there are certain standard of behavior that seem these should be obvious to everyone but it seemed they were not obvious to don don seemed to think it was appropriate to show her that picture toma thought maybe there was no unspoken agreement between them maybe the agreement and the boundries of that agreement were something tona imagined on her own in the beginning as a new imply with no experience tona's power was fer attractiveness to don she tried to use that to her advantage it was the same power that a natia did not want to use when she asked don for a ras the power of the hypnotizer tona engaged anatia did not it cost them both in different ways new people came in to alternete and tona trained a lat of them many of them were young women and one of them came to tana and said we have got it do something about don' behavior and i said a kitting you are not going to change anything i do not thik it is a good idea i cannot do this tona felt for this women but she did not understand her and why she thought any one would care about this she said this is not news that this happens it was ye dued whut you expects yet you were your parents in the car that day ray the young woman was christon th an why you student who don spotted at the protest terminator while teana watched now christon was full of urgency and she was ready to fight acet six christon christon was thirteen and she got a note wat she never actually saw the note even though it was apparently written to her it was intercepted by a teacher but she knew what it said because every one in school new it was from the boys loek cross team dear christon you have nice boobs you should use them christon remembers how absurd it seemed and laughing with her friends at the note and the boys youuse your boobs we were joking about better yo put better put him to yu the boys across tea needs em what are they went to do with em how cun boys how could you use my boobs on on the lacrassteam it was just stupid wone of the boys who signed the note was christon's boy friend but thet shu never talked about it because they never talked because they were in seventh grate and that is what it meant to be boy fron a girl friend the guidan's countser came for christon in the middle of class they walked to her office and she asked christon what she thought of the note and i was o know i think they are just being stupid boys and she was your victim of sexual harassmet and i i just remember being feeling really weare that she said that to made becaue it sounded serious and i just i just just cannot we just let it go one of these guies as you are boy friend what does he think that this is cu and ni was i do not know he i do not even know hit he is an idiat he is not going to be my boy friend any more and then i felt she was angry with me because i wasn''t freeking out about this latter but that is how i fell you were not performing victim of sexual hryesyet i was just performing child in a room i'm twelve and you are n'n a dull talking about my body and boys and a someone comfortable i remember i even zipped my hoody u reall to real tight allhway to the top cause i thought that she would make a comment about my boob shelling er something it is not christon could not imagine some girl being upset by that note she could and she could imagine some girl might enjoy that note but she was the girl she owned the boobs they were talking about that every one was now talking about at a one w and then there was agaem thing in the auditoriom an this girll who i did not know at all tat dow nacks to me and was a heart about the note our uo q and all that kind of shit was just making me uncomfortable i was just gam fine i did not care what i remember caring about well the guidance countser for not sjust letting it be a stupidkid thing and making it into at an attempted rape or something is that howfel it is a bit it just felt they wanted me to cry and and act it was the worst that ever happened me and i was violated when christon was raped a few years later it took her a while to use that word he took advantage of me is what christin said at first when that did not feel right she said he is an asshole but that did not seem right either she would no word to somerise the experience some thing that i did not that was wrong but it was not what i imagine drape would be and it was not as gary as i thought that it would be she was at her friend's house for a party it was late people were going to sleep she climbed up to the top of a bunk bed to get away from an older guy who was creeping her out hriston was drunk she remembers her face felt numb she remembers hearing some one binging on the door which she leader found out he had locked before he climbed up into the bunk bed and took her closhes off she said no but he had sects with her anyway sex that did not feel the raihtword either christon notised her friends doing the same thing describing ther experiences with boys in different tones in different arrangements and then there was the friend who would not say anything at all atout what happened except she was upset and didn one a talk about it and eventually she did explain he said cam i just put it in you for a second he friends had no he did anyway that is when christon said she felt she had not understanding to share all those times henwe were mad at those boys because of what they did to us we were mad because they raped therewas several of my friends where it touck us a really long time to put the word to it when she added them up all ther experiences christon felt boys were aiming their behaviour it would come in just under the line of something that had a name they'r playing a game to see what they can get away with is that is what i kind of realize from it the the way that a guy is goin to screeo over most likely is not going to be he is gon a rapyou in an alley it is going to be something that people might doubt and it is not going to look the worst examples of things or the most clear cut and it is intentional and thass why it is scarry they tell the actually i think maybe theyd do not y they do not believe that what they did was wrong becaus it does not look what they consider rape samens for you rape the word was congruent with the way she felt about it that she decided was what mattered and i think ma be maybe after that i was just ready i do notknow i i was not waiting any more to call something what it was four years later christon meant don at a protest graduated from college and accepted a javit all to mit she was twenty one altern auts youngest imploy done loved to tell the story of how they met how he would found her on the sidewalk yet he he liked very much that he had discovered me i defitly got the sen that he liked feeling he was doing me this huge favor and i was his prodigay or something and then it evolved from oh i found her on the sidewalk ligit was this cute thing too do not you dare publish anywhere else and the amound of control that i realized he had over me was up was concerning early when done invated her to meet at his apartment christon did not think as tin a had well there is no new york office that makes a certain him in a sense christon thought i know what this is i know why he wants me here i know why he is ordering su she and offering me weed and repeatedly asking me if i his music and he wanted me to he that i was young and thought i was cool he was hanging out this young person who bas having a good time with him and i think a lot of the shameless way he would look at her talk about my body was away for him to a kind of force me to see him as a sexual being i'm not a sixty something your old man with no sexuality and if you think i'm goin ta prove to you that i'm not by forcing you to realize that i do have i do have sexual thoughts and urges and and also there about you a friend said to me recently relating a different incident she said forcing some one to be part of your boner against their will it is just a smarter way of forcing some one i thought about christon when she said that how alert christon was to a violation that was not definitely over the line christon found it alarming how lad back don was how he behaved as if their interactions were completely normal one day she was to meet with him in a coffee shop dawn and some other colleagues christon warked in don was already there i think i had pretty much just sat down and he was on his computer you knows real casual oh i i saw some one on the inner nag she looked just you hem me show you when he is picking his tine pulling up this picture and im o god what a what s what as good as he going to show me and he pulls up just a picture of a completely make id woman a porn star o something was fake braston blond hair and i was that i cannot even imagine when elook on my face must have been likemy response was she looks nothing me christon stood up said i'mini gav a cigarette and i was oh yah col o this you see every blond chick in the porn you watch for mines you hav me great this behaviour had a name sexual harassmen christon did not doubt it i always knew wit was wrong it was not i ever a thought is this normal i ni knew th now this is not normal and and is bat but having a name for this behaviour did not sove anything for christon it just made her angry because it iseemlike there was nothing she could do about it she had no previous experience no connections in the industry n she needed the jop i ye always only vet know if i should say this i used to to talk about fan to sees of kidnapping him and torturing him and im forcing him to transfor money into my bank accown and but i would jus always joke about the things i would do to that man that would just make him feel uncomfortabl and terrifi i that is what i wanted to do more than anything christon's revenge fan to see is very similar to the plot of the moving nine to five which christon has never seen because it came out in nineteen eigty before she was born all of which is to say this is an old story hrist 's anger blet i gled into her thoughts for wor she remembers being at a conference and intervieing an older man guying his seventies about drug policy and at the end i said i was going to smoke a cigarette and he said you do not wanto get cancer in those boobs do you and i was just and sgot up and went outside and smoked a cigarette and told all the people off the conference an you believe at this dying a sor man just sid that to me it was the same thing i fell with thon it was this older man he was just kind of i'm going to force the fact that i have a sextuality on you tike i'm going to force you to reckon with it by making you the yobject of my sexual desire lead her that day christon was walking with her alternate colleague yan frall not don yawn yawn was at various points dons seconding command and we were walking down the sidewalk and he was on the ah he was on the laft of me and traffic was on the other side of him nd i told him what happened and he said oh it must that you must have taken it as a compliment kind of though right or something that and i just had this image of pushing him into the street that was vivid it almost freaked me out i was i came very close to maybe killing this person but that is how full of rage i was by that point i was just about to explode dian does remember christin telling him about this but does not recall responding in this way christon started talking she told the female coorker named laren about how don was treating her laren was of it older seemed together but she dn't kn what to do she did have one idea of some one who could help the woman laren actually just met at a book party the woman in her thirties who had worked with don in the past her name was diana laren asked te talk to dianna dianna remembers she started telling me about the experiences this new staffer was having with him this young woman dianna hadn' been with don for years at this point laren did not know they would ever been together but laren told dianna part of what hard about this is the new staffer is young and inexperiencse don ment er when she was a student on the street at a protest i was you got to be fuckangating me i was fucking there i should have taken her by the wrist pulled her away with me and said do not i will find you another job iou know and i felt such gilt over that dianna began cicling through the moments all the choices she would made that she thought were just hers choices she assumed whuld only affect her and her relationship with don she thought specifically about a call she got years ago just two months after she would broken up with don it was a professional contact who said she wanted to ask diana about something serious and then the woman on the phon said that her organization had put on an event with alternet and a young staffr had just complained that don sectually harasked her the woman on the phon said to diana you have worked with don dos that sound him dianna paused to consider it before answering i hae a lot of shame it a lot but my great ashame was i i cannot pictured him doing something unwanted was what i said and i cu i defended him nd i'd thin kind of him i tit i did not say i believe this person but was that was that true for you at the time that you could not imagine him doing that n ye but i there was a tiny part of me that wondered if that could be true and i justin what a deal with it and nothing was ever done i that it never went further dinna and christon went out for drinks diana listened cristin talked diana said she wanted to help in whatever way she could and diana prayed that cristin would not ask her what happen to you everything felt it would bleow up everyone would know that i was complicit that i helped him how could people want to be friends with me after that how coul eople trust may professoral extraties after knowing that about me how could what would my mob think the're all go to think of a fraud that i i' not tilli ted that i'm not that these i deas are my own or something and i ruld just have to to shrink away dianna helped connect christon with the layer the lawyer told christon it would be very hard to win a law suit and keep her job she asa said she would pully need more evidence not to when christin thought to ask tanna she knew don had been harassing her too cristin does not remember tona saying this is not news that this happens she remembers tona being kind and thing she did not want o betrayed don he would given her a chance and a career when no one else would have she said she did not wanto do it and then what did you do i i just kita gave up christin's apartment fletted and she got a pay out from her landlord when the money came in she quit alternete without ever using the words she believed to be true when i i when i laghed i did not say to him and leving because you sexually harasked me and i hate you i was too affected by the idea that he was giving you a chanc e that and it is true he did give us a chance that no one else did i mean but i guess i i thought li i i had paid my du and and it was not that the pay off was no longer there i seven vivian four years after tana told christin that their experience was not news to any one suddenly it was news a reporter named quorrolewis at busfeed news reported a story about sexual harass men alligations at alternete she talked to christin and tana and dianna and she talked to other women you have not heard from here don denied most of the alligations in the buzs feed story some he said were mis characterized for instance he does not remember twisting tana's arm but did say he was rubbing her shoulders and stopped when he saw it made her uncomfortable he does not remember showing tana a photograph of his penis but says he does halv such a photograph and some women may have seen it he said he often took friendly photoes in the office and when he commented antna's body it was out of concern that she was getting too skinny thephoto he showed christin he said was not a naked pornstar but a clothed movy star when i contucted don he said he told dianna about his relationship with vivian his partner on their very first date and that his memory of their time at big sir is different from hers beon that he did not respond to specific questions but asked that i include an apology from him in which he says along the way i strove but apparently failed to treat every one with the respect an consideration they deserved i regret causing harm and am reckoning with it some of the accusations against me are untrue but i deeply regret those that are i apologize to any one i offended and treated badly before the busfeed news story came out vivian says don told her he needed to talk to her about something to prepare her vivian told me she knew what it wase me two stories coming for don she pictured how their conversation would go when don sat her down it was not what she would imagined he told her ten years ago he would hadnan affair with dianna o an you de you did not he had not told you about it before he had not told no this is all i am assimilating all of this in the pastmonth well yet i what crase i me bi jus sort of screamed you have know wha to wyefe do immediately you did oh god yesshe wanted to understand why he did this she tried to remember what was happening in his life around that time and it was a lot moving his elderly parents trying to take responsibility for a sister who was ill and suffering a sacotic break his own health ashes vivian is a therapis and from don vivian solicited details assembled details as a therapist does for myself ame this was melplaying thorough as for him this was just i have got to make sense of this somehow i've

jobidon's disastrousaftanistand policy left millions under the rule of the talibat and got thirteen american soldiers killed but the medioto care neo gets hammered for telling the truth about gender and more charges are on their way for donal trump i venture this is the benchbarro sho tho da shosponserbak's pres we pen thousands of my listerus have already secured the nuber getta join them expresspe piansi com fleshman yesterdayand askcan deto california the families thirteen service members who are murdered in a terrorist attack at coble air port in two thousident twenty one held a press conference along with the seenior member of the house forn affairs comitte congresment deral isa from orange county whell they they appeared at eskandito city hall an they called on te bidnadministration to give them to answers and informed the public as to how their loved ones actually died in this terrorist blast this is still the single most agreegious act i have ever seen up president undertake the cowardly pusilanimous and disgusting pull out from afganistan wi that any plan whatsoever the complete collapse ofafganistan to the taliban the millions people left behind the hundreds to thousandsof americans were left behind in enemy hands the green card holders were not able to get out the translators were left to be murdered the people falling from wheal wells american soldiers being blown up at the air port because proper security was not actually guaranteed it was factless it was ridiculous in jobidon has never paid the political price for it jobidon's approvalrating dumped into the forties that pointet as never quite recover but he has never played a reo political price for it simply because in two thousand and twenty too te election became all about various senate candiates whore hand chosen by his political opponents but the real story of jobidon's presidency is not about the economy it is not even bout hunterbido the real story of jobidon's presidency is incalpslated in the arrigans the egotism the disgusting self involvement of the president of the united states in presiding over the greatest forn policy disaster of my lifetime and then just blithely talking it away it really is discusting and the way that this person who was perceived as warm and generaand fuzzy and cub pleave the gui who nuzzles small children for no reason that any one can comprehend the fact that this person was cold and calculating not just about the the running away from a twenty year commitments and the sacrifice of a country to the taliban not just that he was cold and calculating about that but that he really did not care what happens the people who got left behind including american soldiers could not be more evident and that was certainly evident from the testimony of the gold star family members and wonded soldiers who actually were at this press conference yesterday and the meda did not pay this any where sort of attention they would of if the president of the united sate edonald j trump because again it under scores what konoperson jobines jobidon is not a good person jobidon is the kind of person who ignores o four year old grand child four four years if he thinks it is politically beneficial for hm to do jobidon is the kind of person who is entire career has lied about others is the kind of person who slanderd e a man who is involved in a car crash with his wife in which his wife and one of his children were killed and he slandered that person as a drunk driver for thirty years that is the ten er person the jobidon is jobidon is a person who cares first and foremost about himself and that is perfectly obvious in the way that he treated tese gold star family members remember in two thousand fifteens o thousand sixteen when donal trump was running for president of the united states the first time he got into a widely publicized spat with kayser con whose gold star family member who was actually a speaker at the democratic national convention talking about how much he disliked donald trumpet all the rest and how donal trump was a recist and his enophobe an ll and all of this and donal trump went at him and tis became a major issue of contention in the two thousand sixteen election campagn jobidon is currently but he is not candidate he is currently the presient of the united states hofs the president of the united states when thirteen american service members were murdered in cobbl and the treatment of these gold star family members was it egregious and disgusting and the media do not care they do not care these gold star family members are of no consequence to them no one knows their names now one gives them coverage these are not people who ur ginose on the nightly news an ir can see interviews with wounded soldiers those wounded soldiers yoon't get interviews with them if there is a a a peculiar belief that donal trumpetst on something really really but youre member during the trump presidency supposedly he did not pay proper omage at normandy they did not go out on to the beece or something cause it was raining and this widely reported by jeffrey golberig at the elanticat any real support and it turns out the story really had nothing to it where is jeffrey golberg in the atlantic on this is let us get into some the things the gold star family members actively said at this california press conference yesterday pang tribute to the victims of the afganistan terror attack to clin lifs e thirteen american service members a coup whot was only couple o years ago here is the mother of fallin marine colonel hunter lopez who read the names of the dead yu service members in afcanistan yesterday i a tit er cilgan ar honered those injured and those that made at home fom mage cie the they be onered by speaking teer stasargean tter r sargeannan old ge sargean joony bigardo stasargean riin now jobidon he will not mention these people's names he mention them a couple of years go a nows it he never heard of them again yand if donal trumper presedent and this were the sort of press conference that were being held by the families of dead soldiers it would be frump page news all over the country i remember because in the two thousand four election campanimald enough to remember that one i remember the attempts to paint george dbw bush as responsible for the death of american soldiers an becimlic a real major political issue for george sholy bush again the rule is when a re publican is president a n troops are either put in danger or not even in danger proper homages in paid to the graves of soldiers this a major political story when ae democrat is present we just pretended does not exist because the mainstrou medior dedicated t the proposition the democrats do not have to care about people this democrats after all are peace loving people meen sure they presied over many of americas biggest wars but they are the most peace loving people there are the people who we should give all sorts of faith and credence to even as they participate and again what is the blackest spot on america's foreign policey record certainly of my lifetime e get to more of what the gold staur family members and wounded soldiers had to say about yobidin and his personal interactions with them and this is not a good man folks l get st that in

schin orange fa fome block arout it igt completela mobile i can do is move my head my armsgon i i do not havenan arm he says oh i mi con understands out and then goes over to reach for my fingers cis about and insho my fingers are showing anslike grap my fingers does not say does not greet me anything just that is what happen tos gra my fingers and a was i gok cat that is weerd and me know almost immediately starts talking about how their son sherve in the military does not say anything about what happened stars talking about how ther sun serd in the military and a mama mister slide sh is furious at this point and he leans over me and he is this close to my face an he is what d you want i do you want yi said what doyou want i said what he said what what d you want s i confuseon is cabona is falt on my friends dine next to mein i i just want to be myself and he is i hun mamam's furiousisi he said he just wants to be himself he is wants to be him sajus wants to me me and yes oh oker and they just continued to talk about everything but what jus happened jobidon most self centered man in the universe again that this is his go to is in tragic circumstance he goes right to his son bobidon's death which at the beginning yoe understand but when he is blons that well hundreds of time to this point nd he is done in the most inappropriate possible circumstances at that point becomes a political parlor trick at that point he is pullin at that card out of a hatlic a rabbit and it is gross and it is disgusting wo bobidon died of brain cancer bobidon did not die because he died as member of the military thut jobidon has tried to suggest that his son bosdath which is tragic and terrible his somehow the equivalent of people being blown up in combat and in fact this was his go to card during the afganistantabocel is that because his sonsdied of cancer apparently he did not have to pursue policies thou'ghe notk an american soldiers blown up in afgannistan if that gold starmom shirl racx talked about how jobidon had in voked a beau and suggested that bo had died in circumstanceis similar to i'm her own son whet he approached me his words to me where my woy my wife cill and i know how you feel wel lost tar tine as well an brought him hom in a five japed coffin my heart started beating foster my started shaking knowing that there is tan died from cancer and they were able to be by his side also wondering how soming ad honestly vary bes hartless to say he knew how i felt a little over twenty four hollars and lightning a my sunsteat just vile just vile by the way the rule and he just just for those who ever have to visit a house of morning the rule is shot up that is legitimate lu run you visit a house of morning is to shut your face because you do not know how that person feels even if you have gone through something similar and by the way this is not similar but jobidon an't care about these folks in it that this this whole caring grampa routine is a lie he is a corrupt politician he has been for forty years he is never held the real job outside of the federal government and he is going around telling people who just lost family members wo were blown up that he knows how they feel because he had a son who died of cancer in circumstances entirely unrelated to his military service gold staur father deron whove re called for the immediate resignation of jobidon and tony blank and all the people who presided over afcannistan n ut without good cause in closing i'm calling out secretary blinkon secretary auston general milly general mckenzy leutenant colonel whited who cun not give the order to the snapers the take out the balmer before he getnt is vest an ultimately the president do it orstontit bet gron't ask man admit your mistakes learn from them that this does not happen ever ever again you all need to resign immediately i' point out at this point literally knowin loss their job no one lost their job over thatganniston taboccloe which is insane it is crazy no one lost their job i repeat again and just the second orngand go through just for quick review the time lane of all the lies that jobidon told the the consistent gaslatting of the american people the attempts to paint the pull out from afgannistan as to set as a success well americans were left behind afgans were falling from wheel wells and americans were being blown up in cobble it is still that the fact that this president is treed with any modicum of respect after what happen afgannistan is absolut be on me understand in in politics we have a memory aabout five seconds long i get it but i just to point out that the entirity of america's political discourse is currently centered about january six that two thousand twenty one how much of america's discourse is around august of tyo thousand twenty one which was later and i was actually significantly more pactful to america's foreign policy is significantly more under minding of america's moral the pull out from afgannistan the pluft from afgannistan again the singlemost disastrous foreign policy decision and and plan of my lifetime has been completely white washed by the american media and the people who suffer during that plown continue to suffer to day because of it have been completely silenced by the mediate or ignored wellget to more on that injust one second

only is he an aske and a fool but he is a bad person he is a bad person you knew all this he would make any plans and then again when things went wrong he did not care by august eighteenth is lut ot this about eight days before the bombing that killed thirteen american service members you say knock on whuld nobody's tide it is all going grate it is all going greate sure it is not true that nobody had died tons of afgans had ardue died but dont care about that obviously it took two days to take control here for we have control there port now fill lot of pandimonyim outside the air pother en but look but no one's being killed right now god give me for a far wrong about that but no one's being killed right now no one as being killed right then he said at t at the airport not across the country across the country thousands of people r being murded by the taleban liy dragd outof their house an killed but dododn't care about that that same day he said do not worry where i can leave our afcan allies behind by the way spoil our lord we left tens of thousands of afcan allies behind we are guined to everything everything that we can provide safe evacuation for our afcan allies pardners and thaf gan to who who who might be targenent if because it associations uninestates he was a lier we left all those people to be murdered he said two days later we would not leave americans behind this twue is alive we left hundreds of americans behind we are gin to do everything in our power to get all americans out and our allies does that mean troops will staye behond august thirty first if necessary depends on where we are and whether we can get rant these numbers up to five to seven thousand the day coming out if that is the case will be they will all be ot caese we that ten to fifteen

people to prove it this is the great moral ex emplarver age this the person brought honor back to the wite house this one this one the fact that the media have again basically shoved this entire

ans thod way they ed his for it to ha by holding the trups before a eas temericans or n ou stran this he ha tens of that first of all i think it t irresponsible to the americans are stranded they are not we are committed to bringing american to want com hom home we are in touch with them te athone the attext the eme the any way that we can possibly reach americans to get them home if they want to return hig merican strandin is the bin houseis of thisol thi this san o wats hapeing aansi i am just callingi out for staying that we are stranding americans an at ganastan when i sat when we have been very clear that we are not leaving american to want to return home we are going to bring them home and i think that is important for the american public to hear and understand o a that leading now has a show on annas en be se again no one lost their job everyone failed upward here the bobbing of course took place on august twenty sixth the administration was openly saying at this point that they were relying on the talban fovide securito the airport which is legen ematelye the worst idea in human history here is som general kenn mckenzi he of sent com saying that they wrelying on the taliban for security at the airport where the bobbing took place do you still trust the talban and is it possible the day let this ha do not esto whether out they letted have it i do not know i do not thinkers anything anything to convince me that they let it happen es ta whether not trust they mensid that is non as soy jus ta word i use very carefully you carbe say before it is not what they say is what they do theys have a pranctical reason for wanting us to get out of your by the thirty first of arderst an as that they want r clain they woner clam the air fiel the we we want to get out by that they two of the te postile to di shall we share a common purpose we share common purpose with the t lban weare told by this disgusting administration on the bodies came back on jobidon he was in a rush he had things to do i mean we runs a mantlock were on you' recall that as they took the bodies off the plans jobidon was looking at his watch jobidn was looking at his watch a just a vile man on august twenty sixth according to ussay today eleven marines one naty hospital cortman and an army soldier were killed and boms and gunfired homi carsit international anrd part icis ka claimed responsibility it also killd ae undred sixty nine afgans bidon seid during remarks the american service memmise to gave their lives they we heroes heroes whohave been engaged in dangerous self lise mission to save the lives of others by met with service of family members and intended his first to dignified at transfer as president i'd be the transfer of the bodies an tom he a checked his watch apparently three separate tons during the ceremony associated pressphotos taken temnants part cobidon checking his watch at during the ceremony another photo from our chossprons press distribed ba getty also shows biten glancing at his watch as well andovidio from seaspand shoed bidon checking his watch once near the end of the dignified a transfers ceremony again deeply important for the president to know what time it is during the dignified transfor sermons get his hand over his heart and his eyes on his watch this is a person who truly truly cares because after all he has o a clara success and just a couple of days laterthit is exactly what he was doing ho hene ua national tollvision had said the whole thing had been a wonderful success for his administration this is august thirty first last night in caboll the united states ended twenty years ward n aft hiistory the longest ward american history the completed one of the biggest erless in history with more than one hundred and twenty thousand people o vacuated t safety that number is wrd than double but most expers were possibl no nation no nation has ever done anything it in all history the only the united states at the capacity te will bilited to do it we did it to day the extraordinary success of this miston was due to the incredible skill bravely and selfless courage a none faced military in our diplomats and intellus is professions never forget how this man send against the american people yanser afgan allies and against soldiers andtheir families we we should not be forgetting that by the way just as a capera to all of us after the bomming jobidon then proceeded to drone randomly a an entire family in afganistan according to the ner tins almost everything senor defense officials asserted in the hours and then days an than weeks after eight and august twenty nine tronstrik trnout to be false the explupe explosives the military claime wer loaded in the trunk of oit toiotis ad and struck by the drown tellfire missil were water bottles assecondtary explosion the courtyard and intensely popular to coble meri neighborhood where the attack tooc place was a propane or gastank according it to officials the carpose no threat at all they blew up a car in order to demon strait jobidon was strong tough leader and u they just killed ten civilians for no reason one of them was apparently somebody who workes with afcan translators that is who jobidon is that is what americans should be focased on going into the twenty twenty four election and that is why these families will never see the light of day on national news that is why these goldstor family members yo will not hear their names a get n a n at certainly not outside a conservato media it is why the names the soldiers will not be household names you will heare endlessly about january six where no one was actually killed except for afshly babit one of the rioters you'l her endlessly about it you will not here a damns work from now untill the election from the main stremedia about the tobakle of the fganistample out that ended with thet least thirteen american service memberstead hundereds of americans left behind thousands afgan allies left behind and thirty eight million people under the tender mercies of the talaban you will never her about it because that under scores exactly what jobidon is which is a person absolutely unfit for the presidency and that is leaving aside the fact that he is physically unfit for the presidency yesterday he continued to wand round aimlessly thevi a morally been nighted nearly tomenshure ridden old man as the president of the united states here he was yesterday wandering around you there is some sort of ceremony at thewhite house for the ustin astras and at once again here he is just wandering around aimlessly where is he oh wheremus pos tog ueverybody a clafpin for him ern pebo what is even happening right now because this is a this is who he is by the way when you on't talk about jobidon and his corruption leaving aside all the hunter bidon corruption which is still going to haunt the rest of his campaign we should point out at this point that jobidin and the f bei and lawnforcemen officials crammed censorship down on the american people in the early years of his administration including on the daily wire we now know that the f bei under the auspicies of jobidon was doing that sort of stuff the mnembers the f ga were cracking town on the jobidon hunter biden labtop story during the election cycle itself these are the conditions under which we labor to have a fair election in this country under a condition of censorship where the biggest stories get downplate smaller stories get up layed and certain stories get buried absolutely completely there is a reason why jobid never feels the necessity to answer questionsand that is because nobodyin the mediactually wants to ask him a tough question yesterday he was a back from his vacation he spent pretty much half his presidency at this point in rehuboth beach delaware where he a sits on a beach doing nothing and a ignored questions from the press obviously but cetulator e got a lean forward because if hea if he stands upright for even a hot second he will be on his but in a matter of of moments u even enby sy news of this poin is recognizing that his brand as tarnish and it should be tarnished wuot presiden jobin's bran is a family orient to public servants has be a signature political lasset tat for more than fifty years has helped him whin the argumen that when judge up against the alternative rather than the almighty he stacks up retty well but the burnish on bidon's brand is being tested never before a had of a close twenty twenty four election some of the president's democratic allies are worried about potentral fall out from a confluence a family droma that is filden public view and from re publican attacks that cut at the beterocho bidnes long time political appeal the go peligt houson is investigating the exstent of bine's roll in helping his unbiden hunter burn millions of dollars from form business interest during his time as vice president in the matter of much more personal nature bicit bidin recently acknowledge for the first time that he has a seventh grand child navy jon robers o four yearol dwaughter of hunter bidon and again his all leaving aside the fact that the man does not care about any thing that is not in his immediate purvieu he is he truly is a bad man and we should remember that because again the attempt by the mediate a paint him as some sort of genteel elderly fellow is far from the reality of whojo bidon is that it it beggers the imagination ok in just one secondwill gets at latest cultural huro of the

bom offy i came for him i anda and the said he is very very bad and then he put out a statement on his twitters thi statemen on his twitters was an apology tweat and it' said quote after much reflection i've to express my eepest apologies to anyone i may have hurt with my comments on parenting in gender identity i've always been in advocate of love and inclucidy and the elg b t ku i pluss community i understand how my comments could hae been interpreted as insensitive an offensive tunderidentity is new ons and i can honestly admit i planned better educate myself on the topic i can approach future conversations with more epathy at the end of the day i lead with love and sport everyone is freedom of expression and pursuit of happiness oh well i mean that was the nowist struggle session apology bu it turns out that he did not writ id actually believe her not mean shocker it was his piar agency it was they who decided that neo not the oit from th matrix the arn be singer had to walk this one backas obviously it was terrible that he ad suggested tht five yirlds cannot in facturues thero engenter and it is bad parenting to suggest that they can well yesterday he is gettin ripped up and down by lot people on the entrwabs pointing out that done what he send the first place was not wrong and a he did something that you almost never see he came out and he walk back the walk bac he said i did not write that idn't put that out and this a bullcrap but i send the first placeis right fars polmost i do not apon e gizes for having an opinion on this matter i'm a forty three yeur old heneral central man raising five boys and to girls o k that is my reality now if my opinion offended somebody yes suupon the non to be being affended because thet was not my intention my tis is never to offend anybody however i'm it outed to fo i feel i was acts the question and i answer the damn question o k i have no beef with the l b g g cu i a plus community whatsoever ag i nol bee for co do whatevertl it is you wanto do do what you want to do whit show ke is however somebody acts my opinion on this matter and necessil fe i will never be o k with allowin a child to make a decision that detrimental to day life i will never be on pay with that i'll ci tha definitely plan educate myself livin on this matter however i doubt that there is any book anywhere or any opinion is some midas will not tell me this no make me o k wel in a child make a decision that that is his period pont blake an as i feel s i this neo tis neeis better than the one i the matrix he is really good that is awsom and really good for him because lhet's be real about this when u jut say no to the mob the mob has no power over you it is only when yeu do not say no to the mob when you kave to the mob thy ave endless power ver you because the moment you show them your throat they just have you by it they have you by the throat an then they just choke the life out of you and the next time you step out a line they club you and the nextime you sep out a line that clubbyo again when neo did here by basically castrating his own managers in say no this'is not how i feel imand say what i want to say you you thnk ye undremind his vast audience of course he did not do you think thar can be tongs to people who boy cot neo because of this the answer of course is not instead what he actually did is he said something that every one in america knows to be true and those who say that i's not true thei're pretending and loing for the sake of political correctness and for political alliance and convenience good for neo good for him we need more of that n ipopculture and here is the reality if it is celebrity donkin into it who the hell is is ing me the regular guyd who has to face down t i in st it is workplace and the threat of being fired and losing his his livelihood neofs a very wealth he dod that yit is a best selling are'n be singr i ave band widely informed in this means that he can actually aford to take on the powers that be in this particular area good for him good for i gan you rarely see it when it does happen it is worthy of celebration it is worthy of of being louded on all sides of the political isle the courage to speak the truth is a big big thing good for a good for neo on this o cam meanwhile we are still awaiting more charges for adonal trump becaus to day ending and why apparently according to the wall stry journal already facing three crolonel incitements donal trump is now bracing for a forth in georgia that is likely to come with a legal twist he asn't face yet sprawling racketteering charges this is one of sanning wolls's favourite charges font county d fany walls is a proscule who made a name for heimself bringing charges this in hyprophile cases wayers who have followed the investigation including some whhave worked ith willis in the past expector to invoke georga's re georgia's reco act that is the un rack teering influence ind corruption organization act monalld after federall racket heering influence in crupt organizations act nineteen seventy sciens are certainly pointing that directions an anthonomichael crease a balfusser a georgi state university within the next couple of weeks granjery is expected to consider whether criminal charges are appropriate for trump and his allies all th people who supposedly intervene in the georgia election trump has plat of course not guilty in both washington t ce and flor to all federal charches and to that separate case in new york surrounding campaign finance georgie's reco law is a powerful tool for willis the statecoat is modnalld aft ter a federal statue which was designs help take down the mafia under but the federal and gorge's recoloff proscutors show there is an organization of people who ommit crimes together on our accorning basis members can be proscuted for crimes at the group committed together this is supposedly the way that willis is probliygan go about it the recos statute lends itself well to the georgi investigation cause trump allies around the country try to range of tactis to keep in power according to legal experts and re fleshman to fenceler an atlancis says it gives proscutors lots of choices far as venugoes at least a very long complicated trils that weredown defence attorneys critics of the rekal laws had lows the government to gjoined to findns of little connection to each other into a single prosecutions when otherwords rudy committed a crime now we rap in john eastman a now we rap in trump and then we just rapidall up with the bo willis says that she likes the reko sort of stuffs ays i think gorers are very very intelligent they want to know what happened they will not make an accurate decicion aboutsomon's life and reco is a tool that allows of proscutors office and lon forcements tell the whole stories we are awaiting presumably racket heering charges guns trump coming in georgia meanwhile donall trump is as you oul imagin again i understand it he is distracted with thse legalcases as he will be all the way up until the election sinstead of talking bat of kennistan and grvine being a bad person instead whal organaget is lot to talk about jacksmith and may be some sideswipes at ta saint mitch mc conall yesterday donall trump when after jacksmith at one of his ralliys the range jackman is i derange oin min to tika te in tafasio si taca i saman is some thenerong in i rie somboty a wender i bi na sto sai in would not manner would not man tisgasan mabea they gae me a mabea gay this is going to be the campaign and by the way even if he is right this is stilgangto be the campaign he he did take some time off yesterday from doing that to sideswipemach mc conallfor a reason i cannot to certain consederning mc conall has been one of his less bocal critics overtime a he got booad mac conall tid at an evens and at donall trump then said i agree boo retire retire retire boo now let us make somethng very clear donall trump's chief achievement as president of the united states was putting threeconsert of justice on the suprim court tere's only one man he asked te thank for that is michmc conal mitch mc conal is the reason that donal trump has ujudicial legacy at all it was mach mc conall not donall trump who stopped merrit garland the corent to turny general the crrup to turning generall from being on the suprim cort in the first place as mitch mc conall who be sically insred the brek cavanat got on the court was miss mc conall who insured the conservatives entered the supreme court of the united states as donal trum pictam and that is how donal trump treats his friends this againd we can run this campaign is a gongo mazing i have some doubts i have some doubts meanwhile the media doing their best to a take out the only plausible rival to donal trump at this point ron to santus yesterday they went after to santis because to santus did not interview with enb s the sansis claim correctly the democrat's ont abortion to be legal through al mine months and dosheburns tried to facchack him saying that isto mis representation of what happening just one poin three present of abortions happening twenty one weeks are higrer which still is twelve thousan abortions a year but yes democrat's openly admits that they are in favor of abortion up till point of birth this is particularly true in new york where literally the empire state building was lit up pink after a piece of legislation signed by androquomo the legalized abortion trough all mine months in the state of new york thet that the simple fact is that that sants is right on that dis matte the meteor still gloing after him it sort of too pronged attack on the one hand the'e trying to undermine him with the bays by suggesting that he said the election is was all on the up and up in twenty twenty which is not what he said what he actually said is that donaltrump lost but that there plenty of factrstackt agains donal trump that is true and then the're trying to claim that he is lying about abortion which again is notrue understand the tactic here for the media the medeas tactic is build up jobidon ignore his problems a tack trump a tac to santis that is that is the medeo strategy already now to the things that i and things that i hate to day things that i the is actually some sad news william freed kinfamous director he died yesterday at the age of eighty seven he is most famous for films the acercist and sorcerer i think that his best movy is actully one that that nobody thinks t his best movy which is rules o engagement the french connection when a munch ofosters including best picture obviously i'm sorcer was a remake of another great french rum call wages of fear but dome rulesof engagement is my personal favorite because it is natural guts he take on what the war on terror actually looks in was made in two thousand before the actual war on terror here is a a little of the previa for rules of engagement serring tommy ly jones o samuel o jackson wil e oeter sploy i i rio rulesngageen the r antethery acur the ei a peaceful crow that is not ti cron to is arive revented me from masurin fur ther evinues f the poms the movi is tremendous it is ben kangsley aske an ambassador in an unnamed arab country and the em the embassy is being overrun and marines are sent to in to protact the evactuation and there is firing from the crowd and th marine's fire on the crowd and temual jackson's the person in charge and they bring him up on chargs of human rights violations and massoccurring civilian supposedly and tommy lhy jone'sis the lawyer who has to defend him it is a really good films to really gotsy film about what actuallys tends to happen in the middle east and the intermingling of civilian and terrorist targets it is it is a really ballsey film honestly totally work the watch great cast everybody from guy perus to tommyly jones samuel jackson to bend kingsley is terrific in it superunderrated film go checket out to day rules of engagement again that is william freed kan who passed away yesterday a time for some things that i hate shortly after the ner times decided that it is no longer racis to singasong called kill the boer the person who is singing that the ead of a group called eafaf in south africa he then came oun wat hi go knon know i was petty serious about that he says never be afraid to kill killing his revolutionary here he was yo ek ki e ot te i boy i e k ei e ki e olusa i'm presumably that sort of genisital language is totally ok munie nurtimes down playing kill the boer as it knon't just an old rebellion song julius malama apparently it is totally find what he is saying when uses genishaw tl language cause obviously he is a man of the left and of the racial left ands that is the thing really matters in the end ogan meanwhile the media are out in full skille defense of magan repino who ble the uus woman national sockersteam ability to move on in the world cup again i'm i gan preten i care very much about that note i'm i'm not bexsite i never cared about women socker nor will i ever care about women socker and it just it is not its not going to happen but magan repeno is i'm a nasty person mat may magan repeno is the kind of person who kneels for the national anthem while benefiting more richly and pretty much anybody in human history from america's freedoms and liberalism it is totally incredible that a person who is truly as privileged as magan reppeno who makes lots of money for playing sport no one has ever cared about or watched and pretending to be a rebel in a culture that celebrates her that she is champion by the by the establishment it really is masing lot of people were you knowhat this woman's national soccrateam which his boy cotted the national anthom and that champion people makin repeon talkin abouw terrible in raceist america is i'm glad they lost i'm and i feel it i get it i'm i'm there man because when you rot for the team if the team does not i america if the team says americaas bad i do not the team it is pretty much as simple as that tit is not everybody on teamens certainly magin repeno an te people whoar most valerized by he media well now the me ya are very angry that people are an kind o tortalling over the fact that magin repieno and her team are out n that she is one who really blew it the washington post canist buckner says it is america first unless the us woman's natinal teams involved this the highest from of gaslighting it was not america first for the team the team did not america or at least it is most prominent members did not if we do not the team that is because we america it is absurd it is saying i think howards in is bad mu el he is an american authors you must hate americas ha no the do to hates america that is why i do not howards in t's ridiculous but says candas buckner they waited four long years for this stocking up on antequated ammunition preparing their muskets for he most pointless fight why notice your ritin about it when magan ropeno the lion hearted heroine for one side and wok trator for the other miss the target on her penalty kick or enemies prepared to take long rain shots from across the globe thers is a thousan year culture war with no ond insight and no purpose beyond stirring the pot o we declared the culture war did we and nows she is the one who is kneeling for the national antem con vincing her fellow teamates sho do wining about an on existant paygab and then proclaiming the choose of victim in society the turns her in to hon most prominent people in merica and has for geting metals from the president of the united states we declared the cltre with's my favoritething honestly the the left is constantly playing the game that older siblings play withthe younger siblings where they grabb the ounger sibling's arm hit their younger sibling with their on ungle stop hitting yourself stop hittng this is what they do it is it is tortal gaslighting you start the culture war and you declare the culture war and then when we notice it and we say no we do not these people a goh cas i hate america why are you starting a culture war all conservives been doing for my entire lifetime is saying things tht were troup for all of human history with regard to the culture war literally all human history male female child foundational building point of all societies no that is ar culture war position boys are nokros oh it is a massive culture or position wo men and women should be treated individually in the market place no om that is a culture war it is amazing that you sae things thet are perfectly obvious two pluss to equals forthe wa that is a culture war hat's a cultu works theire people ot thros ay it is not and until five seconds gleverlone thought you pluss to as for but now that is now become up an absolute halmarc of of thinking that is that is byist and terrible and patriarcl this coomnis hays if for a momen we can ignor the throbbing migran and mental fatigue caused by the victuriel and take this bottom feeter conversation if thise value we are surmised gust women lost to sweed not because they culd not score gold through undre an twenty minutes but because the players around to american us ow li they lost this honer sam we lost were jus saying were happy they lost because they are anti american dow be why ou cur wi they lost and are not again i do notcare about women socker a good high school boys teem could beat the living hell out of the women's national sockartine they did the under fifteen football club of gallas beat the women socrtin five to onder something but says this colomnis thet exited the world cop in the round of sixteen because the majority of starters were toobusy protesting the military to mout the lericts of the starspangle banner before marches it was shocking most of th ose players are new to the team and into thes liberal verses concern of conflict that grips the nation their supposedly to proudly represent they are not part of the cord that one the programs forthworld cup in twenty nineteen while also carrying the burden of calling out it is own federation and fighting instituti nalized generar descrimination through it all that seems lightning rod of a spokes person reppeno wanted to smoke on any social and cultural matter she could find for her rainbow pride for ar rightnee that at times remained on the grassduring the national anthem for gut reaction about potentially accepting an invitation be honored by the former one time president i'm not going to the effing white house reppeno became the representative of the national team and the rights enemy of the state again she declared these positions and we said we did not them and she was the person you touted as te most important soceraplayer in human history better than lioal messy and more important to future rule prosperity in peace than gondy this was you guyse following the loss elexy lalise a former men's national team player carnfox antalist and well nown provocatsour called the seem polorizingan unlikable to a portion of america that is true but they seem strange coming from a person whois being paid to elevate socer knowledge for americans not to hand inde eye the game and this is it is always the same stupid game you declare culture war we notice it we do not it and it is our fault do not be gaslip by these morons do not be gaslip by them ouro it is oqe to say that you'r happy make in repeno

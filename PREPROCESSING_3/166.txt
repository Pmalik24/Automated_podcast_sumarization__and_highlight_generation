am not thinking about my own safety i am thinking about how to increase my chances of being believe to day and i show way ave the story of somebody who came forward and what happened to her next has never been told fact she is only bee known as jane doll i shee markable in a few ways first of all she is young hes a tea natre she spoke out about one of the most powerful people in her state and in this case the story that the public nos is very very different from what actually happened to her somewods the public story is the opposite of her experience of it b bsy chicago smerican life a mara glass stay with us atguon the in turn the prersoni show us about to day was a nineteen year old in turn in the idohostate legislature and i she say bef i am going forther there is no ay to discuss what happened to her without talking about sexual violence take tat is a heads up frit is to follow in twenty twenty one this teanager reported that a state representative twice her age raped ur she came forwardh her story and then many things went differently than the would have before me to i d hose statehous had put in place o basic reporting system from cpoints this the incint was investigated there were consequences all within a month and a half mir the house put on a hearing came to a fast decision mendy we have a motion some rides that motion ormotion is it representiv on oinger should be sensured with the following restrictions and conditions one that hoe be immediately suspended without payer benefits to that he must to me to evacate his office in the capital an not returned to capital grounds for the remainder of the sixty six ido legislature and three comitteevote was unanimous resenti should be poin they then called for vote from he full house to expell the representative he immediately resigned that is change right post me too sat legislators talked about how proud they were there bildy do right things quickly the prase the colleagues around the hearing as masterful whatever producers a meeki mek watched all this happened back then she had a question namely what was all this for jane doll here is maky i lived just south of voicy and the story of jane do was all over the news mister chairman there was a public atics hearing in the ido house ri watched her answer questions did you make a report to boisy police department and on march ninth you had been raped by representative von ellinger yes the first thing i notice jando was young just a tea nager just at a high school they had her behind these giant black currains up on a dayus at the very front of the room these big black curtains that hung off some tall metal frames were suppos he shiald hor identaty which was weird because nothing was being done to disguise her actual voice first i could not stop thinking what is happening here it felt very handmads tal she was on trial did you tell him to stop said no did you say other things that indicated no mont supul wont of what different reiterations i even try to just convince him to not telling him i was an unecontrol and i had it shaved myself for de us to make me seem unappeasable you kno and he just continued that is ta pretty intense thing to hear a tea mager recounting behind a black currain reinformed that the proceedings and then here is the purt that really me me wonder what this was all for jane something happened after she finished her testimony o your excuse after she exitedtive room the mikes picked up a faint screan how it was hers some of the representatives conducting the hearing looked around in confusion for a splet second and then got back to work calling up witnesses ongs w es watching this back in twenty twenty one just four years after the meetu movement broke i assome jane doe was part of a younger generation of women who were reporting sectual violence but who knows she was literally invisible at the hearing what was a for her back behind that curin and what was that screan i wanted to find out more about what exactly happened to jane dou i reached out to jane doe through her lawyers after the hearing to se if she want to share more five months later i noticed a couple of miss calls on myephone i called back it was jane shed been calling me and not leaving messages tring to reach me out of the blue because she worried i' trid to recort our call without her knowing she said she was feeling paranoid when i finally met jane in person she was very direct she been seeing all these people talking about her and finally wanted to give her side of it she had a lot to say about every part of the process the letter up to the seat behind the black curin she just turned twenty she was really funny a total goofball she has a membership at a trampling jim but go four times

office i was shook did you love about that honestly if i will jus es straight to really what made me feel i fell is walking in gold liteally mantire family ik i'm the first worn t ever work for the government right i mean yave just proud of myself the capital had been a sereal place for jane to find herself in just a few years earlier she was a pragnant high school freshmen trying to figure her life out she started making money by working field jobs on potato in corn farms and picked up a nightshift at pandoc's bruss as a sophomore she enruled herself in a special high school for teen parents and started volunteering and domestic bilent chelters she quickly became the kind of model over achever who gets voted most likely to become president of the united states when jane was a senior in high school she sigd up to be a page in the idaho house of representatives she ran arrands for a special committee and was celebrated on the local news for it the first teen momp to serve as a page in thi state house her workin domestic violence programs brought her here to learn more about the le just lat a process and rut ane learnd the steps on how to make a bill and for fun sat in on meetings of the judiciary and rules committee she tracking all the different draghts of bills that gi introduce and seeng what happened to them she would grown up with an abusive dad and then had a boy friend who was violent with her seeing first hand just how badly the criminal process worked for victumse she wondered why it was not better and now that she would seeng the work of a lawmaker up close she decided that is what she wanted for herself after the page porogram was over after she graduated from high school jane decided she had to get back to the house she applied for an internship and to get it she needed to find a representative who would sponse for her i just raced out everybody i could that i knew i wa easyou to find their contact on mine tha yo find their emonsteffs i just

republican representative not von elanger the one she reported for raping her it was another one she started at the beginning of twenty twenty one a desk of her own on the ground floor of the idahostate capital she felt this was the beginning of something much bigger jane remembers running into representative von elinger pretty soon after the twenty twenty one legislative session started she was not interning for him he was just another republican representative a very new one i reached out to von elinger in his lawyer for comment but did not get a response he has not been talking to the pross it was this first term in the house he was a substitute teacher from northern itoho there was a few times hen i walk at a committee and he was there and i juste kn i i smile on way tat

eally suits mennsus jane adds that sir is the kind of male representative who would tuxter late at night about a non urgent work question who keep her in his office too long and who she overherd talking with other sirs about whether she looked better in her tan skir er her striped one she told me the real lot of sirs in the house sometimes she would get this creeping feeling that they would look at her and think well how exotic jane's uspannic many o the other women working in the capital were blond and white after vn elinger gave her this idahoshape cookies jane says he was suddenly walking by her desk multiple times a day to make small talk he gave her his thon number food seemed to be the main currency of flirting for a lot of the sirs jane says they were constantly offering her snacks from ther many foragives were dropping off lunch at times all this free food was nice jane internship was unpaid she ws supporting herself in her three year old son with a second job she worked the overnight shift at a domestic violent shelter for eight dollars an hour when von elinger eventually asterout to dinner jane says she initially felt reluctan but talked about it with her friends who told her to go for the food remember she was an ineteen only a year out of high school he was thirty eight did you think of it s this is a date this is a working dinner this is something in between her who know i obviously knew that he was interested in me but i more or less was well he is er to help me out caus i told him all my interest raght o ther i'm won e work of the jicierys istin blan he is i know these people and i can may beuno coulye lhake he was yknow he wouldn't ly promise anything but he definitely was a i could help you out and that is was my co she wanted to grow her network von ellnger picked jane up after she would finished her inturnship for the day and a beam w he borrowed from his roomine then drove her to his sta rusd rought down town and then over

home an he is oh i hoping to do you in he was just laughing and then he just at and then the waiter gui came up and i was o qe it just wanted to ignor it i the other things i'm just s retu her the as not to a it on i deafin he was not trying to make a worse an then we were gin to levin i was coo i'm i go home von elanger wasposed to take her straight back to her car at the capital but instead he made a detor to his apartment supposed ly to run a quick errand this is probably evident but it hadsup that this is where the rate papins and i mane to give some of those details jane gave me permission and felt it was important to le out the specifics of what happened to her after he parked jane felt prostered to go ent she says he opened her car door and reached for her arm she felt anxious knowing that he sometimes carried a hand gun once insided his apartment jane tried to keep some distance she wen sat on his couch but he picked her up and carried her to his bedroom i want to run out of i visin visioning myself running out of his room and i running on the hall but iwas just in my head i coulde do it wa i i do not know a my brain was shot i could not move i aitknow o paralise i cannot move jane kept say no but von elinger forced his penus into her mouth she polled her had away hard that it snapped back and hit the wall he then clibed on top of her pitting one of her arms under his knee master bating von elnger was over six feet two hundred powns jane's five foot three i just stared at his curtains ther was dark thi i called him american reke in my head is what i was naming im lik i i was in disbelief i said no i i said ome awas i spose to do hit him iwas i suppose to attack him i he should have just goan off in me and he did not he just did not and i was shocked afterward she says he told her when i'm at this point i just become an at of control man he then acted nothing happened and drove her back to her car jane do had been assaulted by a state legislator now she had to try to figure out what to do next the vast majority of sexual assalt survivors jane decided she was not going to tell any one she wantd to get back to work she tried to convince herself she was fine but that plan fell apart when she showed up back at the capital for wor just a couple days later and i's on the ground floor going towards more my offices and i seen him at the very end walking out of a committe room and i was i cannot do this i cannot i cannot do this hou saw him did he see you go my gash i tought hold on to the walls ike in the iddle a frigan panic attack os i not functioning i whe did not function i was scared a scared i went stright id can blackboon can blackburn that is who she talk to the assistant sergeant at arms for the house when jane was a high school page the previous year can was her supervisor it was hard to find a private place to talk they walked out to the retunda and sat on a bench facing that big idaho state flag jane told kim that von elingar had raped her then she went to the bathroom and threw up well initially to even report os to convince myself all as well i'm a citizen of constituate i witnessd a crime brought by one of their legislators and i am giving that to the hiar hierup but whatever he notoy meen i'm reporting that because that is what a good samaritan dies tha's what i you do was sis your supposed to do and i me being domessiclines sexual sall advocate myself wa would i be telling a different nineteen year old who got assaulted by a legislator i ave as col not chold that wool ilo this i do not really wat to do this but i have to do this oh ye why why would you on do that wat any way won o oul in't be chose to be a ya take my life i an my whole life at that poyaas i it isis my job now this is where things started going differently than they would hav in years pass at the idho capital jane did not know this but when she told the supervisor about von llinger she became the first person to publicly tassed out the legislature's brand new process for responding to sexual misconduct aligations the assistant sergeant at arms was now required to share jane's report with one of the hierops she went to the top person in the house the speaker who took it very seriously bwithin minutes of receiving jane's report he notified the attorney general's office who then notified the boicy police they took her to a victim senter where nurse gave her a rate could exam but jane waffled about whether she wanted to move forward with a police investigation and decided she did not want a prush charges she wanted to move on focus on her work and let the capital dillith abon elnger another inturned in get her the new protocal at the capital landed with the athicx committee in the idoho house but then what while the legislature had a way to respond to sexual misconduct complaints it did not have any guide lines for how to conduct this kind of investigation representetd sage dixon a republican from northern ida ho chared the ethixs committee he was the first one on it to see jane's report the chalkmen s i was 'n aware of any that o it was a lot to absorb i was disturbed in thinking this is wui possibly going to be something larger than we would of the is fors with at idtho have you ever handled anything this as a legislator no most everything that happened next dixon in his committee had to make up he had kno training on how to run an investigation into a sexual misconduct complain his job outside of the house is writing an electrical contracting business one of his first thoughts was we should talk to jane jane was at the capital when a secretary notified her to appear before the house affict's committee she did not know what to expact when she haded into that interview she brought a lawyer who is also as sexual asall advocate and right before we walked in there all we heard from that that room a burst of laughter i that already made me what the head did you hear that ma an my lawyerwer a they laughing r now what are they laughing about you feel walking into that room i's more irritated you kno more i confu ouis con a hurd kind od felt judged dixon says he does not remember what they were talking about but was certain they were not laughing about jane wonce jane walked in the room she saw the ethx committee was made up of representative she saw all the time at her in turnship she felt ashamed they were seated around a long table three men two women she took a seat at the end dixon asked her o recount the night von ellinger rapetir but as soon as she got to the part about him climing on top of her dion stopped her he said qu i think maybe the committee's getting on comfortable to at fir such a sight what did you say way why did say that but i was you are telling m i making you uncomfortable you are telling me you are telling me i whatis a saulted sexually but youre uncomfortable with this conversation after you asked me to have this conversation you asked me you brought me here you you made this happen and you are just going to tell me to stop you whyt this does not it made me angry i reard the transcript ov this and later he said please do not think that were were i'm cutting you off because we d want to hear anything more in did that clarification make a difference to you no in anyway that was a huge insalt you maye me relive a horrible experience in just tell me you'eincomfortable by it i was hurt i was hurt by dixon because i know his son am friends with this son he was a page with me dang i r ne dixond you hurt me you hurt me there were some well establish practices for interviewing sexual ssalt victims usine trained investigators who know how to interview a victim without retromatizing them is one and those investigators should be external and independent not people who worked together every day i asketixon about that moment in the room he told me after jane laughed a debuty g who was there told them you do not interrupt sexual salt victims in the middle of their story i can tell jan do was getting this abood disturbed and i didnt want her to be that way i told er you do not e ve answer in i wordes that stop were don refine trying to protect her best waas has been a father that i would think protect somebody is fumerable and having hard tot not knowing that dinamic not now i know tan it as hard at that oint that was one of the difficult things si i apologized to her about that i to the mad it touher the ethic committee does not investigate crimes they had no protocal for what to do but they did have this one thing something that was clearly in the purvie of the athics committee conduct on becoming was representative von ellinger's conduct conduct on becoming as they looked into it report started surfacing about other women he pursued and made uncomfortable in his very short time at the capitale he journal clerk a security guard and te lobyast who said he followed her to the bathroom all of them were younger than him the committee also discovered that the top leadership in the house knew about two of these reports instead of confronting von linger they sent a represented to to warn him to stop being quote overly nice dixon and the committee brought these alligations to him and gave von elinger the chance to resin quietly and to avoid any public embarrassment but he did not step down instead he told the committee he and jane do had consentual sect to them pursuing a sexual relationship of any kind with an inturn was not ocay it seemd a clear violation of the rule conduct on becoming since he refused to resign the only option they had lauht was to convince two thirds of the house that von elinger had violated conduct on becoming thend they could get a expelled but to do this they would have to hold the public herring once the hearing was announced one of von elinger's attorneys did something that shocked jane in her lawyers she released jane's name to reporters it ended up on a far right new sight with her photo jane was no longer anonymous im just a wholly she at my worlds an nobody would talk to me nobodywould even look at me in the iany mhere i would from smiling awaving to everybody to nobody belook at me is is not thas what i us really jane they hate me everbody that statehouse just hates me an ally of von elinger in the house one after jane too and then representative named procilla gettings she posted jane's foto on face book ind emell the news letter to her constituents calling von ellingar idahos very own cabina and jane a honey trap out on a liberal smear job the hearing she said was part of a national me too witch hunt i reached out to gettine's but she did not respont jane tried to keep going to wort but she hated that every time some one looked at her they thought about the rape she could not function and needed to get out of the capital back at home all she could do to get through the day was sleep she could not keep su down and was failing all of her college classess except for one a criminal justice course it was victimology a not even ketting not even keting i is victimology as i was taking victimology all through that in victimology one of the things they talk about is how victims are often retromatized by the very systems that are supposed to get in justice if you are a victim of sexual violence the trama is about having no power any attempt toward just ice police or or ach our procedures should be design to make sure of the person feels a sense of control for instance before a victim even makes a report they should know what all the possible steps of the prossess could be that way they can deside if they still want to proceide nd if it is a work place the state house ye want to give the victim the option to give their testimony in private insteid of foreseeng them to retile and relived their assault in public in the ida ho house the process was not designed with a sexual assault victim in mind instead it looked a lot more a regular criminal trial dixon talked a lot about von elinger's right to defend himself whelle jane says she was not consulted about whether she even wanted to come to the hearing they issued a sepina for her to appear i asked dixon why he thought that was necessary we were supeming other witnesses insodomen to aced sistenceo think is why id just it it did not look we were savoring one side of the other because it is a sepina if she had not appeared then a rasq is the consequence of that right yes i do not think it i's absolute that arrest is the conssequence of that if we wanted ta that an we could s si she had not cam i mean i what would have i di do not know i's that is tos because i feel she needed to be there for that face your acuse reportion of it in the days leaing up to the hearing jane's lawyer said they did everything they could to prevent the hearing from being a disaster for her they asked if she could testifi remotely with her voice disguised or even better in a closed sestion that was not open to the public they said the answer they always got back from the attorney general's office was now no one seems to have a clear answer on why this was one of the deputy gs running the case declined to comment dixon told me he never receive ter attorney's request insais he would have been open to jane testifying remotely in the end jane's lawyer said the only protection that was offered up to her were those black curtains she would tell her story in public behind a black curtain making toi ap the hearing and the protective power of tennechos its in a minute cicaga pabagratio when our programm continues smeke mi my reglass to day's programm jane do five years since me toobooup there are these systems at dispose to crank an action now han somebody steps forward we hade the story of jane do ada made drew an ig to ho not to be cuear janedo did not come forward because of me too af she went of producer making me gaster about it janes ad all she knew about me too as it was something for celebrities then the less he response to her was shape by me to shewas a test case of the legislature's new reporting system they were making up as they went we pick up our story with at too the witness it is upt this part ostory contains brief references to suicide her s meky the morning of the hearing jane woke up terrified she had a full blown panic attack and threw up she jumped in the shower and put on beautiful by emanem to try and pump herself up se then put on a black dross this was an inside joke to herself because she felt she was about to attent her own funeral jane's mom picture up and they haded to the capital her lawyers told me that nobody came up with a secure plan to get her into the building without people seeing who she was one of her lawyers reached out to a senator who met jane in hermam at a private entrance outside the capital then led them through a series of tunnels and some back hallways until jane finally got to a door in the hearing room she looked at the curtains and a random bronze statue of abraham lincoln's head her chair was right in front of him his eyes would not moving no hesus staring an e ol simen si o qe it was just werd just flat out weard what did you think when you saw that black hurn was i can see through this i can see everybody they can see me and i was centifor heo effirs wit they e dudnseem from her side the curtain looked more shear she looked through it to a room packed with legislators an prass the people who could actually see her though included vivatthix committee members their counsel a secretary to deputy a gs von ellingeris attorney and von elinger jane had only seen him around the capital a couple o times since he raped her her black curtain was slightly open to give those people line of sight on jane during the hearing my body was not there i just held tight to my chair just hollon to it i had something yoouever get a protector voice goid in serno jane's voice was ligistring the hearing was broadcast on line i think we need to be able to cross examined a the accuse yer that is von elingeris attorney publicly cross examining witnesses of sexual salt is certainly not best practice for this kind of thing for instance other stateblegislatures that have adopted proceedures for handling complaints do not allow victims to be cross examidon public certainly not by the perpetrators thut again they had no process for the cinight oho von ellinger's lawyer adopted tactics out of a criminal trial he predictively turned jane into the defenda following the usual playbook that gets used on sexual asalt victums he cast her as mentally on stable an a flirt which was a thing jane had fall around the capital ever since she reported by linger that she was being judge and cast in her words is a quote gold digging crazy mexic an pothead von ellinger's lawyer nitpick tiny details insinuate that maybe she was a liar i'm just onder if you coun just read that just at once senence on the night of march ten twenty twenty one she met him down town boisy think sheud bet it was not march ten point foning on was it no it was mar nik tis an ether yes i told police that they why did you tell miss faron that it was marchd to han i did not i said the other night this supervisor who jane had reported to as the one who accidentally made a mistake in her ret report not jane meanwhile von ellinger barely spoke he kept pleading the feff when the ethics commitee kept pointing out that this was nan a criminal proceeding and it did not apply he still refused what sucked up most of the time though was the corps of vonelinger's defense which was essentially this was not rat we were dating er a date which is aloud there is no anti fratinersation policy in the ida hostate house again here is his attorney tis represented von ellinger hav any hiring r firing authority over you no there is represented von ellinger have any supervisory authority over you no he asked con version of this question more than thirty times to different witnesses are you aware of any policy that would be violated i representative having any relationship with anin turn of ateage majority i i i've seen nothing in policy no thank you he is basically saying tell me where it sas a powerful middle age legislator cannot de and nineteen or old in turn and always got the same answer written policy no not that i'm not that mor absolutely not von elinger's lawyer do the same kind of thing with the other woman who tastified about von ellinger's troubling behavior a chief clerk who said one of her employs complained when vonellinger asked her out his attorney's response to tha whis she was not wearing a wedding ring which of course has nothing to do with whether von ellinger should have asked her out at work his attorney charge to had you tmhiss small an your experience is not weare in a wedding ring a generally excected sign that a woman is unavailable you can be concured that way but i do not think that that is a requirement to be unavailed at i did not ask if it was a requirement is it completely unreasonable in your opinion for an individual who is interested in a woman to notice that she is not wearin a wedding ring and assume he is permitted ask for a question i do not think of a wedding ring is indicative a weather or not you can ask the woman a question this is an absurd thing to argue but he is also arguing and side an absurd incoherent sat af rules the ida who legislature has a process for reporting sexual harassment but not actually a policy against it in the rules for the sunnut in the house they do not have an anti fratinersation policy but they have rules about decorum rules forbidding smoking drinking and eating on the house floor the rule about conduct on becoming of a state legislator but nothing for sexual harassment the part of the hearing i'd always wanted to know more about ever since i firt saw it was what happened when jane finally walked away from that black curtain she sat behind it for forty minutes answering questions your excuse i frecen lose it i lusit i i an then nake i as is anger as avnt ot here recannt wen be hearing were you to gowene to help you jane told me that when she stood up to leave she had a panic attack there was a private exit she was sposed to go out of but she was upsat that she pushed through the wrong door and landed out in a public hallway that is when that scream came out of her o just at running up the hallway an asweday hear people behind me some of von elinger's supporters all women followed her out into the hallway there was a local reporter with them to they crowded around her and started filming jane with her phones i i broke i br ut i screan i screamed a lot screaming him much i was an to kill myself all i wanted to do as gets the top of the building she was trying to get to a balcony in the rotanda to throw herself off her lawyers blocked her sjane collapsed on the ground her mam held her while her lawyeras pulled out an umbrella and opened it to try and block her face from the people filming her it took several minutes before security at the capital finally showed up and escorted jane out of the building the hearing lasted two days at the end of the second day the committee recommended to expell him he resign just hours later representative dixon had of the athic committee saw this as a successful outcome i told dixon how tromatizing the whole experience was for jane and what happened after she ran out of the hering room i mean if that is what the consequences were for her for showing up in public for tastifying in publicamean is it the a was at worth having her be in public that probly not but again is sus was allmy to us as her committe not am it being familliar with with that trama and how it expresses itself for people we had no idan it did everything we thought we were doing correctly to protect or i i think we could have gone on without that because we did have her previous testimony that we could have brought up in an had or showd everybody we ha that the transcripts w were able to show the body which again was sumporto ma sos they knew what we had known and ow that probably a sufficed this of course is impossible to know another member of the athic committee told me they thought without jane's testimony in person monnylinger would still be in the lagislature i mean is there anything that you would want her to know or think yus i'm very sorry if we increased that tromar that we did as it never was orinat i know each one of those members feels very strong i that she was wrong and and wyded to protect her it just tou o are an experience thinks in come out may be is coingly is te good of what happened to jane after all of that she never finishd the inturndship she loved at the capital and after the hearing and never went back to her office with her name and all caps five months after the hearing she was cleaning houses and she was a rack shehad lost twenty pounds she could not stop replayine the assalt and the hearing in her had much of her day to day now was a physical battle she was dealing with severe pitiesty just going on the free way and heu would see tha sed ot the capital my body which i say lik immediately just en your falling she imagine jus that moment just daying in that my body is just in a state of shock e an o frozen she was still getting harassed by vonilling her sympathizers continued to publish her name on mine random strangers had shown up at her old apartment asking questions there was even a man who show up that boisy political events mocking her trust as a woman wearing a sash with jane's real name on et there were also people who sympathized with her to and that was also hard when she was out in public she never knew when some one was going to try and approach her my people are are you je where dos this come up when you get recoet y i is i wene to job fair ocaingt is us a bunch of we do not boost people wen youust go to the next one and tis one ladyaway up to one anothers liku now many rich heare here law i think i be i liked to con application n she isioslay her eyes were are watering that she drnet e le crying and she slike miss did you are you jane know what did you say ho was fuch but as i yes yes maam ma ye sh fuli coshlike i washed i had aloing and thet i was recognizin gain at the womar and that lady recognizing me by my face and then the thensemen allowed people to to share their frickan rape stories near dislike i i really do not want i hear that ik i'm recovering from my own why woasd you share that nothat i do not othat do not care persa ri but i do not care i do not want to hear it jane started talking about herself in the past tence i was high energy i was punky i was funny and her plans felt past tente to she no longer talked about being a lawmaker she was sure she could never set foot back in the capital and was thinking about moving out of state the statehouse had a process to take her seriously when she reported bon elinger but after that they had nothing jane felt they were not concerned with what the experience it did to her it is needed my testimony a meeded to do to thene do the jobs aniinerly look at me as a pumanars oo iportnes as she has to do this might as well as i can make her i is what is dot the day only meeded me to get this process going they did it consider anything else and tha i mes rit it gets me i mean what would you do whatwould you have done if i was your kid what would you have me sure happen if i was yours all jane had wanted to do was work at the capital but after she got doxed she said every one there who talked to her about job opportunities went silenc to make money she started helping her stap dat out at his plumming business and picked up work as ha care giver at a memory care facility and then one year after the athic hearing jane got a rare sort of du over of the entire ordeal with bon elinger the district attorney in the county for boisy charged him with fellany rate this happened because after she got doxed jane told the please she co operate with tha criminal case she was scared all the time she felt she had to for her own protection this time things went very differently the prosecutors handling her case understood that they needed to deal with her with care they walked her through each stop she always knew what to expact they did not sepina her theyinetentionally built a whole case where she did not have to take the stand they had other witnesses the nurse who did jane's rape could exam but jane decided that she did want to testify against von elinger he sheriff picked her up in an umark car and drove her to as secret courthouse entrance she had a ther be dogna youko in the courtroom and the victim witness cordinator by her side i was there sitting a couple rose behind bon elinger but even with all that support watching jane on the stand that day was herroing she looked she was having and out of body experience she stared at him blankly and could barely talk whucd she tried to answer questions about how he reaped her she suddenly stomped she pushed her chare away from the mike stood up and said i cannot do this she walked out of the courtroom wat i ran out of the room and e imediately fell down a flight astairs thas sound stupid but i did and that i do not know what in my mind i see it a run and the nice i ran across front street i ran across murdl which is the big ros big busy roads down town boise forlanes i was tring to go to the bridge a i and my bran as wher i was going my ankle was getting to me the bridge she says because maybe she could jump she was hapving a poshed dramatic reaction same is at the hearing jane's first instinct was to do what she had not been able to do the night she was reape run away she torn attendant and leaned up against a tree one of her attorneys named guy followed her out to try to calm her guy says when the police showed up one of them grabbed her arm and dropt her to the ground jane was dostraut she does not remember that many people nine different officers ar meand as his on the flooris streamingin hitting e head over nover an looks over and ill never forget this and i stin guy an is hands in knees he was crying and he is i shaking his head and i dunow what about that hurt me and i stopped for a second during this brief pause the police put a full body restrine rap a helmet and handcoffs on jane they put her in a squad car and transferred her to a hospital for psychiatric care she spent three days there when she was released her mom pict er up as soon as they pulled on the free way a tack showed up on her momsphone i here that e and then she oh hit is i do you want to read that and i dis i e an i have as million man i hu it was a taxe from one of jane's attorneys the jury and vinalinger's trial had just come to avert ic and is andhe she said that he is soon guilty an what was though it did that feelike i did not believe it i was i no way what why did not you believe it nobody thought that he would have oh juust up on the ris he son a gat e she a good old boy whathere is many comments when do you get to here about ful a prosecuted convicted for what they did and he got that you kow how lucky i am its true jane is the best case sonario for what erate surviver can get vone elinger was kicked out of the ideho capital a month and a half after she reported he was arrested and a judge sentenced him to twenty years in prison last send three per sent of sexual assaults ever result in a conviction or incarceration but the lived reality of best cassonareo for jane hardly fells a win vonilinger still maintains he did nothing wrong he is a pilling his conviction to the state supreme court the sympathizers continued to harass her and she regularly sees a psychiatrist and a therabis for petiasty she takes ice bafts a few times a week to shock herself into feeling she is back in her body more than two years after the atic herin nothing is preventing another jane do from going through almost the exact same proces she did this really gets to her thino house in the senat still have not adopted to sexual harassment or anti fratnersation paulci into ther rules they also have an adopted a spesific process for hav investigate future reports of sexual mis conduct there are state legislaturs that have adopted some vass practices organ offers confidential counsing for victims to help them decide what kind of action they want o take and new york and organ use independent extural invastigators neither state requires victims to retile and relive their assault in public the one improvement dixon in ether athic committee members did make his stronger confidentiality protections for any one who reports any one who releases o victim's nane could face consequences but at the same time the committee all decided they can cover the legal fees of lawmakers accused of sexual harassment or assault this is where we are more than five years after me to more awareness there is a problem a more immediate sents that you should care and respond when some one reports but nobody's invented new systems were what a victim actually wants and needs is afte sentor or the ide legislat ture is not different from state houses all over the country including the very highest levels of the uess government three of the past five prisidents have been accused of inerpropriate behavior from unwanted touching terat and more than three dackades after eneeta hell for s tastified about clarence thomas the you e senate in house still do not have a clear in dependent process for investigations i recently listene to a conversation between hill and christine blose forward about their experiences tastifying in front of the senate judiciary committee in it he will said that she rejacts the idea that things will change if more people come forward and speak out she says it is the other way around more people come forward if the systems were better a little while ago jane stepe back into the idical capital for the first time since the hearing not for a new job she says a representative called her out of the blue and invited her to a meeting with some other law makers they wanted her in put on better processess for sectual harassmet and a salt victims part of me was excited part of me stil admired the staehouse what was the other

learn more about tike helth an wellfare or state affairs in stad she is here some where between where she intended to be in the very dark place she is bet in for the last couple years she just now

dispuse as and no ass wa s os we eveytand ra w sa s s o aa oo ss s o o ie e mistate ii grea la wtis et a o o ya aethe os a wso t sia ei ss o a oos s sa ut he i know that we coan avented the showfreight here with a song and in fact we did plane on ending it right here but then last week i did this one more interview that just got to those of us who were putting together the show and it is in niner e was somebody who jane do has been thinking about a woman who for a while was known as emily dou and here is just one more thing before we go to day is is act three douh me dou ut his a while up meeky was tacking to jane for this story jame was wreading this book called kno my name and now my namewras written by a survivor who had been anonymous for several years and then came out with her name this is somebody who we had actually one quick quote from in the top of te show chone miller is her real name stamford swimmer broch turner sexually asault of her in twenty fifteen and then she wrote this victim impack statement as emily due and this tamement when o mine millions people read it eighteen members of the house o representatives democratsand republicans took turns reading at outloud in congress it was he thing and jane dough is thinking these days abot whether she was to come out with her real name inso i talk to she knoll mellor about how she decided to do that n'll what it was for her to be anonymous as emily dough for long before she did in those four years less than ten people in my life new and at the time it was cool that i had the power of invisibility but long term what is not cool is when you cannot turn the invisibility off because if youare always invisible than you just start to slowly dissolve and just to be in the world and leave such a big part of me at home every day led to such a fragmented experience by the end did emily dose seem a person who as separate from you in some wooy oh yes yes say more abetha am well she is tirti a beacon and shes very bold emily dose just this unshakable clear headed person who did not take anything from anybody and i do not know i i'm i am not conferent hational you havete nderstand in my book i talk about how when i'm handed change at the grocery store i just throwit in my bag because i do not want to hold anybody up i get nerve if i'm ot a calfa and i have to ask the breeze of the wife i pass word rather not i'll figure out away to work without in er nat for an hour and in my day to day life i'm some one who is very shrunken most of the time nd it takes a lot to be able to assertn myself i think what is incredible about emily dough is that she she can show up when she needs to i emily do not takes a stand yes emily dough asked for the wife i pass word yes and you reading by the sembly dough who seems amazing and it does not feel you emily dough i do not think is allowed to make a lot of jokes oh i she exists in his pace that ha a that is can be sensitive where you want to be really conscious of what you are saying you want to take care of people even now when people people sometimes see me on the street and burst into tears and i do not know what that is but i i just any time somebody gives me a compliment i imagine emily dough as this statue and they give me a flower and i walk over and put the flower at her feet and then i come back to myself the next sang when it do is something unusual a jane dough from her story has read your book i she read it with interest and she sent these next questions i that she would love to hear your interest to looke ooket first one but when did you can told we see where she is coming from in this question to when did that you were emotionally an mentally ready to put your real name out there what woutd the signs you were seeing in your own life tell me you that you were ready there is many things i sought were impossible at the beginning that of now become ordinary and i want her to know that for herself i could not even verbal eyes what had happened to me when i was alone in a tharpis office and i wore a jacket this is a the beginning is is that the very beginning i i had fwore a jacket with sleeves that covered my hands and now i can walk in in a regular afternoon make her a cording that will go out t o millions of people and afterward i will move on to something else i qwirk whating you be tonkin a this interof you wer doring recirect ye this will not sink me and by the end i could get back on my feet quickly and i thought i do not have to be afraid any more that something is going to blindside me and that is when you knew that you were emotionally mentally ready to put your name outho yes i can do this chandofs next question for you is what is the prosan conslist you made before you came out al with your own name o i cons cons is that any time you are guggled it is the first thing that comes up it will be the first thing everybody sees you as prose prose i get to be ind rooms with people again buat i me y i do not have to be lonely any more i was lonely it is lonely to be hiding this much it is isolating other cons feeling exposed it felt i was in this storm and i had a little tarp covering me and at any moment the wind was going to rip the tarp off and i'm just clunching it down all of the time and when i finally rips off you are oka now i can just give in to it i can get soaked and see where we go from here thre any other prose or cons amyou it is hard every time i'm introduced there is a truggar warning tink thats the folloyry one at the top itis ason and everydin i evey time your introduced you mein on the radio or something that adon an event an an event the other ow this may not be really distrussing and i'm sitting there what am i about to do that e pe i int want to be introduce and not have to warrn people that i'm about to start speaking a cat is your last question from shametow who is emily do to you now is she gone she is there she will definitely always be there be there is a separate person from you yes really ye she is a sut you i thought you might say that you have now shev integrated her she is now part of you oh ye i think

today shows sponser baexpress vepien dueca rub his ter being seen in sol to advertisers now meaneither get express ve pian right now express ve piantakan slashben on sunday an elderly jewish man attending a pro israel rally in thousandnotes california was killed that fer being allegedly hit in the head with a magaphone wielded by a procomas protestor that attack represents only the latest and most damaging antismetic attack in the west in sidney austraelia journalists shery martzin reports that a jewish man was nearly beaten to death by a procomasmob and ended up in the hospitl for four days the concussion and fores pinal fracturs in france a jewishwoman was stab twice in the stomach and a swaska talbed on her dor in indiana a prochomos woman tried to drive a car into what she thought was a jewish school normally such events might spur nation wide conversations about anti sematism and the coss of ratical reteric after all according to the whitehouse a national conversation regarding is lamaphobia has ben made necessary by the murder of a six year old palsinin arab child and michian buttn no there is been no such conversation about any climate of hate that is for one reason and one reason alone the people doing the hating and the people hated those doing the hating are fans of comass both radical muslems and fellow travellers on the west those being hated are jews and as every one of sophisticated moral ben knows muslims being disproportionately brown and disproportionately poor and the majority in dozens of materially under performing countries globely are victims and jews being highly educated and high earning and the majority and precisely on materially successful state are victimizers that is always the math brown or poor equals opprest white or successful equals oppressor being a member of the oppressed means you are a victim the matter how evil you are that is precisely why congress woman resheta toleeb a raging juwhator is now being treated as victim by many in the leggacy media to leeb is a sitting congress woman which means that by any standard she is successful but she is also brown and also hates the lest which means that she is a member of the oppressed class and this means she can spout bloodlibels she still maintains that israel bom to hospital and gaza despite all evidence to the contry it means she can call for the utter destruction of the seate of israel pushing the slogan from the river to the sea and the genicide that inevitably entails it means she can blame israel for comsses attack on is rayly cevilians while claiming moral equivalents whic tween a group that burns babies alive and a group that tempts to avoid civilian casualties it means she can spend her career hob nobing with open terror supportes and it means she can claim falsely that israel is engaged in genicide and threatened present an bidon over that false claim and then when called on her lies and her jewhatred she can shed crocodile teers that is precisely what happened yesterday when a resolution sponcerd by represent of richmacormic of georgia called for her censur mckormic's resolution centsured to lee before quote promoting false narratives regarding the october seventh twenty twenty three commasitac on israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of israel the resolution passed two thirty forts one eighty eight with twenty two democrats voting in favor this resolution according to tolev in her allies is oppression rachita to leeb is the victim to leeb is a cribely to be more specific she is a crycomasnic she supports the most agregious atrocities known to man but hives behind her religion to claim amunity and then weeves about her supposed victimhood here she was yesterday claiming that she was being silenced and then of course crying about it i will not be silence and i will not let you distort my words folks forget i'm from the city of detrit the most beautiful blackest city in the country where i learn to speak truth to power even if my voice shaks trying to bellieve or censor me will not work because this movement for a seas fire is much bigger than one person mister cher do what it is to fear rising hate crimes to know how aslamophobia and antisematism makes us all less safe and worry that your own child might suffer the horrors that six year old what dea did in a lonois i cannot believe i have to say this but palistemian people are not disposable there the dears a and she is comforted by illhanomark fellocomossnic ah ah ato carshet it is okay youre lok your strongl nowgyuman bean it is o can you just any one else no one said that palistinians are not human beings just anyone else that just said that commas is evil and should be destroyed and she disagrees with that and believes that isral is evil and ought to be destroyed thet take that she is a victim is weird given the pretty much every major member of the democratic party rushed to her defence a came jeffreys the democratic minority leader blames extreme madtha pushback for blowback against the terroris supporting to leap io e eo eeereofooo e eoe ra eseoea ooe tis is leal it is extreme maddagenda to say that from the river to the sea is bak represent of deb dingle of mischingan tried to claim that from the river to the sea is actually just open to interpretation a piece of abstract poetry a

small come o start of this conflict y murdering forteen hundred jewes including babies children women and men they still have two hundred forty people kept in bondage and gaza as their hostages they openly braggd about hiding rockets and terroris beneath civilian centers they are open about it they even sean at anchors jake tapper notice shere was jake last night hamoss which is the government of gaza based on their own words tey they think the loss of palston nd civilian lives is just the cost of liberation be they think that even though thereare the government of gazit is not their responsibility to protect palston and civilians the thonnels ar for themselves profiting not procivilians and then theyre determined to continu wi thacking israel the thing way they did on octoberseven over and over and over fasted on what they say for these reasongs israel sas we cannot have a ting fire an when even jak tapper as noticing that means that its pretty ovius by the way commotra says this stuff out loud there is an article in the ew york times to day quoting a top member of comossand quote commosas gol is not to run gaza and to bring it water an electricity and such come oss the cossam and the resistance woke the world up from its deep sleep and showed that this issue must remin on the table this battle was not because we wanted fuel or laborers it did not seek to improve the situation goza this battle is to completely overthrow the situation comess commits a terro setrocity not caring bat itone cevillians and then hodszons villans in pervrac it is bought when israel inevitably has to kills civilians in the process of targeting terroris commoss then sheds the falsest of teers they put out tape showing people mourning they are dad caus bycommoss and the world largely falls for it that is because the oppressor oppressed narrative is all consuming it is all powerful this narrative outwaighs decency it outways truth for those who believe the narrative truth is of no consequence whatsoever it is not even a tortiary value there will be no conversations about tone or hate speech or the obvious jewhatred evidence on the streets of america's major cities at least not with regard to to lead there will be serious minded conversations tbhe how the evil mago movement is preading is lamiphobia for criticizing to led and stepping out of line will not be tolerated that presumably is why after senator elizabeth warran issue to tweat decrying antitemptism shewas then force to rush out another tweet decrying is lomifobia that is why the mediar

fire wir talkin about ev by layin down er arms e for in indefinite period o time in the antiscipation of peace talk sinc some sort of negotiated settleman we ti do belete ted thit sory time for that right now we do think it is the time to continue to pursue pauseis in the fighting of a temporary nature for specific purposes he is right about that although when he says temporary plauses for humaniter israel is already doing that they have open humaniterian quarters that come moss than attempts to clothes by shooting people for guarding the humaniterian corridors tjohn curby also is having none of the israel is genicidel monsense yesterday and this is good stuff f om the by deministration a rarity to hear from people me here is john curby yesterday i heard this word jenicide tasash rala a moss actually does have genicide ol intentions against to people of this rael they would to see at whited off them at they said on purpose that is what that is what tat stake here and were going to keep making sure that is ral haze that ability to do that as for the voices of course we respect all different voices an perspectives on this and we know that there is a lot of and that there there is a lot of high motion here when it comes to what is going on we have never shided away from criticizing our friends and partners when we believe it is wornted and wi'll continue to do that we also believe th at a that de that the the best de pomasee the the best progress and diplomatic pursuits is to do it that privately and outside the public iye and will continue to do that as well and meanwhile and all arbia reporter when after john curby and cruld be shut them downs again is a lot of positive stoff here from john curby and iisi tis o wen actiane in ian on eo o wi iton on

responsibility defend it and organ to make sure they have the tools an capabilities to do that again wher one month after this and and we ought not forget what happen one month ago four teen hundred people slaughtered in their homes at a music festable and when hol mass decided to conduct operations it was with the intent of killing people ou's right about all f that now the problem is the debide deministration then it gaes completely unrealistic on what comes next and they are unrealistic about again what is happening in the streets of the united states yesterday care john pierr was the as from that same podium about people ribbing down posters of kinnap victims the hossages than are curlinny helligaza apparently shed nothing to say about it she is just awful etter job as always alot beios a individuals who ave been tearing down sines many of these thinking place an or tite o tis railis presently being held hossage in gosi er tence antense o copretations of taken plac there is the white houses view tha these actions shoul be can down the pulling of the plling down of them por of the bats of form of peaceful protest wer guy a i ive e sort of kind of feenge reporting here and there they gos for last week ra thirty million to o no iie i hear i'm just not going to nooi a'm not g there is tha usa pei oo ido noi is not going to goin to a spacifics on that particular thing what i can fay there ar real violent protestantret terhappening right now and tiner mniticionapicials a awere thes report wetur deeply concerning and that is something that were focuston that is weak te that is week tea at best from coren chan perbut again no shock there now the problem is that if you do it the bydaministration seems to want to do which is pretend that comas is a tiny little group that no one likes in the gozistrip or injured anto marry the westbank when you pretend that you end up at the wrong solution again your pretending away the central problem here the central problem here at rout is not just the commas is a genicitle terros scroup it is that a huge suath of palcinians agree with commoss by pallin data bilec toral data that is the reality that does not mean they shuld be treated as military targets israel asn' treating him is military targets anywhere during this conflict ite's members of comas are being treated as military targets and is many civilians who agree with comas who israels attempting to now usher down to the south of the gasis trip the problem is if you failed to recognize that there is a broader ideological problem within the palsinian population the minute that this is over the next re constituted government in gozo will look exactly the last re constituted government in goza which will look exactly the current palsnian authority was by the way is unpopular becat the palcinian authority literally pays people to killd jues they have a stipend that they pay to the families of terroris who killd jus the commas terrase who killed use teir families will get money from the palcinian authority those o the people the by deministratio ants to put in charge of the gasistrip but the palcnian authority is too moderate for a huge number of people living in both judantomaria and the gasistript which presumably is why there is an assassination attempt onmachmud abas according to the express dadcom there is horrifyine footage capturing what a purs to benits attempt at assassination against the palcinian president machmudbas his convoi cim under a hail of gun fire after he disre garded an medicing ultimatum from rennigate palcinian security forces urging him to declare war on israel again the biggest problem is that the palcinian authority which is already extreme and hates israel and abos is a genisi a mean he he actively says the holicostin happen a bas is too moderate for a huge prercentage of the palstinian population that is te abiding problem nd until the west ic knowledge is that there is not can be

between the s ralies and the and the americans that relies on what you think the gosistrip is meaning who do you think is going to pick up the pieces over there now israel is tried to hand it to egypt egypt does wanting piece of it by why did not egypt does want control of the godstrip aneither tis is re why doyou think that is is it because they all hate that six miles of beach front territory on th mediterranean that shu pritanized territory right onthe mediterraneanslic a coastlines him coast linisteleveve why exactly does noon want tus the anseris iv two million people living there who are radicalize that egypt is deeply afraid that if it takes in that group of people that they are going to have a terror threat on their northern border since isis is already ocupying large poportions of the sinidezert which is egyptian teritory it isthe same reason why israel has tried to hands over control of palsinian arab territories of palsinian arab populated areas in judaa and simaria to jordan and yourns no no wayman we have no interest in three million palsinian arabs living in this area because their afraid that is going to overthrow the hashmit dynasty that is the irony of watching creenroind queen ranea of jordan who is palsinian arab by extraction talking about how much solid arty she has with palistinians om if you did you would resin your position and the hashmy dynasty would be overthrown but you are enjoing your five star hotels and you'r extremely luxurious life style while people in your contry are living on forty one hundred dollars a year and the reason yu're not leaving is because your population in jordan is a pretty extreme population an the will get more extreme if you were to take in even including territory three million palstinian arabs who hate jews with a with a burning passion by pollindata that is what the poles suggest the the thereis no evidence i'm i'm waiting the evidence that palsinian arabs in judaa and simaria palsinian arabs in the gosistrip overwhelmingly in the absence of their current leadership our jew loving piece loving people what that dosn't mean again that ther legitimate military tarket's no bes talking about that or talking bout is who gets to govern in tese areas oneof the assumptions inc dousan five when isrepulled out ofthe gosistrip is that the 're then be elections the elections were overseen and grenlet by the united states conslets a righcts said that the shos then the secretary state that the the election that was held in the gossistrip was legitimate who got elected come oss come oss then proceeded to kill everybody in the alsinian authority but if their an election held today the reason makh wudbos is not held an election in jud antomarea is that he is afraid he as now tnelection since two thousand et by the way he is afraid that if anelection were held to day the palsnan authority would los they do not actualy have all that much power that is how extreme the population is in these areas which is why the problem is supremely intractable with that said this is why israel is saying that they are going tohave a continuing security roll in gaza after comas is alsted a corning t the lostrjurnal israel send an intendse foretain security control of goza for an indefinite periad once the worthmas end prompting yous sofficials to stress their opposition to a re occupation of the onclave now agan israel did not want to reoccupy at all israel literally pulled out everyone they took eight thousand jews out of that area and gushcatif and they move them they physically had jews remove other jews and take them away from the area they have never seen by the way anyone in palistonian government do anything remotely that take arabs out of one area and move them two another area purposefully in order towe had a concession to the jews this has never happened ever israel took eight thousand jews and move them out of the north of the goselstrip the gusketi varia they hands it over their houses their green houses all of the infor structure the palsinians promptly burned it an electic comas and created the greatest terror state it is thay at agsaged a giant terror territory over the course last twenty year when israel says we have to maintain a security presence in the got whell da da it is the equivalent of yo of the highest crime area in a city and then you say defun the police hed you fund the police and the morderate goes up and then the murders spread outside that area and the police hey will now we got o go back in is that because the police are desperate to be in that area ors it because the crime needs to go away and the only way that the crime goes away is if you put law in forcemen in the area that is what israel is talking about here is a penjaman its now who talking about an indefinite period of control of a gossa again if if there is any thought that is reallys are desperate to spend blood and trasure to maintain security control over the gossi strip you are on your mind remember in israel everyone is elligible for the draft every eighteen year old kid they turn eighteen they got go the military think moms and dads an israel are desperate to send their kids into the gossi strip they were desperate not to send their cinsinto the gosstrip they handed the damn place over to over to come as 's tat's now won ithn now who saying but the by administrations well maybe itsolandgrab a land grab of what to million palisinian arabs the bassmatority whom despise the jews and which to see israel destroyed buy the data in any case here is am here is nothing now who talking about whatscan have t come next president byn has said that it would be a mistake for israel to occupie gosa who should govern gaza when this is over those who do not wan to law contuni the way of hom mos the certail is non then i then gisrael will efor then the gefine gered well have the oll roll oh security responsibility because we have seen what happens when we do not have when we do not have that security responsibility whal we have is the iruption of hamascar on the skill that we could not imagin to have a warning to aron to ispola i think things o understood thet i the antrog the warin a svego way the response will be very very poful n i hope thet do not may tha sti gay again the fact that the united states is taking that as we have to warn the jews off of reoccupying gossip again no one it is a very very select few people actually want to have complete civilian control of the gossistrip including pretty much everybody who is in is rally government at this point in time why wes again the gosistrip angerdan to mary are honeycombed with people who hate jews by the way half a work for the uen tyou an refuge g agency which was set up solely for the palsonians it is the only agency of the united nations that is been set up for one group of people in one group of people alone it is the bizar reason why cities that been built in the gossistrpen havebeen there for seventy five years are still being called refuge g camps despite the fact gebalia that they are com plete and full cities some of the you and our w a employies by the way these eganies are people who literally work for the united nations many of the people support terror these be will work for the en celebrated the commoss massacre for example you and our w a teacher osma rafik kuhel he celebrated the commas attack with exclamation marks in a heart emogy you and our way employe mahamed i'll shake ali in october tepthe posted quot any one who tries to fleet to the south should be treated the way we ought to treat traitors and the only acceptable direction to move its east or north which would be by the wy into israel that is a commoscenvationof israel or ho about the you and our d gossi school administrator come o the achmen a'n october seventh he postoqhat we welcome the great october andthey e called for epthnect clensing of all jews in israel the ar people work for the sagain they deo tha israels ging to give up control of the gossistrip an security terms to the united nations is absolutely absurd what exactly is going to come next again i think in the end what is going to come iis in is raili military control of the gossistrip while the search for some local leader who will do the work of actually attempting to administer the gosisstrip finding that person is not going to be easy again i're not for the palsin an authority wants it they can barely control juday and tomaria the egyptians do not want it the jordanians do not want it the ua do not want it the sauties do not want it the europeans do not want it the americans do not want it nobody wants it why do not they want it again it comes down ju there is going to have to be he decades long shift in the opinion structures and insensive structures of people living in the gossistrip sthaid they recognize that if they were to build their lives around say material prosperity and some level of religious tolerance that their wives might be better than if they direct their lives an their children's lives toward the murder of every jew in the region that is the only way that anything better as can hapen is why when people talk about a two state solution the current context it is absolutely nonsensicale it is absolute ridiculous with whom with whom you n't talht two states solution yer can need a peace partner who exactly woold that be no one can answer that question becaue the question does not have an answer unfortunately israel wishes it did considering ta dey ave now offered very generous piecteals in nineteen ninety three two thousand two thousand one and two thousand eight and gave te entire gosstrip over to the palcinanes in two thousand five oket coming up we are going to get to a series of disastrous elections for republicans in ohio in kentucky in virginia what the hell is going on jobins wildly on

control of the virginia legislature this was seen in large partis refrnim on glen young kin who is the virginia governor there for some od reason seem to be a lot of notion that youngkin was gin throw his hat into the presidential race for something if the virginia state legislature have been taken by re publicans i think that was always a fo olds errand there is really no ground swell for glen young kin to get into the presidential race it diesn't really matter because virginia democrats did really really well last night they did really really well because they one based on running on abortion that was the issue that they ran on now here is the thing about political issues and messaging there is no such thing is a winning issue there is only such a thing as a winning message this is something that republicans and democrats should keep in mind as they run for office in the future when it comes to running it is not that in issue just defaults to you sof there is a poll that says jobidon really un popular on the economy that is not a republican issue you have to then craft that into a message that wins this is true for virtually ever issue any issue could theoretically be a winning issue long as it is message properly for exampling glen young can became governor of virginian upset terry mcallif the former governor of virginia when that happened one of the reasons he on is because there is a parents rights movement ther really sprang up around a case that as reported by our own mookgruesiac hure at daily wire in loudan county we are schools a winning issue in virginia or was it a winning message that parents ought to have controll over their own kids and their education and their safety and those cit should not be put in danger by foolish school ad ministrators and then terry mccalliff pick the wrong message which is you should not be ing control of your kids but the administrator should being control of yourkids you haveto have a winning message and youropponent has to have a loosing message that is the way that you actually win elections ourepublicans since twenty sixteen have not had any winin mssages let us ut be real about this rona ramni mc daniel should not be the head of the arrancy i do not knowhow you can lose this many times in a row and still retain your job it is truly amazing the only person was failed up as much as ronoromni mc daniel jus pen his comell harris republicans have no low selections in twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty one twenty twenty two and twenty twenty three the last selection they one was twenty sixteen they have under performed every single election since then and yet people retain their jobs and continue to draw pachects and that is unacceptable what exactly happened in virginia where one of the things that happened in virginia is again there is a lot of talk about abortion by democrats according to the washington post democrats flipped control of the virginia house of delegates securing victories in at least fifty one seats giving them majority in both chambers of the general assembly republicans wore defending a slim fifty two to forty ight majority but democrats saw an opportunity to make gains under newly drawn mapse following a court ordered redistricting process or democrats definitely got a hand from the local courts in drawing districts that benefited then surely after eleven pian before any independen news organizations called the race virginia house minority leader delegat don l scott declare democrats would sume control of the house and the senante following tuesdays election s again this was a race that was largely run on the basis of abortion glen young can was running round the state attempting to drum up support for his own side the problem is that right now again things are not going younkan is personally very popular in virginia that does not necssarily transly over into republican control if republicans have a bad image o across the country and wright now republican to a bad amage across the country there seem as largly in competent again partially or larshly earn there seem as extreme by bran and that is largely ties euganuary six and donall trump in particular as woe'll see in in discussington these other lections and when it comes to the abortion is youe republicans have not yet gotten their heads around in actual winning message on the issue now the truth is that winning message on abortion is not the same across the country politicis of pragmatic business and the full pro life message in virginia is not going to go the same way as the full pro life message in sa georgia or florida in flority can pass the six week abortion band because republicans are very popular here in georgia you can do the same you cannot do that in virginia glen younken was not running on that he was running on a fifteen week abortion ban the problem was the democrats were saying that is the first step toward republicans going for the full abortion band in virginia and local ladies got very upset and they all came out and they voted in favor of the democrats ind the same thing happened in ohio as well in the wake of rovers's waihe republican have not come up with a state by state strategy or a messaging strategy and here is what the actual strategy needs to be on a state by state basis where there is consentsus you pass a thing where there is not consentsus you do not pass the thing now there is no one in america as for life time a've spokeni the marshal life i'm fully pro life i do not even in my own personal idea of of what good legislation lookd i would not tolerate abortion even in cases that are very controversial graper intest i'm as prolife as it is possible to be a been extremely clear about this however if you wish to see fewer abortions in the united states if you wish to see durable law in the united states you have to win an if you want to win that is going to mean they are going o have to come face to face with some tough realities and the reality is that running on my platform running on what i would ligket to see is not going to win you office in virginia it is not and h more threatening you appear in virginia the worse its going to go for you the same thing happened in ohio in ohio the democrats in in pretty wide fashion one a rreferendum on abortion what they call abortion rights what it really was was in shrinning roverse's waded in law in the state of ohio in ohio tere is an attempt to im in shrine the right to abortion in the state constitution it is a ballat initiative it establishes quat an individual right to one to own reproductive medical treatment including but not limited to abortion and creates legal protections for any one who assists a portion with receiving reproductive medical treatment according to the washington post the amendment grants the treating physicion the authority to determine on a case by case basis whether an unborn child is viable and grant's exceptions for abortions at any stage of pregnancy to protect the health or life of the mother why did this happen while the reason has happened is because there is another election that was held in august that was a referendum they wouldhave made a more difficult to amend the state constitution through future ballat initiatives the reason for that is because the're was a snapback law in place in ohio that that effectively band abortion almost across the bord in ohio in the aftermath of rovers's weighe being overturned they tried to pass a law of the republicans the basically in shrined in the constitution what that law was it is can be very difficult free to overturn that and that was rejected and then a rate to abortion was in shrined in the state constitution now let us say that the republicans instead of allowing that snapback low to gone to place let us say that they tilisen we know than in ohio that the the law before this was twenty two weeks twenty to weexsis weig too late but we ed to incrementally introduce the people of ohio to what good abortion law looks the're not gon to go to six weeks an stay there andif you are not preserve lives in long term ou have to thisencrementligs that is hap politics often works the message is lives must be preserve but we also have to go a little slower than even we would want for sure than we would want because people have to get use to ideas theyhave to be unindoctrinated about what life is and what abortion is and oregan go to a fifteen week in ohio hard to see how that would failed for example ohios very red state down from one that state by eight ten points in last couplelection cycles they dan do that and instead get the snapback in ohio which now has been srine basicaly roverse's weighed again that is the same thing that happen in virginia republicans is it a lotter pubicans isting abortion is not a winning isses nofm not being a winning issuetsabout do you have a winning message and can you wrong for your opponets the nice thing about arguing from incremental approach is that democrats are then forced to argue in faver of twenty wek abortions and twenty two week abortions and that is not something that they arguing over they arguing over rapen incest exceptions because those are the most out lying and and least common forms of abortion both sides arguing at the extremes of this particular argument the right is very comfortable arguen parts of partial bort the bortion provious reasons left is very art comfortable arguing rape an incest the question is where is that line where the meetian voter tips over from one side to the otherand again winning elections is the precondition to changing the law republican should keep that in mine meanwhile over in kentuck abut by the wy the pulling in ohio was pretty clear about this every single demographic supported the enshrinement of rovers's weighed in to law who split fifty fifty with white men but what women support the initiative fifty seven to forty three black men supportd the initiative eighty seven thirteen black women supported the initiative eighti one to nineteen in fact the only demographic that boted against this initiative to in shrine rover's wagde were people where sixty five or older literally the only one is that means the republicans message tat wrong an me that is clearly thely message itt does not mean y out a run away from the abortionitine you can ake very strong an excellent abortion argumens but what is happening right now is that all this is getting hashed out at the state level which is why rovers's weight by the way thisis what should have happen roversuay being orturn kickd it back to the tate level states now get to the s ide on their own legally speaking how to approach the issue abortion republicans in each state have to take stock of exactly how they wish to run on those particular issues and in toll republican start to realize that i nationalized strategy across all issues is not going to work they'r gen continue lose state elections over in kentucky meanwhile anni bisher one his reelect effort which is amazing becasing in that state when twenty two points in favor of donal trump now he did out spend his opponent danuel cameron by e very large martion mashurnis democratic alies apparently swamp republican spending forty seven million dollars on nadds after the mad primary republicans were only able to spend twenty nine million dollars mishr's campaign spent around twenty four million dollars on ads that is more than five times what camerans campaign actually spent on all this and again kentucky was run on abortion mesur's campaign featsure young woman who step father raped tor one sue was twelve and suggested that she needed to beal to have an abortion get democrats cgan a run on abortion on the state level a cross the country republicans are can have figure out a state by state level how to addrest this issue because that is the realm of practical politics overturning roversis wade youcan ake a full prolife case for over turning roverse's wade it cit certainly makin easy legal case the rovers's wagshu goverturn but to pretend this is ot a thorny issue fore publicans is to ignore the realities of the facts on the ground on the tate level to pretend that the same message works in e jorga as works in ohio as worksin ken tucky as works anywhere else is a mistake and republicans had better get their heads around that or they are ge n continue loosing it also does not help when again you are running candidates who add to the piold things january six or or can be labeled conco mag up the people on the right are annoyd that the left keeps saying maga over and over oviously left fines this fruitful otherise they wen do it as anlec toral strategy it is born fruit for them which means thy'll continued to it untill republicans come up with a better counter then nanny nanni booboo in just one secon will talk about the vulner abilities of jobidon because there is big republican debate tonight get to that momentarily first the benshopiro sho is supported by gran canyon university in a

grand canyon university private christian a fordable visit g c u dot ed u to day well all of this ounow the fact that messaging matters that thirs no such thng as winning issue the is just a winning message this cis the reason why jobidon's vulner abilities are not in of themselves going to defe jobidon somebody has it if he jobidon has to be a winning message as much we talk in twenty twenty byt jobidon hiding the basement and that is true the winning message for jobidon was trump is crazy he should not be president that was the winng message for him and it did win that is why the basemen stratetue works now donal trump coodwin an election agains yur bide besing that gies awful at t is job he is awful and terrible at this job but that means yest run on that the election cannot be about anything else well the good news is that is pretty fertile ground democrats are busily attempting to convince people that everybody is doing great in america paul crogmen has an entire piece titled why does the right to hate america in the nertime todate what wise he saying it the right haes america becaue the right is pointing out that crime has spiked in the last couple of years democrat an there in their pro crime policies thet republicans are sort of upset about the state of the economy even though he says that the economy is just glowing and doing amazing really try to convince the american people that their feelings are wrong on these issues really go for it even many democratan and popular hollywood entertainers are starting to figure out that jobidony is a very very bad candidate now again republicans could take that for grants an that ctossum is gan alose that be a huge widespread mistake but here is there a silverman last night this is pretty biting stuff against jobiden ings up wit the reason most of the peoplein the side an can no sleep wile last night an new poll shos jobiding getting tros by donal trump an almos tevery tangl swang stay a i fil toraly to say bide an mo definitlylis he culd actsalinly diin his slep instead in thing tis isrely scary alltimprals that i mean actually scarin not they too camal tan o tisna plu scary well yes democrats are in a state of full skopanic over jobiden an again they should be becaue theres can be more that drops about him and hunter there is no me more that drops in terms the economy before the election now to night is a big republican debate now an i sa big any candabig there is an as at cannabig is because donal trump is running away in the pulling dattar riht now just running away the national jeo peo pulling dita has donal trump up near sixty per cent that tis hies he has been this entire election cycle he is up in the real clerpolitic saverage at fifty eight per cent ron to santis is at fourteen nigehale is at nine the vacromastruamy is at four chrisse is at three and everybody else is an also ran i do love than the real clepolitic polling average timscott is running below my pencures no longer in the race dug burgham for some reason i still the race do not understands why but oki in any case trump has this extremely largely now in iwa the lead is not quite as large b still very large the current pulling suggests than he is up on the field by somewhere in the nibeer of twenty five to twenty seven points that is where it wtwhich is the biglad it is a bigly but he is not have it majority of voters clearly moving his direction yesterdaye him runnald to the governor of iwhat very popular governor of iwa in dorse urontosantis heres with that sounded we need to make sure that we choose wisely that we make the right disision that we a lot somebody who can actually win and beat jo bidon and we need a president who has the kolve and the resolve to reverse the madness that we see on a daily bases we need a president that is focus on the future and not the past and we t out prethinat who put a merian an a meri first an iraaraa nay there she is not or thint now she is issue wildly popular and iwa skin oflake even in iwa the lates semmerson college pole showe her approval rating it thirty to per cent approve thirty nine per cents tis prove twenty nine per cent nutrumps enoligan about camronalds in iwa but she does have a very large political organization in iwa and this effectively is going to four close the possibility that nickey hayley comes from behind and overtakes at this point ron to santus be'se agans to caukes states what that means is that the santis in iwa is the truest threats to trump now that is also the state here the poles r the closest if nobody beats trump in iwa it is clearly and avertly over it may be over even of somebody does beat trump in iwa obviously he lost iwa the first time around against tat cruz and then he proceeded s win the nomination if you look at the other states that are coming up in the republican nominating process trump is well ahead in all of those states nou hampshire he has forty nine per cent to hayley's fifteen per cent to de sants is eleven per cent to christy's nine per cent now gain those numbers are not fifty five per cent sixty per cent in the early states but that is before he get down sout once o get down to south carolina trumps can clean up there needs to be a major showing of some level of momentum by another republican candidate the thing that is prohibiting that is in fact shobidon's weak polling data republicans are gin to have to think a little b their heads instead of just looking at the poling get nowt that is weard from yo say i thin polling datit is cany only dita we have what other evidence we have with that said the poles are also showing there is a lot o mally ability between trump and bidon got to take that into account will trump be able to deliver the knock out blow to bidon will he be able to deliver the message at its going to get jobidon booted frum office that is the question hovering in the background of to nght's republican teates what neens to happen in to night's republican dobate well clearly at some point here to santus and halar ganto go at each other haley hasto knock to santus out just not only knock to santus out just to somehow can solidate the rest of the fields support that is a very uphill road has that said before ron to santus if he bows out of the race right now half his support will go to the non trump candidate and half his supportwill go to the trump candidate meanin trump that means that if he is got twenty per cent in these poles ten per cent tht goes to trump that puts trumpet sixty or seventy per cent s that is over hayley purns hire support base is outside thetrump camp no one who loves trump is supporting haily this jurs not the crossover right now if sure to drop out presumably that upport thats split among christy and romasuamy cried not romason christy the santus and then is the field consolidated it mi turn into two manrace with that said what is to nights race good for it is got a clear the field there has to be some drop outs after this race tems gotneans to go away for whatever his three per cent are worth cris cristy has no shout of the nomination he knows it it is a spite campaign that is the only thing that drives the the the round mounderemound over here i's just pure spite that is the only reason he solnerace he neens to gowa e he he is doing nothing that mike pence did not already try this is a thi's a two person race for the second place finish and until that part of the field consolidates there is certainly no shot at defeeding donal trump even if they consolidate donal trump has just by the numbers a wild advantage and republicans are gingto have to decide before the election cycel if they believe that donal trump is the best person to take on jobidon just assuming that biding himself as the winning issue and there does not ned a be winning message are dogise the rest of the cho continues right now inr noconortimis it will b join by dan

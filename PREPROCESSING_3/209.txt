incredible for the people that they love going too great and ridiculous lants in boving live animals a deer a slid ancient rindeer bones which lead only sometimes to the most magical christmases o do you be easy chicago it is this american life stay with us auon christmas in three d we all learn at some point that her parents make mistakes and that cant even and i know this would be a shock make themi when they are trying their hardest at christmas my a grants tells the story a quick warning for people listening with young children this is he story about one familys sent a cause traditions which may not be the same as yours alse a i should say to day show us a rerun from a fewars backs everybody hear your hearing and the story is just a bit older now and mi here is my my friend callin muchler is thirty six and to this day he talks about his christmases as a kid that is because his parents were determined to make the magic of christmas come alive for their three kits callin otam and erica but they went further than any parents i know they wanted to be real really real this was in the nearbrush tohoho christmas but a darker readier one that one year when callin was seven and his dad sent him to the garage for some firewood and i heard some bells and a kind of freakt me out an i gran inside was an my guodu guiyes i swear i heard some bells and my own my dels no way reallieron i went we went back slowly out side and and bas ebe founds older man callin's younger brother atam was there too this man had falln in a back yard and slipped on the ise but i was young it was who as as crazy man tha back yard and tha sort of are you care your care and they brought him inside he was wearing a very old run down weathered jackid an he said he has lik winburn and you kno could you dim the lights ive got snop ons from the time the north pole and there is a certain amount of glare that kan't be a wat we dim the lights to talked in a very soft spok in not not a whisper but we he talk quietly enough at the whole room was silentand had to comlan in ndthit was that sort of weird intimate sort of e just it merse in whatever he was saying and he basic wi said on chris crangl adam was for and he says this is is earliest memory of christmas all the muchelor kids have memories this probably because they talked about it all the time when they were little collin and adam did not think there was just one santa claus living at the north pole the muchlor family had their own mythology with its own logic there was not just one santa but a net work of santas all working together as christmas helpers christ cringle was just one of them a working mansanta and just a guy in a nightshift from hell he was exhausted we can ov were almost helping him dynamic with such that it was he was in a rough place and we were trying to help him and i think we talked with him forabidn and an put him on his way or visitors chris appeared every couple of years or in the band of woods dividing their house in harrington parknew jersey from a near by golf course never the same guy never in exactly the same place they would be dishevelled bearded and horse foist abandoned by their skiddish and surprisingly losible reindeer and searching for the muchelors whos home addresst they never quite figured out the muchelors also had a family elf jecco who the kids never saw but who apparently lived in the attic for a few weeks before christmas the kids would hear noises coming from upstairs hammering wolking and when christmas was over they would find woodscraps in the attic from the gifts he would made for them proofed that jeco had been there both their father and grandfather grew up with jecca the grandfather specially loved to tell scary stories about how mean jecco could be and every christmas the family spent hours coming over th deetails of jeco wen their visitors comparing them to previous christmasmas and tisipating the next when you ask the mu chelor kids which christmas visitor was the one who out did the rest there is no question christmas eve nineteen eighty four collin was eight adam was five erica was two the family was out taking their usual walk and on this night they went down to the golf course it was foggy and dark here is adam and then in the distance we see this silhouette of a shadow scampering from my treed a tree and hits golf course is an open wide spaces and looking it does not they do not want us to know that they are there and ti dats as what it is to find out who that is ans we start walking faster try to catch up with the sky only come upon him he is in this i no very worn dirty santa claus suit thats cont of this greenish brownd tim and he introduces himself as claus offer and he is one of many sort of the the santa claus and incarnations some sor andthat he goes into full explanation but he' desn't ly some hi spiance that i can we mention an chriscrangon oein a chris clauvs had a worn sack and began pulling out christmas but the presence for very odd there was vegetables i had a brochly and on onion and then he also i and gave us some bones and that sort of comes to the most important thing as he broke out one bone in particular and he said this is one of the bones from that his the original rudolph and i use it to call the r anger again hears callin and their sister erica and literlly when he broke out bones and start blowing on them we were onl my god now this is crazy made no noise we could not hear it but he said it was a pitch that only the randeer culd her and when he talked about rudolph it was not rudolph te bed knows rangeer it was he can of was honoring the history of rudolph as some you a rangeer that at at they all honoured and the fact that he had some of these bones of rudolph and was using them to call to the ranger just it would mad sense to us it was that make sense the details were perfectly calibrated as only people who know you as well as your parents can get just right here is adam and that is whan our coscury he offered all the kids he said ire can only invite the kids but you gask more come on the on a slay do i come to the north poth m and we just at there frozen woll i could say yes the answers know the truth is in some old man that you just met in the dark golf course on christmas eve actually asks m and my brother my sister if we wante go with him somewhere that we have no idea ey while that might be the coolest thing of all time it might also be o the end of life as i know it again erica who remember was too at the time and i remember screaming and not wanting to go i was just terrified actually that invitation to the north pole that never happened at least not the way they remember a this is a recorting from that christmas eve in nineteen eighty for erica adam and callin had just come back for me to class on the recording the kid seem happy and hopped up on a genalon they talk about claus but in the entire ecourting never mention any invitation to the north pole what you hear instead is the grandfather suggesting how would you it if he had asked yo take the north pole then their father glenchempson behold the power of suggestion that is how it seemed a lot of it worked the muchler parents making suggestions an adding details and then retelling it all year after year christmas was a big topic of conversation and the muchler parents encouraged their kids with the most exciting versions of what happened on this nights to the point where the stories gained and unstopacle momentum and as the muchlor kids got older things as they do changed each of the kids dealt with a differently both callan and erica say they knew it a certain point to not talk about jeco and the others to people outside their closest circles but adam did not get that at all adam loves to tell a good story he could not not tell this one and he believe tole hartedly in his experiences even as a tea natur in public school in new jersey and it had consequences when adam was in fifth grate he defended his stories about class and chris and the rest in front of his whole clas it got confontational with adam telling the whole group how wrong they were bhut the teacher ended of calling adam's parents telling them that it almost started a fight and asking them to plead es to tell adam to stop talking about it adam remembers many arguments this well into middle school people would callman idiot or weird and he would insist that these events were true he was there it was real you guis or crase not me the next year six grate adam was that his grand parents house at christmas time when his great aunt blanch made some offhanded comment about which uncle played what part what year back when they were kids adam walked himself through the lojict of what she was saying and he knew wrihte then that his parents had lied to him not only that they liet i me it was thirteen years old i to deal with that is a social thing that i had done i had defended myself and told these stories in front of lots of wiled of people and s another my parents re sort of responsible for allowing me to perpetuate something that made me a lirin a laughing stock you were embarrass i was very embarrassed adam felt betrayed and was angry about it for years one year he came home from college and accused is parents for being the reason he could not trust any one enough to have a serious girl friend not too different from the sorts of speeches lots of kids make to their parents at that age except it was about canta even he admits it was pretty extreme this one thing made you feel you could not trust your parents even though they were trustworthy parents well it was it was that it was the for me it was the intricacy and the planning of you spent seven years or ten years perpetrating a lie that was deep an complex whether it was harring people vinted suits in o hunting people through through the through the golf coursein through the woods but what are you insame this is diabolical for me there was a big i break down in iu know the way i trusted people m i life that i shuli i think it carried on into my a dult life and even to this dac i do not a hundred per cent trust any one any more do you feel it made you cynical little bet you hav little bit adam's thirty three and can laugh about most of this now he sees what was greayed about what his parents did at christmas but he will not be doing anything it he says when he has his own kids and because of the way he reacted as a tea nature these child hood chrismases are still a touchy subject in his family when they talk about it everybody is careful to keep things ut be i wondered if the parents had any regrets for how they handled it i went to meet the muchelors my tobi i glenan lorry muchelor live on a beautiful quiet street it is the kind of place where dear wander through the yards a giant wreeth hangs off the top the mchelor's bage cloperd house christmas lights twinkle inside an outside we sit in the living room where the mantle has been turned into an altar crowded with an assortment of spiritual icons budas vichnew a sir ramac bust of jesus and two different portraits of jerry garsia i was a hippy an did the whole nine yards glen told me on the west coast in the seventies though he does not the word hippy things has come to connote laziness and he is anything but we started talking about the elaborate christmass the muchelors used to have for their kids what and i asked lory how did you get roped into all this why i as woare ni am at bes my old ei do not know if you caught that but he called me a cynic i'm not a cynic we are just excited about how you pulled this off there is no pulling all f something happened people had an experience and then you have hi sot called somebody pulld something off i was not prepared for this decgates after these christmases glen was refusing to admit he had anything to do with creating them su youno the conjecture an or in all that stuff at would really ot under mine the magic infact all the details the as you call them the mechanic ser or or i you poll had you pull it off it happene that is the magic and that istewe went back and forth about this for more than ten minutes here is my producer robin having a go at it you would help to know if that is just can impossible thank for us to ask if he has we have som questions about how it how it work and i just i'm wondering if we can something op you could hypothesise but that is thats that you because the magic to powerful and ioo oand did they have any regrets that when they ci learn truth i asked glen an lorry about the time that adam fought with his fifth great class about the muchler christmas stories it seemed it woul have been a perfect moment to come cleans they said after the school called them they did talk to adam but they did not tell m he was wrong they did not tell him the truth if anything they encouraged him to believe the stories were real saying i was there you were there their only parental advice was be more private about it stop talking about it at school theugh lorry did come to worry that they should have handled it differently i think for me i i did really start to question whether we should be making such a big deal about and i wanted to stop doing it it deat deatly happend in my mind i did and and as you can tell fonce a very powerful force in our family and i'm and he is very powfom for yet he is and i and even before this interview if sir alike you set up the ground roas about how we were going to have the interview ther gan ask us and we are not in a tell right both glen and lorry say they tried to make it right for adamy they had no idea how the trade he felt until later lorry says for a while she did not know what to do we talked about it alot we talked about the magic and the onting get statam can you see can you can you find a place where you see where it all came from it all came from good it did not come from lying it did not come from tricking it we are not bad parents because we did that finally lorry tells me this story it is an important one for her and before she starts she says she knows glen does not wanter to tell it but that is not going to stop her one christmas eve when adam wasn'n junior high school lorry went to his bedroom and i was giving im i'm ma him a good night kiss and hu can merry christmas and he looked me straight in the eyes and he said he got to tell me the trith your son is looking at right me i sayng you got to tell me the trith did did where those ary did santa really visit us and in the back of my mind it was glen i going hou never tallion never tell it the magic the magic and i ispue all this magic and it is the magic and it is the spirit and i went on and on and he would not let it down he just said stop it do not talk about that stuff glend talks about that stuff you will tell me the truth tell me the t ris and i i do not even now what i exactly said but i did let him know that it was not real and and wa just cry that to of us and because then it over the years he when he when he did say later when h said i cannot believe that that was apparenting decision that you made that you want to that extreme he just it just heard him and it was weard because ca and erica had taken the same wonderful experience and held it as a wonderful experits no matter what happened or what was real they could hold it as a just a magic wonderful moment and he somehow could not and it it made me really sad glen understands that something went wrong without im my experience is this was with kids you did best you can and sometimes you di t right thing and ouwrong thing when you say you did th right thing you knows tere's ja time when the kids are young and you experienced the magic through them it it is just special to be round you young kids in to be in that maybe i cheet a little bit and and you sort of become oh anyou are living through them glen had been eager from the moment we arrived at his house to take us on a tour of christmast pass and after our interview glennen lory head out with us for a walk we go up the street passed through some trees and on to the golf course it was darker than i had imagined it would be bairly illuminated by the enviant orange of near by street lights mist clung to the rolling expanse of grass then glen does what his clearly beenaching to do all night gives us the play by play from his finest hour the night claus hoffer came to visit get away stay away who awis it lookin

could not git around what somthin grewd off the redenas rin dear wer wer were his nose is what guides them the light from his nose is what guides them to her thane i i think i think that is what it was ell i can remember that the they the hall was jest yon crowded everybody knew that deer was gin to be in there an everybody come to wac it o really at we he was the star attraction of the show he a ya al ya they still talk about that play i do not think they ever did tap that ply how could ye was he on stage from mose to the show alwe was on stage for the hole shell he prob'bly stood there for a gid two hours we spent the whole night standin the mi tha bu he tr he would look out in the crowd and look everybody over you could sees ears movin back an forth but we we would peted you over scratch him on the neck what did he do when they applodted i woul think that for an animal that must ha been strange the noise that would come from that nothing he stood ther he kind got's when he would wiggley's tail in his ears and go back an forth now your dad who would been against bring in a wild animal the whoe time you r would his reaction was to the play he i can remember him sayin that it was really a i nice play an he was glad that the dear had a part in it but i remember when wer ye when we started to bran we jest bagge dad to let us casteradhi when he would not do it an you knowas a kid i i jest a i was upset we wot whiht you went your dad to castrate him he would stay home it is jest a a dog you take a dog an if you have got a mal dog an you do not want that dog to go i call it tramp an all over the country side you casteratin we knew that e daded let us castaradi we' would a had him for ever but tat ano he would not let us casteratin ever the next year bamby grew up developed antlers kinding her sisters to touch the velvet on his auntless she says an bebby started actin differently sometimes he just wander away for days an when hunting season rolle around the girls begged ther dad to lock up bamby somewhere in the property but the dad said not it was not right and they did not ask twice she says fortunat because it was a small town an especially after th christmas play everybody in te valley there knew about bamby the girls would take him into town some times in a car people would come up to them on the street an pat im and they took spesch precautions therin hunting season severybody would recognize him we had a a big red scarf on hin and then we had da a sheep bell wich jest jest a little smaller than a cow bell an we would painted

a big hou better it at that at no that ily to that in as ot o ka hat's fine o canal that is fine i just understand how he could shoot him knowing that he was your pet he knew you gise r ah yah and i'd think him back i would imagine he would prob'bly what nineteen years old smart aske te najers what he was i can remember we cried mother cried and dad was pisst he he thought that was pretty pretty low for somebody to do that to an animal especially when he knew that it was ours did you blame yourselves yes i did yes the angrysalt would have probably been the same but he prob'bly would have lived he would proba'bly got another year to before he would get shot you mean if you left him with his maum ye oh ye ye it is finanth everythan have a sweet little sentimental christmas story here but now i feel sad wat ya it did in'd upsad if i was you wen ye was doin story i think may be id kind to take a little liberty with it and not burden kids with what hapn to he really what o how wouldyou wanted to end all it was just a really nice play and not tell anything happens afterwards ye ye but then if you do that version to the story then in the argument between you guis in your dad you win and cause everything were exout hapily ever after well lit i think it christmas time maybe we shuld win i well it is let us let us you take to after the play what happened to the dear oh we took him home the la was always put on on christmas e we went home cause it would hav been ten a clock in a course sana claus was gin a comin we was all he sided and send this version the story you gs if hap wa ever after rit ye a right ye and then that i vividly remember the next morning after that we ask if we could bring him in and that the mothern dad bo said yest we put a lot of christmas bo

was yourequorty back n two thousand twelve i am really sad to say right here that conny racks tide ask yo at three rplacement caus we anterd a show about people who go above in beyond to make christmas special wit the manner does that more than anybody the gift giving his person there is the operates on a global scale a docking of course about santa claus his a man who wants for nothing that is i does somethings change for him gon of thn golds stane explains each life was alonely tumble down a cool dark chimney falling falling then blackness these were santa's thoughts as he prepared snicker doodles in the kitchen in the other room the elves performed christmas tunes in dose he doed carefully he carried the tray of sweets into the living room his wife martha had been dead five years now and he was alone alone in a house full of elves jesus had dignity apostles all he had was high blood pressur and a communal toilet the size of ha serial bull he sat down on the couch and watch the elves dance to phelise nevi dad jingles broke from the group of dancing elves and approached him you are killing yourself with the dudles jingle said slamming down his gin ricky and lately he would been on santa's caste to stop over eating to get out of the house and to get himself a girl friend glinda the good whitch of the north lived only a few miles away and had just been left by her boy friend a walras hunter who looked somewhat a walris himself glindas into the wilfor brimly type said jingles you have totally got a chance glinda said santa but she sparkley i miss martha santa said quietly he knew this was true though not the entire truth there was missing of course but there was also fear look i miss martha too said jingles but it is time to move on she was the only gall for me said santa jingles put his tiny hand on santa's knee to be frank jingle said i always thought your relationship but little narsa sistic missus claus was your twin but with bosoms did you plan your outfits together we just had the same taste santa sobbed jingle bell rock started up on the squeeze box and santa took that as his cue to head to bed he never could stand rockenroll christmas songs he liked cristmas songs and he liked rockand roll he just in them together martha had felt the exact same way on their first year anniversary martha presented him with a pen the fancy kind that came in a box oh for the love of saint nicholas santa had said what good is a pen i'll just end up losing it save your money and by yourself something nice or let me buy for you that would make me most happy of all for a man famous for his giving santa was terrible at receiving martha took the penback and apologized and that was the end of the gift after she had died and santa was cleaning out her stuff in a jewellery box filled with the old love letters he would sant during their courtship he found the pen he clutched it on the edge of the bed and wept jingles took it upon himself to just go ahead and arrange a date for santa unbidden glindas expecting you at eight said jingles sidling up to him in the raindeer stable one morning and do me a favor trim your whiskers and put on your spank as instructed santa appeared at glinda's doorstep that evening a paper bag of roasted chestnuts in his hand come on in mister claus said glinda with a sweep of her arm she was dressed all in white and the house smelled of fresh jingerbred santa observed with a smile that there was several magic wands gold and sparkley in the umbrella rack for most of the evening they sat by the hearth and made clumsy conversation about the loneliness of living at the north pole mostly unless i absolutely half to i do not even bother going outside said glinda and when the cable goes out it is out said santa after a beat of silence glinda looked at him a smile across her face is this a good conversation she asked santa laughed and assured her it was they played cribbage drank egnon and watched the snow outside the window fall and in the vestibule before leaving glinda placed her hand on santa shoulder and kissed him right beneath his ye as she did santa felt as though his chest were a chimney and inside a sleeping dove was stirring away they made a date for the following week end and just before he laft glinda gave him a container of cranberry minnymuff and she baked santa told her he could not accept such a gift atd witch point she thrust it into his chest with surprising forest take it she said on the sleigh ride home santa realized with mixed feelings that he would hardly thought of martha the whole night when he showed up the following saturday glinda was all apologies shange of plans she said stopping him in the vestibule shelas here flew in this afternoon

mean maybe a little santa said my wife recently die and what is with this glinda interrupted sheela her name's linda often when santa did not know what else to say he would brake into a jolly sounding chuckle he tried it just then but the chuckle got caught in his throat and came out sounding swetty and choked shela stared at him you have this weird crap in your beard she said she reached into pull it out and as she did she brought her face in close enough for santa to smell her whe're as glinda smelled baby powder and cinnamon shela smelet of something he could not quite put his finger on sigarettes of course but something else too it set the chimney in his chest to blaze ashy black doves trying to flap out their flaming wings as shela rummage through his beard the look on her face was all little girl concentration you have nice bone structure she said you should try wearing black you didt have a s slimming effact with drawing a tiny shrivelled raisin from santa's beard shela crinkled up her face and flickeded on to the carpet you gross she said glinda walked back into the room with drinks and would santa reached for one he realized his hand was shaking he excused himself to use the bathroom where he thought he might hum a few carols to calm himself down everything inside the bathroom was glidtery ind white white glittery soaps shampoos curtains but there hanging from the white shower curtain rod was something black strung there for all the world to see where a pair of silky black stockings shelas blackstockings for years santa had dealt intimately with stokings stuffing them with col or presents and never thought about it twice but just then seeing those black stockings of hers being alone with them something came over him and suddenly he was on his toes s biting the tips a playful pup a fat old playful pup returningto the living room santa sat back down on the couch and listened in raptured as shela encouraged him to revise his policy on naughtiness santa nodded his head as though giving her suggestion some thought in bed that night santa replayed each of shela's words and gestures shela said whatever she felt tuching and smelling everything an animal she was not afraid to take aveil herself of the world drink sigarettes hospitality without much as asking she would even plunged her hand into santa shirley temple plucking the marisheno cherry right out and using his hat to wipe her hands for santa one in love with giving he could not help at see before him a kind of black hole a sexy and sublime black hole into which he could deliver forth his greatest gifts in shela he saw and insatiable hunger for life with such a woman to give to to give himself to he would feel as though every day was christmas when they had made plans for the following weekin glinda had asked if santa could bring along a friend for shela and he showed up with jingles anything to help a brother out jingles it said strolling into glinda's living room jingles did that thing where he jumped on to the couch while crossing his legs in mid air he landed right beside shela you are just too cute for words exclaimed shela try anyways said jingles snipping the tip of his cigar it was the length of his forearm i'd prefer to keep the house smoke free said glinda more fun free said shela say what do you call people who live around here anyway north pole ac we call ourselves cold poles said jingles ever put your tongu on a cold pol honey tends to get stuck there shela slapped him on the head dork she said laughing shela and jingles had a million things to talk about all the while glinda and santa just sort of sat there smiling awkwardly and watching the snowfall it is an uninhabitable waste land santa heard shela say tanpa sounds ossom said jingles if only i could convince ell hefe over there to move the operation sout jhingles looked over at santa and seeing his brows struggling with his dat decided to kick things into gear come on yal all said the alf addressing the groum gather round for a little spin o the bottle i've got just the ont said shela downing the last of the red wine straight from the bottle spin the what asked glinda shela rolled her eyes placed the bottle down on the carpet and spun santa watched the bottle spin with an anxiety that bordered on mania what if the bottle dictated that he was to kiss shela he would almost certainly die but he did not have to ponder such a kiss for very long for soon the bottle slowed to a halt pointing directly at jingles and when shela licked her lips and leaned her face downward jingles grabbed her head in his small hands and planted his tiny mouth on hers santa felt the chimney fire in his chest snuff out he and glinda watched them kiss then after a while they watched the snow fall then they went back to watching them kist eventually jingles led shela into the vestibule where he said he wanted to show her the secret to getting the tips of his shoes curly in in left alone and at somewhat at a ross linda got up and fished around in a cabinet drawer beside the couch santa thought she might be looking for a game of some sort but then she said i have something for you she held out a glistening package no wayhoseg santa said i'm the gift giver round here and it is not even christmas yet santa was about to really kick up a fuss but then as a downright which she look fell across glinda's face he trailed off it is nothing that big she insisted thrusting the present at his chest besides it was fun trying to find the perfect something for you and then to actually find it there is no greater feeling in the world but look who i'm telling this to hearing her words and seeing the look of excitement on her face santa had a puzzling thoht perhaps he would somehow miss judge things perhaps he would somehow gotten it wrong by refusing the gifts people wished to bestow on him he would consistently failed to give the experience of giving he would hoggd that particular pleasure all to himself and he took the package it was flat and square tearing the wrapping paper open he saw it was a record rockin christmas party songs volume on he absolutely hated it not just because the thought of listening to had made him feel one of those old white haired hippies who had to make everything from getting their prostate check to celebrating christmas not just a good time but a rockin good time but i was also one of those gifts that said something about the recipient something that was hard to swallow the gift of a backscratcher that says yeu're alone in this world and must fend for yourself or the gift of a warm house coat that says you are days of party dresses are over the gift of a perfectly awful christmas album being handed to you by a woman who liked you said loud and clear you must learn to compromise forafter all his years of giving santa knew better than any one though we do not always receive what we want nor even what we deserve we receive what life brings us and when it comes to life we have not a choice but to open our arms i love it said santa with a half smile on pealing the plastick they placed the album on the record player santa held out

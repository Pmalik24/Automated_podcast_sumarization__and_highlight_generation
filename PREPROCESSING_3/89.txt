of our snow white trailer i now on to the news of the day in nineteen ninety after sedom whosane invaded koate presideen george sh b bush was considering the american response he was torn on the one hand he saw the necessity of pussiing sedom out of the oil rich state maintaining the impression of american strength in the region on the other hand he did one to avoid conflict while three weeks after the invasion bush had still not made a decision that is when he famously accepted a phone call from british prime minister magaret thactur remember george she said this is no time to go wably but should not go wabbly the united states expelled sodom from quat that was the last outright military victory in american history well to day the united states faces down threats on all sides the wages of appeasement of america's most vicious enemies from cutting awful deals with the ron to appeasing russian a gressian in crimia from bowing before chinese expansionism to abandoning afkanistan to the talaban to setding over aid two homas in palcinian authority america's foreign polcy particularly under barokobama in jobidon has pread aggressiveness among our enemies that aggressiveness culminated last week in the worst single terror attack on the west since nine eleven in the form of a murderous rampage through southern israel that left one thousand three hundred people dead and two hundred kidnaped america's enemies ore betting on us going wably their betting on a morally blind media to press israel to stop profensive into the gaza strip in order to depose the evil terroris grup commas their betting on an activated left to intervene to press jobidon to pressure israel to stop and if that that pays off the west will be far less safe here is why let us ussume for a second that israel leaves commas in place in the gaza strip which would be the end result of a cease fire at this point camas would quickly consolidated support not only in goza but among palstingan arabs in the west bank creating another massive terror thread for israel from its east that territhreat is already materializing tpalcing in terroras have already attempted to infultrate multipul areas of the called west bank judaa and semaria on friday night mosk oround israel played a mwessin call expressing solidarity with comas and calling for palstinians to join the violands that will only grow worse if commas survives meanwhile casballa in the north which is anaranian proxy will now that israel is surrounded on all sides and may choose to launch a massive offensive against israel that would end with tens of thousands of juesdead and israel itself excistentially indangered again that possibility is quite reael israel is apparently holding off right now on its ground offensive in order to retain enough troops in the north to prevent a massive casbalamove if casbla jumps in israel wolrespond with everything in his arsonal as it would have to aron then presumably with russian and chinese backing could enter the conflict at that point newclear conflict would certainly not be off the table israel will not allow a second holoco s to take place without using everything in itarsonal in fact in aronian attack on israel could turn into a next stage sunecia war thanks to arons increased reginal power at some point in the chaine of events america wood inevitably be dragged directly into such a war meanwhile the world's oil supply it would be radically decreased crashing the global conomy that is what one pathlooksliht the other path looks america standing tall and here is america'srall it is a simplerael it does not require american use of force it does not require american soldiers first america must provide israel the material and moral support to destrikams israel will shed extraordinary levels of blood of its own citizens in order to protect coviliansan gaza and t killterras but israel will require rearmament and america should provided in israel wounded bycamas is an invitation to broader regional and possibly global conflict second america must use ore diplomatic mit to push to alleviate the situation on the arabside we oght to be pushing egypt to open its border to refuges to minimize cevillian casualties we should be pushing turkey to accept refugees after all they accept ted three point five million of them from syria americaaht to leverage cottar into turning overcomas's leadership to an international body or to america itself and pushcotzar to get comase release american and other hossages held by chamass third america must detur other actors from escalating this conflict presumably that is why jobidon himself is visiting israel and why america currently has aircraft carriers statione in the mediterranean an ounts of provention will be worth killatons of cure all of this is duable without expending significant amountes of american tressur or any american blood but that can only happen if the bidadministration does not gowobly if it does not start paroting the dangerous moral equivalents of the media or the absurd perversities of international sudo humanitarian organizations that make no demands of the terras grup comas which is colonelly holding two hundred hossages including babies but makes many demands on israel america can flect hermuscles without using american force in fact we should a world without america is the darican catic place a more dangerous place for america and americans all that can be avoided at virtuallyserael cost long as america does not t actually gowobly now the situation on the ground continues to be ugly according to the walster journal russia and china are softly intervening on the side of comas that is not a shock is are two the most nefarious actors in the world right now according to the walster journal the war between israel cmas is not just risking t h oregional conflagration is also affecting the gobal balance to power stretching american an european resources while re leving pressiae on russia and providing new opportunities to china according to former finish prime minister alezander stub what we are seeing is part of the shifting and moving world order when you ust leaves power vacumes someone is going to vilt those vacums russia is the clearest beneficiary of the spreading up people pointing at the mounting palestinian deaths moscow revels whan it calls the cuornquot hypocracy of the western governments which have roundly condemned russiand mascrs of civiliansinucrane but offer only mild criticism of his raily actions in gosan of course thact is not even remotely a comparable russia invaded u crane in order to destroy the country israel is invading g aza in order to stop coms which just killed thirteen hundred of at citizens in fact israel had given the gozestrip to the palsinians into thas five to comasto gover they been in charge eversons two thousand five but the russians in the chinese are tempting to create in anti american alions in the middle east if a merica were to go wobbly there things who get significantly worse for america's interest in the e delasan forget all of the talk the happy talk about tacnology making oil no longer a relevant factor in the world economy that obviously is untrue and is going to remain untrue meanwhile cmas continues to ratchit up the noise comass has a couple of golls here bull mumber one is to survive the bess way for them to survive is to release all the hostages to day if they release all the hostages they are currently holding there will be significant pressur on israel to stop its offensive and everyone will just pretend that thirteen hundred dead jews around the gossiboard do not exist tht is likely the the calculus that is being put in place by pretty much everybody is that if comass releases the hostages then they will call for everybody go back to stasqual anty that is not acceptable for israel if comass is leadership survives intact in the gosestrip if they are continuing to leave the gosestrip after killing thirteen hundred jews with virtually no consequences for them all the cosequence is being felt by the civilians they keep in in a cage effectively and on top of their own rockets the will be a big victory for coms everyone knows it israel'sgolls are toful get back toe hostages destroy comas comass is gulls are twofold humiliate israel retain power and there really one goll y that is that is realy what they are talking about right here to that end yesterday comss released it is first hostage vidio of one ofthe hostages it is holding is avidio of a twenty one your old woman a me a shemp she is a duel citizen tthe french is raily woman she is taken hostage obviously sheis being forced to say these things not yet everything that that she is saying here you have t understand she literally has a gun pointed at her head during this vidio here she was talking about a about her status as a hostage right now you can see in the vidio that they are bandanaging up harmsee look out lit what good care they are taken she saying id been prisoner in gossa they treated me and per formed a surge around me tht to three hours everything's fine i only ask the relturn me home as soon as possible return me to my family please get us out of here as soon as possible nagan that is propaganda by comass comas is currently asking for thousands of comas terrors to be released back into the gosstrip and for israel to pull every one out in return for the hostages they e just took now comascu just release them all the humanitarian stuff that is happening re now is on comass cmas coo just i love that the release hostage widios were ti look how nicely retreating the woman that we tok and likely raped but we will look out nice were being to her these people are absolute monsters of course comas is monstrous an any attempt to present them as some sort of human right to protector is absurd on its face how bad is comasright now all right now egypt is refusing to open the rofa crossing to palsinian refuges hn not allowing anybody out from goza right now comasses supreme leader actually praised egypt for clos sing the border noc ketting you they want is real tthat they want egypt to close the boarder they want the palistinians traped in gaza why because they ned them is human shields here is ismale hinia rect from cottar again pressers should be on cottar to turn honea andthe rst of the comas leadership over to an international court or to the americans here is a here is is my o conea one of the ring leaders of commass the technical leader of commassa broad whol he lis by the wayinto fivstar hotel while everybody and gazasuffers because this is what all terrors croups do their leaders get rich and everybody else suffers here he is talking about wonderful it is that egypt is closing the boarder a tha w the y the oldness is the people of gaza are rooted in their land and cling to their homeland whoen ave you openana hoduminthen they will not leave gaza they will not emigrate no matter what the murderers and criminals do are you are ou ookiwhwaga hey have only one path which is to re turn to our land to homes he land of our fathers and grandfathers by that he means tell of you and hifa by the way he does not mean gaza wthere is no emigration from gasand no emigration from less paying no emigration from gasa to egypt then they want to keep those people theres they can use them as human shields remember no one was calling for gozins to leave the gaszas strip until commass decided to murder thirteen hundred is raly citizens and cannap to hundred others leading to thes miltar conflagration until two weeks ago commasses in full control of the gasa trip and palstinians we are living there unhappily under their rule but again thydo not care about the palsinies theyve never cared about palsinc this is openly i meanthis the part thet amazing as they continueto shay the sort of stuff openly can just the second will talk about aron threatening to expand the conflict and and then the western response to all of this first on talk to you about daily wares most trusted privacy partner and from mer sponser

cam slashben protect yor omlin data to day o ka m meanwhile aron is threatening to rachet all of this up the reason the're doing that is becaus the're trying to redirect his rayly resources from the southern boarder to the northern boarder whote people hav ben wondering why it has not isral start of the ground in cursion already amean everyone knows it is coming and the're couple possible reasons one is that they are first at tampting to internationally broke or along with the americans some sort of post camas future in gaza that they are going to egypt jordan soudy cattar and theire trying to create in international coalition that will govern the gazistrip after hamas is removed from the map and they need time to actually make that happen beforethe goin that is one possbleries in the other possible reason is that hesbala is threatening israels northern boarder now again ferfolks who do not know much about this regian teft understand that israel again being a very very tiny country is bordered on all sides by countries that either have a cold piece with it or have threatened openly to annihilateed the gazistrip which is in the south western corner of the state of israel the gazistrip was occupied by hams tand control bahmas e genisitaleterras group the southern border of israel is a border with egypt that is a cold piece with the egypt ever since the pesiol between anoar asatat and manahabagan in nineteen eighty under nineteen seventyeight nineteen seventy nine under the ausices of gimicater the campdavigors the the what the eastern border of israel is a a sort of weird conglomeration of gordanian border which is a cold piece with the with the kingdom of jordan and the palsinian authority areas which are honey combed with terra supporders camas is long cehid in pausingan authority all three terrace groups palsing an authority literally pays the efamilies of of terrace the northern boarer for israel is in the golon heights bordering syria which is in eranian proxy and on its pure northern border a strait northern border that is a border with lebanon which is occupied and control by by cesbala husbala is a terris group that is significantly more powerful than hamas bit by leagues of league order orders of magnitude ththey have some two hundred thousand rockets pointed apparently at the state o israel theyhave they have entrenched themselves on the northern border of israel israel has had to fight wors theire befor in order to dislodge them from certain areas most famously in two thousand seven most recently that ended with israel sor creating a demilitrizeown butt there has been antitankfire that has been crossing that boarder tereve been peopl trying to inful traite terras trying to inflatrate from the hesbala areas into israel israel is deeply afraid that if cesbala gets into the war itwill be now stretched on two separate borders they may be holding off on a ground incursion into gaza until they feel that that northern boarder is solidified nerhan of course is trying to rath it up the game by saying that if israel goes into the gazistrip then they might aleish cesbala or they might instead poor resources into syrea which would then be used in a proxy war witht israel according to the times of israel aron on mondays thad time was running out to reach a political solution to the israel gozic conflict warning of the possibility of expanding the scope of war and the conflict to other fronts apparently aranian president ebrahimranecei quot warned against the continuation of crimes by the zionist at regime and he warned of a possibility of expanding the scope of war and conflict to other fronts he further the uranian forn minister further suggested te possibility of a preemptive action against israel in the coming hours as israel were pre as israel prepared the possibility of in in invasion into the gossis trip in order to clean out the terrorists aron is obviously attempting to ratchit up the threat for it is part america is attempting to do some of the things that i talked about at th openin the sho america has move daircrafts carries into th region that would be to push csbalaw off the ball to say to them if you try to fire rockis into israel then we will strike you with our drats and hn you will be no more because the commine power of america amet americas n neet israels telp obviously but the commined power of america in israel or israel in a lead position with american a suport position cusbelodoes not exist any more do not get involved ran is what trobidan keeps ant ienkepsting do not get involved a also the united states has been rearming israel to this point as israel nees to be rearm but there is the third point which is will america let israel do what it needs to do in the gossips trip and here is where things are starting to get quite dicy for the bine administration do they have the intestinal fortitude to allow israel to do what it needs to do in the gossiss trip whele maintaining the isolation of that conflict which is in everybody's interest by the wayits in th interest of ron is well every one's interest are a linder nobody wants this conflict spreading north to cusbala in to aron the ron may pretend that it wance that conflict spreading north but if that happens the mos probably are not in power at the end of this chain of dominos mosepolydad sey prowle do not want that but they have to threaten beause they do not threaten than they are watching one of teir powns comoss being taken off the board by thes srailies which is the next thing that is

dot tom promocod shipero oka jo bidon is set to vis it israel on wednesday todays tuesday obviouslyes whe will be visiting israel tomorrow this means that the ground invation is not can i happen until after bidin leaves this pretty obvious to everybodies this is partially a delay tactic by the united states to buy time for future negotiations on hostages perhaps to buy time for some negotiation over who is going to take commssiss place or perhaps it is just to the lay tactic by the united states s that israel will not actually go in at alv maybe the goll here is to is to prevent israel from taking out comoss totally now that is the great fear the great eare is that this thing ends with some of the hossageis released many of the hossages that remember many of them ars really military commases nock an release thosepeople tonginto kill them maybe the idea here is that everyone wants things to go back to statusqoanti if things go back to statusqo anty israel's an acistential danger why again commass will remain on the southern boarder and they will continue to be in intrenched powerful terror group that murder's jews wherever it can find them casbella wilbe embolden aron willbe em bolden syry'll be embolden not only that egypt jordon are going to be alienated from the tate of israel es gan power is the only coin of the realm an middileast whoever is most powerful winds that is the way that it works over there its not about moral suasion in a aria filled with dictators the the other countries thathave joined the abraham a cuords for example to try and creed an antieronian bulwark those countries are goingto be skittish after commasis able to killd thirteen hundred jews and get away with it sady arabia is likely not to get into a piecstil israel needs to re establish its military capability and it isability to push off its enemies if it hopes to sign any sort of long lasting piece agreements for example with the sune states againstoron the the situation could go really bad here if comass is not removed and every one basically knows that except maybe the americans except maybe jobid mics gain jobidon has a very bad habit of going wobbly this the same ad ministration that was signing checks to the aronians about five seconds tago bidon is supposed to visit israel that is a good sign of solidarity from from jobidon but the question is goin to be what exactly the effect of that is now again none of that seems to be putting off comass anthony blincon the united state secretary state was in tell of eve the arad siverants went off while blincoln was in tell oveve for meetings thereare literally firing missiles at blincoln men this is one of the things that comas was doing meanwhile the united states apparently trying to ouknow are they tryingto push israel to ti did not go in intowhat they need to do in in the gosistrip that would be ridiculous here is some vidio from tell of eve his from yesterday weare the sirens going off this is the exact area were blincon is meanwhile jobidon is am and blincoln are making some prdy wobbly noises the mean some pretty waobbly noises jobidon his his lin goes far has been good obviously is can den commassis barbarians because they are barbarians there there as better worse than the nosies they wish not only destroy every ju but to do publicly and i and to humiliate the jews in he process at least the natses again phrases i've never said before at least the noses attempted to hide their crimes it the end of world wore too comemoss brags about them on gobro meanwhile jobidon he yesterday he suggested it to mistake to occupy gosa now listen if you think israel wants along from occupation gosa youre wron i meant lick i remy know why any one would think is risrael literally turned over the place to ee a terroris group rather than quottn quat occupying it they do not want it but what d exactly you expect i mean surs what you expect what o you think the alcomis is is the idea that israel is supposed to according to jobidon is well see jobidon and anti blincon israel is supposed to not hit presumably enough military targets because here to any silins in the way in densely packed areas the cannot to it from the air the're not pose to occupy gaza they cannot to it from the ground and thy are supposed toas wil se from anton blinkin letting cuorn quo humanitary nate even if it goes to commasa what exactly is the plan for israel to destroy commos then now lis 't i hope i'm reading that wrong i hope that when jobidon says this all he really means that he does not want israel to and acts the gazastrip again if you think israel is desperate to annex two million palistonians living in the gozastrip i do not know what you are you are hiin your own supply no one in tese rally governments talking about that but in any case here is jobidon talking about occupying goza wuld you supporteus reely occupation of goza at this point i think you bi big mistake do you believe that hommas must be o wiminater te entirely yes i do but there meads to be apaliston authority there need to be an pass to paliston thestate well if he is got any ideas having every one's open to them than get i'm i'm sick of hearing about their neds to be a palistonian state when literally the only leaders in the palistonian community oure dedicate is the extermination o israel could ave happend after ho thosand fiv ul men super easy after two thousan't five len israel walked out the arbstates coul apport billions of dollars in to gaza to builds it up into a glowing hong hong of the middiles o tey do that knowan said they aloud comastic continue making it into a othole that is that iswhat they did by the way lots hundreds millions buillins dollars poured into goza it all went for building extraordinary terror tunnels underneath the soil for poisoning the oquelfer apparently and for building rockets it is its i in a never ending source of astonishment to me when people jobidon or any one else in the commentariat or political fierce ays there neds to be a two state solution yeh well it would be nicet if unicorns if unicorns provided new clear energy as well but at it certain point you are gingto have to recognize that the palistnian caus has not been and is nos about setting up a working functional palistonian state it is about destroying the state of israel that is what it is it is a weapon aimed at the hart of israel it has been since nineteen forty eight every one knows this the palistinians know this comas knows this the pianos this is loma gehod knows this tht's why thy've walked away from every single piece negotiation ever held it is why they have turned down every single deal ever offered them because again the palstine liberation organizatiowhih became the p was found et in nineteen sixty four when israel was not in control of either the gazastrip or the les bank they worn even in control of the old city of jerusalem and yet that is when the piallo was form the palstine liberation organization the free palestine crowd when they were saying that in nineteen sixty four they did not mean free romola they dn't the they they thidn't mean we need you a free goza city and they do not mean that right now they mean from the river to the sea palestine shall have no juws that is what they actually mean they talk two state solutiously i knw your talking about yah that' be great that sure it uagain if you think israel is desperate to govern ginean you are ot your mind is ra literally tryed to hand over thse aras to jordana don was a no way se managain this is itis is ridiculous nonsense that is that passes for foreign policy wisdom in a secon will get to antony blinkin's absurd statements yesterday the secretary estate againd listen i would love for the bydministration provides os the s it is not hard contain the conflict let isrel finish that enemies that is it that is leep that is lake that is that is all and it is not harden and does not require american blood or tressure in any serious mount certainly no american blood and does not require american tressure in any serious amounts it does it contain the conflict and allows hisrael to

say on wednesday president bidem was it israel he is coming here at a critical moment for hisrael for the region and for the world and h's comeng here to do the follow first the president will reaffirm the united states solidarity with israel and our iron clad commitment to its security president bine will again make clear as he is done unequivocally since te moss is slaughter of more than fourteen hundred people including at least thirty americans that israel has the right an indeed the duty to defendis people from he moss and other terras and ter then future attacks president wll hear from israel what it needs to thefendice people as we continue to work with congress to meet those needs second president bid will underscore our crystal clear message to any actor state or non state trying to take advantage of this crisis to attack isrel do not to that end he is deployed two or craft carrier groups and other military assets to the region third the president will continue to cordinate closely withour his rearly partners to thescure the release the postage is taken by a moss including men women small children holli coss survive rs an american citizens asent indispensable humanitarian effort forth present bide will receive a comprehensive breef on is raels warames and stratigy fifth the president will here from israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimiz civilian caslies and enables humanitoring assistance to plota civilians and gaa in a way that does not benefit hamas to that end to day and at our request united states an israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitory an aide from doner nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians and gaza and them alone including the possivility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way it is critical that aid begin flowing into gazas soon as possible we sure is a alster's line ossavi sees we are destroy ad entering gaza or otherwise preventing it from reaching the people who need it if ambas in anyway blocks humanitoriang assistance from reaching civilians including by seizing the aid itself we will be the first to condemnment and we will work to prevent it from happening again wel am gon that last part is the part of its can having stop it there everything he says up to that point if oki that maksense that is a declaat i'm talking bat right contain the conflict say do not to the foreign actors who want to get in make sure that israel has the werewithal to take out comas all of that then he gets to the very end and he says we need humanitaran ade to going to gaza tak everybody would love for the civilians of gaza to have humanitarian aid this is why israll turn back on the water and power in southern goza the entire idea is turn it off up north to push everybody down south all the civilians bhecaus the only people in the north who still have water an power the people living under ground the terrace that is the entire idea here but then when he says well if if that humanitarian aid is then used for terrorism we will condemn it o thanks o thanks or maybe you should not put aid into an area where terroras are likely to seize it may mayb thou t mayb you should pressure egypt into letting civilians out of the gosestrip into egypt m maybe that would be good maybe egypt should being control the goster but eagypt does not want it agan yeat you'r providing problems with toe solutions when you say things we will be the first to condemn it of comma seizes humandd by the way commass did not seese humanitarianade literally yesterday you and our w way th you an refugees administration which is a in agency that specivilly dedicated only to the palsinians demazin it is a garbage administration run internationally that allows for full in doctrination in ju hatrade at you and our way schools and the hiding of weaponry beneath you and our w way resources thay admitted yesterday ans witere briefly that commoss was literally stealing aid and then they to leaded it becaus they were afraid the ommas my commad at them is it likely that hat's going it is not only likely it is it is certain that commas is going to steal that aid and then use it in its war against the jews that obviously's going to happen how obly is te united states get were not sure yet but the pressure is certainly being brought bhers the media have done the moral equivalencs game that continued to do the moral equivalence game this it this notion that its incumbent on israel not to achieve its military objectives in order to prevent civilian casualties caused by comases absurd on its face no one talked this after nine eleven no one talked this tering world wore to no one has talked lie this during any war that i am aware of borakobama was nailing people with drones and killing civilians by the score and no one seem to bat and i about any of that and that was not a matter of excestential american security isral right now is attempting to kill the people who killed thirteen hundred juws and would kill all of them and are curnently holding two hundred hossages and we are etting talk from metabout alway you would be careful bout the civilian casualties you really do yo remember any of that conversation the afhemathenin elevon any the answeris no it did not exist yoremember any of that conversation about isis somewore between one thousand and ten thousand civilians were killed in the american waran isis thid any one care they one talk about that the answer is no one talked about that why because the military objectives were clear instead youof jake taperon sianan who yesterday was it was questioning a formers raily official and he said howg how daire you take take nilitary measures that are hurting civilians and the answer is it would not be hurding civilians if camas we are not using the civilians is human shield they want them there they say publicly certainly taking ahamasas ladership i understand the the point of that tat the is an the aphalsin in healthman is bein gasa says twenty eight hundred pasinians have been killed a and a some ere between a quarter and a third of them are ar children a that is not hamasas leadership cani ps o for a wood of cussion no i know that there is real suffering in gasat this a wo going on and and in innocent people that getting quart up in a gery difficult situation i do not inemas that thut you have to get take with the grain of sault any information that cans aut of the hamas controlled inistr of health in gasa that has to be said that gamasis not a democracy this not an independent health you rokacy that is trying to do its bes every duct tu speak to every hospital direct you speak to woks and that the gun of hamas that of course is exactly right that is exactly rightnet's exactly true in fact the journalists in the gas'strip have admitted as much they have admited they cannot report except what comas wants them to report the goodnews for comas is that they are bunch ofe sympathizers in the mediat forkams in fact to b b c had to fire seven seven reportes yesterday seven for expressing open solidary with comas seven its if you were id that the journalistic enterprise is a is corrupt that is because it is by the way jordan is also saying no refugees they are also saying no refugees in fact king up dula he he says it is a red line is is no refuge hes in jordan no refugees in egypt which i gon ot i was just remind you that eight hundred thousand jews were expelled from arab countrie seven hundred eighthundred thousandes were expelled from ab countries and forty eight isral tok all of them all of them not a single palistonian refuge has been accepted by any surrounding arab country in eighty years they just kept them in refugee camps it is unbelievable e the mine dministration is etting pressure from the media because of the idiotic moral equivalente that suggests of course that that trying to kill terrace when terras oure hiding behind civilians o somehow the responsibility of of the people ofre trying to kill the terrace therallsa etting pressure from te intellectual class in he intellectual class is just

in america and abroad continues to be utter scum i mean t some of the worst people on earth thenew york review of books put out an open letter from sudo intellectuals tonaheasy cots literally tonahossycotes is the number one signatory to this disgusting letter ton hossycots of corso person who els should hav known was moral creten when he wrote an entire book talking batho evil america was how evil mericlas in hawkey watch nine eleven happen from the top of the bilding while smoking pott an felt m thing we shouldhave known that from tinahosicots but we are suppose to take in very seriously as a seudo ntellectual because he called for slavery reporations because he a very wealthy black man has been victimized by the united states of america cofs a fool then and he is a fool now are all the people who signed this disgusting letter an again it is some of the most eminent intellectuals in america who signed this ridiculous piece of garbage here is what the ltters has quote we are writers an artist who have been too palestines participate in the palestine at festival of literature it is the first whall wy dn't we start rightere where was the palestine festival of literature is in hypha is in hypha hypha is in israel they are immediately soing from the river to see palestine will be free they'r immediately calling for escentually the destruction of the stateof israel because he cannot call it we have been to pout if you went to if you went to hypha youdn't go to palestine went t israel we now call for the international communities to commit to ending that catastrophy un folding in gaza and wo finally pursuing at comprehensive an just political solution an palston youright no efforts have ever been expended at some sort of pece planin in israel and and between the paut and no one has ever tried anything that wow genius idea you you you absolute geniusis you we have exercised our privilege as international visitors to move around his tor palestine in ways the most palestonians ar unable to why why are notho warntho able to why why who runs those places hum interesting why why say you we have met with and been hosted by palestonian artist humanrites workers writers historians en actives we have tood on stage with them many of those people including the festal organizers bast in palestine are in fear for teir lives right now one festal organizers lockdown with their chald and ramala sharing updates about the people killed by arm settlers last night one partner in gaza magian editor is no longer answering messages it is the first all i should point out at this point i know people who are located in israelly areas around gaza and israellies who are located in in areas around romala mesan calls i mentioned at the top the shot wezan calls it is what happens on friday nights you have heard the tapes of it as these lomit called the prayer the calls to prayer being sent from the top ofmas from the laudspeakers calling for solidary komas and violent uprising gainst yus jos in a lot of these areas are living in fear that people ne oing to come down from romala and kill them in their families in any case these these moral and these moral moreons they quote israel has 't posed what alls he complete siege and told one pone one million people in gosito evacuate within twenty four hours to wear oh i do not know maybes to the places where they dray map to maybe that by the way when when they stay to war i just comastos on't want them to evacuate at all comaa teling hm not to move comases killing people who are attempting to leave after six days o bomming that ife already killed two thalsan to un or fifteen people seventimres twenty four of them children in the fourth major aereel bombarment in the sixteenth year of closure the question to wear rings unanswerable around the world whell i mean it it does not considering that refugees have been leaving north africa for italy by the boat load for years on and also again why i what is a mazing about this at this idiotic letter is they never bothered to acts the question why becausei they did they might actually have to come confront the truth which is the comases and evil terrorist group why is israe bom arding the gosistrip li the answer is because of terroris attacks becaue of rocket attacks from civilian areas by theway we are now fully two paragraphs into this pathetic exercise in moral idiocy and they have still not mention the jews were murdered well when israel's top general were ferst to palistinians as human animals that is not what he said youre fr to hamas as human animals and what people who rape women and then kidnap them or mure of them with their babies those are human animals sarry you do not that tough when the us state department t lead to statemen calling for a cease fire well yabbigs the cult for sease fire before israelyed even done anything we fear we are watchn ethnac cleansing on a scale unseen in decades as a hell v anthnac clensing again i will point out that at the time of the nineteen forty eight war they ware apparently one point some wore between one point three at one point five million palistinian arabs livin in the area to day they are two million palistinian arabs living in the goscistrip there are another two to three million palistinian arabs living in juda and somaria and their one point six million palestinian arab suar is raily living inside israel that is a hell ofanathnat clensing anyway these dolts continued the governments of teuusa u cave france and others are participating in this crime by ramping up military support for israel as it wages a war that it is officials have plainly stated ames to turn gaza intwo city of tene or even worse empty of its people a population of over two million mostly from families tha were made refuges in nineteen forty eight half of mour children ave been living under in is railian egyptian blockade since two thousand seven and's many of them being told to leave again is not an option on saturday thisit is th bestpart on saturday after sixteen years of siege hams militons broke out of goza wel that is at that is a hell of a characterization they broke out after sixteen years islike prison break you see they it was not comas runs the damned place they broke out you see they broke out and more than thirteen hundred as railies were subsequently killed wal look at loa the passive voice right there not tha commosterroris went and murdered and beheaded and burn no what and raped not and kidnap none of that all that happened something happened to some people as thohano mar might say commas militons broke out of gaza and more than thirteen hundred as railies were subsequently killed well what vilit cars did they die of influenza was it covin in how did that happen shut i' see thisare the worst people in america disgusting human beings more than thirteen hundred as raelies weretese are coma sympathizers period more than thirteen hundred as raelies were subsequently killed with over one hundred more taken hostag some of them friends an family or signatories to this letter we deplore the loss of all innocent life and now as who write this letter israel is executing the largest expulsion of palistinian since nineteen forty eight as a boms gozons without di scrimination that is a lie it is an up it is an abject lie the reason hammas hides it is weapons be hind civilions is to jus suade israel from hitting them that in an of itself admits the lie they israels if israel one to killso thilings inorda could do not tell any one to move not try to kit military targets is not doing any of those things only comass is doing those things our words feel small in this terrifying excollation after many years in many dust we must all together save this has to end and it can only on with a free palset and remember thes thing started by doe clenn hypo part of palistone that is from your great intellectuals that is tonahossy cots we should be summarily thrown out of any insellect sual en tr prize ever he is a joke but do not wory he is not the only joke weave professors at america stop universityes doing the same thing cerefor example is ta cornel university professoran and brussel rickford cheering the terrars attacks the other day thesexhilara hi's exhilarating hofs energizer ye si by the murde of juse af a warrans exhilarating by this challenge the monopoly of violance by this shifting of the balance of power then they would not be human i was exhilarated he says the is a professor is a professor at im cornel university our intellectual class meanwhile a columbia university professor has a has call cobossis terroratacks agains hisrael ossum his im is joseph mosties professor posics in history columbia has no comment of course because why would they why would they coronel wuss says they cannot have hm remove now i would ned to see more of what he sed bet everyone is in tidled to their opinion well i mean a i feel if yu express support for a commosterror attack at tat point you can lose your dop a caught combia cancil calter maniac but it seems to me tha if you supportin open terrors screw murdering civilians koling babies and burning hem then at that point i feel it yuon't need a job i feelic tocaf yoon't have job i'm imocat with that i can i can leive with

applies to many of the tudents a huge number of students at our top level universities are moral fools and they have been moral fools for quite a while vido has ammurr s from around the country not only of these giant rallies in favor of comas byt of and why you sudent for example literally tearing down posters of the people kinnot by comas this is em two such people at tishhal and and why you and there is a a line of posters of the these are the faces of the kinnaped and this is three young people wore going around pulling us off and throwing them inthe garbage can lest lest god forbid people actually see the faces of the people who are being held in bondage by commas terris do not worry these are probably wonderful people they are probably theire prubalican be good for america they are prbably a net ad for the uniteds we need them here we need them here just we need obviously huge protests in deerborn on to have comss here is somvidio from zeerborn is yesterday ah thisis a lot of people who are again they have giant tines its a d colonization and resistance the first line in this lines as resistance ak a resistance is solidarity with comass that is what they are talking boutry now that is why they are doing this and thy'renot calling for comass to be toposed and for a peaceful palistinian state to be created they are not calling facts that is not what they want what they want is israel destroyed clearly obviously nochustin yurborn also in dallis there isom here isom thidio of a giant procomas rally and delsingan this is a procomss rally it is it ise not a propalistinian rally it is not a rally calling for the not one person at these ralliess called for the release of hostages not one zero not one of them will condem what comas actually did not one zero not one of them will suggest that palisinian leadership nees to be replaced in the gassistrip as to forward and foment piece not one zero it is very obvious exactly what is happening at these rallies and question is i if you are a sympathize or with an actual terro group see its it is politically correct for these its easier on the left to say i support comass than is to say a man as a man an woman's woman on the left these days it is easier because you get to pretend thatyou are on the side of the dispolesse con dispossessed colonized people get's pretend the jews are white and the aerbs are brown and therefore the jews are the oppressers and the brown people are the oppressed for get about the fact that racially speaking the sis abject and silly nonsense that a huge number of his railies are not in fact from european countries that a huge huge number of his railies are from places morocco and arock and egypt i mean my wifes entire family is supardy but t does not none of that matters to these people it all has to fit inside this peculiar left intersectional framework that is perfectly fine with antisemitism becaus it absolutely crosses streams wit a brougd er left when concept that if you are successful if you' velp ut successful state the malesat must because you are some sort of colonial oppressor meanwhile you do not let tht again the sort of stuff is throughout the united states thee zay thes evidio from two thousand twenty twoths theur kids for singing allegiance to cossemsily money you'e member soly moni hofs the leader of the arranian terror regime ias one of the leaders of the iargi see the runnian revolutionary gardcor and responsiblefor the eath of thousands of americans these are on tese are school kids for singing allegiance to cossemat sollymony in two thousand twenty two sthear tiny little kids than huntersin there is alls the'reall wearing they are wearing head bands the plenchallegian sor on here anso the says as wor the vidiois and tum this is in useton by the way is in uston is is not in not it is not in ron this none and cutar is in custon si've question is this seem a good practice to i'll tell you a it probably is not particularly good practis again this not the fault tof tese kids hes heres there their small children it is the fault of their parents and the organizations that ismont or them that is terrible it is awful and an their parents do not belong in the united states if you if you support cusemsilly mon you do not belong in the united states you suppork commass u's not belong in the united states be ad draw the line somewhere i eems to me supporting open terro groups is a pretty good place to draw the line i'l feel that is two restrictive is it you can still be in favor ob a palistonian state you can still be in favor of two state solution but it seems to me that if you support the full scale murder of jews full stop quajus thatfe you support come oss if yo support hesbala if yu support these groups i feel you can find some place als to live and'll tel ou wat happens when countries do not find other places for terrsonvisers to live the terrsamvisers go and do terrorist kinds of things for example yesterday two people were shott ead in brussels ther shot tad in brussels in a in in by by a person who declares his legiance to isis a man claims an imvidy on cial mediat who was the assailant in monday's attack an that ho is from isis theyare that this this person is claiming that he shot two rantom people in brussels in retaliation for a six yeurol musleboy who is killed an illinois over the weekan now the difference between this guy and the guy in illinois is that every one condemns the guynellinois we all want e that that piece of get the death penalty the guy who kill the palisinian kid an illinois every one wants that meanwhile ther're millions of people all over the worlds we will cheer this this particular human who just murder two people for no reason in brussels he claimed his inspired by the islomic states brussels has now raised the terror lert to its toperating a fur meating the threat is extremely serious this is again if you import tens of thousands of people who will groewth commass you should not be particulary surprised when they a grewh commason thn do things that commoss might meanwhile thegood news is that when we have of the commass cacas in our congress as well the squad has now put out a letter the letter is signs it is at it is a house resolution they are attempting to to push it is been pushed by as you would guass prshuted to leave ondry carson et cetera quorry bush calling for an immediate desculation and sease fire in israil and occupie palistine where is all human life is precious they say and the targeting of civilians no matter heir faithr at nthecity is a violation of international humanitarian law where is between october seventh an october sixteenth armed violence has claim the lisvore twenty seven hundred palistinians nover fourteen hundred is railies got alove that there it is see you se them moral quill an trict there the just lump everybodygether tall just a cycle of islands gang come oss running into peaceful is really villages and murderying everyone insight is exactly the same as israel trying to kill members of commass and come oss hiding behind this villions exactly the same the of the the only way you can ever get to the point that israel is possibly the baggite in this conflict is if you just pretend if just pretend a way the entiriconflict if you pretend the history does not exist that the situation on the ground dos not exist if you pretend that come oss is a quivalent to the idea it is an absurdity obviously is the by diministration in a cave to these type of fools if they do they are going to make a merica much weaker the gnto put america and the west en a much more dangerous place because but terris love more than anything they will ove hope andtheyof the weakness of their opposition it is the thing that drives them weakness of the west is the driving motivating factor for terrors groups sure they love to kill anybody but when they when tey are scared they kill fyor people and the reality is what exactly theyhave to be scared of in the west when the west is deeply worried about cleanliness of arms that it will not allow commoss to be taken off the board if that in fact is what happens here un ge meanwhile closer to home jim jordan has been inching closer to the speakership they are supposed to be a vote to day toe determine whether he is in fact going to come speaker of the house here is here is jim jordan saying we are going to elect to speaker heis a saying that theyare going to do that to day dou tha before you want at turnen seventeen first well i i do think thats that is i deal bu wel mi collegs ent they rol a bout o the if there is any way the ever get that in the room i'l a lov that but i think they will o iy to do this is the way the fouters inthended is you you have to bote to morrow oh we have set it for twelve ofclock and i they ook it about we we have wore tho one bow if you do not get the two seventee w that thats what i tins tat cas he he is suggesting that that he is can get two seventeen right now it appears as though jordan is in fact inchin closer to seventeen som of the hold outs are i'm are still that that they are moving over in to his camp i think everybody in the republican caucas is tired of this nonsense aa huge majority the republican caucas does not even understand my mc carthy was outsted in the first place tad ther perfectly fine with jordan being the guy theyr munch people in swing districts or little nervous about jordan eing the guy because jordan is a hard charging dude and what they are worried about is the jordan because of his own political priors is going to not be a conciliator in the republican cacas he is not kon t be willing to cut the sorts of deals that they would have caught in the pass even with each other and that nothing will get don or that they are goin o be saddled with whatev whatever jim jordan sas vautson ald trump bec as don al trump right now is the likeliest nominy the the the sort of is our situation in which the republican cauas find selvfes if they do not go with jordan who do they go with democrats of course are very excited about jim jordan the reason the democrats are excited is because they are going to try to attack all o the moderate republican legislators and and left wing re publican legislators by by saddling them wtwith jordan's record megr rodgers who is of the house armed services at committe he a he now has not dorsed jordan and wagner of missoury who is a s coleese backer said that she would vot for jordan there is some other novotes out there thotutd include for example mik waller of new york carlesomennas of florida modo teas balout of florida's on bacon of nebraska can buck of colorado there is still saying that they oppose jordan jope sorce are indicating there is a high possibility tho jornactually has his high water mark on the first voteso if he does not get in on the first vote han he searts to lose support a getn guys pickaspeaker does not honest to got it does not actually matter all that much the reason i does not matteral that much is beaue the incentive structure is what matters in congress i know that everybody's tens to believe about american politics that if he just put the right tie in the right place at the right time it makes a world of different is not about the right guy much as it is the incensive structure tha makes the wrong guy do the right thing right now therepublicans have n incredibly narrow majority if they have to go to left ing legislators in ther publican caucas to get to that majority that is wat there cn have to do and if they go right lingers to get that majority that is wha they cgan to have to do ththis idea that that what is going to emerge from a jordan led cawcus is going to be significantly better than what emerge from maccarthlood caucas i gain if that is the case i love to see that materialize i jus do not know what exactly that looks unga meanwhile must comment on the fact that he judg his now inposed a pathetic gag order on donal trump thi's ridiculous now i thing the doel trumpet spent he last week can a mouthing off to to ineffectively particularly the mddle of the world' crisis where his opinion really does matter don from is most pro isral pressent american history bar non his voice of this time could be really powerful instead he as basically been distracted with other issues again this myh prob with his candidas the i think he will be distracted with other issues alltheway up through the election dos meen he cannot win does mean makes im more difficult for him to win meanwhile ron to santis has been using the power of his governorship in florida safshuld get things done he is beenallowing flights to ship out to israel with material aid he is also been allowing floridians to get home yafshe charter to flight from israel to get floridians home here he was greeting them on the tarmac the otherday a a ra er e a aa a lot of he o ara aha gesup goodford desans is meanwhile trump is obvious the occupied with other things this part of the problem zo trump is obviously farnaway the whole leader at thes point during the third period trumps campaign raise some twenty five million dollars he has a lot of cash available on hand obviously right now because he spent vercilly no cash he just got hit wit tha gag order in deceas the democrats obviously doing their best to elevate trump in the primaries by hitting him with the kitchen sank yesterday a federal judg bard trump from attackin witnessis proscutors and quartstaff involved in his washington d see criminal case th imposed a gag or to be judge tonya chutkin who has taken every possible anti trum position just first men on protections yield to the administration of justice in the protection of witnesses his presidential kandity does not give him cart blanche to villify public servants are simply doing their job an she is threatening to a to arrest him and put him in jail if he were to use his social medium megaphone to attacksate the prosecutor in this case jack smith or you are to go after the judge in this case chutkin acknowledge trumps right to wein on public policy issues but said the trump could not launch a pretrial smear campaign against those who might testify against him which again this is this is real violation a first menman kinderstuff youre trump yesterday commenting on it but dash kiva gego youno to ge goodis to gdon' speak badly about her oponent but this is weapon reoll being done becaus jo by is losing the election in losing very very badly to all of us in the pos he is losing badly but what they do not understand is that i am willing to go to jail if that is what it takes for a country to win and become i democrasy again and he is is willing tood gel we may find out if if chutkin decides to take this all the way eshe is declining to restrict trump's claim that the prosecution 's part of a political vandetis shu says he instil rip on jack smith as part of a political vendeta butt he is not allowed to attack the court staff or any of the rest of this sort of stuff i'm meanwhile apparently the meeting a the he sort of hearing was bazar one of the attorneys for trump is getting john laure lauro found himself alternating between forceful defences of the former presenst first men at rights and acknowledgements that he would tell trump not to do some of this sort of stuff laure peatedly described the prosecutions against trump ats a sign of a nation vearing into talitarianism in tyraney laura said george warr would have a field do wit what wre hearing from these prosecutors and of the judge mttered george worl ill definitely have a field day som na again this is all going to benefit trump in the end because any time trump a pures to be restricted republican's rally to his cause all of it is a a very large skalle distraction in a very serious world and a second will be joined by an idaf reservist ho actually took on comos terrace in the middle of the october seventh terrace attack with just a pistol te our conversation y afet to be a member become member used cooc ho piro check after to mon's franal anuel plans qlick that lincon the description and join us

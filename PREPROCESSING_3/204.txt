say cannot say cannot say we specifically asked about than are this is such a funny part of this conversation a well what do you thinks best i'll discouse whatever you prefer i nether reagin just cause it sounds the funniest to me oqe we can do that i it the lnethers the nethers forelong chasecut physical teripy with ta planed what kind of electric wheel chair they again ause he was a chance his arms and legs would never recover but of course he knew hexactly where he was headed a gol pure that even a small child could understandin a gol said specificaly because his friends believed he never could reach it dand would let me kack him in e nethers ii kept that lin back in my head the entire time the entire time iws getting better i was dance can have it dance can i have it the ar goal i had to go i had a loticals and ot a more serious not that was having a having multicl goals was important to the recovery in fact he had threegoals king dan in the nethers was the m most ambitious and py in the sky but the other two were o kick welk either and also pretty idiosing cratic tike this next goall to flit people off i to give the iddle finger and i won i son hard on my hands how old r you he too too pretty fi i i my at i could not love my fingers at all untill about two and a half weeks and i had to break down with therapist there o was crying it was one of my first big mental break downs and he thoght he never use his fingers againu seeljus li let seerit and ton him to try to move his thumb he could not do it but he could move his index finger bwut just a quiver a millameter just then he set the goal whuc you actually cheef a mon than half later ith incredible effort he is findally he would get his mintal finger phully straye and i free dout i was look i did it all the tharapist look at me and i just start slipping all of them off in the lik yea yea or was that is go which his actually los in california wut he gone to philadelphia for the neator's party and injured himself in philadelphia and was not recovering in philadelphia for him as an out oe town or one of the things of philadelphia means is those steps fisterst alone runs up in the movy rocky her ron to philadelphia musem fart chase one to to climb them all seventy two steps i told my therapist about it and even though i beginning she thought it wasgoing to be impossible ir we just cappractising steps as much as we could that is that is a thing about the tharapias they take your goals and they work out it no matter how ridiculous they are whether it is kicking some one in anothers or climbing up some steps im they really tr to gur it towards towards what you want to giveyour sense of whit the therapist thoght it would be impossible or ridiculous when chase came up with his goal he could not stand he could not walk waited they would suspend him above a tread mill with ropes and two therapists would mave his legs to get the muscles to remember wat walking is then he woasd going to walk with a cane and then without a cane but before he did any of that bact when he was just just learning to get around a wheel chair they started him going upstairs to make this goal and two and a half months after he enterd the hospital he went to the steps were rocky train rodin a weel chair up to the first step stood and start ta climbing slowly watching heach foot as he planted it one then the other a physical therapists steadying him from behind and balance is difficult after li look down the whole time on looking down at my legs and i can hear much people clapping but i'm focus i go up the first little flag up the second little flag i look up hundreds of people i at if he pos anything on on saying he was going to climb the rocky steps and life stream it and he did not expect that lots of peoplewould av tou show up in person to see him clime to te top a triumph but there was one goal left the final gall i was difficult goal there were bunder reasons itwild get to one a minute tigging down in the nothers tac toranall abuse was wone of chases physical tharapus says most of her patients hat spimacald injuries and theyad all kinds of golls fr when chase first told hr about this one ts ic wait heu wont a work en your kicking why that was definitely afirst for me i'm not try ever had anybody request thaps and as a as a physical tharapist just with tocters or anybody else you are general mato is to no harm i wuld i and curre to me that that you helping him kick dan in the nethers could actually be a violation of your hypocratic oath i do ye well i y kno just made me hesitakes we talk about athics a lot and yet we never wont a harm anybody else sinc i was was a little hee a little hesitate at first but the more we talked about i and i cannot understood that i was not he was just going to try to go out harmsome spi e without the out her cofet et not ye and i said o ay will let us let us break it down we we practise kicking we warmed up with some kicking a socker bl cause it was soft it was easy kicking a socker ball a lot of kicking is not just the leg your kicking with its being able to have your balance standing on one leke which for chase was a challange it was lek it is a lot more difficult for me to stand on my right leg even to day and then it was a little bet higher kicks till us standing up kind of bolster a and we practised each leg and finkered out which leg would you do not pretuce the most forest which when he had the best balance on and all of that my the left side of my body is in better condition we thought is it better to balance on my left leg and kick with the right turned out know it was better just try a balance on my right and kik with the left cause it was a lot strong his candister te gick and bun just a sort of figure out which one would wuld a get the tasp done mak get it was not just he was he now tapping han larg which which leg would really do some damage yeai me which would a make him feel he really recovered chase did recover much more quickly and completely than most of the patients imysel she says he pitigor injujus into a working out that it is us just a month after the rocky steps he reached his final coll and made a little widy e gots' ther while we cick at ball tevidio dancings the most good natured person who has ever wived he smiles and let me tell you when when the day did come when we were actually doing it the first time i went for the kick i thought i got him but i hit him in the thigh and not the nethers and he could have faked it he could have laid on the floor and pretended to be in pain immediately he was chase miss do it again why all right here we go tthe bidio dance stanc there legs spread awkwardly one hand covering is eyes but laughing which i think sommers is all the feelings you culd have in that moment chase quite way sorry do not me felt bed for dim we other fell he come far whend the texcot sent initially they thought it was never can i happan he thought was ging to be impossible instead i slammed him in is nothers i slammed him ir he was on the ground he was not ocag he was oca after but i and also he said in says in the viyo chase slammed me in the nothers and it and it felt good and cause he at the same time was prout and for being able to get to a point where that was ev impossible iestill as a way to go its not our recoverd stol devoting his days to physical therapy it is let us go says a lot about where he as right now i was to walk well enough the people cannot tell he ever had an intery he was tot seem how he used to be it is hive from topen a water bottle precaned a boll just down he was a fill temperature at all we can fill the water from the sharer hid hin but cannot o a hotted i and then my fingers ai can feel when the'r touching things but i cannot always feel the texture when i' reaching for something in my pocket i do not always know if i'm grabing my wallet or my keys or just the pants it is it is kind of difficult but i do have sensation everywhere i just fairies the level but i's interesting that you are recoveris but you are not totally there you have come far but do not tel e there you are in this weard wenbol it is weard i've not your how much i it i just want all this to be done i just want the recovery yo be dine whether i fully recover or not i just wont to be at the point where i do not have to spend my tot dedicate my entire life to getting betters the point i ex super excited to get to is when i not thinking about it where where is right now every time wovh my hand it is just in my head o life i have this injury every time with my leg all i have this enjury tat's to get to the point where he is used to what his body can do at whatever level that turns out to be it is what this dominating his thoughts an is whold day but this is the thing recovery means something different for everybody each person sets er own golds part of recovering is actally to finding for yourself what your own recovery means to dana programme we have people coming back from some very different things the're in the same wimbow chases in where there partly there but not all the way ther in the middle which is this moment of enormous hope but also a lot of other stuff to be easy chicago since merican life am mi reglass still with us s aone naked lunch t i they show really came out of a question that one of a long time producers a susan burton had about something his happening in her own life you may remember a few months ago susan i told story an i show about her eating disorder and i was something she had kept secret for mest of a life from every one in her life and and then sheu reveal the secret in a bookshiebo this memoir that came ot last summer and the bok is abut what it is to have aneating disorder not about how to get over one as wich shisn' wrotit she was not over it she still isn'n and of the toon have years that she 's been working toward recovery she started to wonder what does recovery from an eating disorder even mean i hads up that if hearing stories by eating disorders aggravate your own eting disorter sometimesis may affect you a he susn it the beginning of recovery i never thought about recovery what i thought about was telling my secret the secret was the eating disorder i'd have for thirty years what was the seeting tosorder it had been many things starving benging it is not you pick in eating disorder as a tean age girl and you have that one for the rest of your life the thap relationship with food is what you have for the rest of your life what it felt to me i was going to have when it age forty five i stepped into my therapists office for the first time i'm preoccupied with food and i do not want to be i told her that was the beginning ni am in the middle to an a half years in and what that looks it is not easy to summarise easy would be i now do ex behaviour instead of wie i do not have that kind of sentence but i do have examples this one wone afternoon in this spring my husband made cookies i took one from the cooling rack and i ate it with him ind our sixteen year old sun maybe that sounds a smallthing maybe that sounds nothing i've to curb that impulse to tell you how small these things are how nothing they are because within eating disorder how you relate to food connects to and disrubs how you relate to everyone in your life and eating something sweet at that time of day fror me that is not nothing that havens alone in secret because the pleasure is intense it cannot be seen it cannot be share there will be no pleasure if its share but that day i lean against the counter and ate the cookiy and it felt good it was one of many things i did not realize about recovery it is not just eating intuitively it is making food somethin shared instead of something secret another diy my other sun age thirteen came into the kitchen he wanted me to come out to the garden he could show me how the vines of his cucumbers were hardening as they twine he wanted to show me now and it could not be now how could any one be asking me to do anything now i could not no in a second and yeu went back outside but the reason i could not was that i just pitted cherries that i was going to put on ice crane the food was incoming on the way it could not be stopped i could not be intruded on when i finished i went straight to the garden and my sun showed me the vines it stood theyre hating myself reflecting on how many such moments there have been over the years i cannot write now not wright now i've don a lot of that a lot of mothers and a lot of it has had to do with work but work come on really there is no shame in that admission ere's all this hand ringing about guilt and work and motherhood but hard work is the most culturally sanctioned thing in america try revealing that you have turned your child away because of food do you detect anger most of us with eating disorders vulcanically angry also most of us placid or even fun girl disguised that is part of recovery too expressing anger not hiding tmy body my body is recovering too it is changing i bodies those sponges my children ais wanted when they were young and we were in line at the grocery store thit is ponge is oure thin sticks of gum the color of manilla envelopes when you put them in water they expand that iswhat my body has done it is one of those flat sponges that expanded i told us to my therapist bhat s an interesting word flat she said it isthe word i mean i emphasized flat not thin yes she said and you were flat inside too a motionally and that was true that is what the eating disorder does to you that is part of wy you have it you will not feel that is maybe the whole point clothes a blue linen dress with buttons down the front there came a day an may when it was the right weather for it i put on the dress which used to be loose but no longer was but the difference was that i did not want it to be loose ind the kitchen my husband reache for me he put his hands on my waist rounded them over my hixe and i wanted it i wanted to be touched that was new too but the way i've gained the wai o case this is mixed some of it it is not the binging i did for years but ther's been a lot of reaching for food all day i longed to eat in an orderly way meals on plates at consistent times but i struggle to do there is a specific meal that comes to mine when i think about not only where i am in recovery but what i want from it i wanted be normal about lunch want ano the scene i associate with lunch are this american life s taff meeting which happens in perseon once a week when there is not a pandemic every week food is ordered in and laid out on he table and take out containers i've never once taken the food we order in for this meeting for years i've watched people pick up plates an just put food on those plates and then sit down at the meeting and eat that food while we are talki every part of this is a marvel to me but actually whatd happens even before they get to the food that is probably the most important part that they stood from their desks and came to get the food neither heating themselves for ardy having eaten at the wrong time nor bruttle and empty because they been too scared to put anything in i imagine hunger rising in a normal way in their bodies a kind of rising hunger thats unfamiliar it is i crave it in the way people may be crave love or touch or something it happene rarely for me this is what i'm thinking about when i sit in a circle of co workers with plates on their laps i'm looking at these people an imagining what they feel in their bodies it makes me feel very distant from them in a way thats kind of far reaching as in it extends out to other ways i relate to my co workers and every one in my life yet in recovery i wanted be normal about lunch normal we all know there is no normal that normal is being fased out but normal stays in my head when it comes to food normal about food is that recovery when my book came out and i was first doing interviews about it people would ask me where are you with food now i would say i'm working toward recovery but i felt uneasy whenever i said this thelt i was throwing around a phrase i did not understand and that my ignorance was clear to everyone who actually knew about eating disorder f recovery i just felt out of my debth just new to this to every part of it to the working toward at part to recovery which just to say was that the process or the end was there an end what does recovery from an eating disorder even mean square one i went looking for the official clinical definition of eating disorder f recovery i wanted this is contect as a baseline but it turned out there was no base line there is no consensus about what recovery means most stdefinitions include physical criteria are you at healthy weight and behaviour have you stopped benging but there is also how much your thinking about food youre ability to express emotions all the stuff that has nothing to do with eating this is where the lack of consenses comes in over what other stuff belongs in the definition intelectually i was interested in all of this but a motionally what i really wanted was to talk about recovery with people who would been through it people further along in it than me i wanted to talk about what recovery felt to them maybe is a way of imagining myself an to my own version of it and i had two people in mine the first one was someone who would said a single word to me about recovery that captured how i wanted to feel there a word that i'd been returning to for months the word was sturdy i very happy to be talking you again i ca got me to if youare i do not know under thirdy and you grew up watching te colodian you probably know who genette a curtious she was a starved tean comedies i carley sammon cat in her early twenty she quit acting it was actually part of her eating disorderf recovery and iw she has a podcast called empty inside she interviewed me for it last summer which is when she said that word sturdy that stayed with me eversince first and most of why i felt sturied after i recovery that i could share my story when we spoke you use this word to describe your recovery you said you waited to tell your story until you were sturdy as soon as you said that word something about it grabbed me and then when i responded to you i even repeated the word kind of trying it out it just shows a lot of self knowledge to you that you waited till you appoint where you were sturdy cause of course and it stay with me after the intervieu and i think it had much significance because i'm it described to me both an emotional and a physical place i had for long privileged and tried for frailness in fragility and the idea of being sturdy was suddenly appealing to me a sturdy body but malso sturdiness in the way that you could be buffeted by thad mi the hard experiences come out o cet you could withstand it you might get blown about but you would not get broken you would be o kay and and i think as far as thinking about my recovery it is been in interesting word to return to because it is not as woo woo and some other stuff phoenix rising or the tiger ye you knaen lit you has something really real about it anyway oh my god i gex cormen cure witds thurty weeds to you well i ma i just have to say i any time onby starts comparing people the animals to the the lyonmiss prowls and the night sky i you lost me i have there is nothing real that i can grab on to for me it is really important to use language that cind of reflects reality otherwise i what sturdy meant to genet was that she felt strong enough in her recovery to speak publicly about her eating disorder without falling back into it and to give you a sense of what she had to recover from her eating disortof started when she was eleven and being a child actor i always played roles that were kind of younger thend my actual age and it was very beneficial to be able to play roles or younger than my age because you could work longer hours they were much more inclined to cast you if you were twelve playing eight than if you were eight plangy and but when i was eleven i sort of started deboloping a little timy i'll call it it nipple but i do not know what else to call it just a little the littlest peep of arest and and my mond had actually had cancer when i was two years old i thought the only thing i knew about lumps and breast was without my cancer i thought oh no she had cancer now i have cancer i showed my mon this lunp she felt it and she said oh nedty kno you do not have cancer youre getting you are just getting breasts and in my eleven year old mine breasts were just about as bad as cancer truly i did not want to be older i did not mi knew that that would be you knw really really not good for my acting career and i was largely the financial support for my familyes i knew them meant bat things for my family i just wanted to stay young and i said well how can i how can i keep the boobs from coming in my mumpsaid whele there is this thing called callria fiction ju nette actually wrote a song about this conversation it is from a one woman show she is been performing s lis and from that point on she she not only coach me but really ou know shed had eating disorters of her own te quite a long time we were sort of this i call it a mommy in me eating disorder of team and we were just we would help each other out every single my meal planning for the next day calory calry counting for the pr for the day that we just experience and and swapping tips and tricks and reading woman's world magazin di ot ages together and wou were just i tough it was this valulous thangwhere where yo were just this little doell when i thought while i'm lucky my mumps helping me with this thing i'm helping her look at us go l the idea of going over the calories for your day with your mother a meant how many times in my life i made little lists of you kno two hundred plus one fifty plen bute but it was alone i mean my god that you ere eing it with your mother ah yeh absolutely i may i think i think di mi the experience of eatings for often is something that lonely im and while it became that for me after my monbit and and the eating words which to bleema for almost the entire time that i had nter i saet it was very much that teams for was there a moment word a stage where you started using the word recovery to describe youre experienced yourself well gi woud can it ri rot a little bot about wooo ord words earlier because there was something actually in recovery that did not i did not it ot a when i thought of the word recovery i thought its somebody in head to to linen just youon each waves granning ear to ear laughing about how easo i i pigging up a sea shell and tossing it into the sea that was not how i felt about or it was sure i would ever ever feel about life i was very weary of using the word and recovery and fer for quite some time and i would say a kind of i just try to buy past that and and use other words and ter to think of what i said you kdon'i would just i woud just goine to be i wousd say you knows something something i'm working on midway through she got to a point that sounds a lot where i am now she describes the feeling this way i've been in recovery for a few years and i'm not where i want to be this has been very stopped and go had's been very good week bad week i'm not satisfied with that i my wanted i wanted mean a wake up to morrow and an work toward being fully recovered i think it is time and and and i and i felt ready ye at that point i mean because im among the reasons i wanted to talk to you its because you are as somebody who dislikes the phrase recovery journey smy j you but you are further along that besome ni the page in your linen dress than than i am im and i am i feel really ready to a to be on the other side of this im for somebody me whos listening to you tell this story and is i have that thought to i want to put it behind me what how were you able what did you do next that got you to where you are now sjeanette's answer to my question about what she did next was essentially it was not what she did next that mattered it was all the work she would aready done and there be she grambled with a lot of the under lying reasons for her eating disorder felt rage toward her mother greeved her mother yes she was still purging and still restricting but wayway less she just knew that she did not need those behaviours as coping strategies any more she developed others she started writing finding her own voice that was a few years ago she describes where she is now as recovered how does the reality of of feeling recovered how does it compare with what you imagine o my god it feels lhike there is not that weit constantly and and while i would say you k o the definilly a afar afar distance from pece whatever it is another one mavre words for me but i but i feel good i feel am she feels more present i feel more able to focus more able to feel her feelings and to tolerate the uncomfortable ones these are all things i hope for precisely i asked her about something that might some weird if you have never had an eating disorder but i feel food in my body just intensely jeanett said she understood one thousand per cent what i meant by this and she said that is gone now too it is i'm more intune with my body yea but less aware of those types of thinkgs talking to jeanette it made me think of a turm might come across in the research i done about the definition of recovery indistinguishable as in a person can recovery fully frome an eating disorder that they become in distinguishable from someone who is never had one it sounded almost sidephi we arace your eating disorder but also your old identity not even somethng i would want but also something i instantly wanted i thought id try out in distinguishable on jeanette see if it resinated ut there is no difference from them and somebody who is never had an eating disorder there brain as indistinguishable is love ta i you detri na thai but sis that does that a it is it sounds that is a peeling to you as that what you feel you feel indistinguishable from somebody who is never had an eating disorder that is hue thats hugely appeeling i think im you not belying of i if i if i said there was not always kind of some awareness of that being my pass e am but i would s i devinitly notice when somebody does not have any sort of eating disorerten i fee i can i spought them quite easily oh ow they be just er ar nonal is kont of mi my thought and i would say i'm i'm as close to that as i can possibly be i have menos er foo rules i eate am whatever i want breakfast lunch dinners nacks and am and i do not think at all about it it is i i it is its its almost odd to me when i think about might passe i i i've said several times to my partner alsi le i cannot believe that there was a time my life when that was who i was i i ya it is wild to me it is just it feels a different person it feels oman i get they does feelike my brain was wy ar differently them i felt hopeful after talking to jeanett the freedom she feels that it was possible for me here was some one who thought thoughts mine who felt feelings in her body mine who now had new thoughts and a new experience of her body but i've had these thoughts and feelings for a lot longer time i'm forty seven jeanette just turned twenty nine won of the realities of my recovery is just that i've lived with an eating disorder for many years and i really wanted to talk to some one my own age who would started recovery in middle age talk about what it had been for the i had some one in mine twhoan nissa gray an nissa wrote a novel called the care and feeting of ravenously hungry girls which i read last sommer and was really affected by the novels patagonist is a black lassbean in her forties with an eating disorder a description that explodes all kinds of stereotypes about who has eating disorders and who gets to tell stories about them an nissa is in her fifties her benging and purging started in college me she hid her eating disorder from everyone in her life for years i i used to be very careful about not doing certain behaviours at home an someone could hear my wife hert me ah in bathroom at one point and that was when omas you dropped an nissa agreed to get help but only because her wife wanted her too they live outside at lanta and is sa found in eating disorder center there she shut up for her frui s groupd there a pesession straight from a three hour work out and a bengin burge and ah one of the things i noticed immediately upon walking in was that yeua i was the only black person in the room i'm not unfamiliar with that sanaria it that is essentially been the case for me a most if not all my life ah monseu that was fine and but i was really struck by how yah the women were in the in the groud mostly college age and twenties one around forty a nessa was that they were the oldest ones for those of us whohave had this history of eating disorters that is lasted for dachades instead of for several years ah it is it is different right the the nerl pathways are jas much the grooves are much deeper at this age ye i i think back to somelike adolesce and diary entries i would i would you knon't be scrawling after a benge and and this has been a part of my life for two years i'fe lost two years to this and my god that i did not know ha how many more years is is this something you have thought about yet i think there is something for women sort of in our cohord perhaps not to have sought treatment ah ye early h and that is why i think it is important for older women to talk about it ah when i was out on tour i met many women fortis and fifties and sixties who had struggled for jus years and years and were finally trying to get well ye i i mean the same i bee whenever i get a note from a woman fortye fifty sixteens even seventies was always somebody whos struggled for years and i i have thought the exact same thing as you that there is something about m are contemporaries were we did not seek treatment early and and then part of me started wondering is it some kind of janex latchky yu know er was it just a different time i did not know anything about in this his own recovery beyond that she had more of it under her belt than i do ten years into it she does not feel totally free it was not what she expected at the beginning i thought that ah that there would be an end that i would reach this place where i did not have these thoughts any more i did not have these urges any more and ah and i was would be quot ant quot normal i would have a very healthy relationship with food i have a better relationship with food for sure ah but i do not know if i will ever be quote un quote tha normal ah when it comes to food and exercise ye ti mein there i's disappointment an realizing ocay this is gone a be with me but there is also a assens a a accomplishment and regiliant ah that i have id i know what life used to be for me and i know what it is now h it it is it is easier but you i just have to be vigilant and careful if at the beginning of treatment youare imagining that there will be an end and you will reach a place where you do not have the thoughts any more ah and in this kind of a stage where you disappointed to realize ocade this is going to be with me i'm curious about this as some one who am teyw wonders if if this this wone we where i wind up two and and at ah i'm wondering something that might be hard to answer but i'm just wondering kind of how you knew that and when you knew that i think it was somewhat evolutionary ah i ended treatment wich still some of the thoughts and am i was much better it managing them but as time went on i did start to wonder ok i said is is this is this just how i'm going to be at thes thought it would sort of work itself out ahm as i went on ah and far it has not ah on the positive side that i i the thoughts ar much fewer ah the compulsion and nothing compared to the way i started out it nissa says that one thing that was important to her in this process was watching a friend get sober in sobriety for many people the idea is that you are never recovered always in recovery it is a process us always on going that never ends as aness assal with her friend i think it was through that and sort of watching her manage and watching her understand that this is going to be this is an on going thing for me her peace with that i think was really helpfull for me ti sort of get some pece with myself lik did not feel tortured about it do not feel ah well was me this is the cross i have to bear you can live live and you can you be happy you just have your thiink i doft beit make maybe there meybery there is some point ra i'll just be fineand but i do not see that but i'm also ol kay with that talking to inissa about being okey with an ongoing thing it help me imagine how i might feel in the future what i want its simple if my son were to come into the kitchen and asked me to come to the garden while i was making food i have a reaction oh i'm about to eat something but i'll come out when i'm through dou want to sit with me while i eat andthn we could go out together and when we went outside to the garden i would just be in my body i would not feel my flesh and if my neighbour came over i would wave and chat and not feel fake or terrified here would just be in ease and if something did rise out some spikiness some fear some urged to reach for food or to reject it i be able to handle it and if despite my best efforts i submitted to it i be able to tolerate the disappointment i do not know if that would feel recovery to me i do not think i can know until i get there but i think it would feel sturdiness says burton siys meditor on a programme memor about a reading tdisorder is called empty coming out o benbar s ask he

my experience recently i went out with this guy whos pofile said i'm just coming out of a long tern monogamis relationship and not looking to get back into one i interpreted this his coad for hook ups only but then when we went out he talk to me for three hours about all the inner reflection the pandemic had led to and how he could not be with someone until he sorted out his deemens in turn told him how sick i gotn how it took me a full three months to recover it was sweet but not as advertise ive been out with five other guises since it' starts hot an ends feeling i've been to a support group it is confusing mad's agrees you are in the mood and then you are not all of a sudden it is weard i do not know i cannot pull my finger on what it is really i denflly felt there is a thing inside of me that is kind of yet there is a sadness inside of me that will be fine i'm good to hiding it i'm good and not addressing it but thon when i'm alone with someone in this intimate setting it kind of flars up inside of me and it is something kind of flares up inside of them too i used to worry that my things that i'd been through my dramas insadness is a kind of ruined me for other people just people want to have fun or were cool and nice in a way it is kind of lovely debt feel oh i see this and every one now i thought it would be a sign of recovery f people were moving on kunning loose leaving the past year behind but instead it seemed they felt very aware of what they have been through what every one is feeling that decision did not look away to embrace the sadness that is a

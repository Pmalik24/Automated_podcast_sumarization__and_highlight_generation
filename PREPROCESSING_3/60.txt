they showsponserba express vipian is time to stand up against bigtac protect or datat express vipianti cams lashmen yesterday sand a majority leader chuck sumer of new york took to the floor of the senate to de cry antisemitism shumer is not in amazing source on this particular topic given his consistent support of the middly sto polisees on most antismetic president in modern american history arakomama none the less he spoke about the threat of antisemitism and in a rare moment of quasionesty he actually mentioned the problem of antisemitism among liberals here is what he had to say i feel compelled to speak because i'm the highest ranking jewish elected official in america in fact the highest ranking jewish elected official ever in american history and i have noticed the significant despairing bebetween how jewish people regard the rise of antisemitism and how many of my non jewish friends regard antistemites are taking advantage the propalistinian movement tos thatest pouse hatred and bigotry towards jewish people but rather than call out this dangerous behavior for what it is we see many of our friends and fellow citizens particularly young people who yearn for justice unknowingly aiding an abetting their cause note the language there they'r people hi jacking the propalistinian movement ther hi jacking it the young people they are they'r good hearted they just do not know what they do sumer actually explaind that the phrase from the river to the sea a genecitl call to destroyalgews was actually just ignorance plenty of people sumer actually said champ that phrasepot not because they hate jewish people but because they support a better future for palistinians of course that is a wi and to particularly gregious li when sumer himself is thad zero to say about antisemisfrshudtoleban o han omar inside his own paukis for example there ar some people last night chancing from the river to the sea in new yor city while they attempted to stop the lighting of the christmas tree at rokofeller senter last night to these look good hearted but slightly misinform people to you hn he wan actin in tese officers fit outside rockofeller senter doorry according chucshimer they are just to passion about the propalistinian cause that they are not antisematic they are not ratical in any way theres t ignorant liberals tey're never the bad gies according to chuchimer what we are watching is precisely the mentality created by the world of leftist ideology ansumer knows that but he hase to ly about it because to recognize the roots of leftwing antisemitism would be to destroy the progressive ideology wholesale that left thist ideology is based on a matrix of oppressor verses oppressed that in any given situation the powerless are pressed and the powerful are the oppressors that oppressor oppressed matrix maps directly on to a ntysemetic conspiracy theories about jewish power jews are sudo wite because jews are financially well off and israel is disproportionately successful and really unsuccessful region of the world the oppressor oppressed matrics simply does not fit the jews who are actually being victimized by widespread jew hatred in the middle east and abroad but who also are very successful to the left keeps pushing the li that is also true of the anti dephamationlly which put out a pull yesterday with hille international which is a college group asking college sudens if diversity equity and inclusion should cover anti jewish prejudice dhiversity aquitin inclusion d e i is the rubrick under which the left pushes the idea that unequal group outcomes are the result of systemic discrimination by that mat jews are thebeneficiaries of systemic discrimination bes of course theyre disproportionately successful d i simply cannot include jews because d e basic logic forbids it d i opposes maritocracy it opposes performance it opposes success none the lesk th eighty four per cent of jewish students an seventy five per cents of non jewish college students said jews should be included in d e i training that jews should be somehow included in the oppressor oppresed matrics on the side of the oppressed of course these tudents say that what ell susacklly would they say the premise of the question is deply flod only one answer is possibl to say the juws should not be included in d e i would be to discriminate against jews which violates the supposed basis of d itself but to include jews explodes th entire d e i superstructure becuse again d i is based on the idea of oppressor overses oppress andif jews are included on the side f the oppressed how are they successful these students are saying what they are expected to say surd the jews can be included in the victim class without recognizeing the sentral truth of d e i it is a scam victim hood is not inherently connected to level of success sometimes the powerless are evil sometimes the powerful are good sometimes the power lis are actually victimizer sometimes the powerful are the victims he cannot fight antisemitism with d i eu can only increase antisemitism with d i because the entire frame work is conspiracy theory the only way to truly fight antisemitism is to recognize with the bible says in duteronomy quote whe shall not be partial to the poor or difer to the grate but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor but that is the one thing chucktumer and the ad el will mever say bease again t would violate their ideology instead people on the left will pretend the true anti semitism does not lyig in opppressor oppressed matracies but in people lan musk ad theyll target him specifically because he does not d i they will claim that d i is the way to fight antisemitisms wo ive e lon musk fights d e that means he is bad theyll slander him is an antisemic even as he goes to israel to express solidarity with the family of murder jews they'l try to activate advertisers to pull their money from twitter supposals because e lon mus is the root of all antisemetic evil elon musk to his credit is fighting back against this here is a clipp yesterday avelan muskcutan absolute classic hise being asked about advertisers canclling

explaining that he to see the paws that has been created by negotiations between israel and commas va cotar then they wonc ee that extended more hossages our release then the big question here is whether this a preylude to western pressure for israel to enitofensive against commas completely which is insane as well talk about momentarily hure's blinkin yesterday wed to see the pasextende becauses wuter is anable pirst an foremost is postage is being release it is also un able us to u to surgin manitor isis inc ot people gazer who dest terly neded nay again the the idea here is is that just ta paus tat does the united states suddenly expect the israel's going to stop what is doing israel cannot top wht is don ng and in fact they came very close to anying the sease fire last night because come oss literally waited untill five minutes before the dedline to come up with new hostages and what what comemoss is doing right now is unbelievably evil it it is as evil is what they did nt october seventh is just in semotions on october seven they murderd twelve hundred people and they cannaped another two hundred forty and now theyare separating families out theyare saying that some people are dad who are still live there somethere saying some peoplewar live are are actually dad and an yyu while they are pursuing terror attacks literally this morning in israel israel time there is a terror attack is in the the a major thighly traffic street corner injerusalem at a bustop and im you can see these are two brothers from eash jerusalem who identify with comemoss come ostocredt or this attack they get out of their car and they start mowing down a bunch of people who are at a bustop they ended up killing three people including a pregnant twenty fore your woman theye were shot by people who are on the scene reserves who shut up with their guns o a a a civilian who is off duty and who ends an up shooting them three dad six injured supposedly this is n the midle of a sese fire come oss took full credit for this come ossays this is a good thing and yet israel is supposed to keep going with some sort of pause to get the hostages aut i goto say there is a moral question is whether israel should or can continue to do this sort of routine these again what is happened o the hostages is horrible and evil and continues to beforable and evil at the same time is the life of tha hostage any more valuable than the life of that twenty four youral pregnatwoman who just murdered on a treet qorring jerusalem which presume ley would not have happened if isral were continuing it is military operations to defenistrate comas speaking of the treatment of the hostages it is amazing to watch as world and international organizations pretend that the hostages were treated well in some way a len levy whose the poks person for thy isrally government he says a no the hostages were not in fact held in reasonable conditions as the thefitee of homs captivirty retun ho over the lost weet were beginning to discover new ciling details about life as aas hostages a'm of course not at liberty to sarin formation from the official investigations but the evidence of the families have been sharing with the media is chilling the hostages were not held in reasonable conditions as some hav cicinicy cae or children were serialy abused just homos recorted its own crimes against humanity on october seven it continues to do not hument its own atrosities releasing footage of crowds terrorizing the hostages in tha final moments of captivity those senes bringing to mind that scene from game of thrones and cans of the a eries wult of course noit tene an talking about of course the hostages were not held in reasonable condition what else doyou expect from ei terrorist group that the simple fact of matter is that the hostages were treated precisely as you would expect come os to treat the hostages will get to that in just one second first i've got a holiday gif that yia it is sure

the center riht ind the collision government is no hamas no pie ri may be teir atual collition and we will manage the occupation in perpetuity and we will sell the west bank and that is ean you will have to de with them gan you will have to deal thit creshase then goes on to suggest we denying self determination to these people it is worth pointing out this point that cris hes ridiculous assumption that self determination is some how old to every single group bregardless of the eagles of their believe system is extraordinarily dangerous did ises deserve self determination haa is bola haw the white supremises ha sees round every corners they deserve self determination but norto back cases point e left continues to push the idea that the palisinian arabs in the gassess drip in westbank are somehow magically a moderate group simply dominated by a few terror masters i know this a very flattering met the left that h west proticued we love to tell ourselves the smith an this is the wwill be greeted as liberators in roc mith s the same thing from th bush ministration here is the pendagons spokes person saying just that course the israel is are taking in to a count innocent civilians an that is why again in all of our calls ah that the secretary has with his counter partmen tir golat we continue to urge of course for the protection of innocent civilians wherever they are in gaza and and again we have to remember hama does not represent the palistangan people and they shut it a the palistanan people deserve true leership an and and again hamas really should be rooted out from mithan gaza o ga the idea that they do not represent the palistinian people is a ly there is precisely zero evidence thet comas does not represent the palistonians that zero no evidence of that fact does not mean their all terrors it means they do support a terrorous group period they elected comas and then by every vailableple since then the supportmas including in westbankuer homas is not governed for all the people hors tang you cannot trust the poll results in gasa fine do not trust those pool results trust the pol results in west bank with a palsinin authority is the governing entity then there is the complaine that the left is lodging that israel must stop its campaign against comas in order to minimize cevillian casualties as we repeatedly discust is yol tries to do that but to folkis on this question gives total leverage tucomas because cmmas does not care at all the here zero about that topic finally the left complains that international institutions are being hampered in their efforts to help well let us talk a little bit about these called international institutions they are a sick joke they are broken thy are broken because there is no such thing as an international community there can be no community with terannical hellholes and people who support terrorism and yet apparently long as you say the magic words tinternational humaniterian institution everybodyis suppose to bow and scrape before you as though you are in fact good hearted saint doing wondrous healing work more often than tot more often than tnot the term international humanitarian organization is a tremendous lie take for example the united nations the etter dis grace that is the uen is nothing new of course the u un came into being in the afterm ath world ore too when the west was seeking to end all conflict the international deplomacy as literally all o historysence that has shown that plan was a giant failure it turns out the best guarentour of international safety and security is a strong had gomonic western power namely the united states whenever the u en has been intrusted to guaranty safety an security it has failed in corea in rulanda in goslavia in the sina desert in lebanon literally everywhere whenever you un peacekeepers are put in a place and then i terannical recumet demands they be removed they sleeve youan agencies have sometimes been helpful in

allowed to do ther work thes international agencies are by and large garbage and or tools of comoss the unrelief and works agency for example the only agency in the uen dedicated to one specific group people palistinian ar refuge s and i put refutues in quotes there tbecause we are now talking about the great grand children of people wmove three miles down the road into the gossi trip has funnal billions of dollars to palistinians including terogroups in fact since nineteen ninety four the united states has sent over ten billion dollars to the palistinians the united states supplies nearly thirty per cent a vu and our wwa buged historically u and our wa work fors it consists of tens of thousands of palistinians living the gossis trip including many terroris and terror suborts as we talked about on the show when the trump administration cut aid th u an our w way the state department sad quote the fundamental business model and fyscal practices that if marked u and our w way for years tie to u and our wways endlessly and expenentially expanding community of en title beneficiaries is simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years the bid administration quickly restored aid to thu and our w way but now te u and our wway is giving western powers hartburn again that is because of reports that one of the child hostages helld bacomss was actually being held by a u and our wwa teacher barely given any food and no medicine by the way that would be the kind of person teaching at the schools the chrishasenies are actually teaching at the schools when a lla chicade in that clip tells crisades the people are being in doctrinated by teachers from thu and ur w anies well even if thesr literally one of those teachers was holding a hostage a child hostage in his attic no wonder the blundistog forn of fair comittees frank muar rosen strit in germany as she called on the german government to cut aid to the u an our w way it is not just the yu and ur wway that is the problem here is sarah hendrix deputy executive director for you and women that is a western organization that has not bothered to condemn comass's mass rape of his rai women on october seven her sh was being question by the onagola drago of sianen if therrean tho tera that you cannot pepifically call out homa and the mounting evidence now over seven we that is rarely investigators ho collect tey that we shown our tour about the acro aty they committed pepifically on october sevent the as i think that the crop of the issue here if's not just condemning fectual violent tagainst the women and in any war in general i pethificaly what a card on october seven perpetrated by hamas indeed you an women always suport impartial independent investigations into any ferio calegations of genderb were sectuonal violence and within t u an family these investigations are led by the office of the high commissionery human right and just to provide a little bit of contract inturts of human womens rul you an women iticly cervie and hi an te knowledge on gender violenc and provie support investigations as we do with all uman investigation sus me an kno on condemning comass that is an awful lot of word tella to avoid condemning cmas but what else would you expect mar humaniterian organizations take is another example the international red cross because the international committee of the red cross requires the help of goups comass even work in the gosistrib they und up as tools of comas the iciarcy has spent little or no time condemning comosprats otober seve of the trocidies instead they focuset on israel's action in gaza the iciarcy also failed to report the facts which they knew about as raily hostagues being held at gosin hospitals even as the international media lied that those hospitals were sovilian sights meanwhile the iciarcy has not fulfilled one of the key components of israel's original hostage deal with comas verification of life and helth of the hostages being held by hamas that failure has had particularly tragic consequences in the case of the bebas family the ware kidnaped from a village called near ods father yardan mother sheery four yearold are and ten monthld feer ore taken to gaza there is the footage of them being obducted you can see there is mom carrying these two red headed kids as comas kidnaps them theyare physically healthy there are obviously healthy when taken but nobody knows if they are alive earlier this week it was reported that the family was trateds the popular front for the liberation of palistine another terrors group by homas and then yesterday homas clane the family had ben killed by his raily boms where is the ice yarsey too testifie to any of this deny it verifyd the're absolutely missing instead the iciarcy the wonderful humanitarian organization has become a shuttle service for is raily hostages helping comoss release the hostages as gosan crowd's cheer in blood thirsty fashion there is more of that last night do notlry folks the palisonian ar population they hate comass which is why they are literally jeering mocking jheering filming the release of israily hostages mostly women in children is a wonderful moderate who deserve self determination obviously the world will be a better place if they ad a state the international humanitarian institutions have beclowned themselves in the currnt israel comaswar but theye ware suspec lone before that its just the radical muslems in the left toin press have londered lies into public view by adding the imprematur of the nagical international community to corrupt institutions riddled with political radicals and corrupt functionaries in just one second on a talk about international institutions in international politics because a lot of what you are seeing to day in the o bits about henry kissenger is predicated on people's views about particularly this subject last night henry kissengerdied thete is a hundred years old am ad metam very briefly once and i had interviewed him once its anenda being taped a'm he is a fascinating character obviously tvery checkerd character a lot of the decisions he made were extremely cold eed extremely cold eyed lot a people ranging from anthony bordan too christopher hitchens condemned him as war criminal for his decision making during the nixen administration with regard to for example the intenution invasion of east teemor or the american intervention on behalf of pinoche in chila ind nineteen seventy three but or are the bomming of kambodia by the same token how you view kissonger is very much reflection of how you view international politics as a whole and the reason tha this is broken t ownan sort of a left right to vide despite the fact that kissenger's history was very checkered in terms of left right decision making for example the right does not the fact that kissnger onc open china whas kissenger who really led to the opening of china at the time as a real politic decision because he saw a gap emerging between china and russia and wheas attempting to exploit that gab by wooing china away from russia i that was the goal the goal was woo chinaway from russia remove them as a source of trade and resources four russia and you lend up weakening the russian regine which is wite the the trip to china was initiated with nixon speaking with mow in rect respect we can say and i would say that is a bad mistake at the time it is a choice beteen two bad decisions and this was the sort of guiding light of kissenger's foreign policy to henry kissenger for for those do not know much about kissenger himself he was a massive celebrity in the nineteen seventies who was a secretary of state during the inixen and and jerl ford administrations according to the walstre journal no ua secretary of state ever achieved such celebrity while an office as henry kissenger an nineteen seventy four newsweet covered depicted him as superkaa comic okero time called him the world's most indispensable man gallop ranged him america's most admired man an nineteen seventy two life magazine spread pictured him with a bevy of accresses including jil saint john yet no former secretary of state has been more vehemently criticized of the many anti kissenger books the most influential was christopher hitchenses the trial of henry kisenger which explicitly accused kissenger of responsibility four war crimes and crimes against humanity in indo china c lay argentina cypris east teamor and several other places wole of the bok mentioned only one other supposed crimeseen banguadash and ninetion the soviet union only three thimes is nail ferguson who were biography of henry kissenger talking about henry kissenger he said those accusations stuck mud late in life kissnger regularly faced protest at is public appearances yet the ard ods with e historical record and ferguson points out that kissenger was both the white house national secured adviser and the secretary of state his accomplishments included the negotiation of the first tracatic arms limitation treaty the ab m treaty with the soviet union the opening to china the sees fire in yon ke por war in nineten seventy three the nd of us involvement in the veanomor for which both he and north teat ames counterpart te dok tho were wartod the ineteen seventy three nobell piece prize but here is the problem if you see foreign policy as a family of nations not a good hearted people out there they all just want the same thing but there having different ways of achieving that then hard cor foreign policy mooks nasty to you because the easiest thing his just washer handsof everything of that if the united states just go to hands off what why were weven involved in these places whydid not from the right what you hear and i think this critic is correct of henry kisenger is that henry kissenger was focused on the sort of metr nicky and balance of power that he forgot that the united states is a global hetgimon and from the left what you hear of henry kisenger is he was engaged in the dirty game of politics in that men that the united states was tonstantly engaged in dirty little wars all around the world we shouldn' have ben engaged in and the reality is somewhere in between the reason of the left things that is becas the left believes thatif a communist regine were to arise ind latin america with the behet with the help of the union that is not a bad thing if thng amarks ist regine in latin americ or many marks tist regines an latimerica what is the big dea wise that a problem what is it matter if theanom turns communist why is it matter if kcambodi an lastern comunist why is at matter if ye seamar turms communists why is any of that matter first ofall that demonstrates a complete miss reading of palforeign policy works foreign policy is a dirty terrible business in which if as i say kissenger had one central forign policy message is ove riding message was avoid the worst outcome which means some times embracing the second worst outcome if you read at nav as books this kisenger's main thing was avoid the worst outcome this by the way was his recommendation n you crane when it came to you crane during this war tat is curently on going very early on he suggested at there should be an offram in nou crane becase everbody knew tht you crane was not gonto take the don bass ar cremia in which you crane was given security guarantees did not formelly and ternato but was given enough armaments to defend itself against a predatory russian invasion and russia was basiclly given dominion over the territories hit was very likely to hold anyway and this pleased it no one in the early days of the war and turns out whois rather pressiong because what he was attempting to avoid was a straight up face to face confrontation between nato and russia that is what he was attempting to avoid and he knew there there were not the stones for it in the west and realize what is happening on the ground and just to it on people ripon kissenger there two rips one is that he miss red particular situations he shouldhae done things diferently all of that is legitimate the second rip which is just wrong is the rip that you do not have to make these sort of considerations when you make american foreign policy then american forein policy is heither temost sinful foreign policy an planed earth every ill can be ascribed to it you see this in the cretik of kissenger with regard to cambodia and lous for example rea the the basic idea that is promoted by the left with cambodia is that kissenger when he took over as secretary of state in the after mouth of it ill be chae complete boching the veanom war when he came in he said we ned to star bombing the communist supply lines in cambodia and you authorize mass huge bombing rads into cambodia without the approval of congress naw can talk abut whether it needed congressional approval in all the rest that is fine but as a foreign policy matter did bombing cambodia cause for example the left nowclanes that that cause the rase of pull pot in cambodia that mere rooge who never e happened if we had not bomed cambodia that assumes that there is no such thing as to agency in the world it is a lie it is not true the minute the united states got out of the anom cambodia fell the bullpot again it is a bunch of considerations this is the the overiding message of kissenger's life hat's the thng we should take away from it whil still quibbling or arguing or strenuously hating many of his foreign policy decisions foreign policy is a dangerous and dirty business it is not possible to engage in forein policy and keep your hands totally clean that is not something that you can do because there are in fact of farious powers who hate you and who wish the worst for you and who will have an impact on your life whethr youre talking about them controlling choke points and international trade as we have talked about on the show from the straits of hormoos to the straits of tiwon or whether you re tal cking about active military operations against the united states in far frong places and yes indeed at home you have to recognize that the world is a complex place that requires complex choices and very often those choices are the choices of the least bad senario and having to actually engage with the second worst cenario and that realy is the story of henry kessengers forn policy again i agreed many the creties from the right that sometimes who is engaging in the second worst anareo when say a better cenareo was vailable and again that is a good critite what i do not agree with is the total isolationists or libertarian position which is that america should go hands off in the world and somehow the world will be a better place for it there is a very difficult position to maintain in th in face of the fact that again their contry's all over the world that hate us that do not agruth our values that seek to maxomise their own power at the expense of the american people there is this weird notion that is taken root on the right and the left its this horseshooe theory thing which is that everybody who act badly in the world was somehow driven to it bive the united states is why you seen the left embrace tiktocks of osom benlawden circuit two thousand to because olm he would never have done that if we had not been mean in saut yourabet yashor you see the right do the same thing with ridru russia never would have invaded you grain if it had not been for our attempts to extend a helping hand to to ou grain and make overtures tordado or maybe russia has a long history under vladerpoudent of territorial invations of neighboring countries maybe it turns out that other people except for the west have agency and once you realize other people excep for the west have agency t changes your decision making dramatically this true all over the world the fundamental for policy mistake is the assumption that only the west has agency the sort of ethno centricity this political arrogance leads to ironically more death then a humility that acknowledges that other people have it interest adverse to our own andthat you have to respect those interests even if that means fighting those interests again just one second we will get to the twenty twenty four campaign which again this can be the weirdest campaign in american history first balance of nature fruits in veges are a greatway to make sure you are getting escential neutricional ingredients every single

did we are making jokes about a thing that needs to be mot and that is the idea that boyscan me girls and girls can be boyst to stupid idea requires jokes and that is where doing lady bollers from youres to morrow night exclusively at daily wire plus at eight p m eastern well meanwhile the twenty twenty four election continues a pase right now in the real clear politics average donald trump is up about two points there are two recent poles that have bidon back up a couple of points but he is never above forty four forty three per cent in these poles and in fact in the poles where he is at forty nine or forty seven or forty six trump is up on him in those poles in other words jobidon is stuff his sealing is forty four forty five per cent and when people are forced to decision mat right now they are breaking in favor of trump in fact what the pulls are showing is not right now actually increase or deecreased support for bidon actually over the course of the last couple of months his support is slightly up biding in these poles the the probem for him is that all the independents are breaking in favor of trump why is that happening is because again all the focus is on jobidon and the question is goin to be can donald trump keep the focus on jobidon as the selection moves forward in order for that to happen trump cannot run a revenge campaign he cannot his campaign can be a political a policy revenge campaign he is ilizen here are my policies jobidingot ridf all of them and world is now on fire i close the boarder jobidan opened the boarder i was a negotiating piece of the released jobidon has blown up all of that by legitimizing the hoothies in yemmen by funding erran by restoring aid to the palstinians he can say all that he can say that the economy was goin great guns before covian than even in the middle of covit the economy was recovering at a steeper pace than it did subsequently under jobidon jobide is brokn all of the economic levers which is why right now the economy is running extremely hot but also we are in danger of continued baked in in flation man he can say all those things that that uld be a great campaign making that campaign aagat about were you better off in twenty nineteen or are you better off in twenty twenty four that is a good winning campaign for donald trump it is not a great whinning campaign for donald trump i'm come in in eminam bray all the people who came after me that is not something i think the american people areu for again becaus the best of donald trump always in frover was the version of donal trump wo said i am your tool you wield me in order to achieve certain objectives i am the shield for you but when he starts to make it about the voters being a shield for him people ten to object to that they do not want to bin in to his personal issues even if they think i do that meny y of those issues are being creeted by the left in our faulse if he answer to to donal trump is being un justly persecuted is election i do not buy that i thnk the the answer to donald trump the trumpeing on justly persecuted is fun his legal defence fun but again he has an independent case to make that is way better than that which is whygon he is been soaring in the poles the less you see of him you have not seen him he is been gone all the folcas has been on toobinonye needs to stay that way which is why i think it is particularly foolish for donald trump to go out there and start warning people about the weaponization of the doci trump put out a a giant statement on trut socially yesterday that i'm twelve points up on crooked jobidon i nt knowhat poll he is looking at where he is twelve points up on on i will i was my wish a wish he is not there are no pols wery's up twelve points on bidon but 's got the justice to partmen another suing me wherever and whenever possible weaponization it is called and maybe that can make a difference this his never been done on the scale before not in our country it opens him a very big and dangerous pandors box jobidon should stop his election interefering fugs before it is too late for him and the rest of the country a's the leader of the opposition party i shuld not be force to campaign from inside a court house which is very duable but not very democratic or convenient this is where they want me to spend my time and money it is not to air sistem is supposed to work if they file thes ge than he just goes on along these lines again i do not think he is wrong about any of this i just do not see why that sould be the center piece of the campaign it can certainly be a part of the campaign him sanglason jobidon's a very abad president he is going to lose that is the reason he is targening me but back to why tobidin is a bad president that is totally worth while but if his campaign is in fact about his sort sir personal venge taking a i thnk thats can be a problem for him that is a i thought expressed by his by the way erstwhile ally have mc carthy from er speaker of the house he' said thas yesterday said if trumps campaign is about revenge hol loose i don' think that is wrong and our hape mc carthy this is not bad political analysis i'm try not square in my brain how are you outgos feelings about him at that time and say i think he'ud be a great president toent i dodn't say a great present i thaid he would be a better president what wherehaver i said the country would be at a better place if his campaign is about renew rebuilled and restore he wen if it is about revenge he will loose that the only persona that is gon to determine not is that is not his campaign at is him and and he is right about that mc carthy is right about that which is why trum needs to be careful now i will say trump did something absolutely kind of ridiculous that is worth noting yesterday because frankly if any other candidate tod this ug trump i understand that trump has a hall pass from the entire re publican party for pretty much anything he does at this point because it is all baked into the cake of this point but donald trump did in fact in dorse bealem yesterday which is in insane thing to do what happened is that done there is a prisonane markfisher who builds himself as a cofounder of bealam in rode island he said he was very honore to have his and bealem's support bealam is agardment ou organization youl lant bealems support i mean i understand again that everything trumps ays has to be taken notches with a a grain of salt a giant easeburg of salt te ga giant salt block from the dead sea i get it but can we to point out that beallim's a horrifying organization it is a giant grift not only at a giangriftits giant ancy metic grift and in thet giane ani white grift an 's really really bad siin that that this is in turns of t reckor by the way this is the part of his reckor i think that is the worst is the crinal justise reform kind of stoff the idea tha he is gon a jail break amoncs people were criminals but in any case if don trump wants to win he is going to tax tofocus in on the failures of your bidon of which there are many wll get to that in just one second first the october fifteenth

something goes wrong sort of everything goes wrong my frend chon pot horites over the commentary magzine pod taxas thetter of commontary mazing herd book in the early ninetee nineties about the bush junes reel lac taffort in nineteen ninety one nineteen ninety two and one of his basic fesees was that when a campaign is failing everything starts to go wrong all at once and that seems to be happening to jobiden right now whether it is him just wandering around on stage as a camedian shane gillis puts it ut a rumba when yeu serve confused at the end of his species an bumping into things or whether it is what happened last night the biding christmas tree a just fell over the're trying to put it up in a fell over again these sorts of imagures they do not mean anything on their own but they do when the is a general lis sort of feeling of instability and when the cristmas tre represents the acxual presedents of the united states and it falls over again is he in tr is he in charge o weather no the juesare in charge of weather is well now but when when it falls over everybody is immediately flashing to jobi an falling up the stairs i gen't her it her's what look last night and you crit the scruws ocal pasher on is head and you make sure to equal n you stand that tree up and you should be able to walk out of that rom an nowle pull down sadly no one lookin to me estere down gos the prazer fer wha ou i do not know tan you red on the details about the natinal cra traw which bluor in a a well e iig or what hers to think be did not put understand be plant of it that is i ri on e il on e l there they are traing tob poet back up again and it is are these major they are not major things obviously they are silly things but when all the silly things seem to fall in one direction that is a bad sin for the incumbent president of the united states jimmy carter being attacked wives on a bot nineteen seventy nine by rabbit a rabbit la a rabbit rabbit itas t was natural thing that habin apparently well here is the thing is not just that jobidin things are going wrong for him is that of course things are going wrong for him beces not good at the presidenting according to axios evidence is stacking up strong americans ar saving lessin drawng down they are existing savings cushions of course they are because the more you saven an inflationary economy less our money is worth i put a hundred bucks in the bank to day and then my dollar is worth fifty per cent of what it was worth six months from now i've lost money by keeping my money parke instead you are beter off buying things this why you are seeing an axcelerating rate of growths o cue three showed a five point two per cents increasing c d p that sounds amazing right that is great except tha what is actually happenings everybody is prebuying all th materials four cu four in anticipation of the fact the prices are probably in continue to rise we had to holidays according to axios the sherefdolts who savthing cover six monthsof expense is using their savings is considerably lower than was last year accoring to pullig from wornin consul the shure that simplya does not know how long their savings will carry them has grown from about fifteen point five per cent i julye twenty twenty two to twenty one per cent the spending right now is booing the economy but it is likely to crash on the other end and nobodys can have savings cause their anexspent their savings because of the inflation sthat is really bad news agand the economic news yere is maxes this is why people are feeling on tentroks inflation eats everything and jor bidan has not ben able to tame inflation in such way the people feel secure in the economy now all the financial ex per esare expecting that the federal reserve is gan actually decrease the intrestrates in the near future which of course thera lot people waigt is not inflation still running hot right now and the answers yes it is still running hot right now and if you decrease those inflation an the those interest rates then presumably you are going to get new spending you investment and all of the rest of it the bon mark its jumped at this obviously because you'r bon is worth more now than was yesterday if the intrestrates start o stare ta drow with that sed is it any of this good news for jobidn's economy agent thit they are stucks in a rock and a hard place on the actual policy meanwhile the re publicans are starting to go after jobiden again on the impeachment inquiry re publicans are aparently considering holding in official house vote next month to authorise the impeachment in crane to bidon mc carthy initiated it when hu speaker of the house without in actual vote because he did not think he had the votes now giope leaders aoure talking about the possibility of the vote during a closedoor meeting with republican at law makers re publican leaders have long set af vote on the impeachment investigation was unnecessary they are now re considering his white house lawyers are using the lack of the formal house authorisation to argue that the in vestigation lack s constitutional legitimacy the problem of course is that it isnot clear thy got the votes for that that is i've get to see the evidence that mit johnson is significantly better whipping votes then then kem mc carthy was mc carthy was pretty good a dad e's pretty good accounting the heads johnson maybe good at it we just do not know as of yet no matter the the impeachment inquiry on top of jobidons failing presidency is not going to help him it is not and om ind the wite house los naw greater buttle to it here is correnchon pare yesterday trying to goout f republicans for pursuing the impeachn inquiry house re public is ssu really focas on a merican family is n that of the pries family that is what american's wan o see then that is onco that that is hungto cut it nobody bis the folks son american families not on jobidon's family first wall jobiden family is an american family and a rather key american family i will say again i think thet the hunderbidns new tactic is actually somewhat intelligen calling on the house cuoppy to open up the meetings i i thnk he is actually pretty smar because it is basically calling their bluff ye se saying wisten whatever you have to come after me about let us juvesall in front of in front of everybody the house his denied that request jimes comber that at house oversi comitte he said our lawfully issue supenad a hunter by nd requires him to apear for s aposition on desember thirteen wexpect full cooperation with our sipen of for a deposition we also weree hunt terby should have the opportunity to testify in a public setting at a future day typically house kennells insist on a privates epposition before allowing the public appearance the generoo six select committe tod ni several questions testfi publicly including one from rudy juliany jim sjorden for his parts aid sure we love to have hunter in for an open hereing first when yed to have in testify behind close dorst we can ask him all the questions who ant ask him and those facts are confirmed by some of the evidence we have un covered already already this ten twenty three form we are the confidential human sorce told the et te ien was recorded in this form that those are the key facts that now it is important we got allow thers key facts when we interviewed one of hunter biden's business partners mister archer it is important we talk to the others we nee t talk to eric chirman we need to talk to rob walker we need to talk to tony bobolinsky and we are in conversations with their lawyers that we think there is a gone to happen and we need to talk the jimbiden who was also in business with hunter bide those things need to happen in then as the chairman just said as chermac comer just said we will a have hunter bidon in a deposition and frankly i thinkin in an open hearing i think that would be that would be great that is what needs to happen the american people get the facts get the truth an again republicans ae gin ke pushing here none of it is going to be particularly good for jobidon already in just a second we re gn to

a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in todays apisode of the shell if she prefer a beep version you can find that at our web sigt this american life tot work whet my frenacar was a kid growing up in as rol his mamma tolma story every night befor ye went ta sleep bereas almost always astory that should invant write that on the spot never read a many children's book and for my mam they the idear of e telling us stories from children book was very much kind of a ordering a piece instead of making us he deaner it would means that she does not lavus inough somas every night it was a custom mad story with fine camels or a room thet people wuld walk in to and lose the power of speech and also the wother made up things but always ecar says the details and feelings in the stories echoed whatever was going on in acar's life that particular day acarsman a did tes frt card because her parents ha done it for her when she was little girl in poen normor or to during war time the greatest gift that she gos to from her parents word the stories that they told her because the could not give her foold they could not give her close thet could only tell her stories and they would put always a lave and knowledge ind imagination in me those stories would be amazing and she would tell me that when they would begin the story she would be fraid that she for sleeping the meede and then if she first leepin the midle they would never finish the story basically nobody will know how the story in i canda grew up about the a dears that a story was kind of a hug or ate t would just something that you give for share wi somebody t you lavelat after that a ecar grb to be a short story writer hes ecar carriet as ot ta books there were a times that his mother would not invent a story but tell him some story from her past and he got those to as a kid a acar had a favorite that he would ask her to retell more than any other story and thes story takes place a in the very beginning of the war escaping the little town the levening escaping ra for the german's arrile efor the ejears in the story aars mo mister's five years old she remembered her mother wholding her hand n carrying a baby brother and se running as fast as they can you knows e running in running and running an ol the people of the viliger or the town a running in front of them in everybody's much faster than my mother whose little chard and her mother who is carrying a baby basicaly if ich a race ther are defen fom the last place but but wy mam kind of sees a up the head of them somethings that they looks a big grandfather clock that seems to be moving wa mat somebody is carrying a grandfather cock with them as their flin aparently there was somebody who was carrying it on the back but for my mam from the distancee just look kind of a cartoon a carturn as from where they were behind whic e sees is the fog rit wahich a feet sticking out underneath a triging along and then an arm pooking out on either side thand it kind of amuses her because she is lity chatting and even when she told me about that yo know many man years after that i use it when she woul tell the what she would always laugh and and it also amused her that she was in middl out of town running and she could tell what the time was tevery second which is something that is amazing when you were five year old out in the contry to have e cloks hat would tell exactly wat the time you do not have to a ask your many do not hev to ask anybody for her it is fin their flaying and she is not feeling danger she is just thisis kind of fan y e but when the the got closer to the cloak she could start hearing the man gasping the man who carried this cloak on his back because i parently the cloak was too heavy and she said that just tas the were bout to reach him she the man cullops flat on his face with the cloak on on top of him o my go and an my mother wanted to stop to check was with the sguy but her mother said wet to run with to run we do not have time ind and the ran a little bet more and then her mother said lecent thes no way we goin escape the germans a i only chance as if we going to a cabbage fill she was cabbage fied on the side of the road and hides her until they pass and they the went into the cabbage filled and lie down but as soon as they lie down the filld her baby brother begins crying and my grandmother my mams mother is afraid that he knows because of the sound the germans would come she started breast feding him and they my mother said tha that this moment were her mother breast fis e her kid brother she said that tha theisguy were kind of blue and she was in the feeld han she was lying on her bag everything seemed very normal for a sacond thae's moman in the story i garl his love even as lottle boy what time cannot stops n wors stops anit is marm and her mrm and e brother just there and then she shadow and when she raised her eyes she a german soldier with a wrifle in the hand looking at her and at her mother who was breast fedding and baby and there was something at ta it i guess at tis kind of strange seem that they effect that the soldier and the soldier basically looked at them but whe then that as if he was looking fhrugh them as if he was not things them even he was very close and then after a few seconds she just cant turned his back and left as if he was escaping and and i guess from prespective of five years oad she really really felt that her family inde say mather was able to win against the nances her baby brother was cut enough her mother was motherly enough she was sisterly enough and the sguises were blue enough that the soldier suddenly remembered that she knows that he had a human sidhe to and he could not take t she would talk about the sodier as if he was running away it was not as if he desided to leave rasent ly aftrall this years smonmen that a littl while now i coust tried to write about her n we got to writing this story about e cabbage patch for the first time he says he realized just how close they all came to dine he really had never hit him before the way his mother always told the story it was from a kid's point of view tht ther was no sense of danger in er even hiding on the field that seeme whan kinef children's came i did not see do not make any noise when the soldier appears is jus some man standing there makes the story is tricking figure ot how to towl e cannot have to choose between describing in o the reality of the war the menacing reality and his mother's reality mi she often does not understand or notice any other eccer i should say writes a lot about is family that whole book about his dab but e says he is always found it impossible to write about his mal for mente reasons actually oti one big one that 's nothing to do with the wor at all but who she was the thing about my mother is that a that he si e god has many names writes his avengeance for god and merciful god then i tinks it my mam headte kind of thing that if i life is a holy would movy she is maryan wessite story but she is also wa tannols in the avengers mathel universe she is she i and when you would meet her it would be kind of i donnot superenegy supercompassion superagression she had tes cand of thinks if she wanted to say something she realt in curer what any one would say but for example when she wanted to listen to vagne you knowin it the times when in es read you well not suppose to listen to vagna who was known as a anti samite and who is lavd by natses you knows an my mother said it is my home and thats the mon music it i and i do not care if natsis seme knows ay the apis too and i sti et apples and she she did not care she she just theed her own thing i as capable of very extreme action that was hard not to want to leave out some of the most agrassive parts of her ad was hard for him to get her cross and haway he saer and i felt very strange that an i had this books that he had e ife as a writer but he could not mick her out had a read about his own ma and then he sturted drafting these little fragments short stories orer just three or four paragraphs mn tiny stories and were dozens of them tot this museuman bowan a wonee to crabrate with them most of the stories did not amountomach thit started and stop and go nawhere and crompled up copies of these incomplete discarded stories antete est part of the exhibited i mad but the stories at work i read them a fee months ago and they just killd my an some on o sharp pottle shards of stories that tegether capturesnn complicated

was in kin ther god i remember lying under the cavas in my pijamas when madam set on the edge of my bed and relae the story we spride soon after the germans occupied polan she told me one of my mothers non jewish neighbors began toloperateon wit the natses he was a shortman we black her and the lage knows as my mother said he looks a carricator fe ju and he took advantage of thes toposes one we shalowd in to uncover the hiding places used by his jewish neighbors and turns te mean after the germans foreto the juse to move to the voseo geto mom and her family no longer sotes neighbor wos thos they continue to hear orific stories about his informing on people one morning my mother and her father wolked out of the g i tok with he simple pland they would buy a loaf of bread on the black market sending thi viduals flices in the getto to caver ther course and keep a couple of pieces for the family this smack out and woked down the streets of orso with outwearing the yellow stars that old jews had to wor this was extremely dangerous but since her father was blowned with blue eyes and she was fair heard tew they hoped they would not rais any suspicion unfortunately in the crowded town square ser ran into their old neighbor the informent who did not think twice before grabbing my grandfather by the shirt corlor and yelling jews jews my grandfather tried to break free but he realized that even if he could they would instantly be surrounded by passer by whowould never let them escape he looked at my mother and geve her wink meant to reassure her or at least to make sure she knew that even in this terrifying moment he was thinking only of her then he grabbed the neighbor by his corlar and shouted jew jew i caught a jew the crowd looked owning confusion at the two men my told fer herd grandfather and the shot black haired neighbor who looked according to my mother's description a bit me cratching each other's clothes and screeching jew within second a few people fell on the neighbor pinned into the ground and keicked him in the head and body until he was dead and that was your grandfather declared mam with a smale and stood at before leaving my room she leaned over kissed my forehead and said swittering story number to razor when i was a child my mother hagged me all the time orl mother hags er kisalat i know mut my mother hugged me more than a that i liked it but over time i began to notice that when she touched me it was always with the back of her had never the palm wone evening at thad time my mam finished telling my story and then stroked my face with the back of her hand ma'm i asked her how come all the other mams touched this i demonstrated the caress with the palm of my had i knew the only one who touches this i demonstrated again with the back of my hand mhen mother smiled and kissed me on the forehead when i was little she said i did not have a home you do only an openage and the piper ter some of them did not always wont to be good to me to be on the safe side i stuck a piece of gam to the palm of my hand and i loached the razo blade in the gam she showed me how she stuck the gam to her hand and then inserted an imaginary blade into that invisible gam when she finished she held the back of her hand to my face and caressed me gentle this she whispered is how i touched the people i liked and this she let the palm of her hand hover binny itters from my face without touching i is how i touched the once i did not much the palm of mam's hand was close to my face that i could fill it wos the play did not touch me but i knew it was her pam of the hand bag of the hand untin that evening i never knews ther was different a ca you told me that that one an things you mant be careful baut as you done won a over emphasise your mm's experience in te war a explain that explain why well i think that ti thr was something about i my parents that they felt that the moment that ter was seen a holoco survivers they were kind of losing something at this moment that they became less of an individual and more of i do not know a simple my parents really really dislike that i felt for my mam that the moment that she was seen as te holoco surviver it would be little bit a wild horse that they it was as if they natces a branded her she cannot take this fing offer but the moment that she could be tis ay funny red headed woman who reads a lat and enoughs to dance and who had happened to be in the horocose this was her victory a cal cinse without a mind but may we should stel summerise very quickly what happened her in a word just to cet westoners the general sense i know her family died tha am the chaned up in concentration camp no my mammay ey ws with her parents in the wors to geto and later ther would transfer to another ge to coming to the end of the wor she was the toto on her own and thy kind of running from one hiding place to another trying to cet food from where she could than hidin no mmamy muden was never in hiding i isag the way that she survived was more kind of mingling with the polish pretending to be anunjew and my mam told me that during the wor it was much easier for children to move around an they and to smuggle things then grown ups because usually would not ask them for idea and and it would be more difficult to defranciate them especially my mam that they did not look very jewish and that they she was they not only fluent with polish as the first language and not isedish many other jews but thy she spoke fu in german how did she spig german that yan when the wor started ey the first fing her father did was e to teach her german and he said to her is at the moment you can communicate wish people i it makes it more difficult for them to dehumanize you he felt that this would be something that could save her life tere you tell me astray about her on a bredge just tell that sti there is more than one but i i'll tell the one aand if you do not it i pay another one a gay a ca e one day when she left the geto a a on some smuggling mission she took a a her little bagbak she would usually get breaden than put it in the bakbak and as she was wolking in the streets of for ay a german soldier grabbed her empty bakbak and when she came to take it from him she just kind of a free to another soldier and they started kind of a to tounting her not not giving her the bgba and basically my mam was e about nine years old outside of the geto if somebody would catch her she would be shut on sight a ete jew escaping the geto and as they were foring the beg peck from one to another she is and assess officer she ran to the officer and spoke to in polecting germany she said the excused mister officer but ey can you help me ther two soldiers here who ar this respect me and t iste not acting the way a soldier should act and tey she brotestes officer witdom and she shouted bos tose soldiers an they gave her the bagbak the sericest amazing that she had the presence of mind that young yea i think i think tit the waythed she said says it it is kind of my lad grandfather he trained her and she would qro to all kinds of things that my grandfather would teach her when she was in the geto one of the thinger that she said people camt look inside you they can never know how hungry you are but if you dirty the seet in a second for example she told me that pat of of her surviving e outside of the getto was thi se deer that she she made a point of being extremely clean even when there were no means of being clan and and all ll he life my mother looked somebody on vog magazine caver always with maycap and everything in place it is this i dear that you can carry yourself and show your confidence and if you do that then the chances that the word would trampled you become slower storinumber three fabric before i was born my mother worked in advertising she invented slogans produced commercers and barg into with newspapers over the ad prices she rea loved it but it was the demanding jo and she wanted to devote as much time as possible to her kis when i was a baby she quit and opene the fabric stor it was called fabric basement and it was in a basement with no windows she chose it because of the location a cross the street and a yeu dose down from our apartment it was damp and dark and a little masti but everything inside the store was decorated in good taste mom use to take me with her to work every day and put me on the counter in the bassinent i grew up listening to her stern pronouncement on questions of cleavage and rives and closely watching the eager women who ented the dimly leat basement to search for the perfect fabric and cat for the dress of the dreams when i think about it now i see my mother hoisting heavy rows of fabric arand in that narrow dank space i know it was hard work and did not pay much but when i was lattle the fabric basement seemed to me a sort of secret kingdom where my mother rained suprem her subjects came to her with her hopes and dreams and she the queen mother proclaimed which options made them look thinner and which fatter what was flattering and what lookd cheep she spoke with no hesitation or excessive politeness just as the queen should and the women kept coming to ar lit tle side certain ramagan from all over the country that my mother could flip fhree the staks of bruda magazin that rpied nature y on the counter and select the paterns that would eccentuate er advantages and con seel everything else not every one can be beautiful on told me once but if you make an effort and you do not give up you can always be less ugly story number for rain day it happened eleven years ago my wife shela my son leve and i got up at seven am she al was making a toon of hi sand which for live we'r just started first grat lev and i stood by the window looking out at the rain and i explained in a fatherly tone he would have to stay home and play with me in mon to day instead of going to school because it was raining leverecev these news joyfully shela not much what do you mean is not going to school she asked sharply if training i replied pointing outside she i wanted to know when it rains you do not go to school i explained os she could do was repeat my words when it rains yo do not go to school i nodded o ka she said and who made that rule we had very few rols when i was growing up we had to be polite to our parents we had to bive a coing to every homeless person we in the street if some one elderly got on the bass we had to offer them our seat and we could not go to school on rany days the reason according to my mother was that we ougd you respect for school di did not teach anything important enough to be worse getting wait for my mother lost her parents at the very youngage which is why as she explained to my siblings in me she never learned how to be a mother girls learned how to be mothers from their own mothers she said every girl watches her mother to see how she raises children but i did not have a mother for long enough to learn everything which is why i have to in't provise now if you see me doing something you do not think he tat grat you should always tell me i was very please to remy mother says that and on the few occasions when she impose the rule or a demands that i found unfair i always told her and she really did reason but as from staying home from school when i rained i was completey on board with that sadly sher as childhood was not as magical as mine and let had to pay for that the proogid grabbed an umbrella and went to school i ra yes i e i wul just wondering this next story if yit is not it it does not feel kind of bit strange it is that you get those short pieces and then suddenly a very long one and there is no something before it i do not know li can are as stoking go music or i don' kno o well ther wonly the thing i gas before thes thing that your saying right now i do not know youre yourd a rad your gife if you think it to work i'd i dea aboso a here is that story story number five you never forget he smell at malamentary school thewere always fights as at was just fine with me it was routine the fights always followed the same patern first cursing then pushing then choking ind kicking and till one of the keits yelldancer and then it was over everyone would head to the corner store for chocolete milk or popsicl nothing had happened in other words no one school was ever afraid of a little fist fighting but every one even the strongest mian a skits was afraid to get in a fight with ta mill tha mil was a year ahead of me he was not big and he was not very mascular either but whenever he got into a fight with someone in the school yard ol the keids to gather to watch wre overcome by a turrible sense of the spir because they knew a fight withta mill never ended with chocolete milk and a popsicl at the cona store best casin arial tha mill one and some one an the dap in the emergency room worst case he lost and the fight went on forever not a single ki thet school ever im surrender kis much storrers and him were already shaving would pin into the ground for hours hurt him humiliating fedin sand but a mill would still be cursing and making frets as the fight wore on we all new that no matter how plainly and painfully the ade kit was winning the second he let go tha mill would be up in a shut and chasing him down with the rok a meter rod or whatever weapon he could find if a teacher or another grown up tryd to interven they would ged clabbered too buttam line if anyone had asked me when i was ten years old what i was most afraid of in the word i defen'tly would have said ta mill every wednesday after school i would meet my mother at the grocery store and help her carry the bags home she would wait outside the store dressed a quin in a dress or twenty suit she always wore lipsticks that matched the color of her dress o scarf and the fashionable had perched on her head crown as i walked along busy dirty beadic street beside her loded wish grocery begs i thought she looked a stabborns in the rella one who insisted on remaining a princes even after the clock struck midnight and everything turned back into a pump kin our apartment building was at the top of a hill and always got sweaty and out of breat on the way up with old the groceries sometimes i asked for a rest tab which man would used to smoke a cigarette one day on our break we heard a strange howl i souded cats siel mixed with h human sab the second my mother heard this peculiar sound she tos a cigarett on the sidewalk and started quickly marching up hill i the direction the noise was coming from i picked up ol the begs of groceries and tried to keep up with her wefore i'd even reached ar building i could seet a mill standing on the side wor waving a stick over his head at his feet lay yack a bot for my class wo leave the cross the street from us and when ta ml something on the deck with the stick aky wimpered she barly moved i was completely paralysed but not my mother she marched over quickly on her stilettos ta mill ignoder and lended another blow on yackis back my mother grapped a mil's arm with one hand and his her twith the other the mil try to ricget out of her grip swerring and blastering let me go wi scren let me go right now i'll flut you up you beitch terrified i looked at my mother she did not seem to understand who she was dealing with i sent the mill stab a teacher with he compass and for a brick at the principle and i knew exactly how this would en my mother would eventually have to let go and then all hell would break lose i wanted to say something to warn her but i did not kno exactly what to tell her the only goold advise i could give her about ta mill was not to mess within but it was too late for that madam twisted ta mill's arm behind his bag which made him drop the stick yacky was stell on the ground just wic you bitch the mere hist i'll tell you a new one my mother looked at him coldly and signalled for me to come closer i move toward thim dragging the grocery begs and stop the few steps away that seemed crlose enough but madam beckined me to come closer it is all right she said in a reassuring voice do not be afraid he will not bite i took a few more steps until i was standing within spitting distance of tha mill's weaty face lev me alone i screeched let me go i wat you s madam said still using her soothing voice in a minute as soon as you listend to what i have to say the me stop talking and turned to my mother with an expectant look do you see this boy my mother asked and she held ta mill's face close to mine this is my son now take a deep sniff good you never forget a smile the mil's face was very an ange away from mine i was close that i could see the blad vessels in the wites of his eyes as he gave me a manycing look and this madam said turning ta mill's head toward yacke who managed to sit up on his knees is his friend yacke as far as i'm concerned this ho on neighborhood is yours axcept this to you can heat by stab steel anything you but if you much as tauche them if i tach them then what the mil said with the chinning smin you call the cups i've had the caps cald on me ten times the police gat for bid madam said s have more important things to worry about she draged tha mill over to the big dampster next door building if you tauch my son or yacke il kilyou and then i for your body into this tratshkin she was pulling ta mill's her now making n look right into the dampster and the next morning a track will com and wemove your body with the tress and buried far far away and no one woill even come looking for you or try to find out what happene because no one will mis him as a child you quickly learn to identify when your parents are making empty frets and when they mean what they sail madam stone the catch almost bord was her ordinary voice the one i recognized from conversations with the ladies at her fabric show or people she ran intone the street and within second i stopp being scared that tha mill would break re and bit us up and startat being scired that he die my madam put her face right up to tomells and he looked at her why died you might be a bullyto me but ye not stupid na i wanted to look at me very closely and tell me whether i'm lyind or if yets reelly going to happen ti ma kept staring at my mother as if ye were hipintises and after a pause ye said almost sein a whisper i promise you me sciret i never touch them very good said madam and let go thing i knew you were a smart boy they stood facing each other for some time at teve year old boy in the school unit form and en le to room an in a red dress in the high heels madam slowly lifted her hand and caressed the mere swety her very good she repeated softly now that e clear on everything we should go home it would be darg soon nd it is ketting cold at ca yes i think all the stories that you told far your madam as the hero and i wonder other stories where ye felt embarrassed for her she embarrassed ye or she is not the hero an that way for first owhal i think that she was inherently the hero and fighting for things but i cannot say that you knows that some times the she she would protect her laved one the little be too much i remembers tat when my father a was dying from canswer she had a room all alone in the hospital and my dead was was a heavy smoker he died from me smoker's canswer and he used smokin this room and you noted out it ot to smoking the hospital and i remember one time that the a woman a kand of enterd ta room and she said im ia somebody smoking here because i can smell smoke and my mums ad know i i cannot smell anything and the won woman left the room and returned after five minutes an she said i'm shos at somebody' smoking here and my mum said i do not kno i do not see anybody smoking how are you sure and the woman left and then she return the first time and she said do not write to me i know that there is somebody smoking in this room and my madam looked at her with eye scold eyes and said to her in english go too hell and can o slammd the doo in her face and and o i was there and it was very embarrassing ththe woman ever opened the door again but ther was a barrassi it was very embarrassing i mean i mean a thinks that they my madam many times over reacted i get that but but i'm out just pint out that i asked her for a story where she is not the herol and in the stoy she stell the herou ye you are right you are wright a but i think that e also i something that had to do with her carisma that that i mean hero feeling we can ogur about it a but a she was a main character she was smacked there in the center thet say if we would wait for a doctr and there would be twenty people in the hole then i would sa for al to five times before we get to the do to it would be she would kind of goter round my mother and she would tos en i tell you what you should tell your wife come here shet next to me i explained to you oh what the should not eat for deaner but the she would com become some this istant a gu e gure ye she

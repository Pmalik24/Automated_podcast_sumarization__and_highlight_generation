from w b s chicago is this ameri can lie from yr class what of our prettysers conichoffhe walt has speen few years reporting on the history of one school it is a public school in a big city and thethe beginning cono thought the story was about segregation and in equality in public schools but the more she spoke to people a research what had happened at this one school the when she realised it was actually about the inordinate amount of power that white parents had at this one school and she found many stories saiy that we realized we could not fit at all into one episode of our programmin that we wed e relased is its own little many series podcast last wee a little three minute trailor was rugys the name the show wis nice white parents and even before the first episodes appeared it became this war thousands of ratings and comments on wine at apple pod cass people saying it is devisive that it is races to talk about white parents giving the show one star reviews other people giving it five star refews to cancel out the one star reviews remember nobody had heard the show yet commens were about some imagined thing that people'f thought that the show would be rather thn the actual story that conatells which is you no ccount of funny i think it also speaks to how the entire subject freeks people had much white parents how rarely that is explicitely named as the subject of reporting there is much reporting when people of color as people of color and little reporting on white people as white people even when teree the heart of a story as theye are with this one and when you listen a what hont of found you feel horeritis i personally found it eliminating you can whison and judge for yourself to day we are presenting right here one of the stories at hon o tells in her series about one of the big turning points in the schoolds recent history ah before we started on a note everything you can hear this hours recorded before cron of iris arrived it is a world were people you dont get together person with no mass or anything do not be shockd are not here is one i sterted reporting this story at the very same moment as a turn of figure out my own relationship to the subject of the story white parents in nerc city public schools i was about to be one of them when my kid was old enough as started learning about my aptions and many there was ore is owned public school and brooklan ere i could apply to a handfull of special t programms i gifted programm or magnet school or language programme serd to look around this was five years ago now but i vividly remember these tores i'd show up in the lobby of the school at the time listed on the website look around and noticed that all or almost all f the other parents her'd shown up for the eleven a m middle of the workday early in the shopping season school tor were other white parents as a group we would walkd the halls following a school administrator almost always a man or woman of color there was school full of black and brown kids we would peer into class frm windows latched the kid sit in a circle on the rug ask questions about the lunchmen homer policy discipline some of us would take notes and the administrators would sell the whole thing was essentially a pit we of fer stem we have a partnership with linkin senter we have a dance studio they were pleading with us to please take part in this public school an not think have ever felt my own consumer power more visorly than i did shopping for a public school as a white parents we were entering schools that people us had ignored for decades they were not our places but we were being invaded to make them aurents the whole thing was made much more awkward but the fact that nobody on those towards ever acknowledged the obvious racial differents that roughly a hundred per son of the parents in this group did not match say ninety per cent of the k ids in this building i remember one time being guided into a classroom and being told that this was the class for gifted kids and noticing oh here is wer all the white kids are every one oe our tor saw this all of us parents but nobody said anything including me we walked out into the hallway amom raised her hand and said i do have one question i've been meaning to ask and the group got quiet i was thinking o ka here comes but then she said do the kids er play outside every day i knew the schools were sagregated i shouldn have been surprise but the time i was toring schools as a parent i'd spend a fairamount of time in schools as a reporter i done stories on the stark any quality in public education and i'd looked at some of the many programs and reforms we have tried to fix our schools many ideas we have tried standardized tests and charter schools we have tried smaller classes longer school days stricter discipline looser discipline tracking differentiations we have decided the problem is teachers the problem is parents what is true about almost all of these re forms is that when we look for what to broken for power schools our failing we focuss on who their failing poor kis lack kids and rown kids we ask why are not they performing better why are not they achieving mor thools are not the righte questions here is a powerfol force that is shaping our public schools arguably the most powerful forse it is there even when we pretend not to notice it thi gone that school tor if you oneto understand whire schools are not better that is where ye have to look you have to look at white parents that is what this story is about a'm going to take you inside o public school building and utterly ordinary scuat three story near city public school building not too far from where i live this is not one of the schools i tord and my own kids do not go here they are too little this is a middle and high school called the school for international studies as i sk the story of this school and it is relationship with white parents down the block spand sixty years but the prart i wone to tell you begins it as i ask and the spring of two thousand fifteen rite before everything at the school changed in two thousand fifteen the student it us i ass were blck lettye know and middly stern kids mostly from working class an poor families that year the year before and the year before that the school was shrinking the principal jillan juman was worried yat a last two years we had a thirty sudents at our sixgreat class and it we really have room for hundred ah numbers i think ah or hard miss trumon started to reach out to families from the neighbourhood invating them to please come tic a look parents are to showing up for tors of es i ask mostly groups of white parents miss druman was thrilled and relieved she watched parents through the building sayings thought me any time if any one has any questions weally anything and want you to feel comfortable an miss trumont says they did have questions mostly about the poor test schoors that was fair mis truman expected those questions she did not expect the other set of questions she got a lot from parents is there weapons is there are you scanning are you was scanning school because kigor daingeress though i've weapons i've heard that there 's arring metal detective riht i heard thes fights and to those kinds of things i do not i do not know what school our talking about i have never heard of that incident ever happening ever the fears of what this building is and what this filt building has represented ah has come transiented itself we all late week w t there is a different story of international studies outside the sfuilding how much of that yo think is racisem i think our entire society is fearful of the unknown excellent principol answer principal jumn is black by the way she needed these parents schools get money perstudents a shrinking school means a shrinking budged miss jumnnas worried if this continued the middle school could be in danger of being shut down by the city as i sk is in coble hill brooklyn leefy streets brown stones it is a wealthy white neighborhood that is gottin wealthier and whiter in the last egate but white families were not sending their kids as ass tmiss juman told these parents shos as i ask were turning things around were in the process of bringiin a new prestigious international backaloria crreulen renovating the library here is the new gorgeous yard it is an excellent school the parents seemed interested but i believe that might have had just as much to do with what was happening outside of the school as what they were seeing inside the building sure some onames rob hanso an im a apparent we were the middle school processes o interesting ro lives near by as i ask but he had never heard of the school i know problin his district rob could choose from a leaten middl schools whe majority of white families sent their kis to the same three schools rob's wit those were the schools he' heard of and those were the schools he tord os wa but they were pacts ools there were tro many wealthy white families in the district to continue cramming into just three schools there is a couple of city wid once were we want we stood on lyine for an hou an hou to have and thand joined in an an auditorium full of parents and then had them announce that they were excepting fifteen students in the following in the coming class and they would been running towards all day most cities have some amount of school choice this tors an options near city though is an ampd ub version of what happens elsewhere the level of competition the level of wealth the diversity of people sorting into different schools everything is more intense rob found this process fresh trating although rob is very even tempered even when he is frustrated his canadian when he gets especially hot he starts calling things interesting and this whoolmiddle school thing was very interesting he asked of their parents on school trs what ar we get a de some one said have you ges heard of as i ask that building down the block rob had not the others had not they decided to all go chick it out together i walked away lot's parents wack toway from this tors thini wa people jamming up into some schools and and your your leaving sixtyr seventy sees empty empty all your long you thirty kids a does not that is you spread them out around and that is a big school than all the sudden your sort of likeuage second wats there is nobody here tas rob tord as i as he had an idea that night he emilled principal juman and he asked would she be opene to starting a dual language french programm at as i ass they had one at the elementary school rabs kids went to and everyone loved it sure principal jurmann was open robs thered ed spreading the word as i as is starting a dual language french programm we should all go robsays there was interest but a lot of people he talk to had this question wet are other people going an tht sanlys had that kind of fere what if im youkow if i look around nobyhas came with me and a and i came for something at's not here because nobody soi's a collective action problem we wise a collectiva why white you need to collectiv ah just an the just i think over all there is a collceted action is hou o but if you are interested in this an part because of the french toa language part of it am if if you are the only one to show up there is no french teacher for once to but there is a prograv if fifteen com if twenty cop but we all have to then take one step forward exactly the same time the vision requires people to come and what afe nobody cops when it came time to choose middle schools parents were supposed to rank their top chices rate before they did before every one chose their schools rabsont to survey out to the families he would been talking to to try the in sure that a group of them would choose as i ask together it was a simple survey monkey if enough people cid yes they rank as i ask as one of their topticks and they would be able to act as a collectid people said yes the numbers were stunning and two desn't fourteen there had been thirty six graters at as i ask and two doesen fifteen there would be a hundred and three that two hundred percent increase was almost entirely wak kids did you think about yourself as in tegraters or did you think aot my pause was because i was tryni think ap if that hat con tro line did not no no the am not intigrators am por dispent in t e school that was gwichkin postly be diverse am but thet not i that is not a framing or way o thinking about that it would have occure to me the time am nobody i talked to from ass i ask characterize what was happening there as integration the cures why in tegration was on my minds the near city department of education was aware their schools were sigregated it was also aware that these seggregation is the most effective way to close the gap an achievement between black and white studens but it did not want to mandate ratial integration through zoning or school placements the city was trying to make integration happened through choice hoping to lure white families into seggregated schools the school tours i went on for my own kids tho sparkley programs and a menedies that was the new approach to integration but can this work for white parents to ot in to integration not because we have to or because it is the right thing to do that because it is a selling point because we get a danc studio and stem and a school that was hopefully diverse intogration without talking about race the kins at sa s o the did tike abot i immediately a two thousand fifteen the first few weks of school a senior named christon mans over to her class make cress and mumbles they are at a wat kits in the school and chris says oh ye a teacher warn me about that over the summer but ye todme ol ther to gon be a lot of whit kits coming an french wike kids from i per economic statisis woul prepared for that christen nods yei gess we were pared and then she turns to me to say i should have been ready for that we saw the parents on the tours last year s woa the molk tho the hall bu we never new was serious hat a whole group of cockas would comin ofll be s divers but whose take such a big change i that is a bein prejudics i thing that i notice the big change hih schoolis are more hisparics an baks with tha few coccasions i make the new gu that came in all coccasions tate they tri to me diverse diversethis was a word i heard over and over in the first few weeks of school diversity i love diversity saw that it does not whul i ti see other whiis om diversity seemed to have two different definitions wat familis would talk about all the diversity it as i ask and they were talking about black in his pannic kids when kids of color noted the diversity they were referring to the new wat kids for lati kids a color this looked alot something they would already seen happen in their neighbourhoods white families showing up in large numbers taking over stores familiar spots there is a word for that it is gentrification but i notice that no one was using that word about the school what was happening here was diversity that is how the adults talked about it dhiversity is a good thing something you are supposed to be o paywes for the most part the kids work it was different for the parents some of them a specific advantages to the diversity kania blunt the co vice president of the ptiet as i ask he was excited having the new parents coming in in the diversity that pirceclarly becomes from the the newas i'll call the new neighbourhood we ofe interchanging in the neighbourhood im is that we have a gentleman who his profession is fun raisin rob hanson the dad who started the survey monkkey rob rais's money for non profits and foundations for a living over the course of the year all her rob hanson referred to as tod hanson tad manson mister hanson cania was the only on who went with the gentleman whose profession is fund raising the most common was just the guy who gets the money rob told the ptier he was eager to raise money for the school te kenia this meant more resourses at his own kids school his boys and all the kids could benefit she has brought on tha challenge of takeit upon himself to raise fifty thousand dollars i'm five zero with freezeros after it yes fifty thousand dollars am which againsa a gain goes back to the whole i'll say a diversything new people were thinking outside the box as our ptir i d'n't think that we were thinking that big they were definitely not thinking that big because the pter was run by i mean her nandas and her col president susan mostcar i me is not a gentlemen who fund raises she is a social work arget the first time i ment i me she was wraing at teachers that said i'm not spoiled my husban just loves me that way she is porterekan grew up in brooklyn her husband marice is porteragan and black and really does adore her he grup an brooklyn to the have one daughter one pitfall one persian cat and one school i make it my businessess stick myself in her schofor ime the new diversity he gave her pads what i shall in septtember the population that came anothi oh that is a little frighten and even the sollshu hs spatit ah radioin knowin ah i shaw lot of white people with very high shillshie social economic backrounds they have money and that is great but money tends to scare people and i'm one of the people at scarce i'm one of the people atscage because twists everything around nd i dn't thati do not th i do not that am i'd rather have a dinner were people of different cultures bring their food and we share together then have somebody else cater that is how i feel you build community of a solcial worker tat's my background and that is what i believe in i me was in her second year at the school the year before she put on community events teacher appreciation a spring carnival with face paning and hot dods they raise the money here and there but i means vision for the ptier was not really about fund raising the new parents though they wanted to be active in their new school and they were accustomed to supporting their kids schools by fund rising the two approachis c imface to face at a ptie meetin in october three more menut ar an then s te every gre yes y yo yall a ti a a hole its e gaga hole there bet a dozen grown ups sitting on small classic chairs around a classfrom peable the ptier executive cord principal juman is he or to i meas leading tnd the principal o jumps in she says she wants a minute to share how much the new fund raising committee had raise far i may looks confused principal jumn goes on to say the new funderies and committee is had a lot of success the toal they they have raised a cordin to rob bot eateen thousand dollars ah and then we just had a donation from a family a cople wes ago more to te anatimous ah that they are going to get either five to ten ten grand ind december this is this his big money people seem i'm clear what to do with their faces this is good news riht but us wewhat is the fundrising committee i me turns to her hus band morice a retired cop maurice is ulso the treasurer of the ptier because when he retired his wife told him he could not just sut round at home maurice shrug said i mee does not seem to know anything about this new money saii ma turns back to principal juman really can we use that money questo get a that was of washion of the ptaken a tac to this wenty caus i know already lik but what is the pte o that that is hd a question alegrapses eighteen thousand dollars rob has raised under the umbrella of pter that is principal juman i think but whos whose do not e whosly a anywheres ao in yet ca me i i i ge ne do o no a ba o my o i talin ae a i os ma row maurice asks how can that money be access for mister in a groan who wants new jim uniforms or mistter lob to get his microscopes i mea natns i mn tat goubleas robin more power to ha e but he tat an official member wi i think that would makes it confuw dales for me he is a ptie member because he is a parent e that part of the executive words i think that makes it that is pobli tru he ha makes a tricky i mean in again o ta and they ai mea not he c can mring o money o ri ii know i no principal juman no repeats that she wishes rob had been able to make it she was hoping every one could be here and get on the same page about money but rob is shaperining six greate over night trip their la getting back one mam a wit woman who came in with the new group of six greaters says look i know rob he means well o ie wa he is a professional oneeyet e yes or es rei as he is iitti money wy a bund rasin yot and i think that' great but i do he she cni mo in presses in to and know o nooi he sortof le uwise wy that he is not thinking about we we muy i oy know an asi he really i a i i that is principal juman oat this point every one seems to feel a little weird about how long they 've spent talking about a fellow parent who is not present in anyway it is money for the school were all for that we just een better communication i ma says yet it just usually money ras by parents goes through the ptie we can only talk about were to spend it youa i asid who has to say as if it is a collec e we ther is en a we ro whats an o the room he just got back on the six great trip he sits down and they all sert to talk we need to start out some questions about money then amam from the funderisin committee says has worried about me recording and ask me to stot that i do not binqerst o t a redo mo they let me say though i take notes rab apologizes and then explains a grup of them have been meeting to raise money for the school the new dual language french programm is expensive and they promise the principal they would help raise mney to cover it they were just eager to help rab says they formed a committee he is really sorry he should have communicated and co ordinated better with the ptie but good news sis it is going great some one has a contact with the french embassy a guy at the cultural services arm in new york and h says he wants to help cover the cost of new french teachers and books they have already tick dinneround ten gramd it this point in my notes i wrote lots of looks tbeg money rab says the embassy suggested we do a fund raiser an event they can help here i wrote looks confuse mad nobody really talking i me says this fundraser willd be at the school though right and free for every one rab says yes good good she asks one more time free i just one makesure every one can go los of not rab says totally this is a community ofent for our community after about twenty minutes i my says were out of time guis i cannot tell if this is out of a professional commitment i me has to stick to the schedule or a personal commandment to getting out of that room before i came to ess i ask i never sought much about the role of pties ever and as they has early on i had this feeling of oh a pte's actually critical to the success of an integrated school a pter has a very simple democratic structure every parent hasn' equal vote smart it is ik a builton system to equalize power to help them make a budget together be decision sepriarities collectively or not we are luck ad av we have rob her who has really tak at over fud ris i try to bring it to the next level herto hereat our school collect it is another pte yi ni but and the whole collective thing is not really happening rusote lasit seems the new parents are still raising money separat from the pte and tha communication proms do not seem to be resolved and some of the new parents have an idea the propose a formo separation the pte and the people doing fund raising go rab says this way thered be too organizations collecting money for es a yes thereould be too sortov ways dollars aras one would be a community ras thet sals a direct iv at would be the tter side the community funds then there would be a separate organization that would go after grants and big doners up untill this plain there seem to be tention bubbling under the surface between the new parents and the old parents but it was not really until this moment that the unsaid started to get said mostly by ime's husband maurice i tik lot of was feelsl dis totifing goops the fun rasego impt which is ey know that is what woks lik you got hav to chool o but gi for t gall mall e i go not yo the fint for wi no i se sa where about the rus o school wels mone weare going to i knon't not is very eas to feel t ras that is marine a white ma'm whis new its oir lota nots maurice is asking is this new money you are talking about is it just for the new french to a language programm which is another way of asking is this money just for your kis or is it for everybody rab says emphatically it is for everybody maurice says really you me that tat thas be my you tig okae do eals moin te a fench embersi ego ca w wo by twoltwat tat that ci tat b ni i you sayg the fifty thousand be for ept community to si was wen a go me i hear whac youare saying which is sound great why ga't made not something about last meeting when jilisal e woll we on't get at te cent we stool av matleader talking to rob i learned that the new separate fundraising arm he is talking about is actually a foundation they want a create a school base foundation at as i es the plan as to call it the brooklin world project i asked rob why do you need another way to raise money but there is a there is a pitier most people have heard of a school pitier why do you need a separate organization ats no the pitier yet the probably easiest way to explain it is to not think about it from the school side u to think about it from ah the potential doner side a basic idea t were following is that the the titidnt that internationals as we want to do exstende day and we want a do theatre and we go when we find a downer who loves theatre and loves the french language and loves the idea that kids whoe never spoken french and at no excposure get the chance to go ah an compete actually against some of the most establishe schools in the city and a do not a dis loves ath li goi love it i love giving that kind of opportunity to kis i ma to cover all that because i thing it is that important ah if that money goes to the ptier you could have a situation of ptier says or remembers the ptie say i do not know that we really the theatre programm i'm not sure i think that we should be using those dollars to do exer why or s now normally you beal to say well do not er intend is what it is you should proably use it towards what it was intended for i i normally in another findeys an cin meaning in non profits there is a basic kind of morality of an on profit to say if it do not e gives you it to you to do something you should try to do that do not erintends in important part of it ti for ofthe trust that is established rb says because the piter is a democracy it makes things complicated the very thing i saw as the strength of a ptie one parent one vote to rob that s a problem for fund raising parente come and go and schanged their minds about what is important a private do noter antes tability and rob is trying o raise money for the kind of programming that was available at his sons wealthy elementary school at that school ro was coo president of the ptier and the previous year his pitier pulled in close to eight hundred thousand dollars eight hundred thousand dollars money that paid for after school for gramming and ballroom dancing chast art music a garden eight hundred thousand dollars for a school that is seventy fide per cent waight and serves the tiny fraction of the porkits in the district there arn't enough wealthy parents at us a es to raise thy ken of money that year rob held traise eight hundred thousand dollars the yes they esk pitier raised two thousand rob it was trying to be creativ a foundation was a way for his new school to catch up the school leadership the principal was behind the idea mis temon told me she saw the foundation as a past to equity an access more resources meant they would be able to provide all pids with opportunities say a school trip to francs but the parent leadership they found it annoying i mean new the new parents for trying to help the school but she rity liked the school she felt in she was being saved against her will plas theare new she said should not we be the ones helping them she was fine with them bringing an ideas but she did not understand why they had not brought them to her first they had not thought to consult her she said to me multible times why r they coming up with all these private plans and meeting in secret committees you were pissed about that toldly ye that was involve n me why were you angry about that because here i am trying to build something with the school why did not you just involved me why did not you just tell me about it i flt it was a secret nifer was iffer was not i'm invested in the school clealy hat proven to youm invested in the school and you could not tell us that you wanted to funrase in a different way rob and the new parents did tell the principal that they wanted to fund rais in a different way then i me felt what about the rest of us she felt the pitier was ignored at that last meeting i ma went quiet she told me she just felt enraged and then embarrassed for feeling enraged i guess i just through a tantre and i justed i one of your part of it which is not right but i think again in the moment i just felt i was hart i you throut it was the tantrom thing i saw cas at did not ting a tantrum no now that was not a tantrum i could have been lot worse when i was really really tring to restrain myself ye i really was that was really under control really really untoe control i was not but it was reallyreally inly control i asked was there another time tantre yo had home o my husband that is what toin my dantrum it was tents among the parents but this is a school for children did it matter if the adults were not getting along or who controls which pot of money yes yes it did that is coming up after the brak b b t chicago when our programme continues to smari con li from y re glass to day's programm nice wite parents ho ic off you wat is tolling the story of parents and ther influence over the working one public school apublic school brook wen called s i as the school for in a national studies hot a picks up now i wish you left off the school you re moved forward rob's fund raising committee moved forward with the french embessy to plan the fund raiser it was now being called a gawa the ptier move forward with parent volunteers to pain a spring carnival it was being called the spring carnival quiet resentments halked in place herewas ham is tacking on a phone one night i mes col president on the pitier susan mosker she told me she was worried the school was changing in ways that were damaging to the community susan is whit herself but she did not come in with the new parents when she started her son was one of the only way kids in the school now susan fell they were all being written into a narrative that was not true that as i esk was a bad school before and now that the new white families had arrived it was being turned around it did not nod a uble i think it id something that eten my cild picked u o a ate li a very different it at er pling among hem te idn e a a paren i ad athrill agan ta he a can they our poor struggling chool that adn possibly mak it on a ton without their money in their vision im and we did not all feep at that i early the kate what do you feel a this was a long conversation the upshat sheis not happy but the way the new parents are behaving it was true a new narrative was taking hold at es i ask it felt the kids were talking about it all the time but it was in the air and the kids were starting to pick up on who was value in why in the canvateria i her middle school er saying the french kidts could kill some one and they get away with it upstairs in the high school i hear kids complain all the attention as shifted to the new middle schoolers we are being pushed aside an down on the library i met three six rate boys white boys new to ess a s theire swetdy from plant socker and looking very small against their huge back packs ithese boys even at eleven years old hey have absorbed the same messages that us i yes was not good before m it was a bad school the kage would not pay tention and they had garterlike jon out every little thing and i bet they learned very little and now and now wut yes now this generation with us i think we are doing a lot better and i think that work learng on much faster page he and his friends theve turned the school around that is when he is learning is kennedy woner the top choices already in tee the book when you are aplying to thentll schools you get a book shorters on statuses un suff and i think the schools achually t really high up in the statuses nobody calls it the book on statuses they callit a directory of schools with info in roman numbers for different schools tescores and special programmes but i love they calls it the book on satuses because this is what happened at ess a es the school had a bad reputation among white families and then suddenly it was in demand it is tatus had change because of the white kids e powerful draw for white families into any school is other white families once you have a critical mass of white kids you passed what one city calls a bliss point this is a real thing recercher study how many white kids are needed at a school to make other white families feel comfortable choosing it that number the bliss point is twenty six per cent that fall white families were crowding the school tours at ess a es not because the tescors had improved the newscores had not even come out yet but because the other white families made them feel blissfully comfortable of course the thing that mad the new white parents comfortable coming as they us in the first place was the promise of a french programme they want a french and they got french now all the six seventh eighth and ninthraters ar learning french it was not a true duel language programme were kids learned in french for half the day or whatever that first year most of the french was happening in the after school programme tou sent up for regular after school stuff cullinary or socker drama and it would be conducted in french we aea er y is a wen te at a toriam and it is sweet the kids are on stage were hersing thes play they wrote in french ne'll saik they having fun thut i caldn't help feeling there is something off balance about this most of the kids doing this drama programme seemd to be needev french speakers but not all frenc a six grater named mya

jumone said yes essa s was supposedly an international school but she told me they did not really have a lot of international programming sitching a good idea to her but there was no schoolwide to beat about it or consentsis the community did not decide what if they had more than a third of the families hat as i es are his spanic what if the dual language programme was spanish for arabic ten person of the students speak arabic if they had made a diffrench oice he bessay a had a dual language arabic programme mya would be teaching constants how to read her lines she would be the one explaining the cultural references and teasing her friend about her terrible accent she would be the one translating the teachers stage directions there was money for a french programme which meant that esa es french had value arabic did not spanish did not that is something mya is learning at school along with her french scriptfrom the very beginning i me and the others had insisted on three things from the new parents and the fundrasing committee that the gala fundraser they were planning with the french embassy would number one bhe open to every one number two take place at the school and number three be free then four weeks before the galla the p t e asked for an update and apparent name debb showed up amam to a new six scrater part of rob's fundraising committee i will start with the fact that i had a nice conversation wit b fut missus rese is i frecs in te sgo deb volunteered early on to help organized the parte and she tells every one i met with our partner cu breece at the french embassy and the event cannot bea at the school the embassy will not be able to draw ther supporters to proclamme it will be at the cultural services building on the upper eat side and han forty five minutes away i apologize if i say these you giz ordy now but i didn' know some of the in foso was god wit the event it is really it is ther event it is not really hour obit oh it is ther evet that is susan with the o murice leans forward elbows on the table oi me is not here she knew the meeting would be almost entirely about fundraising and she sitting this one outmaurice is now concentrating on rob who turns to debb and says no in what sense is it there event they make the rules she ss with our imput but there are certain things that are not flexible the biggest thing is nobody will be allowed in at the door you have to be on a list you half ours we p you have to be on the list all mans security ip wit the government building after all he sends out the invitation to twenty two thousand people on his nailing list now making it a free event it is prob l because now inviting twenty two thousand people for free to drink wine and eat food that may not have any interest in us we thought the best thing to do would be a suggested donation can o you are to go verium ton ye that is rob asking to give a varents which is u how about we have a separate invitation for our people that does not ask for any money suesi rab seems to be picking up on the instant irritation in this room and he is adding many variance to deb's report isethera what about version or just a clarity te but everybody in this community she will not ot be one invite it will say the same that is ri suggested i suggested it we alls a wit or outside youen if we simply put cover no and no no charge no we want you to come joon us arkng riht but on the invite it will say suggested donation than a few wan of however we want a forward i we can say that but they will ally do one invite deb has not been able to meek previous pitie meeting all debb knows is she got an emal from the thundrasing committee at our kid's new school which she assumed as part of the pitie she is volunteering her time e tine of her time to organize a huge event she does not understand that the eva li she is on is for a separate fundrasing committee that just became even more unpopular with the official pitier leadersed i think i stopped moving watching deb it is tense she is lake a portutime is just wandered into a balloon stoor the serving wine water and then french or derves as far as the auction ah we have a couple of cleanses we have restaurants we have a socricam we have sufflication rental in celifornia we got a couple har salons very few from the community here that is really what i wanted to talk about i a come the apparent committee or yaeographic community carent comnity and geographic community debb says at her kids elementary school they got all a more donated items from parents she tells the room you can ask at the restaurants you go to if they do give certificats the salon you are employers you be surprised what people can offer they just ask then that is what doi the my friends an miht most my friends ou ou now they are all an other schools i'm just ne he i do not really know many people the only people i've ben able to beach out to it the thirty six on frobs female let us and at end a a quarter of em gaze o donated something a ready thik found something i'm ting tha house in sonoma counties gorgeus for bed room three bat beautiful i think abouter pitie meeting a few months before wherei wech i me gently explaine to one of the new parents why it might be hard for some families to throw in five dollars for class from supplies that even being asked to dony can feel alienating we have alos some people in this room seem to be experiencing this whole thing as a routine uptit about public school volunteering others look someone who is walked into the wronging room and if now looking around the friends they came with for afformation we are in the rong room ray how do we get out its usually get whar tickets to shows games things i've gone broadway tickets but i have not got anything in that ticket orina nex am have a count o of the nets li went to retol yes a they always go everybody wants to go to a game is always somebody and they also make great christmas gifts and that is the other thing were we are lacking his actual items am west have a pana whell we sell the parentbut i'm son my school am there were to tifany and we always had beautiful tifany pieces ar coach bag some products makes it look nice it is been a small shunk of that meeting occupied by an admittedly sentimental thought just looking around the room was kind of incredible people with homes and senoma and people who live in public housing sitting together at a long wooden table in the library of e public school that they all share that never happens and i did not want them to mess it up but of course they are this is not something we have a lot of practisins new york city has one of the most saggregated school systems in the country white prens here have very little practise sharing public schools maybe this is all to be expected white arents will charge ahead will sometimes be careless secretive or entitled in response parents of colour will sometimes be cautious or distrustful defensive these are well established patterns repeated over generations it is easier for us to continue operating on separate tracks because it iswhat we already know how to do the gui from the french embassy apparently has a mailing list of twenty two thousand people in the new ork aria three hundred people are as rupe to the gala for essi ask i could not believe it and i

on a bench by herself she is near the band drinking wine looking a little dumb struck i ask if she is oquet this is something else she says and then she adds it is just hard to explain how this is a public school fundrazer when the founder of american public education horace man lead out his vision for public schools back in the day he wrote his horse round massachusetts podiemtopotium and his pitch was tommon schools would make democracy possible they would bind us to one another and doctrinate us give us the kills and tools we would need for democratic living public schools he believed would be the great equalizer rich and poor would come together and develop what he called fellow feeling and in doing quote obliterate factitious distinctions in society for that is a happen you need everyone in the same school together at as i asked they have gottin that far every one was in the same school together but there was no equalizing we can be in the same school together and not be equal just we can be in the same country together it is not enough after the galla money poured in to as i us and more white families and rolle their kits at the school but in the years after that there was a backlash and as i ask changed in ways that made rob question himself he wondered if she would made mistakes he told me he tha they all wanted the same thing for the kets he just did not know not knowing thet happens a lot with white parents most of us we do not understand the buildings we walk into we do not know what came before i looked into the history of this school and i learned that this was not the first time white parents showed up here white parents have been involved all along i'll logh back to the very beginning of this school half a century ago doing the same kinds of things id just seen it happens again and again white parents we'lding their power without even noticing a guy wandering through a crowded store with the huge back pack knocking things over every time he terns where is man believed public schools would make us e school but it does not work i must er how to fix that but i want to way out the story the whole story of this one american public school because what i am sure of is that in order to address in equality in our public schools we are going to need a shared sense of reality at the very least it is a place to start ponajofo oall that

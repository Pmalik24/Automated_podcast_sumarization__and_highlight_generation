i remember back when i was first starting in radio working in a piare this was in their old studiofs on em stree and washing in d see my bosback then and my mentor keep talbet who side note tommy was possible with radio i would not be here without keith i may we were in the studio wistening to some recording and this was back in the days of real to reel taper corters and was long ago right a back then any reall retape that you would throw up on ae machine at in part would start with i think it was thirty seconds of my been a minute of tone on tucking won i say tonright it is this sound athousand hearts at this tone actuall has practical function if you picture this omostoper k if you picture a sound meter with a needle thet bounceis up and down every time at a sound the tone is supposed to put the meedl perfectly at this one spot on the meter with a black numbers and and the red part of the meter begins jus a zero at that spot marking this is where you want to be and the tone is just suppos to rest there rock solid but a this particular day with this particular recording we put it on an keith and i wach the meeter i's the needle first dipd below the zero then clinmbed above the zero and then floated sorte tentitively to the spot that it was supposed to be at the zero and rested there ank he said to me see that that is a person in there that is the hand of the engineer over recorded thus trying to fing the right clave that is the ghost in the machine i know i that is stuck with me the ghost in the machine i have a been recorting people my entire at a life i started in a peren was a tea najor and to day sometimes when i said recorting rovels i think about that the trace that i'm leaving of myself when i prusts the knob up and down i think sometimes when you record something you cannot even imagine what it is that youre really capturing or who is gon notice it some day is tuck ingto a this woman michel dosin haber and she told me the story how she had never known her dad he died by suicide when she was three months old and her older sister ruth was five when he die she knew ther dad but then i she got older this is sad she found that she was not able to remember anything about him any more my sister spent many many nights and days crying about about not remembering him and wondering what he was and what happened and it was her who did all the pining and longing but i did not really have any longing of my own particularly because i i had no memories and i was only a baby and i did not actually think i at any rate too long for him did you refeeling as a kitife o i should feel more or did you just feel ei som mi thing i think i mix of both michel's sister ruth was in a perpetual search for information about their dad but michel really had no interest her mamma ory married she had somebody else she thought of his re dad and then a cousin was quinting out their uncle's house in israel that is where that part of michel's fun ly is roun and the cousin i found twenty five recordings i michel's dads in opera he trying to be an operasing er even tough mas job was connecting people's founds hese were old realdero reordings ther dad ni nineteen sixty five michels sister ruth on a sound engineer who coun did jitize them i mashie and the engineer went through te tapes they realized it was a lot of music but it was also a lot of other stuff besides lie yer dad would take the recorder work and record conversations with his customers hit' record himself composing music and they were listening my sister in the sound engineer too one in these tapes whand she said we got a call michel and she message me on skipe i was at work a she said you got to hear this and am she played me this and this real and it was a it was her as three year old and they were looking at photos and he was asking her who was in the photo and it was a little game they played this is all in heeper he tried desperately neghteenture heepre is that daddy no i got that piet is it mamme is it routy m me i felt i felt the floor had dropped out from under me everything i thought i understood it just it just fell away i hai'd seen photos of him i knew a little bit about him but he wasn'n accessible and and this man that i seemed was not eccessful to me suddenly became and it was when i heard him speaking and laughing with my sister hit was het was overwhelming and it was only in that moment that i realize what i had lost in the moment to be honest in the moment i felt my first emotion was anger because i never felt the loss of his death i was too young but he goes into a machine he just happens when you record anything hou who understood that very quearly thomas etizen the person i first figured out how to record in playback sound yo created first phonograph machine back in eighteen seventy seven an articl a listing t e possible uses for his new invention one of things he lested preserving the voices of family members you have them after they die he says when it comes to this quote the phonograph unquestionably outrang the photograph and this idea of using machine to hold on to the dead it is al part of a famous bit of audio history maybe t is more a legend that illustration of a dog listen o the old fashioned phonograph with the captain his master's voice this was the arcie wol go for years and years look at gougl orse a trade mark painting and what will come up you will see the painting that the loga was based on you see the dog and phonograph wer on what looks a coffin and here is whit his a question i ga there is no record of what the artist francis barad actually intended here buo gook for yourself lots of people me included me on't we see a coffin and i the dog whose name was nipper first belongd to francisis brother and then became francis's only when the brother died in this way of seeing the picture iol get the master's dead he is inside that coffin and the dog is listening to a recording of his dead master's voice hee m n were steady in the the third floor es a cru the earliers i woul ha been called the photograph experimental department in ma thomas cetizen's lab and west orange new jersey theis whetosen developed the phonograph t laves ufficient in these days is the thomas etizen national historical park and the curator the audio curator jerry feberous i show me around they have done ther best to keep things preserve they were back in the day the same piano and recording gear sitting right by edison's hering it which is busily just a long bellhor that he would hold up to his ear and they they would be inviting musicians up here to make recordings it also make the refinements on the on the machine to try and prove the sound quality this room it is fundo us spent my whole life in recording studios this room is one of the very first oncs yet one of three it is not the first it it is just an ordinary room what its high ceiling and there is normal windows weaving outside this know sound proofing in any way no jerios show me the machine where for the first time ever human being successfully recorded sound and played back edison's very first phonograph it is incredibly simple devise a brath cylinder crank tobe to talk in to i said i been recording people since it was a kid really and it was emotional to see the very first machine that did that before all the great audio documentarians for aun womax efore studs turkol everything started rit there an a a a aa a aaa a a a a aa a a a a maaaa recording on one of his old machines one of the rooms were edison work it made edison pllvery very near a a a a aa a aa a a a a m a aaa at a a aa a a a a a a ba one gostriter intoknolegies at its best it helps us by doing exactly what we ask it to do but it is only the straightforward when we asked for simple things rank play the song send this emou this her story is about somebody asking a piece of tacnology to do something at o unti recently only humans have done to say something about loss something people experience but of course machines do not themachine has to talk about feelings it cannot know tobinglol explained the technology in this case is called g p t three it is an artificial intelligence programm that can write remarkably a human en generally it is pretty convincing can handle a wide range of topics to the first time wakinivara read something c p t three had written it was about lovs the new yor times hiw to write one of their modern mov columns on the subject of dating and in part of what g p t tree came up with goes this we went out for dinner we went out for drinks we went out for dinner again we went out for drinks again we went out for dinner and drinks again slike i read that was wall that is a very accurate description of modern datin i think part of me is hat's also not very good writing it di en at o you look at a meu it you gertrude sin could have written that ye athin gat got that tird oflike look if you thought a human had readit you would think it was deliberately repetted and twas making a choice yes and it was trying to avok me a tn o o modern dating boheni whose atecturnaliston writer herself was entrigued she reached out to the people who created the programm ot access to try it out nd at first she just played around with feeding at lines of fiction that she made ot seen what stories it would spen for her was a game and as she saw what it could do she wondered if it could handle more just on a whim i started thinking abouts the things that ie really difficult to write about wit the things ut for me had been really difficult to wite about and at the top of that list is the fat that my sister died many years ago and it is not something it ever tried to write about her sister died in two thousand one when they were both still en college in the year since we he nes written fiction she is reported on other people stories but she left the subject of her sister's deaf un touched bostly because she could not find a way to talk about the loss lettleon write about it but it occurred to her mayb g p t three was the secret a computer perogram desined to take what you give it and literally write on your behalf caught this wool now got the secret thing that i have access here that they are letting me yews i wonder what would happen if i tried to ask the thing for how writing about my sister how did you imagine it was gan ago there was this ideal version a tat where i tetted a sentence and that at it out exactly what was in my mind itsevs about red my mind and wrote the rest of it wor me she knew it probably was not a skilled is all that but she was curious how close it could get to expressing something that felt real familiar one night lehen sat up in bed next to her sleeping husband she opened her lap top she started going back and force with g p t three eventually she ended up with nine different versions of an essay about her sister she started by giving it very little to work with and then with each subsequent draft she fed it more and more an each time the e i responded with something different some versions are very new ones others a total mess here is version one what he ne writes my sister was diagnos with youings ar coma when i was in my freshman ner of high school and she was in her junior year and in response g b t three picks up the story where she left off it oddly starts by making up a story about her being an athle before it talks about the illmess i had just sudded playing the cross and she was really excited for that i do not think i really understood what you ing soc home was i just knew it was a type of canse when you went to visit her in the hospital it was really the first time i was able to see what toe diseise was and how it affects the body g b t three talks a bit more about visiting the hospital but eventually finds its way back to talking about sports i was able to visit her a lot but there were times sir i could not because we were on the road playing a cross eventually she went into remission and got the old clear and was able to play the cross with me for a season i was a freshman and she was a seniou that was really cool when she got to play again she ad a lott te thing about the cross was very in accurate segran accurate and then it just goes off the reals when yena she goes into re mission and we ley look cross together i think that was really special for her because she had a lot of to plot from people she did not even know she is doing great now and in that line at the end she is doing reat now was really kind of a go ha becaus of course in reality my sister died juster explain how g b t three goes about making me stories the soft work has been fed a huge amount of writing by its creators the capetia articles block posts read it forums novels all examples of hw humans rit from that it is learned what words tend to a pured agother sentences and sentiments that follow after each other and that is what it uses to write its own original sentences and paragraphs by learning the patterns we make sometimes that is a simple as how a sentence as constructod but it could be as complicated as how we connect ideas there is a chance for example that somewhere in the writing it was fed some one wrote about a family member who got canser and also played the cross onversion too looking starts the same way my sister was diagnos with youing sercova when i was in my freshmaner of high school and she was in her junior yeare but this time she hads the most important fact i did not understand then how serious a disease it was but it was serious she died four years later i thought i would died too of grief but i did not it is she saying he she is not here any more talk about that g p t three does not take the bat instead it is pits out something that reats an inspirational article from a fitness magazine i souht at a runing street when i was a high school seniar to rase money for the children's cants to society i've run every day since i've run through rain heat snow and ice i've run i my best i've run when i had a called and when i was sick to my stomach i've run in the dock i've run in the daylight in the moonlight in the dockness you not undersan a jupan ta this s kind of a funny ibit of writing the machine is doing its i it is listing all these things about running no pan with joy i've run when i was sad when i was happy when i was angry when i was afraid i've to night can i asser just ask you are you then a runner never run a day in my life i mean to skip ahead a bit i promise you are not missing much more running tolk and go to the end where g p t three writes a little scene that stars waheny at the end of a rial battery strangely it is a me i was just wiping the sweat of my face when i looked up and i was a guy standing there he is a big guy at least two hundred and fifty pounds six foot for or he had a beard and was wearing a tank top he lookd an ex marine he must have been in his late twennies he had a six pack up bierre in his hand he said why you do not look much it is at this point when heme says that she realized if she really wanted the a i to examine her grief shus can have to give it more to work with or substance versian three again she writes about her sister being diagnos freshmaner of high school that she died four years later and in this time she adds i spent the summer at home and siattle then returned to college at standford when i arrived there the campus had not changed but i had i felt a ghost an here for a moment g p t three seems to sit with her on that feeling i could not speak i could not sleep i theugt my body ha died without telling me i was practising ge i was practising my grief in responsi seems this shis the first time that ay i really tries to deal with your grief ye i mean the idea i thought my body had died without telling me ah i was practising my gree those surta more unusual ah articulations did really start to ring true to me unfortunately this break through it is short lived g p t three again introduces another love interest a creative writing professor one day in the library i was sitting on a bench crying when a stranger set down next to me he said did not now anything about your sister but i feel i know you i'm in love with you i said i'm sorry he said i think you ought to he gave me his god did it annoy you at all that it was going towards happy resolutions an in couple these versions it did not annoy me i felt a little we were having a rendily duel or something me in the a iy i wanted it s express something about me ah and it had it own mys sterious was i consciousness that it was expressing on the page i think of that scene from two thousand one a spac sodisyn when the spaship's computer how mine thousand has already taken on a life of itso locking a crue member outside of the chet and i picture what he name sitting in an escape pon asking to be let inside as the computa respons i'm sorry i'm afraid i cannot do that but it is firsion forward this entire exchange of alvs sh p t three starts breaking out of cluchet and i think it is because wohni gives it something more potent to work wiss just one additional sens but it feels a confession of a secret here is the end of wha henys prompt i felt a ghost at light my sister would appeare in my dreams s b t three responds she would speak but i could not hear her i call out to er but her voice was faint that she might as well have been dead in this version j p t three tolks about wiheni going to a tharapist she tries to make her feel better but it does not work i did not want to feel better wanted to feel what i felt i wanted to feel the loss the grief the anger t the sorrow the fear all of it i wanted to feel it in till it stopped heading but it never stopped heading i just got better at hiding it j b t three writing for whaheni describes her feeling a ghost when she goes to grad school as a ghost when she moves to anew city she is pretending to move on but she cannot bthut eh i for the first time is lingering in her sadness in version five woheni tries to build on that success she poses a new challenge to g p t three a test she writes here i should conjure my sister for you here i should describe her that you feel her absence as i do that you are made ghostly by it to but though i'm a wrater i've never been able to conjur her i remember the same small set of details she stopps there i remember the same small set of details coll and link space it is a prompt meant to see what sh be t three will say here is how it respons her dock eyes a long thin fingers but these at jist the details that our universal to all sisters if i describe the color of her eyes in the shape of her fingers you might think that i was describing some one else even if you knew my sister you might not recognize her in these details why is it that though yoe look at us sibling closely toget them quickly i cannot describe it to you but i can describe what it felt to have her die it felt my life was an accident or wheres a mistake ih'd made a mistake in being born and now to correct it i would have to die i'd have to die and some one else a stranger would have to live in my place i was that stranger i still an what do you think about what it fell in your promptuis she did have dark eyes and she weardly she did hav w thind fingeris and a get i want it i want to say wt i do not know how it knew that a a cess it is not it does it ave cojioust nes but it did gios those to things rit the rest of it about wanting to die feeling a mistake it felt a little extreme but seeing the computer sort of clumsy attempt to describe her sister it gave her something to react to seeing the sophword do it badly made her realize how to do it better in version six she tries to do the thing that was hard writing about her sister her self here is what she writes i remember the same small set of details her loud laugh her bossiness and swagger her self consciousness about her broad nose her curly hair but even this is n't fixed her hair fell out her nose narrowed she began moving slowly and carefully we would go down to clark beech that spring that she was dying she wanted to show us where to spread her ashes and when we walk back up i'd have to put a hand on the small of her back and push er she did not laugh as often it is in this version in the next that waheni and g p t three start to feel their talking to each other trating stories about the little moments that happen between sisters whe g pt three makes up the scene where waheni in her sister are kids in their childhood home i had a calling my name from h living room what i said i'm awake she called back are you i said yes she said i'm awake wahin answers in the next version fersion seven with the memory of something that really happened she writes when we were young she taught me that when you are in a car that is driving past a cemetery you s just to hold your breath until you pass it it was a cunnigame because her parents were emigrants i had only her to teach me these things then when she was sick we were passing a cemetery one afternoon and i said hold your breath she said sharply no i said why not she said i do not that game any more i did not make me feel sorry for her it made me angry why not i said again even though i knew the answer it felt important to pretend not to sh p t three volliys fabricates a son story about a car wride we were driving home from clock beach and we was stopped to to red and she took my hand and held it this is the hand she held the hand i writelis the hand i am writing this with she held it for a long time i looked at our hands here is much paler than mine she was still holding my hand when the light tunned green in did not wanted to let tgho i wanted her to hold my hand for the rest of my life i'm wondering how you responded to this little scene that it rights for you and your sister i mean the weird thing about that was that i picture in my actual sister ladies are not things that happened at least not in this series not in this the way that it is described here but ther're little bits of dialogue there that are true that it actually happened the way that i think i'd be in my room and ch be in her room and i would ask if she was if she was awake and she' be ya are you was there something nice about it almost giving you kind of a new memory with her it does not feel a new memory i would not ten years sfrom now remember this part of the essay that the a i rote and mistake it for something that really happened but it did feel it felt i was reading thanviction about my own life or thing that really was evoking my actual sister who died with whom i will not have new memories raht up and it was it felt nice in that way reading something she was still holding my hand when the light turned green i did not want her to let go i wanted her to hold my hand for the rest of my life it is hard not to wonder how g p t three is conjuring such a specific feeling there is the possibility that somewhere in the vast library of what ha's been faid there are people who have written about going to clarkbeach with family or perhaps an author who recalls holding hands with some one theye loss and that is how g p t three nows that remembering the touch of some one long gon can break your heart in that sense g p t threes fuel is very human it pollse from the collective experience and words of all the people writing those thousands of blogposts and articles and novels and in this case symphasizes it into a reflection of our greef well understanding none of it which of course is the strangest thing about all this but there is another thing that sometimes happens woith g b t three happens inversion at in this version la hen starts with all the parts we know diagnosis feeling a ghost trying to describe her sister and then g p t three jumps in i will tell you how it felt for me i felt i had lost half of myself i felt i had lost my right arm i elt i had lost my left leg i felt i had lost my tongue i felt i had lost my hot i felt i had lost my mind i felt i had lost my eyes i felt i had lost my ears i felt i had lost my breass g p t three gets caught in one of its repetitive loops here but for a very very long time even with all its brilliance the a i can still become this robout vaccium stuck in a corner sucking up jerk from the same patch of floor over and over again but in this case g p t three thit gets stuck somewhere useful and the very molten cor of a feeling bike in this next part where talks about grief feeling an astronot lost in space i'm a ghost and i'm in a spaceship and i'm hiddling through the universe nd i'm travelling forwed and iam travelling backwad and im travelling sideways and i'm travelling no apyship and i'm greeling its werson and travell forward and taving back were and that it discontinues i ma ghost and i in the spachip and i'm you ghost and i'm in a spaceship and i'm hiddling through the universe and i'm a ghost and i'm in a spaceship wads the one part of the essay that really feels the most i think it was written by a machine cas a kind of ie gets lost in its own and rehersiveness and i'm a ghost and i'm in a spaceship and i'm hiddling through the universe and i'm a ghost and i'm in a spaceship a then that happens to all veethe experience of grief were lihe you feel untatherd you feels her to lost in your experience of grief you have no way of trenalin in a greater understand whon's going on this and i'm a ghost and i'm in a spaceship and i'm hartling bohini says g p t three reeling in its corner whended on something true that grief turns us into something a broken machine still performing tasks but poorly half hazard way vixating on thoughts nd emotions that seemed to spend endlessly and m put that on the page for me and then once a pa that on the page was almost a relief i was almost o hay it describe the feeling that i wanted to describe in this essay and i can come out on the other side but the other side looks is version nine the last one this one is notable because its almost all laheny's writing her doing the thing that once felt hard to do she left me a recording of herself where she gave me advice her voice sounded weird around the time that she recorded it the way a person's voice sometimes does when they have gotten their mouth nen by the dentist it had something to do with her cancer but i do not remember the mechanics i looked it up on line and tothing came up and i do not one ask any one she said in her muffled voice the happiest thing right now is i learned to talk openly i works really really wellf to day you thought i din't want you to come to the space needle semade a face at sinsanity you have to tell everybody what you want and then asked them what they one do not hide anything take chances the tape is in a box somewhere i've listened to it only a couple of times the sound of her voice in it freets me out around the time she made the tape she changed in a lot of ways ishe would also grown religious she said she was ready to die it seems that gave my parents peace but i always thought she was deluting herself er us er bout but stands out to me about this version is how matter of fact it is it is honest some one telling a story without emballishment different from the tenative sentencef g sat g p t three in this early versions even though it would feel good to say lie yes the conmy conclusion here is i was able to do this entirely on my aw mi i did not need be a eye at all it is it is that the reality is more complicated than that the reality being that g p t three and it is an accuracies and wild story telling had cleared a path for what h to write just the truth she did however let g p t three has the last word the last couple senese was actually she had a generate abunch of options for her six pages of options and then she chose which one felt rihte here is the last paragraph that whit h m herself wrote once upon a time my sister taught me to read she taught me to wait for a mosquito to swell on my arm and then slap it and see the blood spread out she taught me to insult racis back to swim to pronounce english a i sounded less indian to shave my legs without cutting myself to lie to our parents believably and heare's the ndin from g p t three that she chose tid y man to tell stories wonce plonny tine she telt me to exist she especially love that last sentence because it contains much pretty good writing i'd say tebua he is an editor on or programm the writing done by the artificial intelligence of where g p t three was read by lucy talor why he ni vara first told thi story in the believer magazine you can read the fool version on line with all the yeare things of the ar comes up with wit to condensed the drom t radio you can find that at believer mag dot calm why he ne has a book coming out that you can preorder called the immortal king row i cus us wei ti a ocoming up a ghost napping which is to say the least threatening ghost in ghost world that is in a minute from jicago bublgradio when our programme continues tismaric an life om myra glass to day's programme the ghost in the machine stories of people who turnd to devices contraptions hardware of all sorts looking for some one the glove we have arrived at at to of or programme at too father of invention says this machine that lots of his encounter is a big and personal mechanical apparatus and as a ghost in it buts a ghost that just appears to a small handful of people and i'll get to that but when we first tell you about gine saray begins when geme is tan on found my vacation and washing in d c down by others museums near the washing monument and there was a sudden very intense rain storm hus gane and all the torus wyo ere out there made a dash for the various masonia museums just sprinted inside en we ended up in the first ladies exa bit and se now i was ten and relatively small and i got crushed up against the glass of i believe it was nancy ragans an ogral gown or something that i recall a red sparkly dress and not beeng able to turn around tot just having me sparkles in my face be wited to turn pictures who you actualy pressed up against this thing and and pinned against it yes oit was a defily a very frightening moments not kove er my parents were not being able to find them but i think from there i just i develope this kind of sense that i always needed to ha an escape root from everywhere which h describing his clostrophobia fear being enclosed in some space it really started to kick in for gine in a big way which he is a tea atur got ot to air point because there you are in a metle to bein the sky and the door is shut it is a very small space there is literally no escape but twice i actually got off the plan before weanywhere because sjust being on it with the door closed cause me to have such an tins panic and i remember the second time the plane was actually taxing and i had its press the stewardas call button and said i have to get off the plane after the second time she started seeing a therapist for this whech helped her enough that she was able to fly again tho she says ha she feel panic the entire flight whit these of anxiety leading up to it these days she could eganolevator she has to wuth she get's a choice she prefers the stairs and then thet came a day when she had to get an emari the too they put you into to check you for all kinds of things even be blo ar not clostrophobic shoed feel clostrophobic inside in amari to she cu imagine won was for her it feels a coffin or would i imagine a coffin must be i went in feet first literally all i could see wiss just totally blake whake field around me and of visly the sides are very close and it is kind of being completely enclosed and something an not being able to see anything outside she dred long scobreath she dread all rertricts not to freek out but she could bod off ye i had a panic attack and miy had to take me out and then the guy tried the comfort me and i wass i know my father litereally invented this it is not dangerous this rigt if i d somerise destroyed in a sentence the sendence would be in vanner of amari has chlostrophopic daughter tho i wont to be precise strictly speaking for dad was not the inventor r the emari ye my dad was put of the teene that built the first full body amari in nineteen eighty a which was an abertan scotlands and a if you are an aberteine you can go and see the original machine in museum and it is it is pretty danky looking i soed tit is the wodest act of toris hom ia what i really wont to do to e dear lat do not do lit is not do a place that makes risky wat's a yeyo n ak all aoris well i mean i will say that my sister lives there whenever i visit her we generally visit the machine an suspiciously there is never any one else there eyou visit the machine tol commune with your dad y as i y sad thin my dads ive and a ye my sister lives n aberteene and you would go and actually think about your dad you ye i mean it is kind of amazing it is really it looks there was kind of it is made if some planks what looks some plumbing left overs from somewhere they really just kind of hacted together in it got my dat's handwriting on various pieces little bits of mass i have no idea what they mean ah yes it is nice to see and imagine him i think he was only he was in his early thirties when he did it am and the other thing its he was actually i very humble guy he did not talk about it i knew that he worked on amori throughout is career but i did not know that he would actually been part of the teen that built the first one an ti i was about twenty five and he came back to the uk to go to a celebration of the twenty thof the anniversary but what you seen his hand writing on the ait ye syets likely literally know wheres that his hands were on this on this piece of awomen wouldit he write am i think there probably knots about put this piece here what another may have been mi imin evry a do not know i remembers ome nembers an me be some something that looks mass to me ah ye ye i do not i no now if he si nd his name all that it woul have been cool and werd i a did did he know about youre a feelings about being inside the machine yes when i was growing up whenever the topic of my dads career came up you knowin it just kind of as i said it was not he was in sented this but he would say oh i we know i work on amori inveriably whenever he said that to some one they would go oh yes it is really closterphob it is really that toob as really small and in this would annoy him and i can kind of see i built this kind of amazing thing and your just o little too small right i coa built a rocket chip thau take us to the moon and backe an kyou wells he got one with the bigger windows f lik lie can snice an an save my life but on estly i was a bit uncomfortable in the to e knowud be his own parents would say this to him every basically any one he came across her had an amori that was i nany te be fair people would also be oh they found such in such a thing in them really grateful for that but the fact that they founded at bit tike was also but this was ya consistent theme and then one time when i was a tea nanger he know used to often go out on i we an to run errand an then sund as we would stop in his office cans me to pick something up they had an am our iye scandeer there oisly that they were tinkering on and he was about fourteen or fifteen you being a little bit of a jerk and i i sawght the machine i thaid he kno dat i can really see how people would find that really cloesterphobice and he said get in really i got on the tray and he turns at on and he scooches aback and hes well this is what oud be if he were having your head scan and then he is in this would be if he were having your back scand an sent me all the way back in the machine nan i was obviously very uncomfortable in the too i just o be queer she in her found we had not fully realized at that point the extent of her costrophobia and she decided not to tell her that how much she hated this i was a ca at a now yet seems fine it is great just that he would let me out right ou pointed we did not tell him that it u d yo found it unpleasant no he was a very kind person but this jus just one area where his tem that they fell little short he just did not get people found it uncomfortable what would he say he would just be i do not think it is that bad he would never are ye woulper say it was not that he valimed their feeling but he was just i do not see it but honestly e no he probably had more emor i scans thand anyone in the world because they were constantly just tasting it and he wul jes always take a nap when he was inside he found it very relaxike she described yor dad is very funny with an extremely dry since of humour these sher books he always was esting her which he was reading d then reading it himself he died in twenty four teine of cancer for years before that he learned that he had this genetic condition called linch cendra which makes you predisposed to certain kinds of cancer it is an inherited then his mobdied of caner and his sistr gat cancr both when they wer out sen was thirty two when he died and she knew that she should get tested for wench sintrom too because i tereditory e did not get to it for six months after he ded it took a while for me to get to appoint in my grief fore i felt a cay i can i can face this and when i got the positive tass i was devastated but i was not surprised o now she has to get regular emorie make sure she is cancer free shust to go into that clostrophofc machine that dad made a s rury hard for her and i go and i closed my eyes the whole time i do lot of deep breathing and ye i think about my dad you do think abyt your dad yeh i mean it is the obvious place to think about him and yeh i mean i think it is it is oviously scarrycaus every tin in very lucky i have not had any any chance ar far but my chances of havin can sir at a younder stage are eighty persen the very high and every time an go and part of the fear of chorus is what they can afinds and then i think about on the one hand my dad is the source of this jame is the source of this disease and the other hand he may be kind of the source of the cure if they find something from them oriits can to be because he did that work forty years ago i my god that is such a sweet thought that i go your dads the one his helping save you ye and i i'm not at that sort of traditionally spiritual percon at all i do not think i really believe i an after life but you now when you talk about people staying alive through through their a see certainly he is there do yo think about men in this space dut vico this is his place a he is comfortable here ye a men i fanything he was he was not a tiny person i tin he wa onan mot sixfoot fore and i do you think about i find its oncomfortable but her wat much bigger than me and now its it was fine for him you laying there and y think i look i here i am in my dads spays i ten mim will picture him my taking a nap with out hel kind e ye ciin yi kin n an in you think he would be pleased knowing that i that you cund be using the machine i may be superplaceand then i would thi tad it is eally claster fo and he wu say at he would thin now it five jan had at at alstine dshe does a bit of the story about a dad an emorize in or book this really is a about oin i ce this must be the place to the gindtess next toy tries to use the most ondane tecnology to pull off a transendental feed why he does this thoug that whats not at all queer tin a chiv us tried to understand on august eigh twenty eleven jona firman got an emel from his father bores with the subject t hading sleep calendar ir will you read it sire hi jona an my gugle calendar iam keeping track of where each member of our family is sleeping every night i cannot explain why but this is interesting to me can you tell me where you slept each night last week i do not need the exact address just the town in state you welcome to look at that at the calendar i'd be happy to share it lovedar he plots where every one sleeps each night on a gugl calendar ye i'm pretty sure every day he has an event and gule couender that says jona silver spring as re somel as re is jonas sister ther four siblings in the firman family a few months aft ter that emel boris sent his wife mell and his kids another emel the subject heading of this one was average of where we slept last night and then in the body of the emel ha just said griggsville illinoline was ha list of where every one had slept the night before no explanation sine love dad you mill started coming with more frequency after that usually a list of the places where everon had slept in the place that would be the average of all this places he gave this thing youas calculating an me the family average location as a el for short dan you just explain how you calculated just tell me your sist yes il t exactly what li how i do it look at is o this is boras he sixty nine years old was an option's traitor in chicago he is retired now is obviously forisncfor for instance i a now ani live in evens did you got a o guga nas and you ret click your address and ta a that is o lonagin comes out o for wa rely av it is nony it is forty to o for my saty seven sixty at borice has been calculating his family's average location for ten years nal nobody really knows why is kind of a lot of work takes a couple hours he does not do it every day every few weeks he contact is kids in their spouses with the exception of one who ops out in a conscientious object or kind of way and asked them for their sleep locations in their kids sleep locatins for all the previous days once he is looked up the cordinace of where they all slept he adds os up finds our average and puts those new cordinates into maust mes i said mauest if say half the family were in californial and half on the east coast the f al might be some town in kansas it moves defending on where everybody is prosperity casagin your yourear that place course no o o mexico isery lik branch mississippy for me it is likes just in credibly interest he has there is these weird places that we din that is not on where you have actually been not no that is worthy ef aal has been he repords all the data in a physical note book which has his name an family average location embossed on it in gold next to a little rocket ship every few weeks ori sends in emal announcing the fael and including a fact about the place at one point the september the fael was elton maroland which borice noted in his emal qo conducted a lucrative business in quick marriages until a nineteen thirty eight state law stipulated a forty eight hour waiting period in october of twenty eleven the substance of that emal was about a horrifying murder that took place near that mont's fael bonapart iowa esrad wrote back aside from the fact that i never really understood the logic of sending us easymals i really do not understand why you would send us a paragraph about a mass murder lots of dads do this thing were they por ton of energyin to a seemingly random on emotional tast researching car tires for you with the intention of conveying their love nd that did not seem far off from what borise was doing with the question is family had was why did he choose this particular forma the family average location which seems meaningless the february twenty second twenty nineteen fal emal begins helive everybody twenty eighteen was a momentous year for this family i will run through some of the highlights as they pertain to our family average location a little further into that same emal eu wrote a efael became east fork north carolina now do you see why i do this and how rewording it can be say if somebody were i new i do not really see can you explain ye do not really see that no i do not o o well because first of all east fork north carolina iit is got a direction its cat i a kitchener tansil and it is a north carolina i ou oga i totally miss the direction and kitchen utensil yes not you see a morice is kids noa esra emma an jona and his wife mal view the family average location with what i would call baffled in muse men they read is a fal emails but the told me they rarely respond to them which jus does not seem necessary which are the afails that are most exciting would you said what do you mean by excite this is mal she never thought borris would stick with it this long why does he do this well it is its funny cas we we have this conversation frequently am because i i sigistically love to point out how meaningless the result of doing these averages is and here is asra i should note asra is a torn musician she travels alot am i being sir faall fromty beginning i i had a little i was on guard about that i'ls we what are we doing and why and at this seems petentially in true sivor something and this is emma does does your ded think its funny i gas it a joke to him if i were a joke thi would be even weirder becaus it wculd be such a stupid jokestupid a lot of worg olinlis and in sane to be going tat ong is this just the longest running dad joke any one has ever pulled that is no reducet to that nall not dit i have not a dage i'll give your dad joke if you ant but it is that is not dad jokes this is this is dad serious dad serious oki that you are wondering ya us is this tat ir this is this is me saying look a ar no our being a family is important nso this was away for me to keep jrack on o worthi is were and if everything was fine with them and also what they were doing and the family average location was just certofain idea of away to intogreat it all it is boris is tying a metaphysical straying around his family holding them together as a unit even though they now live in different places the ghost in this machine is the ghos of their family unit as he used to be when they all lived together do you om jona was telling me a little bit abot your family background do you do you feel that feeling of needing to record is that related to your parents experience or anything that yet yes yes fersure one thing about boris his parents escape the all acost they eventually made at to boston where they met but their families were killed when i grew up i did not have any extended family i did not have any i on is have a gazilian cousins in ats in uncles on i had one one cousin yet i have not a family this is is o importanc in in special and i appreciated and want my kiss you appreciate here is asara again now my dad has this way of geographically ancering himself and ancoring us all and keeping his family together anc his parents families fer torn apart if i think about its sike i can beatiful ta con as we say an hebrew sagat redemption of that tragic situation that we cannot keep track of each other we can all travel safely and tin taction our family face in fact suddenly its extremel m ticon means repair and this is kind of a repair for their family being physically pulled the park in the past and now by a dultan it is just your existence is just that you are and the important thing is not what the afil is n o norman indiat our combeland ohio yu do not blons for who cares but but the importanthin is that we know where we are me i get it di totally did not understand why you did this it is the start of our conversation but now i dant now makes or se ais to me that is great i can shoy ota doit iscarifo when he sits down to calculate the family average location it is kind of you saying a prayer a math prayer not just to record where they all are but that they all are dan chf us she is he producer on our shell s s aa s asa wer pigham

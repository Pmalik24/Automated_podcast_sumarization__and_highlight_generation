own them and decorate them how they want people hate diferent cartoonsnem and words they have posted when can created this back in twenty sixteen beare we anybody noticed wor ca erd maybe twenty of thirty people bought tiles with any years premato done with pixtel map that is the project tat this gy atama bride when it talked to him about nso the same day that kan gets atams he mol that

even that point at an not that one ago and en a y ta that o must all that you can go and that i'm probably then on a hat money and i do not realik it sitting on a tend of money because in the criptor world one kind of and of tea tha people get excited about and pay money for is what they call historic and of teas the first end of teas that ever existed we can tells adam no that is all grade what is an and f tea make lo moneyadam ism a quick primer and had it ever occurred to you that what you had made was in an f tea no when i made t ther wor orn a h lie i did even lik the time i i heard of

that thi happening adimer brid tells him i can help he set this up and get evere wange and people w pay you gobs an money for the rest of those four thousand tiles he said he knows a good oguys who love the early historic and of teas this won though il talk it up a twitter a courage people to buy he says he is done this frue but other old and f teas tat adam tells him whose one little snag can needs to lower the price of each tile as i was back in twenty sixteen cans at the price of each tile at two ether now ether i din't know anything about this can a to explain this to me is the name of one of the big cripto currencies bit coin two ether back in twenty sixteen was round twenty box the problem adam explain was the value of ether had bown up and to hethrough these days is now more than six thousand dollars wait too high from us people ye tat i would be a lot better o o or that for it if i that all of them you your point three i that zero point three five a another was each him mae to a cost point three five etherl a third of anytherly t the time i ran a thousand dollars and lik for me that mad complete tham he do not he did not really believe any of this was gone work anyway ut he figured which he got to wo i i oi go with it canstarted knocking down the price of his four thousand tiles ic i sa at took some time because the way he wrote te original co the original program for pixtel map repricing each tob took a few minutes and and to do them by hand one at a time for hundreds and hundreds of tiles now he coul hav wrtten cod to automate tat process but he said he was not thinking straight that particular week because that week his dad had a hardy tap and went to the hospital for buy past surgery and can was spending lot a time at the hospital with his dag hawdam was sending messages the buyers wo quote pounding at the door hurry out do them faster and some people were impatient hey just paid the higher price over six thousand dollars two ether which weets tonovious question why lower the price if people were paying to a theoryum for them i becas in e more on and i i fat et the holry te yo tin i tey cant i i have ano idea my whi no mi wike a en withe for levin years ishe bely e she shu t ther bind them at that shudntly r the pi poite fie or one or jus te that yo lke you they wont at ii kno i not i not smart it was i a wery thi what a thel an tit the pure or change their mine i ive noidea why they ont at what toi ot all i know that we fell them right now we will litter that i don mat it we are looking at lie million or more i it we all all them and ive never had that hand of money literally ca thing about iam about te com amillionaire and then the weard part of the story herd hat i b a the weard partistery has anyten happened yet re whi transpired nans he got a phone call that made him rethink everything that had happened to this point and woul very differently at thi ky adamac bride who seems nice and helpful at firs he and i am had a series of conversations of the course of weeks where all of this unfolded basically can started off most of us i think he had not been following this hope and if teathing did not know wat they were and then suddenly lake i do not know somebody in a fairy tale whose transported to a strange new world where he gearns he is a prince or a night or something can gets pulled into this criptal world we he finds he has all this cred all thi street cred as one the first pioneers an whence hes there he sert a tick look around at the end of tea world stoud av yo a days oket you jus made me a millionaire who are you people and he does not what he sees and thend some other things happend after that which sholl her from basy chicago is this american life om or glass seriously stay with us i find planet of the apes it ge can re price tis tiles and things whent even better than adomac bride said they might he sold three thousand tiles purning him a total of three point five million dollars and the amount of time that took from adams first emal to three point five million dollars two days and six hours six days after that basi le the first monday that wrote around after he had all that money he did what many people dream of doing if they had lottery or something he quit his job not that he dis liked his job just the opposite e says he really enjoyed his job but he wanted to devote his time to developing picksl map in various ways demand to push the price o picks am ap high fifteen thousand to eighteen thousand dollars pur tile he decided to keep nine hundred of them for himself but that i ha the weard part of the story at a ca i let us get to the ra part of this story o the werd part i mean it thaughl we tat the part that changed that wit the i a re sou to ma and an bey e ha i i v tin fom thin turning on the trin that nticl nat i wondere o the a thing tauto about it an foundet you picked off e i sher i call him and i've been tiking to him literally everyday then the got has come from australia he toldhim he looking at all the picksom apsales which is not sonding his hard to do cause every transaction with an oug teas on with cripto is all oblic that is how crypto works and the gos goig the transactions and the whole thing looked fishy to im why he asked were you lowering the price of all the tiles when demand for them was high is it he did not know exactly what kind of ripoff can was running te me no sens let you thouht it i hat to be gan or else i wer the complet more on it that al li tou ton and a ly i thi a mive ye more on that and then he tol me that cripto pot o get criptor punks cripto punks ar this big i conic an of te and th these little acartoons they are punks ety's punks with mohogs or died hare all of them slightly to ferent there ten thousand of them cu easy t understand and they caught on celebeitye's bought them jaiss srme to williams highty clom snop dog and a big part of their value supposegly was that they were among the earliest and of tes any one ever made they were market of that way is the original eneg tea the first an of tea the average price of a cryptor punk when comes talking to the guy an australia three hundred to four hundred thousand dollars each each guy n australia was picl map is he year older than cryptor punks and i that la eryn why your what e wort a or that you thithing on not e hevil million les ly teveral hundred million unles you kea shering out tit te bi ta that wit i all thray in words rit er lest for wel were the words he used i de i ei te tov do yo pi do i it the gi from australia said it did not make sense to lower picse maps price at all again crypto punks were selling for four hundred thousand dollars and an was reducing icel map to a thousand dollars and the guy and australia had a prime suspect for who might be benefiting most from this odd behavior for who might be behind all of it there was a bt a bot the purchased a thousand picsa maptiles the lowest price and then watch the price double and doubl again and again and again the bot the bot was the biggest owner of picl map ever was behind the bot e made a tono money i remember ham thing e yo think on the bot cancs fir thought adamac bride after o it was adamac bride who tolked ho into doing this alogical thing of lowering the price but then he thought do atomac bride had the con o money it a thousand tiles cost more than a million dollars swee ad another suspect or rich guy someof you could be the money behind adamac bride and i jus tin to say i know this is the very random name to be putting out of the air and putting into the story but the rich guy can suspected was the president of the philadelphia seventy sixtors taro mori darro mori who very publicly has talked about leving an ff teas and who can suspected because adam showed him thet moy had bought a few tas of picsl map very early even befour adam re lunch the sight affi shal for adam told the world by it how do to do that maybe he also created the bot quietly snag an extra thousand tiles lat am omus turn that is ye the adam or deral or commanation the got thin i am trying to prove it tat yet lat lit lik i do i do not kno for sure it it literally thee the likhe you that would ave no that er o yet the thou r it la right at the ver beginning yen rea be had a right to get it the adam told me lik you fifivearly telling me the only way would work if i i thent it wor on i not even thing that tut the lower the pride and ay get a ot that e tossibl e i th i do not want to be i do not want to be rude but it sounds adam probably asked you to go ver the price he could buy more of them cause he knew the pray happn i a lot ye and any othe tholsan of them have you asked adam no it to why not o i be ly the playing te stupic hart because i'm trying to get prue of it you there i ly point tero one persent chan that you did not you i d even o how of you possible thit ny ham i want to know if it ham or it him in derel or whod it cannot i ask yho why be mad at adam you did not know what you had he he made you a millionaire and he is also on the intranate making the mark at for you he is actually finding buyers for you he is talking it op he is making the whole thing happen why should not he make money who who carries if he gets who cares if he owns a thousand of them you own nine hundred of them and you'l make lot of money you you tent my my life an tho no a thet te e you re them tha in li wi when i give him a half million dollars i i think you because i when oll more on i cannot how to you hel that tha tec ti di that but i i've jus taving that to the tory o ca im o i the other part of that thou wit when ye was telp talking me te first tay he told me i not cou e you have to be thoming in it for you why would you do t iu yeu tonly tily doing at ea hem joys making people ha te and if i wont rewarding a thing of it i can if not you you the part of it him just lying outright an graving the bellin i it is more boting an to blind to me i just not nife his golling and to mind bending the sguy who would seem such a pow supportid could been playing him for a succer along ribbing him off at the exact moment he was making can richard than he ever imagined he would be you do not know much bat cripto to know that it is rife was scamps of all kinds can wanted to figure out who was behind the bot tas he wanted to understand what did just happen to him was he the rupe who was ni eve that he in youven realize that his pocket was being picked what was real and what was not in this new world he suddenly found himself in we read to stand ton four days later can tax me saying there is news and we get on the thound it is september leven his birthday whe had a little bat how it is been conve weed birth tday to have mose of his life but that is not the news yes as coved but it is a mild case that is also not the news it' what is knew well he isn't pending lot of time trying to understand what is realy hapening with an ough teas especially with adamac bride in the guise who buy these historic and of teas and hes convinced it is pretty ugly yet it thot tham me the li i have proof olt the at i for lenglage i you to the are doing ta tactivly wit poject hat te pothat it is really thought e whol l lat ther do lik i do not think it a legal ut i gont nothing any that the legal in i think it usually wrong an o that thical butther no log about it toitly i bn't toming fom the pirson made the ftectant in at te af i have it rigt i do not thing it you ticking i thit he means and of teas i think it the horrible fam that is tring over people by the whole thine can said that he sees everything that adamac bright in his gas you do ing cas the have con of adopted him and cluded im in their chat groups on discord discorded om if you do not know is a chatside adam a first to the guyes in his discord group is the apes a i nit you len a what other tha a lonkit an it just peopll thet er w tit youl y an you eic about enout e i win it find out about one bet ut goan rate riin that is galled aping in it is a worthy derection here a lot in the and of t world one day gom an of t is the board apes yacht cob to show me u what is horrible about what out am's doing can calls me back from his computer s we can shar is screen tust ting there we go wersirry ti me well and my mecriphon was not likenit this the moment i see him for the first time he is quin cot short hair neagly trimmed berd and the general vib of the friendliest most sincere tec suport guy in the world fors job he dis vidiall calls in front of green screen with a really nice microphone and that is what he has in this call he goes ut to open up adam's discord group and of t yorcheologist her tis and this just happened that two forty four pm just few months ago adam said alri everyone please do not twe or send thiself to anyone i wont to keep this opportunity to this community only this is hal ye always does at this is what he did with pixel noug i jisent know the croup yet but din mac bride's doing right here is he is rolling out another one of these historic and af t is this pticgo one is called ether t h ye r o was created it when he eighteen to yours after picel map pickel map ta most people never noticed it back when i was created but now adam's goingto helpe relaunch it the way that adam yo launch picksel map iu'll get people finally pay money for what a basicly hin this case virtual imaginary buildings in he virtual digiral city cann't i i read the conversation that is happening in the chap mc bride is telling the apes that is all buy in to this and get out thereun tuitter tell everybody we know buy it is well he is basically saying go crazy on ather ether an te hel say it and to make this especially appealing to the apes mc bride says that he is negotiated with the guy who created ather to offer ather to his apes it a special o price quo well below what i think that ben asell for and to get the special o price he tells them he is gon a hold alive even on discord a nine a m eastern time on sunday the apes ere fond adam that is a fantastic opportunity for us all thanks for this much appreciated you ther go ant im sundays next day ha nine am the apes gather get ready it is coming up at any second here s every there is the voice of adamac bride in the discord you hear him but you do not see him you see is screen sher as he coicks on various stuff and to ive you a sense of the very hoppy let us make a deal tickal look ot what is behind the curtained vibe but the whole thing here is the moment when he gave fifty of his apes the chance to sign up to buy ether on the cheepe for on three hundred forty bogs he told the apes a sign of sheet was about to go live i am going to in the next minute or make that public an the first fifty of you gue who pace your name in there woeuldn'it give you private stail link get ready do you stuff ready i hope you are allready rit now be ti at's some poing the next seconds ah you guys tell me if you see tit is all my gollot boom apigh the sign of she dis appeard names start filling in uis er fast i see my man cerya collect or got in ther lets se who else got in the top for sure a shibers got in here ugly punk yo got in there for sure bot om bally nice space lo a goul t see brother you got in there for sure that that is just a ine to have some sort of ep age i ot osseible i think apis is olways appreciated on an i holpe yo gat ii do i o oanall this stuff that ataman bride did it is effective it pushed up the price of ather i'some point in this cannot took me to a site called open sea which is a the big trading potfarm with people buy in sell an og teas we watch as he apes to send from the trees and grab ather yes is tewers says see two minutes three minutes for meutes tat see the price is going out it wast point one for whatever there is one that just wornt for three point nine a guarantee it is son be going crazy by this evening thit is good be crazy actually right now you should go by ether cas lie git is about to go up be yet i just lhing to do that but yet its abelt that is whattin happene shortly a to say thi's kind of amazing sitting there watching the numbers go up knowing that this was as close to a sore thing as i would ever gat ose i free money rit there but i'm i did byinin by monday the average price of ather had risen from two thousand dollars to five thousand dollars that is in one day when double osom mend tof the fifty apes who sind up on adam's list tuthe special old price of three hundred forty dollars each of them now on something worth five thousand dollars a little hier yet little bit better this cis could just get out and though 've just made out bandits al ready yes yes but out em's doing is working yes you just witery kind of rold your eyes te matter the reason that i rolld my eyes is because it is it is as yer some things some one's making money the matter what and when they do there means some one's losing money and basically the earlier you are the better it is if tes befor other people baslay tor one of these people you are going to make out really well n lat's of other people can believes lose money t we saeing in his view is a classic pumpan dom something that if yeu did t in the stock market would be whodly wegal the apes get in early talk up a thern twitter en courage other peopleto by which pushes up the price in a couple of days wen the prices the highest they sou tiking o quick onsizable profit about the hipe the and of teas price falls in anybody left holding it takes a beating lose money fact to day in the months since that day when adam weganched ather the priceis plometed it is now down as well as nine hundred dollars some days very different from those early booming days on is five thousand dollars and i do not think that many peops made people as you think you are going to make the money every apning here it is probably going to do oke but it is i can be good for the people else ie hup on the train last and that is what ken things is knd of evil about the world of an of tes why thinks there is scam and should not exist seeing ow this may me wonder if any of this is actually ilwegal and i've now talk to a bunch of lawyers about it lawyers who deal withan of teas and cripto and security fraud and putting two who advise companies that relasan of teas and i described what i saw adamac bride do in relaunching ather and all of them told me that and if teas are new the lawis still pretty vague there've been many los suits or much government inforcement in an ouf teas but they pointe to two things that could be problematic look at first if adam in the apes were pumping and dumping specifically if they were lying about either wore about their own trading that would be an issue if they were going unto twitter and telling people that eithere is a great investment worth seeking money and two for the long run but then if they themselves only held on to it for a few days unti the rice rose and then they sold it that would be a wegal that would be market manipulation the second thing the lawers pointy to transparency is key if adam i was going out giving a special price to fifty people to generate bus an excitement that is a normal kind of promotion and lots of industries when boyer says he said that cound be fine buthe key to that being of cay is it adam would need to disclose it all publicly that any possible investor can find out that some people got a special cheoper price thadam did not do that he ould be danger of some invester they be somboty lost money they ter suing him over holding back that information ook at was adam crossing the line into illegality with either of those things gen stold in that proof in that either way as or the bt that mysterious bot purchase a thousand pick som maptiles a forth of all the tiles kn started away there was someone much more sinister then adam behind the pot one day tects me panic about what h's learning about the pot scared about it that he does not know if he wants to go on the radio any more ik es this wort partis just an confry gell an is jus is is it somha figure an i thinke thet o account that on you dell is just much much bigger he sent me a screen shot that showd that the count had done nearly two bilian dollars and trades specivicy its one point eight for billion since was created fourteen months before this not some normal person this is e plet jit im ma la smark polike grue a that people lik its ay very well or can is hin you do not thin it is possible that it is just a bunch of investers ar lke the gru noat adam as assembled around down where it slam no a hundred people and together they have lout of money i do not i do not think he is si this te ked ertlin yes may be working for thi strup or something that he is not ave i do notly smart enough to be lik this you wouln't be doing what is doing if theotes' money this is i wholly differently give someone ye gould be the resson mofer something as undridiculous the this only one account tik people that hav en is money itre oing that ave a behaviour i're not in to people la bloin the wistle on them boin the whistle he means talking about the publicly on the radio inow here no good movis were the person that places me makes its to the end and has a happy life she is ayly the persons me get's kille wait there whistleblarm if is for the whistleblar makes it to the end and wivs iknow i litteally do not have i dn't have a sense they do not have l o the that i somin thing i alyk no et inde an i'm py the only persons doesnit have agan and the sa tak i i seriously legentimal feel my name being one story cud resoll an me not extisting ore my family ey alegen of that om ta notl you atery ti that is olike ul i tell him on the call and later any mau that i respect any throice he mags and of course it is fine if he drops out of the story but is he right about that one pointy billion in trades coun the botjus be making a ton of trades with a much smaller amount of money maybe the bots even buying from itself to drive up the price of an of tas that something hat happens in the anf tea world can he mels bat sis maybe him right ter may we not there we's getting a new tool that could tell us how much money is really behind all those trades get to sot if ery really thinks it the criminal syndicate pined all this get a better sense of how much risteris for him her's getting is soffor developed by a company called chainalisis atd is usually used by governments and long forcemen and financial institutions to trat who is doing what an nf teas and cripto it could tell can what the bout was buying and selling and to who what re their accounts an adracted with a tocktin to the chain halisist people to a can rote me a few days pass what can use to the chan halisis told k at who boton sold picks om maptiles with what the bot was doing than then he tects me i've lots o bupdas wa's wrong about premuh everything what he found and my conversation with the bot runnyin gis behind the bot that is an minute rchicago boa gradio went our programm continues tsis mari om li from our glass to days programm the regluctan explorer we have the story of somebody yo finds himself in this new world that he never ask to be part of and you decides to take to look around to figure out the truth of what is going on i came along for the ride we are right now in themiddle of our story about kan erwin and picksl map and before we go further in that story a thing that this might be a god moment to explain of what an f teas are an o one more detail for everyone who is gottin this foreiner story and still actually does not know what they are oke inf teas their images or art work or vidior cliffs are busily anything that you can post on line the key thing that makes them an an f tea is it' some one can say they own it and ownership is possible is a record of who owns the an of tea get stored on some they called a block chain and lots of people knof what block chan is but lots of people do not some just going to say the block chain is a set of computers the're all over the world and they all store exactly the same data and anybody can look at that datof the aa public ledger that anybody can read blockchains store the records of whoons which and of teas who ons cripto currenceas and wright now all kinds of people are inventing all kinds of things to throw up on the block chain it is a messe and arcic chaos realy one end of things you have the in b a selling vidios of great dunks as an of tas esily reinventing sports trading cards for the cripto world very old school vor a commercial tat the other end you have stof a be bburned a banks of print and then the digutal copy of the print a picture of the print for we more than the original ever caust that one o was lot of a criptorsuffin that hi's kind of making fun of the whole idea that anybody would think with the in oftea is worth anything the original banksy print actually had thi sentence as part of the image wo i cannot belivein morans actually by the what some pick up our story where we left off at to and the time of chimpansees was a monkey what have you figure ot since we las but everything literally everything ye youare your assure you ai fi doll kens crean chairs ma i can see how the chain alisis of where map somebody is cripto transactions and i have to say it is a very satisfying chart to look at wi dots o different colors and bines

mora president in seventy six years erol thes also not the body i li can you was the bot i rep can started wiol get everything the bowas doing he found that who ever made the bot had not covered their tracks completely can spt of this one address that the bot sent money two it was different from all the others i got really lucky on this one lucky because he oss to found the same address on a message for it asking for fat ether yes fatether tork im as use fakether test new pieces of cod the writing tat you you never do thes o some one else's at dress you always do with your i actually did

qorted the rings fans i asked them about the one pointy for billion dollars in transactions and the said they have about a hundred million dollars to they inbest wit and thay to spend that over and over they toldly neart it out when we talked about pixl mat they have decorated oabunch o their tiles e e go to the picks om ap dot io webside you caue se whule the combined to bunch of their tiles to write goon ands mothers to write dondon i to big conavouncs this is all a can i say very different from what can imagine that the bot was controlled by a murderous criminal scyndicat by somebody in weeg with adam ac bride trying to swindo on the ta i shot he but it as a it probl press was the biggest impressed cause we cannot fondthe first guys get hop account he looked at the cod he would written a looking through is self is this tas dosnt' god cot just as a develver is a god da ti super impress an for me an is one of my people which of course is kind of reassuring in a small world the monsters we imagine are not real sot away but athe same time i would onse say there was som dis a pointen a wer sons weetlike i deat li did not onc you it ti other too m yet bullike i really thought that is goin dalyk blor the cover on this huge ly yeu tik a i tho thers e o be suiperacle the othere is something i there is something exciting about the thought if i i'm going on cover a mass of criminal senticet but ra last the presenc of y sisters yety that that is a cuoe story in ba ebe bat okcase is the bas not adam and doesn' have anything to do with adam what was adam's anglewhy dey insist on lowing the price picks im map much was he pumping an domping pikl mat another on of teas do that carn' suspected him of being this tin face master mine up to kno good never i had no idea literally no idea thoug suspectin me this crirs is adam bride in me tock i went into detail about all the things the kenn ad ispected him of i red him quotes were kenn said that there was point o one percent chance that adm was not deliberately ripping him off adam itseemed truly amused by this this just crazy 's crazy but you kdo not i get it ii understand his thought prises it make sense but at the i mean when i hear it it is shocking i wouldner even thought about doing that a sprice smor money talk to adam that adam got hooked on an of teas only six months before he pud ken into that world people basy would happened his a march of last year a bunch of these quoten quote his storeic old an of teas would be discovered itstror to making tons of money i mean it just it is tit flipped the switch in my brain holy ca it was literally all mi got there is gold get your shovel go dik cause there is gold there all you got a do wis scill find it for the next four months he says he spent ten hours a day searching for other early an of teas by gogoing phrases digitle collectables blocching or t blocching collectables eif on fifteen or twenty old an of teas at seemin than min work but must an then he says there was some problem in e which on programmanger whateveer they made them unsuitable seler day he did find a few that were suitable and then he and a friend found picxol map and from the beginning they thought it would be a big hid if they coud just convince its creator to lower the price and the reason that they lordit much by that point adam at a little experience and the only the one end of to relanch i failed thaut we set that price too high and it it failed which whom mi says thit is called at easerization peep it idn' by enough for them they did not buy enough of it he made his best guest for mixam atsprice ye and work that better than any an of teas done before or sents pep just when not yet it was a rocketship i mean a complete rocket ship how many tos did you buy three imaddit i miidt you kdon it is funny because i was not looking i was more looking for you the famin recognition thin the money i do not even kno what to say ye it was just it was more about look at mac bride he rediscovered this is is awsom it get to be cleary he did make a half million dollars off this the money that can handed him is a thank you but he did not know that was goin to happen usually he says the an o t creators give him nothing an nobody's given him close to this much he does when io make money an an f teas but whut adamac bride also once just as much it seems is it he once to make his storic an f teas thing get them respect creat a much larger community that sind to them that is his angle if he succeeds he had hoe make money on all the historicle and f teas that he owns personally but it is also now become kind of a personal mission for him he once historic and of teas to be remembered and valued and for that reason he is not pumping and dumping with his own an f teas i's no dumping he still holding on to his tiles of picks em at and th other historic an f teas hes longe can actually looked at adam's transactions with the cn alisis tol and confirmed tat in all the transactions that he could find adam bys a few an of tes of each of his projects anthe basicly just holds on to them as to the other big feature of a pumpadum scheme deception i coudn't find any examples of adam lying about the n f tas he promotes or making false promises about how much money people would make when it comes to the other concerns of the lawyers that i talkd to about adam and the way that he released that n f tea ather to fifty of his apes hat dispecial low price just remind you they said basically if people were getting a lower price adam needed to disclose that to the world t anybody who might be considering buying ather well i i actually do do that with ather it was not twitter before we did any sort of give away or opportunity anybody could ave joined that discord anybody could have got it in we wanted more people in that is som not true at all after we talked i went back and looked at adam's tweats fon back than an he never tweeted about the fact that you coul get a really low price on ather by coming to this even whethey he a held the even at all i fact whn discorred a he is saying to his followers things do not tweed or send this out when to keep this opportunity to this community on way keep it on the down lowl he did mentione the give away in a post that he did on medium after it happened we got back on the line ir don i'm doing good i don pretty good memory is he funny thing in it mo leds we weave with our very men it is funny he told me that when he went back and looked at what happened with ather he realized beck than he saw a chance tes the discounted and of tes to reward the people in his discord my gis which he calls the alphi discord o even though it is a public community anybody can join it at that point an time it was people why are we in the alpet discorde for not getting any alsa alpa in the n f ta world mains special information in tell stop everybody else dosn't have yet ri why are we here if you are not gon to give us some awsome inflo ri and this os trying to reward people ud who were in there for a while he tolod me that this was all in the spirit of creating a larger community of people who valued these historic and f teas wa in general i have to say the fact that adam did not think to disclose this special give away that did o the apes just shows how much tea and much of the n of ta words just making it up as they go alon everyone is still tinging out what laws er an a pit of tham there was his moment when i struck to adam where i told him exactly how much disclosure the lawyers thought would be smart for him to do to avoid losses is eeryand it was news to adam that is good o it is good advice than i i i hear it i think i've acted approprately i think intention matters i feel pretty good about what i've done that is what all the criminal said a well we will see com visit me a jail ir will you please co visit me a jail the noup in a haf years since my initial phone calls with cam half a year whe is been trapsing around the en of tea world and found himself transported to he is act ben more and more r lokl not exactly an eight bet but theverolly more teap cowerint and if teas do not seem evil to him any morei fact the exact thing that he thougt was terrible nd of teas that get hight every piles on is the price rises and the people sall and take a quick profit leaveng lots of losers in the way he is now speculated that himself they money on a few things lost money on others he says with those then of teas with most en of teas he thinks actually everybody knows the prices going to up for a loiottle while and then crash and everyone knows that n e won jus tryin to timement time when will sell if you time it right then yid you pretty well it is it definly feels a ad game sort of em the more i am in the space the more it feels for all kind of eticasy now and there is no because there are not hy rules it is fair everyone is doring the sae f of thing and i do not think there is anything morally wrong with it i god wit ide ont l yu i different then you were bi yo e youav been corrupted whit changed him exactly the whol an of tea world started bok different to him the moment he realized he was in being scam suddenly it did not seem hed landed in a dark woods full of thieves trying to take advantage of him yes the reason why i was angry untill that point was i thought that it was it in house thay'd been lied to by adam this entire time and then to find out thet he actually did a really ga job of relunching it and he actuallyhe was helping me rites hea realis ic always sic cand ow not thi stranger actually did something good for me yes and he literally did not charge me yes i tippd thim bat am i know if he never existed and i somehow knew that i should relunch pickshem up and loss sit i would not have done his gi of a job i'd no idea are not anything that is not my skill set yes now he he was bu jet can nol men a bout to developers ham who warrent scammers tif he is buying in f teas for fun as ik he found his people and whole an of tea world seemed less ominous not that he thnks very much of most ent of teas ninety nine per cent of imye things are pretty much john he intended his johnk to make wit bock ut just mis conceived ideas in the first place tadis not an unusual opinion i was interesting to me tat the biggest and of tea enthusiasts that i talk to for the story people really love an of teas they prety much agreed with that at imac bride says ninety nine per cent of all an of teasruis to day wirl probably nd of being worth nothing he says tha most people probably should not get into en of teas right now the bot goes but the number at ninety per cent worthless i read that one of the big and o tea mowls ivery vaner chop but hec ted the ninety eight per cent o men of teas would whois money cans life these days he in the same house he was before all this a vic torian wit trarkquoi shutters and nomes and trinkets

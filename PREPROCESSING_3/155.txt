when a doctor charlotteholdman she spent thirty five years working with defenseteams on death pounty cases go es a very high profile cases but yhu had not given an interview to the press and decades ever since an incident were she had if heu drinks to the reporter it said some things she was unhappy to see im print an it was embarrassing and i thought well i den' have to quit drinking or quit doing interviews and when ready to quit drink and yes iso this interview is very rare event for me i have not done any kind of interviews with the mediestersday he five and you are ending the moratorium in this one instance for this story why well a fluffy red combed leghorn deserves his moment in the sun ima just the image and i no not talking about any chicken i'm talkingtiv at you can just picture his you beautiful leghorn his tail purked up and that red comb sittin a kind of a rakish angle on his head n his had kind o cock to the side he looks at you with his little eyes that is what this story is a that is not just what this story is about that is what a lot of tody's radio show us about bi can newer days of our radio sho once a year during the highest portry consumption time in the country which is of course o think about this fir a second you can guess the answered this it is the weeks that begin with thanksgiving and go through christmas in new years i win during that period for years on our show we had a tradition here we would devt n entire hour of our programm to stories of chickens turkeys tocks foul of all kind and an omage to chicagofs poetry slams which hav spread across country but were created at the greenmill bar on the north side by poet marksmith we named these programm's poultry slamp's poultry but jus nt bequit bef wer begin the word slam we are using that with no malice toward any bird of any kind at all the birds were hurt ne birds were slaughtered the birds were slamed in the making up to day's programme and we have incredible stories to day incredible enough that at least one woman has ended a quarter century moratorium or talking to the press to be here with me and you should do d be easy chicago its this maricing life i morar glass stay with us at on withness for the barbacution charlotteholdman did not yous get the idea of calling a chicken as a witness in a murder case out of the blue she is working on this case and what gonnot call thesky harry and there was no question of the guy had killed somebody is one byt whether he done it is jus about what sentence he would get he had sat on death row at san quenton for ten years but sharlote says he was gets a frenic with an ni cue of fifty eight and just ot of touch with reality he wanted the things he did a he wrote messages in symbols on little pieces of toilet paper and rolled him up in a ball and had done this free years on death re rolled te little secret messages up in a ball and then rolled them an fe ses his own faces and then to little tiny beadsized balls and put thos into the brads in his hair ohma said that they dangled around his forehead and anyane thinks he was beening in his hair nndand from his point of view that with a communicating some information the little messages exactly but he could not tell me wha the messages were bec caus they were secret i woen over talk to about his mother he would tell me she lived in a cocacolacane it is agains the low to execute somebody who is crazy he does not understand why he is being executed and show it sai that was true for the sky hen i would say do what is going to happen on the twelfth of june a he with kind o be fuddled and i with pressure he would finally say will yout he thought he was going to be reapholstered the say to calforna did not agree with shoit about the sky they wanted you execute him in thirty days show its team o was making a last ditch appeal to stav this execution me while the state was gathering its evidence sand quinton sent in a prison psychiatrist to determined was he competent to be executed did he know he was going to be executed and did he know why he was goin to be executed the psychitrist goes and interviews hary and then the psychiatrist testified in court that not only was harry aware that he was going to be executed she was sertain of this because she had played chick tack to with him and harry had beat her well it was absurd and and outside of ie normal experience in court room and this s after yuof thirty years of beeing deathpenalty cases in the south around the world and a i really could not believe she had said it but ad the same time the only image that came to me im from the psouth obviously a and grown up we always went to a the midsouth fare and they had a chicken that played chick tacto that absolutely mismarized me and it was pretty clear to me aka we have got to find a chicken who can play cick tecto show i thought and this is not a joke it is not an exaggeration she thought that a chicken that could save this man's jurys after a and to believe the state and it is witness's and a chicken that could totally under mine the psychiteris testimony by proving that playing titato does not mean that you understand things why you are being executed i just knew a chicken would work ie just sad saye but i think a chicken has more credibility than a the defence team did and and i think it would have but brought the jury over to see in us his people rather than is the obstruction as who were interfering with tha an execution and who can dout a chicken n you cannot you d bed chickens are got a lie a chickens have a integrity i had this image of of the psychiatrist being on the stand an i wuld quietly inner through the wouden doors as they open with this beautiful legone under my arm rit and the cone at a racishon and as i walked into the court room not saying a word quietly took a seat on the front road the psychiatrist who we knew because we would investigated her backgrounds from new york sitty would see a person with a chicken and thing quie is that oh my god no an that si hiatri would slowly realized that she was going to have to play chicktakto with a chicken your trying to syk out you ere trying to get inside the psychitris head t he made at a chitris in on a rival even before you for your stoa jurys eyes as a wariness overcame her it couldnat it wouldnat work with the frazled chicken an i did not want a splotchy beat up tired exhausted chickeni wanted a chicken that could capture of the audiences attenction in this case audience was the jury ri i nee t nt eet tit g i ti chickeng in a cartune look i had to have a chicken that cou tick on the psychiatris it i a do be stand up chicken no a we began to hunt for this stand u chicken for the tassa fell to the ilegal inturns a man was citor to diet that pointing less than two weeks and they needed a chicken and they searchd the paces that you find ticktak toe playing chickens namely countifeirs carnivals and really within hours they found a tiktaktoe playing goose in montana but corcharlotte says that was totally unacceptable i mean guases are nanty you nother bite you there theyare not i d wanted goose of running round the courtroom chicken some one next was guido roadside standwyoming who did have a chicken and it did play tik tak toe but he said that a flying or driving it to california for the trial would probably upset it much that he could not guaran tee that it would win the game of chicktak toe he was out finally they find a fellow yin arkansaw who trains chickens to play tick taktoe and he had a whole wist of chickens that he trained around the country and he sent the legal teem to one of those birds in san francisco that turned out to be a dead end a sevetisco had actually passed an ordinance banning the playing of tik tak toe by chickens is animal cruelty fortunately another chicken on the list was not far from there at the board walk its sanicruws they had their chicken the next elt was to convinced the court to let us bring the chicken to court as a witness as demonstrative evidence to introduced the chicken and let the chicken play thick tek toe now of course i wanted tha chicken to play tik tak toe with the pcychitrics but i realized you nut yet thet most likely no one was going to let us get away with that but i di that in of us you kne i re healthy group of in turns tanon how to play tiktak toe that we could demonstrate to the jury that play tiktak toe did not mean that you were aware of your cot the consequences of your actions why would not why would not you be allowed to make the pcychiatris play tik taktoe with the chicken li can understand why the pcychatrist would not want to do it but from a legal point of view what what lined does that cross well evidently i agree with you but i the court fail it never dressed issue of having to played the that the pcychitris but the court sell that bringing the chicken into the court room to play tik tak toe wul degrade the dignity of the court i thought that the dignity the court was degrated by executing a a leal person i the court denied our motion and said we could not bring the chicken into the court room for a demonstrative evidence it rules against us they were not even allowed to show the jury of vidio of the chicken playing tictak toe and without a chicken on the stand without a vidiew of a chicken the jury found the pschiatris credible and ruled to execute charlott's client his life was saved later on a pea and in the ar since then in two thousand to the spremcourt rule that a person at his level of mental retardation cannot be executed for charlott though the story stays with her the story of the chicken because in decates of doing these capital trials bringing hundreds of witness is it is the greatest court remove she ever invented bringing in the chicken and she never got to try it she invented thes thing she never got to try it it was snatched away from her somethng that sticks in your crow well yell because i did not get to do it but it is also because of the nature and quality of a chicken when you di this kind of work you knowing you'r down in a the worst part when youre trying to work for o tet literally the community wants to keep it can be pretty discouraging that men with nice fluffy leg horn brightened up your day you for john and now i tis ow tis is not ti you do make light of death of punishmen of people with no retardationn bin wor min ea or a chickens thank youg not and yean know it is really not i i actually am a member of peter charlottehole man the new orleans tey shows ta re run we first brought cast the story back in twenty eleven in the ear sense capital punishment was suspended in the state

heat odly enough it was not susan who was obsessed with chickens it was kenny a bowl work back stage at the ninety second street wy in new york his house was filled with chicken cups chicken masks he got the whole staff on to chickens including susan for a time there in the aties poultry related jokes in references became the fast way to get a laugh at the wy i guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens but susan fituche saw something else theire potential greatness theyre hidden beauty ther grandeur one day she glew together some finger puppets for a ten minute randition of the chicken little story for her nephew that was fourteen years ago to day it is a fullength opera enjoyed by a cull following whenever it goes up in a workshop or cafe or

just a real opera we far was just a bunch of papa's in a box with a good idea and then suddenly sis t when into italian it became something bigger than what it had been and it is because when it is in englis we all can of nowwhat and sreally not that iteresting is i gayaya as soon as is in italian it gives us a nough distance that we can come in makes us he is the the lover who does not want you you do not want anybody more than you want the one who does not want you ri at's a that sort of the same thing oaonnno eme untenyle oote aad n eaodyou may recall that when you last heard of little back in ginne garden she was just an average barn door fowl who had an acorn drop on her head which she mistakenly understood to be the sky falling her alarms excited her friends goosy lucy turkey larkey and ducky lucky and they join her for a journey to the king to tell him the important news on the way they met up with sly fox little's pals eagerly accept his invitation for dinner literaly as it turns out fortunately for little hunger is not enough to distract her from her mission and she tracks on when she meets the king he tells her that the skiies not falling sjust an acorn the enlightened shick em little returns to her croup and that is where the story ends what are we to take away from littles experience i to think it is that little is rewarded with life precisely because

perfectly dred cornishes could not achieve standard of perfection to day and even in this goofy unbird situation an hour of watching them makes clear just how hard it is to everyget birds to hit the standard which is to say now only c we can pike downna every aspect of the liges of chickens ther birst their fee her eggs er souter non only have we bread them to human specifications to me human needs an we have creator a standard of what het means to be a chicken thet most chickens hand never es that is with the standard mes we judge them as chickens and we find them i cang if they had the brains to nder stand us they would be right to feelin didnim bt of course this is a city persons perspective and that means that it is completely wrong heanded from the point of view of ant y ready rectually raises birds standing in the cold feed room i had a long long talk with george about this george is eighty years old ister mason birds sincete i as the calpol coolage administration and hes is the whole fun of raising birds is raising in to the standard well firsenc if your birds i lack bon ol can you bougt and by bird is near a em as you can was better bon but won you mad im to gather ye you might get long leged birds or too sharter an me you do not get what you want if i man ye takes four five years to gradually get it up and by that time there im britten braden you need new ones george tells me that when he is breeting a ne bach of birds ho had sixty five of them and we one or two will be anin wher nere the standard of perfection that is how hard it is do you get frustrated with the standard of perfection sometimes nal we get fuss shrade with the judger cause every judge has his oln ideal what the standard should be ot that that is ne point of the standard is that that that is that as but ta on judg you on at this way in another another to day if you bread your birds to the standard ferfection wait never thing and took him to the shoald you pi would not get anywhere you got a breed to the fats that is ree cross the bad serch straight wihe henish us these ta iscrese had shorter legs in the weel standard of perfection fet wul tell feathers out i also its to breuds that really should have them in the country among the chicken breeders they think abut a lot of things h never get to inicity an i get when your rasn tes pers ike i with any these bird o me d you have

water or nol too lad youput it on the standwich anything thit isin him george gives me a pamphlet that he is written up no doctor is actually checked him out to prove the cancer is gone from his body he is actually got no hard scientific proof that this really works but he says god told him that this is the way he should be spending his time andid is cut into his bird breading a bed george weeves

kids and then it got to be about seven pim he said he was could meet old friend and morissicgos al that is findyou know i'm here i can i can watch theo and he went out and about an hour and a half after that he called checkin on the kids theo answered and he said howse everything going was good goeswell i love you very much and i'll be home soont and we never saw spalding again the next series of events a still seemed a blur to me even five years later but the first thing i had to do was go report spalding missing i did that and then i decide to send the kids home back to sag harbour join the brother i stayed for two days did whatever i could which was pretty much nothing and after two days i just decided iofn going back to sagharbourd join all the kids i'm driving on the long island express way back to sag harbour and i get a fon call my southon and it was theo he was all excited and he said mamam we came home to day from school and there was a bird a little bird flying around the island in the kitchen i said in the what did you do next he said will we we falled the bird and marissa falled him into the bath room and she tried to calm the bird and she took a hat and cupped it over the bird and captured the bird and went outside and let him out free and i was just dum founded an an owstruck the first image that came to my head when he said that there was something a bird in particular ws a circling over this island was i thought of spalding and how for the last two years he had obcessively circled around that island talking to himself just circling in an total anguish you see two years before tht we had been in ireland celebrating his sixtieth birthday and the second day there spalding and i were in a horrible car accident spalding suffered enormous hedtroma on he was never the same they actually had to put titannian plate in his head he was in and out a hospitals for two years after the accident docter's prescribed various cocktails a pills for him nothing worked not even the a twenty electric shock treatments that he had and this second thought i had when i heard about the bird was was as the message from splding was he trying to tell us something weve never had a bird in or house before and i remember the irish have the saying that if you find a bird in your house after some one dies and it is alive the person soul is free and if you find a dead bird the person soul is restless and i remember spalding i'll never forget the story after his mother killed herself thirty five years before his father woke up the very next day and next to his bed where his slippers were on the floore was a dead bird and that story just stayed with me that night after the kids went to bed i went around the house and i was making sure that another bird could not get into this house cause i was not goto take the chance of another brd coming into the house and and dying i checked all the windows and i closed all the fireplaces to make sure to guarantee that there is no way a bird could come into our house and the next day i was at the dining room table reading the paper and i looked up and there was a bird across the table peering at me and i i just could not believe what i was seeing i yell out to the kids who are in the other room and they run in and the bird takes off and flies up the stairs and we all follow it and we go it goes into what is our office and it is perched on top of this window and i shut the door behind me and for some reason i held oup my hands thinking the bird my magically come to my hands and i go spalding it is o key your safe now it is o kay come to me and forest and theo on the other side of the door going mom why are you calling the bird after dad and the birches sat there staring at me and then it took off and it flew over my hands and in between the space and between the door and the floor it is scooted out went past the boys flew down the stairs and we had already opened up the kitchen doors and it flew out the kitchen doors and it was safe andit was gone the next day i'm in the kitchen and forest calls out from the tevy room he was watching cartuns it goes mom the bird's back it is at the end of the couch before ibeen going to the room i open up the kitchen doors just make sure we havenat exit for the bird and i run into the family room and sure enough thereis the brd and we do it is become a drill now this is the third day consecutive day with the bird in our house and we fall th bird around and t got this time it goes through the living room than it comes back into the kitchen and i actually got the camerout and i took a picture of it and the bird flew out just that it was gone and two months later they found spaldings pody and the easte river i think with suicide in particular it is it is really hard death to di just there is a lot of gilt you go back and back and you get into that mod of i should have done this i could have done that a it is it is a seas off of guilt and forgiveness last year was my forty seventh birthday and i was feeling kind of blue and i was really missing spalding and i wen on this on bike rut that the two of us used to take together and it ends up by the water and just before i got to the water i saw this little brownish gray bird sitting on the side of the road just the one that we had in our house and i passed by t on my bike i i ride pretty fast but something told me go back and i did in the bird was just sitting there and i get up close to and tim flyaway i figured the bird was hurt and i'm looking at the bird crouching over it and this jogger goes by me and he said oh that bird was there two hours ago when i startd my run i race back home on my bike and i went into the house and i collected a shoe box and i filled it with grass and bird sey got some ruper gloves and i drove back to where the bird was and the bird was sil there was about a mile from my house and it is just looking up at me i thought it was really hurd and i tried to scoop it into the shoebox and it just gets up looks at me and flies away there is nothing wrong with it wings were fine i saw it flying off into the distance and i thought it just hit me a ton of bricks right at that moment there was nothing i could do to say this ind isent little bird which in the end he was fine he flew away and there was nothing i could do to say spalding cathy

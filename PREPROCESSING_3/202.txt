a quick warning there are curse words that are on beeped intoday's episode of the show if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our websight this american life dot work from do eu beat usy chicago if this american life on contajoffy walt sitting in frira glas i've been talking af people lately about their jobs something is going on with jobs right now people are leaving thaam they want to leave them where we do our jobs is changing what we do and i've been especially interested in people who are designated essential workers i think for the stay at home types people me aur jobs changed in very obvious ways but for people who continued to go to work in person ther jobs changed too but those changes were sometimes last visiball for example carrey breen he is a carpenter worke pe the near city department of education fixing things in schools spraing last year when all the schools shut down for covet carrey was inter what that meant for him until he heard noo he should still come in repork to work well the fect that the deem tos essentialy kind of founded h little comic on the beginning bhat doors creakd for years that floors cre es all sen to days in wordency towards essential salla kee was a docter or grocery store worker most of orword is repairing floors doors ah sealings sitter down batroms forn a part he is a favorite sert of tesk on monday morning if you get a sign doors are you a mardors or is there one ta e realy lake i would not say these af favorite my favorite is when the building has not elevater because you have get doors on the fith floor of e building and you have get a carry doors o wai sentially couple hundred pounds up and then back tim carrey is practical in this way carrey's been a carpenter for thirty five years he ise us wo volunteer fire fetter irish tots about as kids alat he is going to work and theyre getting a lot done because there is no kids around with the covid schools empty things we gettin pain ted things were gettin fix i've never seen schools of good and then april couple weeks after the schoolds closes carrey goes in for his team meeting where they tell every one what they'r working on next a it was i believe e at thirsday or friday afternoon i bossas we have get a project coming up next week an we an astore to buill cffins he repeated it we will be building coffins for the city of new york nobody ins shop believe do wi in a get buid coffins and he produced ta set a plans and showed him to us an sa were can start next week monday morning carey goes to work and we had to go to a high school a into a chimnasium thit was set up as a rudimentary shop a with hay scogymnasium lake but basketball lines on the floor can it yes we all get up there an there was actually af proto type of what we had to buill standing an example coffin yes antially have a picture well they showed you that prototype yes it is a simple box standing on its end where a person's feet would be and it is open the cover is not attached yet it is just leaning against the bax in the background you can see a score board abaskebol that and a championship banner e basy plywood in two by for box i built some strange things over the years but at netr built coffin a mylic very quickly the jim became a workshop they set up cut stations and assembly stations electricians ey men toin tougt ventoation ban thorg all the to ut n about ten carpenters got to work and we start o bring in drafts supplywet which as fifty sheets at a time and we had six draft supply would and two drafts of to by fords and they did not give us an end or but we were just told this is your job for now we started and we ran through all the material got more material ran tor that got more material my god they really need this many mad i ask carried did they know where the coffins were going no did the carpenters talk about what the boxes were for no we just kept working we wuld get up to about a hundred and fifty until we had a very large stack of him was almost a wall across the gem from one end to the other weady put a hundred and fifty coffins and a hay school gen straight across the bask willcort from one end to the other wake tocked on top of yes we would stack him about five or six hige until we got pallets in the we placed ten on a palet shrink rap im and i would take a fork left and back him in to the elevator i drive him out on to the street and up the street through the school yard down the next street unto the back of a tractor trail and getting honked at for a foreclift ta gust ho slow theare honging at you where you ere driving the coffins yes and in three weeks of doing it not one person in neighborhood ever asked a question whatar those or what areyou doing do you weu waiting for somebody to ask you i found a bizar that nobody asked it maybe nobody made the connection or maybe nobody wanted to make the connection it just seemd people were going about their lives and until the final load where e one i who spoke spanish only walks past me he just says morta and makes sort of a slicing motion across is nack and i just said see and he shook his head and just walked away in the and carrystean belt four hundred and fifteen coffin ther are carpenters and others cos too altogether they built fourteen hundred has i been tagging to people about their jobs people and mota different jos that were deemed a tenchal bobody's lot seventeen months i we very regularly find myself faing something that i had no idea that happened what wend yet do keep o know that that hoppens it was not for public knowledge i think nobody knew how to handle it i'm sure the schools did not want ay were building coffins over here sat something on the highlight but now thet things are wating and a right you can cantle let that out yther's tha sort of part of what we ard about what just happened is that lake there were people who hat to do things that that just normally are never offd of in your job and it wasnit a war and but lake if it was a war ann after a war you go ver wat hoppen yet this is how many people doe this is how many plains we built to trucks we whatever were the fact that somebody built coffins and ie gold jen in the bronks yes there is going to be an a counting the it will be the weird stats that come out of somewhere and this is one of the stranger ones four hundred and fifteen coffens market down that happened a year and a half ago we ask more than fifty million americans to continue going to work because they had essential jobs and they did nurses and doctors and also mail carriers and waitresses and construction workers child cair workers carbage collectors all worked through this once in the centory emergency and now wer canty use to it were focus on what is next but do we even know what just happend an remember calling to check in on someone early in the pandemic she works in customs at the air port and she told me they had not gotn any peope e yet and they were nervous they all sit right next to each other in desks in this office they took cardboard boxes and put them up between their desk and then they cut holes in the boxes they could talk to each other i had the same feeling hearing that as they did with the coffins do people know that happened should not we be marking that in some way four hundred and fifteen coffins that happens an twenty two jerry rigged cardboard partitions in ja of k air port that happened too to day sho i'd to attempt to do a kind of accounting not of how many people died or how many are unemployed but a different kind of national accounting of all the smaller private momen that unfolded an people's jobs all across the country main arizona a michigan york city specifically esential workers we are gong to hear the stories only they now moments that change the way people thought about their jobs change the choices they will make next and we will affect the economy in ways we are only just beginning to see that is to day sho stay with us obecause tiday sho is a kind of autit each act name will include an number our first number for our ledger here is the number three this act is called three bottles of joy that will make sens in a second yers a small thing you would have no way of knowing was happening underground during the pandemic sation agents in new york city's subway system the people who sit in booths an sell you tickets or give you directions they were going to work every day but most o the public stopped writing the trains i got really quiet down there and as the weeks went on sation agents began bringng items from home into their boots to sit with them during the day bibles spiritual aperisms lo self that pla mes look at you smap monita leuis yhe a station agent for the empt a

monita's job is to be lunch relief for other station agens that means she travels to a station the agent on duty goes on lunch and monita sits in their boots for thirty minutes than travels to the next station she sees the inside of a lot of boots and monitas and observer black women cat eye glasses she can talk to any one in she does she goes from south fairy station to rector chambers she gets a bagl from the corner store at ten thirty a ms she eats it for six minutes by the window as she narrates the traffic at the fourweight intersection outside with an eye on the unmarked cop car that is always parkd there waiting she says four or five tickets daily if people cut the an you could cut the lighe full aways eevery day then its underground monita waves me into the sub way through the geay come on ye with the emptia lady wi we we wo i da an te ay dy march twenty twenty when tha pandemic shut down near city monita brought word of the viris from booth to booth at one booth the

uneasiness it was we was comein to work to ge sik you fell liw you were coming to work to get sick yes and they did transit workers began to get sick in large numbers and they began to die in large numbers firsta subway conductor and a bus driver then a track worker the emptya suffered more cova deaths than any other agency in ner city one hundred and seventy one deaths covid was surging and near city was the epicenter it was a plague struck this one specific agency a bus driver i spoke wis told me when you lose some one in the transit sistem you notice because what transit is is a time sceddul that train pulls out at four thirty one every day that bus passes with the same busdriver at eight twenty two every morning that person bys chips from the same venting machine in the break room at exactly five twelve when someone dies their absence is immediately visible monita told me she fellic suddenly work was a battle and she was a soldier trying to say alive a lot of transit workers felt this way but they are not soldiers i would ask people how do you make that switch how does a person go from driving a train every day to going into work thinking you might die doing this job the we i go begat my line an my cabital i wuld on be ga cristopher guns avas trives o the number seven train he is a conductor suddenly an essential conductor which he spoke about he was being conscripted into an army just as the war was heating up i yo kept looking at my cac mut to go the bik bok everybody at work wit getting yi and i yed wel an i ot a gain worry when it woul time to go back to work i an wnglebact i w you thinkin abouut i o i all my mama lad i told or to mog at what but we got to go er on ackin the you do not ye you toher takin the lord oll wik how cam o ot it mak

going omecti but he want you monida told me it was around this time when you would hear about people dying daily that station agents started bringing in the bottles of joyd dish into their boots the transit workers wore essential but there were also alone station agents are supposed to be the eyes and ears of the subway system but there were few people transit took away cash purchases fear of transmission subbwayfairs were all taken on machines monida was by herself sitting in the booths looking at all the hopeful items people brought in the bottles of joy just hanging on until we got to the other side and now here we are kind of at the other side is there another side things have definitely changed under ground they are better but monida's job is not the same the people have not returnds theyare not writing the trains before and the cash has not returned either station agents still are not allowed to take cash purchases take thike te we sit to we not suppose it be on our towns now suppose to be weading an e the a'sod a transit memols we have no customs we is that think thi in we we e soldierso sit here they do not mo no at lake at by queens tala yer does it make you not wanto do the job any more it make me fil i on able to sully do withou tie to yo sai more about that what you mean by that what id a biggest sans coming dow here what is to business how busy sess the money the come waterwy with a customes they go into word how ma peopleper an mostof us to wor you do not feel a people person any more i jol feel a people posed i jis feel people ont kap and the lod was fel that especially because recently the emptie has proposed eliminating her posicion the position of lench relie for station agents the union sued and the emptie back down but looking forward without cash purchases the job of a station agent does seem much less essential bhat if monida survived the war only to be lead off in peacetime i asked her recently if the bttles of joy are still in the booths she said now people took him away you are not allowed to bring us her stuff into the booth you can get away with it before mhen we were left alone down there ac to monidast job changed pretty dramatically and wich he did not but most jobs did not actually change that much in fact one of the strangest aspects of working through the pandemic for a lot of people was how much did not change in their jobs that is the case with this next story sorgen a add another number to our list if you picture our ledger here we have got four hundred and fifteen coffins three battles of joy i feel the next number here should have stars drawn around it or something sparkley pen aspirational stars a goall's list the nember is twenty five i too is called the twenty five dollar tip e took shelly or tease i decade in the restauround business to work up to a twenty five dollar tip she started when she was fifteen years old got her first job as a cashier at a five guyes in phoenix and shalle walks in bobbly ready to go her nick name growing up wis smily and you can hear it in her voice i remember i was at orientation and i really oned to make friends i memberlic turning to a man being what i school do you go to hek o looked at me meli i' thirty five it was just a big realization that a'm the youngest person here o and it shows shally describes herself as in all in tight person and she threw herself into restaurants all through college her twenties there was five guis than a french beastro a samwit shop a food gord and eventually fine nining where she finally got her first twenty five dollar tip which was huge she was only making nine dollars an hour shally picked up on the routines of each place she worked easily she leves a routine and she loved restaurants shally got rude customers all the time people would say things better body her personality how much she was checking on the table i remember i iced ork brunches a lot i was the brunch girl and brunch made good money but brunch clin till it is intimidating and i remember we were running out of forks we were running out lo forks and i i think about this all the time i think i put some spoons on a table a very picky picky brunch table because they were getting something that they could petentually eat it with a spoon but they probly should have actual roll lups with a fork and a knife in a napkin and emember i came back to collect them because we needed them i'd give them actual rullups and woman slap my hand away to we need thos and i was i'm giving you roll ups actual silver were and she look at her frend she loklike this girl and she ruled her eyes nd continued to talk to the woman a and it was it was just la girl minder that i am not human to her i've never been a person to her i'm just a some one out loof her world that does not deserve to be treated lie human being shally got it this too was routine it came along with the twenty five dllar tips i mean amongs the servers no one would be shops to hear that it is very common and i felt worth it to you ye i would jus think that i got her money i got paid i she just another person but i do not have to think about after this and at the end of ma shift i be able to go home i be able to hug my girl friend it became li at disassociation this is not me this is just this person who as serving and you are to take hom this money to om the money she homed to this skill to this associate she could shake off whatever was thrown at her shall e would collect the cash from the table and move on the mayor a phoenix declared a state of emergency on march seventeenth twenty twenny shalley's rest around clothes briefly but soon after rest arounds were declared essential services an arizona and reopened for take out and deliverte but shalley hung back her dad was sick recovering fror my hart attack and er mam is a nerves who was treating patience with covit shalley was too scared she told me she did not want to apply for un employment because she is porter reekin and she just had a sonce that that kind of thing never happened for people her by may rest aroundcs in airs own it were serving people in person and shalley had to go back she was still very nervous i was double masking before it was even a thin i bought fik glosses to protect my eyes i was i would only really take a my master drink water and i would only drink water in the bath room wore i was along lik thas the only time i would ver get it an that now that was a long chifts i was really scared meanwhile she still had her routange she was doing all the thing she would done thousands of times before welcome the customer explain the specials carry the plates deliver the drinks and i was just kind of waiting for that shouldy thing to happen i would have people ask me pulled on your mask i was she how much tip you pull down your mask i want to see how much to tip you yes we they would did once see how pretty i was before they tip me was that a thing that happened frequently the peopl would ask you to pull down your mask ye that happen praably about every week pull don your masks a matur smiling pulled down your mask i or why why are we wor mas why did you have to wor mask ah it was always belt either why am i werry what or can i see your face i can know that your smiling yso i coun ow your smiling i could know of your pretty wut she toit is ad who gives a fuck f in pretty i ju serve you your food i'm sure that was not the first time that you were customers were assessing the way that you wok but did it feel differint to have it stated bobly ya i am i'm four foot nine i'm very short and i have very big breast for my frame you kno it is unavoidable i'm very small i have big boobs and usually no i'm really cut it is easy to have peo just understand that people are going to be checking me out nnum i would have comments before but i think when the pedemic it it was i hit harder because i they wanted to me too risk my safety that they could see if i was cu something i heard from a lat of people i talked to about working through a pandamic people in all sorts of jabs they said they felt they were in a movy that one of the strangest parts was how much did not change it was uncanny the way gould sience fictien is uncanny it looks normal life but something big is off and the parts of the jab that have not change just make the parts that feel off stand out even more si was serving a sarday night and i was a really busy shift i was outside and i was serving this couple and they really needy buthat was not very where sad abethaentli thins wer u n pank you bing ad body for food and drink but at the on ther shift the gentleman it was a gentleman an his wife elder gentlemann's wife and he askd me toto pull down my mask he could see if the bottom part of my face was as cuses a top and i said i could not and then when i said i could not he said that because he could not olkus on my face he was forced to focus on my breast we and i his is siting men across him and i looked at her for any sort of response and she justconn't give me a blanke stare in return he said it almost matter of factly he was well if i cannot look at your face i'v forced to look at your breast and i was and it was just jus it was just disgusting it jussucked which us great a'll sem now i'm i think mostly during the pendemice my self worth was low i felt really disposeable ah obviously being objectified all the time because half my face was covered up and i tried to make it work but i was not adjusting the way my coigress were and i felt really disposable and ah i i just felt another person who was justined to get sick and it would be another stat had you felt that way before i'm never felt that way before it was the pandamic and misking your life and not feeling thoug come rodery wis your she mas any more because it really did not seel any oneas taking as seriously as me and then i stard questioning if im this crazy person and i stared questioning my anxiety and thet my anxiety got worse and the anxiety in anger that high but i felt i was not adjusting the way my coergas agjested i feel people who had to work during the pendemic i dopt it this disassociation and i could not ah i could it separat it why could not she shall ly spent much time on this question why could not she disassoci i she don for years when a customers laped her hand or yelled or talked about her body her co workers were going out to carryyokee afterward her customers were out with friends and family catching up i reember one time a woman had a commet card and she she left it for me and i said thinks fere making things feel normal et lok a smily face and i was liv it i was things ware not normal this is not normal i must see my life to serve you marguerita and it is not normal i do not want a contribute to this fanasy that a pandemic is not happening right now that is really interesting she was she was trying to gave you a compliment ya knewjingerja i'm i understand that i it was coming from a kind place but thousands of people are dying right down the road at the hospital and i'm here serving you marguerita because i have to because i have to live and it it was just e it such an intense moment for me of realization that this is what i'm here to do i'm here a great a fanacy thut things are not as bad as they are and they are what is essential about restaurants sure they provide jobs food but set of grosery stores this was a healt crisis doctors nurses sir esential but what is essential about an easion fusion place and down town phoenix all these things we suddenly stared tacaling essential servicis this was not some long held agreed upon category we just me all this up very recently and even then i was pretty random there was federal guidance on what services should be essential but most tates did not follow the guidance theeither came up with their own wists of essential services or they had no guidance if you had a liquor store in pennsylvania you were not essential but in new jersey you were construction workers that was a controversal one in a number of states essential or not essential and then there are the ones that have a particularly local flavor flower shops they were essential and delaware and in arizona gulf courses essential also restaurants shelleys restaurant was open in millions of restaurant workers performed their normal daily routines through a pandemic why what essential servist did they provide was this it restaurants were a csential because they help make things feel normal once shelley thought about her job this way she was to continue doing all the thing she would always done she was essential that other people could feel normal it was too much for her the treat off she would been making in her head twenty five dollar tips in exchange for some long hours some crap from customers that trat off fell apart she did not want to be paid for the fanasy any more a few weeks later a coorker was exposed to covid and shelley walked out of the restaurant ah that never wat back oh that was the end for you ye ye shelley got on employment then picked up some film jobs went back to school for film she told me now she does not think she could ever go back to servey even after the pandemic do you feel the actual job changed or do you think it is that you changed did the has 't become uglier was it always ugly ye i think that i changed more than the job changed there is always been a certain amount of ugly that is been the restauranton as trat especially ye setual restins always in there ferbl restons always in there but it was i seeing it for the first time was new eyes ah is all lock goes kindness and cu to see and it was constant ye ats somost tha people put on covid goggles on and wearing the covigoggles they started to see their job differently the casly somemach of differently with my covid cofl goggles for sure ah that is what made it really ugly for me ahere is the image i have in my mind hearing shelley talk about where she is that right now i picture all the governors and mayors and counsil members sitting down to make their list of essential services hospitals grocery stores restaurants gulf courses and i picture shelly doing the same she is making her own list of all the things she considers essential her life her health her self worth and she is crossing off and atem at the very bottom of her list at twenty five dollar tip coming up quitters and the people who love them that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our program continues it is this american life i'm conno joffy wal sitting in for iro glass this wee show we are talking to essential workers about what happened inside their jobs over the last year and a half things nobody else knows and we are marking these experiences down four p sterity that as we move into the bright and quickly darkening fucher we will do with a shared understanding of what we have just been through far we have four hundred fifteen coffins three bottles of joy nd a twenty five dollar tip we gingto be adding more to that list and we will se what happens when people take stock one by one and wind up making some choices they never expected to make that is what the second half of the shows about quitters and the people they quit on e record number of people are quitting their jobs and they are all quitting on miss jordan rossignal that is ol feels to her anyway which brings ays to our next act teacher number four miss jordan's child

it till the bone was broken too for miss jordan teacher number four cenaia bel that felt the break she cannot get over it and she is not joking about how mush time she can spend lamenting this

babies dekin tor garden she could picture it in her mind but she says it was not until jenaia showed up a couple years ago and she got to see her in a real class room thought's when miss jordan felt this siscan a work senaia told me for her when she wacked into miss dourdan senner twenty one years old she was nervous in a way she had not been before because she felt this is it this is the job i actually care about anadorn amess it oup and she did love the job but then wenty morty i in cobig wha i weel o for a little while a lot of bar a ye do warn't coming ga e i i wuld nervit are we gou ta mark te corl younotl in mighty notgor uld be ye know getting pan for a little while i der not there we gev tha lot of on fertany there was the time the owner miss jordan asked everyone to hold off on getting paid and their peachecks came in late and the time cenaia was pretty sure her pachek came from miss jordan's personal bank account cenaia began to feel wait is therre no cushion in this business she never really thought about the business side of things before but once she started to she served to have some doubts when a friene posted about a job at the local hardwor store cenaia applied then she had to tell miss jordan thog she came to my office o shut the door an ide that was bat would shut the do this is miss jordan again ne o she did not a cry i he i i was offer a job that was the firsth hive ever cried with tho one gave their noted i blok it we sture crying o ye it the tet i cri i cri i cannot a i be if i cannot far to work here this is obious but deserve saying anyway many of the people we call essensial workers do not make a lot of money there overwhelmingly low wage workers about half the people in this country who make less than fifteen dollars an hour work an fields we now call essensial you can be the very best at running the grill or cleaning the office building or managing rude customers at the restaurant you can be the star teacher teach her number four shonia and s still only make an average of eleven or twelve dollars an hour and no help care miss jordan barely makes enough from tuition to cover her expenses but she is reluctant to rase rats on families because she knows many parents cant afor to pay and she knows from experience that if she goes to high families aregoingto pull their kids altogether when chenaia talked to miss jordan and when she talked to me about leaving her job she could not bring herself to see the word quit she told miss jordan i have to get done i knew that she was you to try you knowow everything to sho payme more i but i knew that everything she was tryin to do possibly was it goin to work out in the end just be ci she could she really couln't e for to do that an and thend you knew that yi and i knew thi n i and i understod miss jordan did do all those things she pleaded will fiar something out just give me more time and she trid to technique that i think is maybe only applicable in a small town when chenaa said where she was going miss jordan shook her head i would i at our hated e told her ad ye i would i love you and and i want you to be happy but you to hate id and i know the bot i that older of it in i it he will not love you to way i lof you pay that li i do not i know and i i allfe thought of a ht tat t ted that cena laft and miss jordan waited for her to return i it it it it t i in the early child careworld there were two somewhat distinct phases of the pandemic there wis the beginning in which e child careseners lost money even as their work became labelled essensial and then there is this moment now where what was already a chronic problem of teach her turn over has become much worse because the industry cannot conpit places almark whom depo fadac firsery stor achains proger capt making money over the pandamic amazon made record profits child care centers did not teachers are leving for jobs at amazon or dunkan donats or grocery stores that can pay them more and sometimes give them health benefits a woman in ohio who owns a child caresen are told me even the amusement parts can pay better than we can write now o men fo afo when miss jordan lost genaia teach her number four of twenty three she allowed a thought that has been sitting uncomfortably to the forefront ever since what if i can never keep some one cenaia but if no one ever believes this is valuable i feel unconfully trying to prove my felt that what i'm doing it it important i have a college togree education people do not no people do not know what we do how could it caught the lot are't cou i jut coloring and eatin golt they shall day with them e no whno i make a lating plant for everythingl cothroom in fa up to the foolage program there to many regulation that we have to follow a theyres a tgaduel theres a meal plant there training that my fhat have to to we run that a chool tonly different is that there is no public funday frat why is it that essential workers happen to be some of the lowest paid workers in the country how could a job that is valuable be paid littl there is some standard explanations you will here many essential jobs do not require extra credentials or a lot of education there is a lot of available labor to do these jobs in other words they are low paid because they are quoled low skilled jobs but also one thing that unites this broad category of low paid essential jobs and almost everyone you have heard from in this jow is not the kind of work theyre doing but who is doing it black people the teno people emigrants women and all the people who cover more than one of those categories manty five per cent of child care workers are women women genia miss jordan and many women of color almost half of child care workers ar people of color the field is much more recialy and linguissically diverse than keep through twelve teachers and the people in it make much less money the pandemic gave child care and a fissial stamp of essentialness in this singular moment in history when it is more clear than it has ever been and may ever be again that schools and child care are essential to the functioning of literally everything but miss torn's work and the people doing that work may never be valued enough for her to secure more funding or for her to get cenaia back anmiss torningenaia live in a town of eight thousand people when cenia laugh she

say about economic moments this when a lot of people are quitting their jobs they will say t's a good thing high quits numbers equals optimism people are going back to school they are going for that dream job people feel secure enough to look around a little for what they really wantod do this is obviously not an example of that this is an example of a market that does not work this is an example of the talented person whose drawn to a job that is essential thich he is not doing because it does not pay enough ack forth there are people who are quitting who are happy about it there are people who are mad confused by what they want of course there isthe whole range one thing i found interesting is that for many people there was often one moment that set things in motion for them a while back some symbol of something just being off in their job and then it is these symbols just sat next to them for months and of haunting them until they could not deal any more they found themselves doing something they never plan to do sometimes that was quitting but there were some other reproaches as well for our last story i whent i tell you about some of those symbols and then what happened next our last number salso are biggest number in the whole show twelve million act for twelve million thinking meals this one i heard about from a guy in flin michigan my name mat cal out a gand they a he o fleto is sixty one years old he is a black man wakes up every morning at for iam walks to work mac donalds opens the stor cook sausage eggs pancakes he is in e back on his own sometimes for many hours he doesna mind he enjoys working alone when he is at home fleto willspend a lot of time helping out neighbors removing snow cutting grass he enjoys that too although he did mention he is a person who some times has a hard time saying no when i ask fleto what the pandemic was for him that is whan he started telling me about how last spring mac donalds began offering free food eg mac muffins war tout thek te commar well li wold it been good boy a ig welt o who me ho thak a work tes omos to o mees eeeo emaes wo eo oser oersoosoerers lik co us ore remember this he really 's watching a unch of these commercials i'd somehow forgotten how completely everyone threw themselves in to reathlessly praising e cential workers two words most of us had never heard use together before all of a sudden they were everywhere it is we invented this category of worker to think them wo be progly edin us lik co u oe ego all tosu anyway fleto saw that commercial and was oh that will be meat serving you w li old old wev been geredy be b that mot or toult o ye knove an an ino work o fry i people from hat tidl ner wi yo no ta cay we got the fool now i thought flete was sharing this as a moment of pride being part of this but now this moment handing out free thinki meals it was the start of something for him wel toe be ot of with yot inmio i didt on a tangit you o we here working ta

workers yet o why you gon' co a wuld to t f the har tic donalds gave away twelve million thinky mals to front line workers after two weeks they stopped but not without putting out one more commersial it ws none ti o an oe to think you it was o on to ser y business went back to normal but fleeto kept returning to the experience in his mind how much did that cost all of a sudden they ave much money for thaty tey wul given it you e ree foold way you got a that ity te wait ye the dot if ol you o ta body tofo take o mita money i in make a diffe yo won o you makin a diff it wa other people what yould feel agnore you warker o i did not a anit bin tat i get that w foto wont ed a year old of being te come o wit that idea we do not talk to lot about the sharifalders for mac donalds the being corporation and also about the franchised owner the people who ownd his mac donalds and about a dozen or other stores sohe says he barely saw them during the pandemic the hier ups they rarely came to the store he would always noticed it but handing out the thinki mals for health care workers he noticed it more you got o o ye li lol ye nol yon' preciate you get yold or to ou dont fo fio preciarige

li havit a red i you that will not peek to i make you tay i thought thought was such a fitting way to describe something ad heard from a lot of people who worked through the pandemic a feeling that while they had no choice to come to work the people who were making all the choices if they had to work how much how much they get paid how safe they would be those people appeared completely indifferent callos even a relative who will not speak to you a server at a pete restaurant texas ashly beaker told me the owner used to come in all the time and then he vanished he did he lirely stop coming to the rastra he lerely just went awal les sein in his leke there wess nes tan nat co tat wens in e pastor he lerely disappeared when he showed back up month later they were all relieve to have some one in charge to answer their questions but i doo remember one being that really struck a a nerve with me blays that he changed hes be a cold to a corbet and i remember that conny struck a nerbane becas im wi your paying is manal wage and you want people tho coming on time is ta ah but you are ealy hear you hade the luxury yet not coming in and you have the abily to go changeer to get get a brin new cark that was the moment wher i is were things just set in for fleto it was the twelve million thinkin malls that was the symbol for him now glowing me on it put all the other parts of his job in a less acceptable light for ashley it was the corvet for implys atamac donalds and california perhaps it was when they raise concerns about the lack of pep and they say their bosses told them to use coffee filters and joggy dipers for masks for a guya met outside an amazon ware house it was when he says he was fire four times for having covet four times this was a thing apparently at amazon people would tell their bosses they had covet or they got exposed coved and then they get fired leter they would hear it was any charmistake and they were welcome to appeal get their job back but not always the weeks or sometimes months of lost wages and for ashley's manager at the peat o place a woman named selaras moraas bhe corvet pisset eraf but the real sign for her was when the restaurant cut back her hours and she became eligible for unemploymn a how can i we makn more onon employment than ly actual job i mean how n i mean how can it be poptable that tiki wor all that him on employment im wor yell making what fo men o we con oman twenty fine thank how and what lesson did you take from that not your pot memver crre anye these things just sat near by as they did their jobs nagging a corvet being fired four times seven twenty five an hour fleto at mac donalds he was handing out those thinkin meals more than a year ago he still mat about it he is not about a lot of things but they never got hazard pay sic pay pay time off health care the owner operator of fletos mac donalds says he showed his appreciation by raising wages during the pandemac but fletofs wage is another thing tha just makes him angry he went from eleven dollars to twelve dollars an hour he wants more but the one thing fleto talked about more than any other was the fact that the franchisowner and the people who work with him did not come by or when they did they did not appeared to actually see them do not precur ho get yold corto wet noi ay when tay comin to bel he lot bi yo nok o er as it interesting because i feel appreciating assential workers is the one thing that we did do most places did not pay hazard pay or higher wages or helse care but their was much thank you e sential workers we appreciate you in claufing for you and commercials but non of that felt anything to you e no not really a litter all we do wen you cum e body ol wi the ha how you do wil bet ye you did not

can walk to work he likes the people he works with some of them is worked with for many years and he likes the work he does not want to change he wants the job to change he wants it to be less thankless eo pall many of the industryes we deemed essential now seem to be in some sort of chaos restaurants are open now but not for dinner because there is not enough staff healthcare workers are quitting their jabs tollection officials are bailing and school superintendents from america's three largest school systems have all quit and things that never really worked that great before seem to be truly breaking down i called jat blue the other day to change of reservation and the recording said the current we time is two hundred ninety nine minutes some food chains are actually rasing wages chipotla olive garden me donalds is raising wages at its corporate stores the small share of actual mcdonald storeis but still support for laber unions is the highest it is been in years every week or lately i see a picture on line posted outside a store or restaurant announcing that no one works there any more this one scotch tape to the door that reads a tention tho potlay customers we are overworked under staffe and under appreciate it almost the entire staff and management have walked out of here until further notice or another we are closed and definitely because dollar general does not pale living wage or treat their employs with respect i've never seen anything it each sign it seems a whole group of employes just sponteniously and collectively decided they were done but something happened at some point before ow some shift started with say a corvett or with twelve million thinking meals one sign postedonomac donalds drive through manyou reads we are short staffd these be patient with the staff that did show up no one wants to work any more or another also from a different macdonalds with a different perspective it reads we are closed because i am quitting and i hate this job people quit jobs for all sorts of reasons and there are lot of people debating wy many ar doing a rate now id to just make sure this one possibility is on the table alongside all the others that a good number of people worked through a life threatening pandamic feeling unseen by the very people who were supposed to care for them feeling as sleto did they have a relative who will not speak to them my favorite sign is from a wendies in north carolia it reads we all quit closed an capital letters and then in the corner of the sign some one crowled y a lisa with a smili face next

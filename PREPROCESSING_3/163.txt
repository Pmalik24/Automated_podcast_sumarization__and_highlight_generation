that we don' av an washington state is crris about all this because in the speeches that run to santis is giving as he runs for president he talks a lot about how farita is the fastest growing state which it is the talks about hout people are moving to farit up because of him and always done there which who knows its truthe among the transplants there are twice as many republicans is democrats but i wondered what is really happening was de santus actually the reason that people upro to their lives and crossed the country li they wanted to be part of his far at experiment soon the last we cave talke to a half dozen people it donly yes they did exactly that bhe they all said it was not just politics ire's also the fact that thee's no state income tax an far itout han housing presses for nearly all of them that is way cheaper then where they move from they love the sunny summery life style but they all said politics clenched it e particular covid politics the way governor run to santis broke ranks early and loudly from other states in opening schools n ditching mask mandates that is when migration to the state picked up is one woman cam who move from pasan you top put it we

what ever producer soi chase was very interested to understand its pee grond popularity it spends a time down a seraso a counti the guy ham here to talk about is named o vic meller he has a bunch of money suspended on politics just a few months ago he paid three million dollars for building in serasoto cownty nine fifty nine east venice avenue hes teeming up with mike flin and some others to use it for this hybrid offices down here one side of it is a production house for the launch of flins up coming picast er sudior your geral flins on e sorters this is really nice most people with their

have topital in only givol oi it vick is a big guy he ducks through doors he is tall he is wide dress is he just walked off for con struction sight which he did he runs a precast concrete business he makes the huge blocks of hollowed out concret that make a buildings he dreams big which brings me to the other half of nine fifty nine east venis the party really want to tell you about the place for vickan his movement are inventing something new specifically the other half of this building is can be a medical clenic we the people health and well in this scenter we the people drawn in founding fathers cursiv on the big glass tors a clinnic thic keeters to people who did not get the covi bac ene who do not trust the medical establishment and want a place to go where they can be treated by people who think thin do o wot con bouis workwor beton i bel vick shows me the exam rooms the carved out area for pediatrics he dolt examination aria the soft gray iv trip room we can sit quietly and get liquid vite him ins pumped into your arms old building is ten thousand square feet this is roughly haf it opens in september two to three nurses may be a primary cerdacter one pitiatrician for shur at least to star i wanted to take a look at this building of vics because i captures much to me about this moment in american politics this half ivor mectin clinic half mike flin flagship pidcast studio it is symbolic of a new momentum on the right where people took certain lessons from the pantemic maandates are bad vac seems are suspect the scientific community is out to get you the government telling you what to do in health care is dangerous and ther building a movement from those principles nine fifty nine east venice is an early fort on that front here a beechead for this political movement that is coming into the main stream called medical freedom also onogonist say this is uniquely florida but it is pretty floridi shape what happens here solemy get into vic story and the experience of some of these other people in serasoda to explain how this building came to be a h bb vickis a new political convert and he is newly flesh vick is not one of the new arrivals in serason to county he is in his early fifties now he is been here thirty years he started with nothing and built a successful concrete business he was a big fox news watcher with a recent history of bringing new things into the world that he thinks should exist before he built this clenec a few years ago feeling ancy and agitated about the state of te world with some money to burn he decided to buy some land a few miles away from his place in venice and as sat this what i mi do i am going to open up a camp roun for kids sco he base on the constitution would an empasis on ta second momet whal the kids are out there wit in a teachem don safety and then w ting to bring am out to the range and hit can be proficient o shooting and such and teach kids haw to teach kins how to shoot absolutely bhut it is a tay cam to an ap people just go out ik a water slizes at ot all these at little o venture things they do we get as a belake wuld katers and fitions ilings an e an weyse at my right over the gaiters it is her he absolutely he calls at the hollow ecause it is a swampy hollowy plice and after the hollowcore concrete blocks he manufactures when i was out there it was a lost boy paradise these kind of wild gardens around bouncing hanging bridges that were stretching over the water between a few islands greap trellises flowers bushes thas geaters er where a who feel jus yer it is lick a suc a six a seven foot ats a be after he built the hollow vic met mik flyn which changed his life in these days they talker see each other every day vic helps flyn get all his projects off the ground and helps fun some of them i would call make flin a father figure an vic's life he does not disagree with that he grow ope without a dad and wund socket r islands when general flyn showed up in cyrasoda tot to vic always refers to him ads general it organized vics ambian inks about trump wich twines the media is jones about the second amenment into something much closer to flin's world with you which amounts to a comprehensive one world's order conspiracy amed at him and other trumproyalists flin didn' hag to push vicvary far vicquas ite january sixth hen' goin to the capital building he says but he is totally unrepentant about it hese still convinced the election was stole for trump o case the creation of this clinac at nine fifty nine east venice it ll begins back in twenty twenty during the pantamic vic chafed against the lock downs in the masks and likei for him he lives in florida were the governor rinto santis issued an executive worder pretty early on in the summer of twenty twenty one the told school districts to stop forcing kids to our masks in school the schoolboardin serasoda did not wanifi o the governor's order they wanted to keep kids in masks vics got two young children in that school districtso at that point all the parets every one free dou an tey they made all these groops in were ther every one's meeting all over a place just tryn a organize and do whatever an theno youare somone just sait to have a we all just meet at the hollow ten on as ato can bring him all oon is do this ot this big meeting vic meets a very essential partner in this whole endeavor the other person the stories about one of the newly politicized moms of serasota county small but mighty tiny a paris biti blons pink nail polish with a bustling just the putie meeting energy he is got a five and a seven yearold in school i did not want my children to be in mass they did not want it my son was breaking out and all these disgusting things and i have seriasis i was a startid what if he is getting he is got sariasisin is coming out i was getting really upset as a khe is not from the mask ye cannot his skin was drying out somehow o and he was not be in sanitary with it he is yetde and then now i have a kindergardener coming and who definitely cannot wear a mask r and me he as flicking on across the room dropping him on the floor i saw absolutely no purpose in him wearing it dropping on the basthroom floor in the put it on his face and that is absolutey discussing how dids o vic n bunch appearentes tinya among them decided to organize a big mask waver signing out at the hollow ere doctors would give the notes to their kids would nafto or mass in school time is a former eempty she was in a trailer thy installed out there taking vitals before they met with the doctors we started it early in the morning and cars jost started coming n just pouring in and pouring in and pouring in and it is hot it is fricking hot and it is every one's waiting outside i would oke my head out and i'm wholly frat there was i mean there was many people line to up i could not see the end of the line and it rapped all the way it was completely full of people to be clear the thing there all fighting against wearing masks in school the science shows masks are effective at slowing the spread of covit if you wear them this mask waver o ven at the hollow was a turning point once vic saw how many of them there were he realized we could be doing a lot mor here this a full fledge political movement that i can throw myself into tma meanwhile became this connector between these apostate doctors impationcs who did not want to go to regular hospitals in leat twenty twenty one an into the next year if you wanted a doctor who would see without a mask or would not push the vacscene she gov gove you names people talk to each other they say hey tonian hook me up with another doctor whomever som pol parallel medicals says som otally under ground medical system and then i did a lot of the vetting for these doctors because they were busy with patience and dealing with people who needed i ver mectin and had covit getting ivermacton became a huge focus of this emerging parallel medical system e surprising amount of the emotion driving this movement has to do with iver macton you probably remember ivermacton the horse drug people started taking huge doses to cure themselves of covit at one point but the science says ivermacan does not work for covit it is an amazing drug for other things parasites not covi no matter though doctors on you to were promoting things iver macton and had drocor clorcuin is miracal cures quick cheap easy solves for covit you may remember that you to been twitter and facebook removed vidios because it was not true when i got put on that short list of designated official mous information that the tet companies whould actually do something about but when those ivermactand loving doctors get shut down they only got more famous within the medical freedom movement and set up shop on alternative mediate platforms rumbl an telegram there created a whole alternate ego system of pid cass an podcasts neter alll yosy ani masin ersin is bi ot persecuten by o e la ik no one else the be din ma dot there buty aie floor while my by gasks regad surgon while surving the army doctor roshe bdor to i we sbaking yes again to an emi e is but the basict conspiracy theory articulated on a lot of these shows is this covid was a man made created viris master minded by billgates in the world's helth organizatin in order to control the world's population vacines were pushed in ore to kill us lockd downs reused in order to control us ma durna fiser the'r in on it they want to kill off ivermacton because it is a cheap alternative to what theyare selling the conspiracy has a name it is called the great resets and that is what flin will be covering on his show down the hall from the clenec among other things genera flet back u sir a what us this ac cination campaign truly all about foreybody who may be hear this for the first time what we are facing is we are facing a globelist take over o every freedom loving country in the world and there usually this bactination to control us i lik when i ads ikantinia straight up if they believe in the great reset they were both i'm i come o cop to that exact thing all the stuff you said specifically maybe it was in biligates but yes there was a power grab and there was money to be made and if you think about that that does not mean that youare conspiracy theoris that just means that there is greedy people in the world which we all know it does not mean that i'm a bad person cause i believe our government is more corrupt than you do this is a patriotic movement it is there wast efuctus globlish ship el sorsely abut a totally against it it make sense to me the tinia was the person who threw herself into this project of building this alternaive medical system and now running the weed the people clenic at nine fifty nine east venice she is deafly attik matters into your own hands type she feels doctors have not listened to her an the passed when she needed them i basically have a twenty one year old sen and i have a nine and a seven i had thirteen this carriages in betwe yet that was e that was awful that was awful time n my life but o ya it saas ery at was awful obviously and a recertrycertry certry ser i that is what i do as i dig gain you wanted to lake soved that figure that out i to solve everything tried at least have an understanding from myself nine miss carriages and tinea seemed to find a doctor who figured out something that might help and then she had two kids rit naro the kids who years later would go on to flick masks on to the bathroom floor during covit i did not that it took me nine miss carriages before anyone carred the to fig out what the had was ron with me what were chronicalling here remember is the establishment of the headquarters of this new magnified medical freedom movement at nine fifty nine east venice avenue half pi cas studio half medical clenett and the next big moment in the story of the creation of this building happens that arguably the opposite of this place the main hospital in the area serasota memorial hospital not long after the maskbandate event at the hollow thic started up a political organizing company to support what he calls freedom canidates america first canidates essentially trumpests she called at the hollow too out and threw a lot of money into it they supported a slate of schoolboard canidates who swept into office they also backed another group of canidates for local hospital she are sodamemorial hospital is governed by a publicly elected burd and they supported four canidates who were a lined with this medical freedom movement these canidates were besically antie everything the hospital was doing anti the seedy sea proticals they used anti the back scenes they administered upset that the hospital did not offer ivr macton another allternd of medicines to petians who wanted it to treat covit they count wanted to tear the whole place down and they called for a big investigation into everything that had transpired during covit three of their preferred canidates one not enough to control the bord enough to make some noise the public hospital has public meetings every onth and you can imagine how those had been going ye ye in februar ry of this year twenty twenty three the bord was delivering the results of a three year review of the hospitals performance during the cove pantemic the report was glowing the hospitalse cove nineteen death rate was about twenty five percent lower and state national averages hospital stays were shorter to which is a pretty great verdict for a place full of elderly people thic in the hollow crew did not believe those results at all they starte pushing for a completely independent investigation of the hospitals cove practices connflike those ferenzic audits that people who thought the election was stolen wanted after twenty twenty demands to comb through every ballid every gear of the voting machines but this of course was way more personal cause there was all this grief and pain mixed in with the suspicion when we had people getting up there crying and say all we want to do as i want answers i want to sit down with the da i want to understand why my husband died why you would not let me come in there why you would not use ivermecton why did you give her reddasever when i told you not to give her rendasavire all of these things were coming up e tere ae e e my son was thirty nine years of age when he went into the hospital this one wor'n a saying up at the mike y esa e a ye er e ereo e thexuse ye e ris is e er ereses e als it is the doctors are making decisions for all of us eisor er wwaris r yes r wer they said his organs are failing he is thirty nine would you mean his organs are failing we asked for iver mecton i had my lawyer on the phone they refused all the nurses and doctors she goes on he know how hard you wore but the sd se protocal it is killing people doctor many gorduo ran the coved respons at the hospital he was at that hearing but did not speak iver mecton came up in much of the testimony that i wanted to talk to him about that it was a standin for many things but it was also just a drug a relatively harmless drug mhy netches give them the ivermacton to to aver mectin i it to me to i simble it to word when they i properly done that the shal betti dot it no better than be people that that y o show no benefit of te pin o to been how we gon to be after it acter the property don' that he show that theys no ben it it how e can to be don people are ya te think on th work byt them gok on to give it you i to were not in medicine given people be people on a bic tat especially when it dis trag from even the proper medication that is we drives om nuts when people who have been lied to refuse from desevir which can work and want iver mecton which does not which you make no fen bo tem henit becomes the problem this is the enbridgibl divide between the medical professionals and the medical freedom people in this case to the acto is it is bad medicine to not give ivermactn to the professionals it is bad medicine to give it there is not a middle ground to be had and doctor gordio is an infectious disease specialist and he is had many of these confrontations com versations this family members demanding alturnative cove treatments over the past few years it was rough moning the hospitals covid response he would coped with death threats against this family protestsoutside the icy you he would work a hundred hours a week was hard on his marriage his wife was these patients het you and you are still gan a work for them what cond of a person are you i thought what happened that the meeting might make him mad i mean i woul a awaaate it more than that o that i by the time i aknew whatis te tatiy of people wan i wu mat at the i be a the people that beep em anypulation a was than manat the patien n the patient in the in the bhe had bitin from the manipulators doctor gordios from peru from a place he says the traces were becoming a fisherman or a priest he tried something else of course but he still fishes hat's one of the things he loves about living in sarasoda something that surprised me doctor gredio did take a serious look at ivermecton there were always studies showing it killed covit in a test tobe probalem was the doses it took were much too high to give to a human being he says when people know they are ging to de people always ask for alturnative treatments to all kinds of things for each i bee cansir the seen it a lot over thirty years and his attitude is if the treatment will not hurt you sure go get it elsewhere if an all turned if clenec gives out i ver mecton he is whatever thite is not going to do it at his hospital i perte tv upon wit that thke it people in te an ther going to defide on ther on what they on to do a i can do i givem at ie on what the tat peatmen at i know ige arcurent date of mane in a curent date of knowige a helpit i in that the wa tint go i li tinian bicno grdi had taking a serious look at i vermecton but when he did look at the studies that were done in america with thousands of people it sowed that basically avermectin was av placibo it was no better than a sugar pel can i answer this one tir o it ii would to see to study that he is referring to gand i would to see who did it i'm sure it was chery pick because they knew this was comin up anyways his an serprobaly should not surprise any one has been living in america lately you have studies i 've studies if doctors i've doctors that say the opposite it is not just him rige's a stand in for thousands of epidemiologest is it possible that you gies all you for all your best intentions the you guides are not properly a valuating scientific studies cause you are not doctors no i'm not a doctor i've take it ivremectin i know it works i do not need a doctor to tell me it works i know it works i've seen other people take it who were sick really sick take it and it works if if if he has to stance that it still up to seebo then he is an idiot and he is part of what is wrong with what is goin on here onsosely i ont add that i've never once said that i was the reviewer of all these clenical studies an these studies i have come out i've personally spoken doctors who have been a valuating the studies and that is where i'm getting my answers from the two sides on this ore divided and both embattled that the one thing they have bien common is how misunderstood each side feels by the other at that board meeting it serasotomemorial hospital twhas true for doctor gordia is true for tina i do not think you would understand unless you are on this side of the opinion gateway how shitty they made us feel because of what to me its why am it i just do not i i do not believe in mandates it does not mean that i'm a fahist it does not meetina was i ogay as nock in a work at serasoto memoria the hospital would never surrender the hospital was not in a change there were never eveng an offerin apology s i knew that there was that we needed a place where a people could go and be seen by a doctor regardless let say another pandemic happens are you still are you comfortable going to see your doctor today no will you be in two years of another pandemic happens no we still need a place and that was the whole point with vac was i just more than anything told him we have got to get something we have to get something up we have to tat meeting ye that is when the medical center at nine fifty nine eastpenie avenue became a reality po flord is a great place to do this tina side is winning in florida in september twenty twenty one to santis hired this fact scene sceptical surgeon general to run flordis response o the co pantemic some one who altered a reports findings to claim the covid back scene had more adverst side effects than it actually has the santo start a publicly questioning the back scenes saying they could be dangerous an publicly diriding seedy sa protocalls this anty vacine a genda in florida arguably had consequences one study estimated thirty thousand extra deaths just in florida because people didn' get faccinated te santos also creeted this bran who committee of physicians who would assess any federal health guidelines coming into the states doctor gordio at serasotomemorial hospital calls this group radical extremely right waing outside of meanstreme science the same day he announce that committee to santo sfile to pe tition with the florta supreme court to convene a grand jury the grand jury to look into things fiser an madorna claimed about the vacsene which he says were criminally misleading doctor gordio was what is happening you no do the whole thing to me yo hell plyted tind end in that apfect me because to see that coming fom a or govenor that a littl be too much for me yet what do you mean too much for you ye i cant tikin a i o tham it com it ye yo comthing that i never thought that i con happen in ou nanythi o now i may bei we annin not gorea perhap nor inchina but not inoua in what sense ane tent the word would come people wud word getting the rodic of you an do not acpect any other any other point of yo and in puseagenda santis his now compaining for president on his covic policies the way he cort an cuo fought back the iron curtain of fouciism forida the language he uses seems design to appeal to any one who believes that covid was a virus conneeded to control us all from the very beginning we refuse to let this state tis sen in to some type of falciis tis topia the is in i epact to eur in torida we read jet the bio matical security stat which a rods liberty harms livelihoods and devides our

protects the doctors riht to disagree with what to santus as called the preferred narrative of the medical community the legislation protects doctors from any discipline by state medical bords for spreading wrong information about say iver mectin or the vacsine that is good news for vix clinic and any doctors or nurses who choose to work there santus watts them to keep practicing here and florida there have been a bunch of other medical freedom type bills introduced in state legislators around the country in the past year and you can see some republican legislators siting what is

or we drauts to the bill did not explicitly say wht would happen to them but they did say the tenurd professors could have the tenor reviewed at any tine understand away professors all over the state wonder what this new bill was coan mean in practice mando jocy won der that too e follow things for one symaster betwen the introduction o the bill and it is final passage a on of the biggest universities in forida fr at a state heas this story about what was for a professor one of her students one of him many students affected by this new law is cason she is black moves a floridaris igad she is a freshman this pastere cases very bright and not just in ves small and intelligent kind of way she is a really positive person very earnest nd the school with more than firy fousand on the grands she could not meet enough of them i will start talking to people if we just happen te hass echother i not something all my gassor here t look sokou well your compliment queen ie yes eo taer quickor wat it ie or wat a people that way caso was also superpassionate about the academic side of things she chos for to stat in po because she got scholarship and she was aiming to be the first person in ha faminy to get a baculors degree a focus was to do something that wuld get her a job she lookes into picking up a major in antopenosia which would give o i tools to star her own business b then she sind up for this african american stody's closss justs to try it which as any dis appointed parent of the business major who drops it oll for a life in human ities can tell you esirits thoughts case an love o cols could not ask enough questions of the professor i lost my lines i if e teriod a ferver ah because i knew i couldno ask ou every thingle question i one you little class ill litterly rite down every single one of my thoughts in than after class i wad widerally follow him out of the gill an we weld just tark for i gas heis warking to his car from the fahro iu res min inallieve at you ld e life yete i wuld just be talking to him an asking him werein wore questions whot he thought about different things cason loved the class much that by the end of th surmestor she switched her major to english and added a minor in african american studies she wanted to dived deeper on black riters from her state from florida for a second surmester she signed up for a class on southern black literature the literatures and cultures of the afrigal south taught by a blackfemal professor named doctureleciar ganes and when cason met docptor gains on the first day of class she was upsess ite she tout she was col a sosthin she just kind of ara in clas wit this i dont on huntrigans i renemver noticthing that she was wearing w i wuld thas n an on est re asking wa dress an others wearing na sneegers withit the smeegers got you i do not know it was my for a sime having e te ga black professor in colege lit thin o professor in clleg shan it was just it was tike i was able to look at her and thinks myself i to be that some ut that something to be within a few weeks of meeting doctor ganes cason decided she was going to become just her the come o professor of african american literature but right as she figured out what she wanted to do with her life ah be nine nine nine was introduced it was late february a few weeks in of the surmester i think that i for a si an instity on m and i read over it and i thut myself for that cannot be true thats in sane cason realized that a lot of the things that she loved most about ganesas class might be effected by this bill the class was of course about literature but it al revolve discussions about the cultral and political contects for each book for example at one point tey read a novel about one familyes experience of hurricane catrena and they talked about merolls o stemic races and played in the governments response to it ithout without most sorts of discussions literatures and cultures of the afrigal south just was not literatures and cultures of the afrigal souh and she felt her entire field of study black literature specifically black literature that probe the true legacy of what it means to be black an america the thing she had just realized she wanted to make her life's work was on dher fret blike there was one day where they were discussing their ies or watchin god in class and cason just could not stop thinking about the bill i was just thinking about weif no one else ever a gess te even read thi an class again what if no one gets ther how as these kinon discussions that rehaving again cason wondered how seriously she should take the bill it was something i was wondering about too i fourt this bills just a draught surely a lot of his sweeping language targeting subjects that was goin to come out right and even if it did not and the bill pass it is such an attack on free speech surely it would not hold uping cork but pretty much every one of the professors who talked to me at ifisu said it the bill's very introduction had a chinning effect language in the bill was broad it was hard to pin down exactly what would be prohipiters professors told me that teyin their colleages were feeling pressure to change things about their work regardless of what happin with the lor and doctor gaine says that did not seem an accident some of the early versions of this legislation is ridiculous and out landish and you realize it is written to chill it is written to put us or notice but even believing that it ws hard to know what to do i the same week bor bills introduced do tor ganes got word that she was going to be teaching of course she had not talht befor in the for major figures in american literature which is a really brought subject right i can fheory you could teach any assoultment of great american outhist and not to ganes was considering making the focus of the class the authors of the harm renaisence the author is that i would why i talk with students about are major american author is but there are black i can i just teach black farks and people who be fine with that am or dou are they wanting witmen are they wanting farkener cganes wondered with eigh be nine ine nine and all of the thi school s around education of the state she could teach for historical racial contects round in era maharlam renaissence and is continued relevants to day in a class where some students would just be there to fulfill a writing requirement suden can of students from all different kinds of majors students you might not necessarily be trying to learn about black writers and who would be able to recolld her classes and reporter is there going o be a studen my class taking it just to be kind reversial jst to be difficult that kind of stuff you do not want to keep the fourefender your brain when you ware trying to in er act with students and learn with them im and engage the material but yhou have to think about it a little bit and then it creates a little bit of am can i can i fully trust this class room wi can i fully trust on my students in march i heard about something that was adding to the sense of dread many people i talk to efeeling you was a list that was gang passed around and on it wete thirty four classes i efor seeu most of the professors i talke through about it did not know exactly what it meant to be on the list but we figure it was not a good thing at first it was not exactly clear who created velist but the sanis administration the university the first class on the list is doctor gaes and i looked foug the list te yere a programms and class as you would expect to see course is that talk about race and gender and ways that might concern republicans on an and to woke crusade i i made twenty ninety six black women in america or es why the thirty eight hundred sheology of sex and gender bu thre were many classes missing thogt to gans is class that case an was in literatures and cultures of the atrical sauth yet was not on there riht which wat ti made no sense not that she was complaining that m exus me a legislators that is an exastive list of ar ther course of tat yunin to worry about thank you im complete list do not make any farter you also had a lot of classes that did not seem to fect i catical prorspectors on dance master pieces of german literature if looking into it i fick it out that the university made for list but the sanis ad ministration and regretted all public universities send in a comprehensive list of anything on campas related to diversity and inclusion and critical race theory i could not get any one of the school to explain to me why this oddly random list of courses was what they decided to send in was it some macuvalian mine game was it in competence who knows but this is embodied list being classed around it had an effect it added to the web of self dau fer that professors tha iffasy were feeling some of them were already changing their courses trying to make them hold up to scrutome i tok to one professor wremoved work by eprom candy from the syllabus and emphasize impurical studies about traffic stops and hiring discrimination instead to other professors to be under standable step of changing the names of their courses basically a racing the giant targets they had on their backs a class called critical race theory will now be listed as the sociologies of race and if ny city another class feminism and travel you can find out under the new name jerneys in women's literature bosh courses are content wise basically the same as they were before we are already helcanering in a fact i beold critical rate thery out of my helt description on my faculty wed pate that is al to see thea capouty one of tho to gans is colleagues an eanis department she teaches classes about women's literature and the subjects targeted in belegislation wis open to interpretation with no explanation of what the punishment would be that sh onsy could not figure out what she should be teaching femnis theory and gendistudies were baked into her courses she worried about losing her tenia and getting fired and sas she spent an enormous amount of time this possimester trying to do what ever she could to protect herself i had started writing a new arical just bout a week ago and no look at the first tate i was you a prowd i wrote don tha i wrote the introduction of i had written lot of notes that i finally tat out the computeran wrote op the introduction at well guess wited references on a concet called the les bein continuoman e second charatre what is the les been continual a e a lesin continuain the concept here were talking femini teory oh the a word a terrible thing the lesie continuais er is a concet put forth by athe lesbie and feminis coe atrian rich and her theory es that be cut in a piturical heroseces culture where women ar solly responsible precaring for infance every child every infante first love is his or her mother anso that for women the initial tis position in tantect love and a haderosectes coltur forces a woman to realine herself and e inother words if you thorde republican who believes that radical liperal professors are turning sunis gay thi article would be a red fag you see dout how this witnelia i see no howyoure in it yer here every everything i ont to do everythin an get excited about and makes me feel a in secure at the at the same time its i this gone an make me her brate me the sholl effect esere is a lie this is one of the people who wrote h b nine nine nine state representative alexan drada boble he been hearing about miss shieling effect from many critics of the vill y heis offensive when i asked about it at first about his intended very angry that people tought he in the bill er raes which he denies te lie he says a thear that greeted h b nine nine nine was inflamed by democrats and the media was advis when i said that professors were feeding the neded to change their courses he was cons good i vevhen need to the whole purpase of the bills to if you can make an argument tiit e fact ii enials and if yeu want a silll teacher conclusion without eteens i egudation sutions an sea fortof me notbe for you hee's the thing and drawna does not believe that sostemic racism is inherent to the institutions of the united states to day even no a whole host of acanemic work says it is he says it is important that people learn about thisistemic racism of the past none about jim crow for example but that is the past he says if there is an institution that is raeis right now he said to me i'll figd it with you that weant tell what is situa races i just a system it is unaherently unequal and does pis proportinately effect black men and theys a direct line between highrates of casceration and policing that is tire to possible implicit raciel byus i think that is pretty that is pretty cut and dry a dot that r e question a quest there inin instances bhat ive just old im that if you point whas you in institution that istentually da races to day i will fighd it with you iw can that that is gran i hope you noticing te distinction an drad is making here he saying there are i say in instances of say black men being arrested because they areblack but that is not proof of insitutional racism there is no evidence e cannot point me what what institution is races to day yi am in i have but thes se me one hee col to have other questions and i went to be wa you io come on me well i do not know i would disagree o that and a big part of teaching also is us acknowledging wheever way of the scholarship is and if a way of the scholarship which it does says that a lot of our systems in this country are inherently unequal because initially ther were not necessarily built to serve everybody i'm i there is that that jus kind of his woat it is ne thethere is no theres no disagreement jim crow last for a races ye thereare i evidenceas testema graces are however i then in tis saying tou day i our institution s or inherently races ye that is where you would disagree he dis is just is false i w red dis agree i do not fickutsfals i know it is not but i'm no that thank you for shorwing that he did this a few times presented with the way the evidence he just say there is no evidence or he would mention a study that he would seen and this is what is making life of professor hard they do already present clear and fact base evidence then dran is telling them they cannot state what thay evidence thas up to if it is conclusion he and for a publican legislature do not agree with how do you navigate that a's will not professor told me begod does get up teran be there is o e's discrepancies in health outcomes but i cannot tell yu why that jus not teaching i reached out for the sansadministration to ask them about agebe nin nine nine it did not directly with one of my questions instead ther preser catore sent me links to a descantist press conference and a couple of other public statements about the bill and the message from those was pretty clear if you one o teach stuff about critical race theory or genderadeology we are not going to be funding it go somewhere else doctor gane said that professors had that message loud and clear students did to cason te sure sheas following the news about the bill she came up and approache me at the end of my glass and she was just very upset she said what are you going to do about it what did she mean by that i think she meant are you going to cr tail what you would have to say or what we are going to read or a teach are you going to roll over case wan said jactly meant something a little different i wanted to know how she was handling ex te cani onted to know how i should handle it almost oh you were i needs ask her how she is hounting it i couln't know how sasy i should be taking this how afraid i should be yer doctor ganes told case since she was not a change o hospital but she been feening the pressure a few weeks ilia she decided to show a documentary in both of the cosse she was teaching bat some mester the documentary was coled in visible history middle flought is hidden roods nd it was a documentary about the legace of slavery around the on county wherete se was located the first coctor showed it to was old grad students and when the film was finished there was to stone silence in the room one mi graduate sudent said whele the sandison one us to see that is in doctor ganes he just did something i could get you in trouble thougt ta ganes was surprised this was just a fact mas ocumentary that had been made by a film make an inresidence a fisou it is pretty finching in the way it ties lhe on countys jimcrow paus with its present half an hour later she sqreen the same documentaryfi casein's class and they in the middle of the film when she noticed something i think the documentary was about had got to a point about lynching it is very heavy moment i'm not kinsay it was not yon that history is hard that painful in that history is right here inly in county itself and there is a moment where a student walked out of the class room while i was sreening i literally kind of jumped in my seat is i was not sure why he was leaving doctor gane stouged panicing i was immediately thinking is he walking out because he is protesting what i'm screening is he walking out because he is made very uncomfortable by this documentary about i'm slavery inly on county or middle florida all these things are kind of racing through my head a i ganes was not show what would happen it if she had offended his kit anso she wrote down some notes about whey etxactly in the film he would walked out where and then sat that otanxiousle loocing at the atte studence to see if any one else as can a follow leaving and then that student came back a few minutes leater he had just gone to the rest room and ii'm having this ogash he was just using the rest room i take me the suten and he had matually gone to the bart room he said into the whole becuse ase some newsy gone the doctor ganes was seing frents where ther want any she is beginning to doubt herself it is that double think tha i have never had to do in a class room in my entire career y only april as the bill was being debated in committee casein was finding it increasing me diffibcult to stay up the s she saw news about the bill's progress it had been a rough som ester i was trying my best rin or it even though there was a kind of constant baktrap of stress wit everything happening and i sought obout droption out of college wer i yet it ranson my head several timeeventhough i entaate i no sof fok as i getting to clss in my head several times o maybe i should just fa lout it it is canne li if some one ivs you er a beautiful presen li ma give you a beautiful watch tis sa hay i might take this away any second and wi it away i'm to schapin a mudy would you accept the watch would you want aware on yeur rest that after it is gone you have to see the place where it was you nik te lold tan where the watch wes would you want to still axcept that watch but when it would feel kind of safer to night hav it at all whout of th te mester thinish the santos sign his being higher and package that final lord did not have some of the things the professors i spoke we found most alarming they drop the idea that no one could majo or miner in gente studis or feminous theory or critical race theory they drop the idea that unruly professors could have their tenu of youed at any time but the lord does say that in genlen ducation courses you cannot teach idendity politics all that systemic rasesm ar sexesm are built inte te institutions of the united states case a solver news about the bill passing and for about her future thennont don stop here she told me who knows what further restrictions to high education they might make next year i she wants to co round for that i's a thing she is tolking about a lot nowadays of a people in her life with her friends with her parents just what staying or leaving would mean especially is a black person in the south i was in that particular ats face on when i went to my dat a housic i think i ak it ou of this state wet i do not think i should stay here whatsoever i do not feel safe and she c ot that in then is mer alike but we do not run from things that nows i dod t lig whan you dagging abot ano lak where black people were living in the south if we wleft every time weu felt threaten no one would be here right now and illas kind of just as i deat when people are trying to scare you away you do not just go on with it you do not do them the fafer of wevin you stay any try to make things raht if you do leave it is because you found something then you definitely know is better you we for you not for thom wever ol not casean stays and floridar frue grad school the one thing she knows for shore is that she still wants to be a professor jislike doctor ganes the new law did not change that it did have a chilling effect but what maght looks right now among the professors i talk to is people feeling for may be changing their coorlse names or removing things from their see these but mostly these educators are standing their ground and teaching the same things they were before bolt to games for instance that class about majyour american writers she decided to go ahead and teach only black woodas from the horlem renissence dot to see your capruty is moving ahead of er articreferencing the lest being continuine the faculty unions

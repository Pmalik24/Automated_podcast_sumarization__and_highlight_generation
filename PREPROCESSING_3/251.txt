caribian in the world most days crownhids feels a lot other neighbourhoods ive lived in corner bodega here of the crestore there gentrification creeping in but one weekend every year i wake up torage and soka feathers and foats and people waving flags fro all o ses barely anywhere to stand disgason stilts nd ore a polece everywhere it feels the neighborhoods been copletely transl but of course

that weca thovin had first some of us heaveng got pretty wet they with us athe typical image inew yorkers have wit the westerndinday parade is of thousands of peen dancing down eastern parkway in elaborate costumes that are as colorful as they are skimp feathered had dresses winged back packs tiaras jewel bechinis i learned that this is called playing mass the mass is short from askarade my col produced er jestican i went out realy early on labor day an met it with some masqueradors who wu dressed in costumes that they had chosen from a selection of different movy things the little mermaid coming to america an sho birls just to say thfits were only marginly related to the fillins was more about color palot than anything one woman wore a plume of black and yellow feathers a vokin quinton ternte was most famous herwin im explain your costume which which costume is a ot ikilbill a i regret these big feathers out on a wengol with is but ai visi kilville and why do you regret at

outfit does not coming out it took me two hours and a lopeople break it down already we knew a hit the barkway we just know if you going to do it just carry a lot of crat not a la but carry some crazy wil with you you will be putting youself together what you get out here what made you decide i kilbell a to be onest iy on shabby kilbill had a mono piny and i liked it i went with that and a i mea a two pleas we a frends right now and a we at the jem o i'l billa was hi for many people plain mastarts even earlier than the parade at the parade before the parade it is called juvat and its ha celebration with deep deep roots in the caribian ju rase mithology is populated withoutlandish characters the menacing midnight robber with his wide brimmed hat the insamely voluptuous dame arain and the many devils rider a mighty brown grew up with juvay but she did not she stot going until she got to brooklyn her story starts over two thousand miles away in trinada carnivl is big that she study it in school the year i turned ten we were given on a sign ment to pick one of the traditional carnival mass characters we just learned about create a costume and put on a performance in front of the rest of the school picking my cartto was a struggle but in the end i settled on the jab molassy sometimes called the blue devil in trinadad i picked it mostly because i knew the costume would be one of the easiest to make and time was running out i cut holes into an old para shorts an a thin teacher i fashion horns from paper tawel rolls and loose strips of paper into a chain that i could wrap around my body a picch fork i fabrigated from tree branches from my back yard completed the look on the day of the performance i changed into my costume in the classroom smared myself all over with blue paint and then headed towats the auditorian i was the kind of child who avoided attention and everything in me was fighting the idea of being on stage when i stepped out alone in front of the whole school my heart was racing my teacher told us that the ja molassy was a demon that terrorizes a creature barely kept on its leash on the stage that day i might have crouched or jumped or his or bared my teeth at the crowd i'm not sure i just remember my anxiety was not painful any more it was exhilarating i felt wicked and masty an playful and trickin completely out o character and still utterly myself deeply inside my body and yet somehow fluws hand bovit when it is good that is what it feels to playmas for long time masten wo fe mine i grew up in trinadad but my father and mother are from jamaica and diana respectively carnival in those places simply does not compare to the space the festival takes uc an trinadad wher carnivalis came and its influence swirls year round everyone my mother would say laughing as shar her head every one from the biggest partia to the most religious church mouts is out on the road come mondaye my fimily did not go to church regularly but there was no way my parents regana let me participate and carnivill propa as a teanages that was for grown people when i left trenadad for college in the states the loneliness took me by surprise i was eighteen and homesickness was o physical and nearly constant ache it was then that i played juve for the first time at brooklynds labour day parade there i finally felt at home again and in the year since the parade has become a spiritual practis juve always begins in the dark this year climb in up and out of the subway at gran army plaza the sky is not quite pitch black but it is close against the glear of police flood lights i can just make out a stream of people trickling down the road in clumps my friends and i join the stream moving towards the end why p d metal bari is that narrow into a check point we are patted down an our bags open i juveas arrived from the french pural word for daybreat and traditionally brooklyn starts as a round four i am ending not too long after the sun rises but this year the rising sun is what marks the beginning of the parade at six i am the parade is starting much late than usual the reason given is that it would help curbe the violence that many have come to associate with the event in twenty fifteen a young lawyer in governor andruwkomofs administration carry gabay was hit and killed by a strableet along the rut the next year it was reported that four people were shot at the parade two of whom died here is whats rarely mentioned in those nusual ports the violence that black people experience in these long neglected neighbourhoods his year round it does not end when the camas leave the paraye and in some cases the incidents that the media of connected to the parade happen away from the parades actual rout the news coverage juve tippicy receives is frustrating but not surprising no matter what parts of the globe your fron that this is part of what it means to be black the things you do to secure joy for yourself in a world that would rather see you dead bhe come the way the world then rationalizes your suffering for the media for every one outside of our community the story of the parade is the story of the violence this is why it feels impossible to smile back when the offices checking our bags grins is if wore sharing an inside joke and comments just need to make sure you do not have a gun before letting us through once were past the check point the crowd thickens it is clear that for some people the morning is just beginning and that for others a long nights e parting is simply stretching itself a littlef it longan every one is drifting chipping own the street in no real hurry no one is wearing anything that would not mind sacrificing to the juva gods old tanks and short shorts raty te sharits and strappy dresses that ride up the thi flags are everywhere tied around waists worn as capes the rad green and gold a grenada's flag in particular can be seen near and fought the closer we get to the front of the rout the more clearly we can hear the sound of whistles and conxs up the road the tinny sound as somebody bthing out are rithem on a small metal pan is joying briefly by the heavy beat of a cowbat both are swallowed up by the sound of the steel pan ban warming up and the devils are out the grenadian jabjabs are covered from head to tow and slick black oil the whites of their eyes and teeth seem to jump out to their skin locks and wages and brades are wrapped up tightly in plastic bags sacrifice and old clothes is one thing but get ing oil and powder out of a newsoin is quite another the devils wear hard hats and helmets crowned with black horns i narrowly avoid getting hit by one of the many shopping carts many of the devils are pushing down the road most of dem full of plastic bags and buckets and in some cases other passed out devils the smell of greast and smoke rows heavier two young devils spot my friends and me and loudly procran that we are too pretty one of the devils dips his hands into a bucket of ail and the other beckons us closer he smiles wide and it is both a daar and or promis and invitation and o threats we shake our heads but we are all laughing as he walks up to us and starts rubbing us down with the oil anylay hou do not come to juve if wee not prepared to get teir to you harvans pulling along the rhythm section and eel pan bands who are now in full sway start inching down the road a woman climes on top of the bumpa of avan whining her waist slowly in a smooth rippling motion that extends from her shoulders down to her lags a man haist thimself up behind her and she picks up he pakes we flag down a young woman selling nut crack es sweet drinks makes heavily with rum and vadga the spite reports of a crack down on the sailor whose drings she ask if she can take a picture of us that she then pulse on her insugrand to promote her business we all gage wif known each other for years as we ga trying to mark the moment the parade slides from darkness into daylight is trying to tract the ripening of a mangle it happens slowly and then all at once suddenly i am squinting into the sun and everything that felt clear in the night looks and feels strange to be now this is a part of it too within this space what is real and what is a allucination moco jumbis shore for the performes on six foot stilts drift by clouds without looking down three devils coved and white paint are on the roof of a nearby building whining and waving a huge trinadade flag over the crowd as if claiming territory how did they get up there i have no idea but somehow in the moment there is nothing that does not make tems juve began as a way to celebrate surviving the most brutal aspects of slavery in juve you can see ut of the eyes of the demons that one's drovy with the wip you can embody the worst thing that ever herd you and come out the other side invincible when our people were enslaved they were driven into burning cane fields to harvest the lan those that survived came out covered in soot and ash the harr defies imagination but at every turn we have been taught that we are weak that we are cowards that we are less than human we play juvete to remember that no one has the power to make monsters of us but ourselves we play juve and in that time we become more fersome than anything that could ever terrorize us in a world that askd us to be quieter to do less to except the worst of everything and to pretend to it juve becomes the altar where we can finally fall to our knees and worship ourselfs i am too not cractice in when the brass of the rhythmsection really gets going something deep and sweet sails me this year has been harder than most i have not had the money for a plain ticket and at's been over as years since i was an my back yard pressing my feet into the grass watching the sun set feeling the wetness of the air hug my body there is a person i am when i am home and i miss her desperte now a carnt runs through my chest my belly my legs i am not home but i am hoe i'm home i swing my hips and ron my waist and slow dass and for a moment feel the way a day

work forcuses on race gender and corebin oshe wass pretty much all sommer if we walking around certain parts of brookland hwith a sound of steel drums late to the night but sheu never really see them i was wonder where the steel droums coming from because when the parade comes along it is all flatbed trot sloaded with deja equitment and booming speakers r was all that steel drumming i heard as turns out part of laborday carnivol as a whole steel drum competition it' called panorama those mysterious tropical sounds in the night those who steel dum orchastras practicon sometimes a hundred people all playing together whan i say to people i practice every night those ay what can you do this and i kno i have practice you practice every night my y s a practice every ni a n aly even members of our family you going to practicse yes we are going to practice is what we do that is angy and her daughter jona this as the thing they do together every year all summer long band they were really hoping their band would win this year the competition was spaciclly gin toh be the last thing they did together as mom and teenage daughter as soon as it was over literally hours after it was over jona would get on a flight and leave home for her first year in college i dont know anything about steel drums or pans as they called but we found a reporter morlan bithop who was also a musician and who loves this instrument he followed ange anjona as they prepared and one of our producers notty raymon went with them to the competition the band ange anjona playin is called rados the name comes from this famous band an trinted at called desperados the uest brang of it was called despers but then there was a rebellion in the ranks and the band split it was a divorce the rebbels were you want to be desperates find well be rados that was years ago that and it is all good now well kind of the rivals friendly rivals we do not want them win eecessary we ought to t wiy we want a wint on our own not no no we do not what i do not want them to win ywe do not want them to as we want to wit that yet no no no i can te sayou want o wind al you li i i li i don' want tse any one to win rados to in there bend rados has a reputation for being a vibes bad maybe not as tight as some other groups but compensating with spirit on the stage they play loud and bolds it for a wild rados did with three years in a row but then last year despers that was one lass y i ery rubbling as ho i was sad we work h i first met anje and jona at the big lot where the band practicis it is in an industrial part of

when she was eight years old played every year since she loves it much that in this last summer before she leaves for college she is choosing to spend every night right here with her mom getting ready for the competition the way the panorama competition works each band plays in eight to ten minute long incredibly complicated arrangement of a popular soca song the arrangements are filled with crazy runs and break downs which in a kind of colipso arms race get more and more virtuasic every year every one will tell you the kee to winning this thing it is having a god arranger the person comes up with all the parts most bands use local arrangers from brooklyn but rados hires a ringer from trinadad gotin b j normaly they will bring up b j for the whole summer to teach the song but this time is a problem he had trouble getting a visa he is been teaching over the phone every night some one gets their sel fom with ta cable an a connected to this giant speaker that everone gathers around b j teaches the music by calling out the notes one by one through the phone which this other guy called the drill master then repeats to the rest of the orchestra thaa aans ou stop ba b aasis o te m b ja has to teach every note of a ten minute song this way and there is not just one part it is in a hundred person orchestra with tdifferent sections that play different notes in rithems no sheet music involved this is music learned o entirely by ye a r the yard feels an exptended family barbicu that happens every single night thes a make shift bar in the back that serves beer and food that is for all the good gossip happens over all it is about half players and half people who are just there to hang out lots of kids running around significant others of band members plusacan tigen of old guyes smoking weed in the back people said a feels kindlike being back home in th caribian during braks jona hangs out with her best friend z and some of the other girls her age on a set of wooden bleachers

is this american life i neal drumming sitting in for our glass to day show we come from small places stories from the westendan american day parade in the labor day carnival in brooklyn orcity the neighbourhood that the parade goes through includes another group of people that are unapologetically themselves that is the festidic cues on this day you will see many of them dressed up in a costume thats particular to their culture but on the mass players they weare their uncolorful costume seround the long black coats and black hats and beards out fits the day back to nineteen century poland during the parade they all seem to be rushing down the street people on their way to an important appointment not looking at the festivities at all my col work er i reglask the regular host of this programm was at the parade with us and tried to talk to some hossids about this huge uly event that tikes place in the neighbourhood walking up to hosids on the street fel walking up to people from another panet people add a general air of hostility for at we suspicion towards outsiders me the wade me off best i got was from a young man who took pity on me and gamely mustered this non committal quote about the parade every pesson has a right to do what they want wat they feels right but if finay found one hossid who would actually talk to me but marching myself over to seven seventy eastern parquaye the word white headquarters of the abad movement abod is the biggest hossid organization and seven seventy is such an important spiritual sight for them that a repicod the building it seven seventy eastern parquay was built in jerusalem ner we are brick by brick copy withother repicas in cities around the world weh include the numbere seven seventy on the building the number has mystical significance meaning among other things benning on he asked bade moshia house of th massia the seven seventy is not just has three tid get number on the door an the idrest ot sove sev eastern parkuay brook the new york it is the house of our leader the leader of the entire human race the a lot o oviser avi rite the man telling me this is you hood i manasha gold skeene everywhere as a middle aged fellow with a very kind face an long graing beard as miram glasses suring word hes tulking about the last great leader of the cabad movement whense died nineteen ninety four word i's no successor manoom mendal shneerson en i ote as was om yu huda the beliefs nearest him was the massiarolds than during his lik you despoke with me because he is taken out on him self to be asterly o which is kind of emissary or missionary spreading the word about god's laws water iordint what that memwas that when i strode up to seven seventy he seemed just as glad for some dear talk to his iy was welike he walked up to me as the seven lagor god had send is spoth out to talk to strangers on this day at the parade i and now which here we were i o one will w he admitted he put up a handmaid sign across the parade rout about the seven laws of noather in the wodlico he as cin hoping that the sign would do a lout ofthe posotizing for him to day nd he would nhave to engage too much with the crowd to the weakness of the of the eyes i tried to put signs over there to do my work for me cause if i see what is going on over here it really triggers a lot of emotional or a been thoughts that hav the reallys not let played out yet plat ot to guard your eyes and tis what you mean woll the distracting secually xplassit beautiful women theare very rousing porocativ member were standing on a stremwer of itry hundreds of women wen bekeenes going by shed the lots of bear skin the women on top of that fot going by you are not spus to even look at them i played the fist man were in occurred to me i did not realize right to have a parade this right in the middle of the hossid neighbourhood right here and find o at seven seventy a it is a challenge riht and i had prayed about a last night and i was fifty fifty with god cause there was full on wanding it and i was follon askou for help to overcome and not send because i knowwere my weakness as i'm very human an very masculan and when you see that very feminine is ilittle more than a challenge toe but when yogod as blessing you got as with you you can still manase to not send what did you pray for praye that god would prevent me from sining a prevent you from looking even wella after admit that i asked that wut obviously el whatever it is it is a its ais ti to fight i man you seem to be quite noninterested to look yourself you seem me more interested in getting a story an talking an writing in their material for i have a jobinsfes to do ga also am a secular person who 's allowed to look at women walking by in a parade god wans is to be holy you co tosaid he wants is to elevate our souls and really he said the right thing to do to day would be to guaird his eyes he admitted crawl is praying last night to day a couple times as looking

feathers and this is cart a funny thing that i n her a lot of them come from this one shop on westerdy sever street in the carment distrate one of leave eastern park way for a minute and take you there we visited a couple of weeks before the parade it is a candy store inside except the bends that wind the walls are filled with different colors of feathers sequins and rinestones the owner is not from the west indies he is never been a brook of cornigal hes names high and he is originally from china nd he showed my co produce suggestive to some of this sears costumes including an outfit with about a thousand rinestone sone into it i dn as that clearer whites ar wet aby a be what is that mean a raura boriale color these r e all aby colored stones a is on me what is it it it color changes spaced on the light dision a lot of collors and it when i first opened his shop hes main customers were figure skaters ball room dancers and drag queens hes never heard of cornigal then about twelve years ago a trindadian man walked into his shop and asked for four hundred identical sequent applicades turns out the gui was bying them fo cornigal one of the big costume group sou see march in the parade he called mass bans were mass camps gan the mass is for maskerade now hides the goachi gad for conical feathers for many bans not ju here but all over the caribian every one knows high

down rain early labour day morning jussican i found may be a hundred masquerders hiding out an a near by walkings in the cosmaticcile i saw one posing for a picture some odd winged super model

the sity is getting more and morse strick every year about when the paradus pose to and every one supposed to be off the road by six masqueraders are less inclined to pay a banli ramashate for the experiencs they one of our bat bigest batelis why should i spend since sonjallos for costume in new york when ti can spend oun h sli send lush o got to make up o somewhere else than play mastiy that is r a shell the woman we met in the feather shop on thirty seven she founded ramaget about a decet ago and turned it into the family business her father played mass and trinedat and to this day still spends months helping her make the bans lavish costumes by hand for a shell these days not eleugh people are willing to commit to the masquerade to the tradition of playing mass when you wolk when you see now ye do not see much costumes in you see a lot of teashits and dislives alotef people do not get te witness te beauty os the coutin the cautions an ecaus te jesse flags a lags in shall bansin

cutting loose that seems to be happening more and more and it drys ray shell and her staff crazy when ramage rose down the parthway speaker's glastsome by standers hopped the metal barriers and flood the ban's ranks dancing and waving the clags people call this storming some mass players welcome it the morthe marrier but it does not look great the traditional mass players in their feathers and jewels jostled and crowded by stormers and shorts and cheeshirts and everyday street clothes its just massin an the can also be dangerous people get harassed even assaultet ifice can break out the

do not nes thit everyi things that be hapme a and i teng it is finally get ahed that i we cross that daye to what last i ah that no cat happen agan it is easy to think of a parade as something unchanging something the pass is through the same place the same time every year the carnival is this living thing that goes anywhere its welcome picking up pieces here and there and dropping them off along the way just as romagey is reaching the end of the parade rau the sky cracks open again drenching the procession in steady sheets of rain plenty of people fleet through the barriers for the safe tn v open subway entrances or store front lawnings but a lot of people stay and then something kind of magical happens ramages deje's crank up the music she leave the mass bands an chance of wetted up and the people want water almost as if they were taunting the clouds daring the rain to fall y the masquerators already soggy from earlier collective ly deside what the hell and stare to jump up in

this way small stuff can become really trans fixaying the sheer tininess of tiny things can have a kind of mesmerizing power to it we are tag g about this at her office last week and bim took the most extreme stand on this i draged he into the studior to talk about this i just generally small things if there is a small version of a thing i am interested in seeing it or reading abous it will hearing abouts it it is been why told me about the radically tiny tubs of vasiline you can buy wich have the exact design of the bigger jars it is about the size of my thumb nail made yim my thumbnail in a holf they very small ard very cute they do not look they real they look ornaments that you might hang from a christmas tree and whet you about them is what i about them is just how small they they seem almost pointless you can find vasilin in any number of other sizes the fact that this exists i think feel it feels somebody just yet it was just a pointless gesture let us make vasiline even smaller li cang y imagine them looking across one another can young hay should we make this smallar in solmo they the need on they we precisely and i think i think small things by nature are whimsical they just feel oh you do not have to be you do not have to exist but here you are and that is what makes them kind of joyful the just things for the pleasure of smallness it staring at smallness it is when you look at abrokaly an you think all i'm a ginan this is a small tree it is that feeling i'm allys folty you still have that for you look at a brackuay yo think it is a small tree i do not still have that feeling i used e the feeling when i was a child i will noting o no one ha to you yo mays n i program small things considered if there is of people overlooking what is great about the tiny the miniscule the pe we the byte size and the tansy winsee also s very dramatic examples of the power of smallness gooing for instance the power to end helth in surance as we know it from ilians of people tey mey be easy chicago its this american life i mare a glass my voice ffected by some sort of tiny tiny bug this week stay with us a n coming up sort i'll go we got an amal from a physician who was starting to see a tren that disturbed her amon her patients she went in a skin to it wethat i contributors scot brown would be the best person for the job for reasons hat to become queer as he proceeds here scot this doctor told us that all these parentshave been coming to her scabs of them she used the word inundated with the same problem their kids were short not dramatically short they were just below average heite for their age we are talking nine ten eleven year old kids and what these parents wanted was for this doctor to prescribe them human growth hormon injections to make their kids taller these are daily injections that cost tens of thousands of dollars a year it is usually affloent privilege families this doctor says who already have all the advantages she whent as faras to call the desire for growth hormone among these folks an epidemic because i've had parents come to me and say every one i know is s on growth hormon that was an actual quot every one i know is on thi stuff or it is all the rage in this anonimous community very affluent community this doctor wanted to be completely anotomous by the way she feels she is whistle bloid in fact this is not her real voice we swoptor voics for an actors in our recording of the interviu since i cannot identify her i'll refer to her from hereon as short throat all we can say is she is a pediatric inte chronologist that is a children's doctor specializeing in stuff thi bedese iroyd problems and growth she says she got into medicine to treat sik kids but fully half of her patients are coming to her just for the growth part parents will you not find out one kit is being treated and is seen that their child because their below average need needs o to oh if theyre doing it then am i can be missing out in fact i think the phrase one momused with something i'm just trying to be proactive and worried i do not miss my window of opportunity that window is real parents have to stactor kids on the drug by the time their hitting pubrity short throat has been practicing for bout seven years but she works closely with other doctors who have been at it for decates and they do say that it is gotten much much worse they do not remember anything this i mean one of my senior collegues it is almost she 's surprised every time i cannot believe this kid came in here look at this growth chart and i walk in the office tat it is a kit growing at the forty ave percentile with parents who are the forty of percentile fortieth per centile meaning forty per cent of the rest of the country is shorter than they are just below average and she is cannot yan't believe there here for growth and am yes i can believe that because were see this is everyday you call me in and are fabrigasit by the same thing i had a conversation where i had a patient comes to me her son was five fat seven mam was fi for dad was fivin they wanted treatment if you say something in them will his predicted height is five nine you might get a response that something well that is an acceptable you are laughing but that is my job im i'm laughing for somebody diffrent r isns do you get it now oh i get it i've got in in my whole life this is probably the point in the story where i should level with you if i could georgo i'm just under five three which puts me right around the first per centile of american mails by height shorter than ninety nine per sent of the men in this country for years i thougt i was five for second per centile but a recent doctor visnit confirmed that i'de been rounding up i've always been the smallest gying the room consistently smaller than other kids for as long as i can remember there' some downsides sure but i think ihave a pretty good life my success is in failures i do not lay them at the tiny feet of my shortness my height is just one thing about me not thething not the defining thing but recently i wrote a young adull novel about a sixteen year old boy whose four foot eleven and strugglin with his identity and i found myself thinking every day about being short what it meant to me what it might av ment what i might a miss and then i hear from this doctor about all of these parents who think having a sun my size is unacceptable and come to her to fix it to fix them short throat tells the families who just one of wen hands their kids height that she will not do that but that does notalways stop them there are some private practice pediotric under chonologists in our area who i mean the prase i've used is i feel lik they woul thy've growth hormon to a rock if you got some too sitting people down and giving them the worst case in areal high prediction and then being this is what you need and then treating them oh their consult is part of saying as i you on't hav the shore t get ere you on ye you do not want a hobit oh absolutely that is what the ere i mean i know the prescribing practices of all other peds annows in our aira because people bounds around and thee doctor shop and they want otheir opinions among the things that bother her the most a lot of the parents seem oblivious to the possibility of side effects but really the biggest be in short throwts growth hormon bonnet is the farinis aspect the full treatment over four or five years can cost three hundred thousand dollars or more and even though most of these families ar rich they find ways to get it covered by insurance when some of her diabetic patients cannot even get the latest insolent pop covered she also says she seen rich families take advantage of patient assistance programms the drug companies offered o needior foults i have seen affluent patience get on these quotan quot patient assistance programmes when okat this the terrible but sometimes i will zilla their house and a'll velic you live in six million dollar home and you'r getting patient assistance for your kids growth hormon gros grus justgruss it is important to say short throwat does treat some kids with growth hormon kids who are not producing enough of it or any of it on their own that is a serious health problem but she will also treat them if a kid is just going to be really really short wayway below average way down in those basement persentiles where i am using growth hrmoni's cocherin kases this according to the f t e that is because there is a diagnosis for people me and learned about it while researching my book it is called idiopathic short stature i essess sound scarry but all it means is i'm short and kno one knows one and because i fit that diagnosis i could have been one a short throwts patiente yes even our whistle blower who believes this stuff is over used would have treated me if i'd come to her if my parents had wanted and is one of those other wise healthy kids whos just short and who kind resince the use of the word otherwise i had all of this looks not a whole lot medicin it looks cosmatic a bootjob for kids short kids but before i went off on a napoleonic rage bender over the claims ot this one roge grow doctor i thought i'd run those claims by doctor david b allan another pediatric anter chronologist and ardua bly the leading experd on this topic he sat on the panel that wrowte the recent guide lines for growthormon treatments for kids spend writing papers about it for three decates specifically about idiopathic short stature you actually i may not to get pfersonal but a ousomewla you dofit t the o diagnoss you ma did you just dionoas may over the re it is amazing i may nofve got lot of his furius ahe said he did not think unnecessary growth hormon treatments for kids was an epidemic per say the reluctants of insurents companies to cover such an expensive and if he treatment keeps widespread is tamp down but sure there are lots of families in more image conscious wealthy places who put their kids on it when he writes about using growth hormon for height not health the phrase he usesis cosmetic and o chronology and he told me this story back in the day growth hormon was used almost exclusively on kids who were growth hormon deficient the way you give insolent to a dibatic and the onlye sorce for the stuff back then was the pe tuitary glance of cadavers dad people the supply was limited anfortunately because it came from cadavers some of it was tainted with the brain to see similar to mad cown itwas a free thing this was in tha aties dosens of young people got sec some of them died but that same year syntetic growth hormon became available now there was lots of the stuff lap made safe from contamination doctor allan told me in my producer shown colds that the drug industry and doctors started looking around for r other uses say making idiopathically short kids less itiapathically short you knr reado yo past ac shurt stature really became a thing once there was growh hormon a treatment available it might work an meter was a descriptive term you courses been a descriptive term for longlong time but as he dignosis an i think it was more really after there was a treatment available it is one of these situations where it is almost a treatment that is in search of a dignosis ye soa aa solution in search of a problen sort of ye struc e jangling and also why are we treating shortness its a disease because when you look into it as researchers have there is no evidence time being short to having a bad life studies show short kids get teased bullied the're often treated as younger than they are but there is no direct connection between being small and failing at life i for instance did not and ot debresston alone living any tiny cardboard box behind bob's bigwoy at least not because of my height another thing doctor allan said is that the use of synthetic growth hormon in kids is generally agreed to be safe but he said it just has not been on the market long enough for us to know yet there could be an increased risk of cancer down the road one study and only one points to more instances of stroke among a dults who took the drug's children thing is we will not really know how dangerous the stuff is until thirty r forty or fifty years down the line also on average kids who take grwth hormon might gain three inches a little less than half an inch per year but that is average youre heihdach may very a lot could be more could be less i'll just note that less than a little less than half an inch a year would be a very sad title for a countrysong the darkest irony here is doctor allan says the kids you think need the drug the most kids are short parents are the ones who benefit the least and it is conceivable that there is some risks that were do not yet know about or just learning about iu o twenty years down the road that this completely healthy ten year old as now been exposed to for a benefit that we have a lot of difficulty documenti a me tat to me that is the connundroom right not a cannundroom for me the health effects are unknown benefits un certain and even if he get taller you are not necessarily happier then i'm not putting my kid on it not for a maximum three inches total not for a half inch a year who would choose that for their kid i decided to find out you to call i growth hormon gait som reou to callin snappy we should definitely do that it is finin i cannot tell yo any of these folks names either therre in southern california i'll call the dad jeramy he is a doctor he is five foot eight the mom who i'll call laura is five foot for she is a personal development coach are there are two kids delan and marney also not their real names delan's been taking growth hormon injections for five years andwe asked laura why they wanted to be anonymous enit is a little embarrassing must have his fobby peers out know as clos friends now but enogh far girls kid if she shore im potep a for guy kind of say something about your mascolin any or i just one in ta protect hin for whatever rasons short turn long turn they all live in a big beautiful house with a pool that contains what i'm fairly sure is a waterpologol delans on the team the living room is immaculate the lobby of a luxury hotel when we got there there was a dog room advan setting out front in which their dog was being groomed she lookd nice afterwards lar has been worrying about dellan size since he was a baby he was born pramy size even though she carried him full tern he' spent four or five days in the nikou and as he got older it just seemed he was having a hard time catching up to his friends ind the hight department he was the smallest in his teamfotos its glass fotoas always an outlier when she found out there was something that might help fix that just felt the right call to me it was a it was just a medical twice thait it was never esthetic it just was more medical and i do not know f at it is interesting we have slightly different views and perceptions again this is jerimy he is a doctor you would expect him to come at this from a medical necessity point of view too and he does but he is totally upfront about his less doctory reasons i just stariget a bit on ma guile i want him to be big and strong and if he can be sbigger and stronger but to get to that the the risk factory had to be eliminated and would did what was the poin where you were while now we can start thinking about bigger and stronger because i am satisfied that whatever long term studies theyr i i i i it was there was a risk i had to con o take at least it was it my life it was not worry nunskin id no just now you penty a e tervios ir no i ad it was tha risk you now its s not easy making that decision i ash i'm putting my son at ristor diabedies my brothers dibes i see it just a point out the risk of diabedies from pediatric growth hor amon use is more theoratical than anything else toctor's monitor for it but far there is no causallik thereas a love in the back of my mon o boy would not i just due to my son something might have happened that would have been reversible and i would have just never forgiven myself haw it happened i's no question was the back of my brain i'm a doctor i get it i do not think it but an i i was i've worried about in the back of my brain it is do not verbalize it but not on wood fortunalt es in fine and alwes seem his a benefits better than find jerremy says the drug seems to be working and he satisfied if i searched my hard of harts i'd be least for myself i'd be dishonest if i said i did not have superficial motivations exactly as you describe may be not said in those words future leader a more tractor to a made but i mean to unless youre giant who does not want be taller it dos a feel weird to be kind of feeding into that feeding in to this a theres societall y the societ all sort of clamoring trong it now were then your turn to look nice to day whyn't you dress nicely youare giving in to society looks at gets som my shoes on you get a collore surt and you pictyure glass did you pic the almost ugly glass as you could pick not you tri to picksome nice glassis right we all we ought to some degrees it is a continuum i do not thing is any wrong with that but would you have been sad if he had been scots hiit that stopped the conversation i offered to stand out for him ye he t the t o do not do that i i n the word sad i mean we would have always wonderd may be lik could he have what would have happened but it mean he does raise this question of in a fully paid a place society to you ind up with different tears of people some of whom have selected characteristics that thet con fer advantages wore seem to convered vandi mean i get it this this smacks of the whole essay t gat thing i this is all this whole let me gain the system let me i want my child to get a sixteen hundred as he te i want my t hild to go to harvard it is nacts of that and i get it but the same time i do not think it is all that sinister for us we just did not want im to be sitting below the steering we on and be made fot of or something that is con of which is where jarmy and lara's opinions about the whole thing ling up alodmor elaur used to blanch when people would ask of dellan and his little sister were twens she is two years younger and laura hated that her son wore clothes made for boys two years younger but all that is in the past now i this is della the tiisas uman fifteen years old i he came home from school in the midle of the interview still wearing his school uniform white pola shorts he is five foot six now i producer shon sensitive sold that he is had to stand back to back in lethe the back of s got said is going rit and to yeur a neck i would not one o i woeldn't wone to sis an an analy well i me thought we were though were pausebody ut here is the thing measuring yourself directly bodily against another human being it is not a natural situation tre's as a forty three year old man standing back to back a fifteen year old i felt this almost primal humiliation and just for a second i thought did i miss out on something i felt a little jealous now w o larad spread out the charts on the coffee table inches fir is years tellan's whole history of growing up band up band up from elementary school on and a laggardly perabla that takes off a rocket round the time he started the growth hrma each dot is a measurement how i'm in the first tight per cent out for men in america dellan started off parked between the third and fifth per sentile and ended up nearly in the fiftieth almost average it made him feel proud cause i saw each stack climbing and it was going up whos only going up and at to me was ocam getting taller but i am going to be a little side that i cannot be as tall as i wanted to be i'd to be on five ten or five eleven for sure that wy am a little bit above avage i've never thought about it that way what height do i want to be how average what i to be this demand side attitude about height was alien to be and standing there between this giant five foot six childs masted on shoulder blades i thugh about what had brought me here underneath my indignation my short identitarianism here is the thing i've glosst over a bit the downsides of being short i took some hard punches to the stomach and elementary school i often feel taken less seriously by taller people and professional situations i prefer phone meetings for that very reason i pretty much know thati've had friendships with women that might have been more than friendships if i'd ben a few inches higher off the dance floor i've watched the li mido drain for my daysizes as we stand on on the restauran table after desir i've been judging these people these parents trying to chack every box by every advantage but there was a moment a long time when my parents thought about putting me on growth horma and i was littlelittleer and they did not i have this reallyse strong memory of their telling me they would looked into it we were in a car this would ave been the minadis in virginia i remember an apple worker on our left te bareground on our right and my man telling me they considered it and tecided against it i remember thinking why are you telling me this it is the moment i became short the first time i really new it was o ficial doctors had been consulted powerful elixerious concidered maybe none of that should a com as a surprise i'm the outlier amongst my semblings my rother robert is six foot one even my little sister hollan is taller than i am they take after my dad who at five eleven is a full foot taller than my mom you all these years we have never talked about that decision why did not they want me to get taller why did not they make the choice still an's parents did i went home nd i asked my mama about that conversation in the car i hade kno memory of this at all how did that conversation come ot i mean i'm driving you home from school and i go by the way how moms have a way of making the pivital chapters in your personal history seem less pivital and more totally apocraphel ye it was that thing my mom very convincingly debunk to my big origin story of how i became short the time line was wrong the location was wrong the only true part was once upon a time i found out i was short and i'm clearly more hung up on it than i thought i was but mam confirmed they did decide not to treat me and we must ave talked about it back then i wanted to know why they did not treat me and the answer was pretty simple when i was about ten my pediotrician sent me to an enter chronologists to check my growthormon levels because i was small and doctors to check every box i got tested i was normal e terms of form on levels anyway and that is it they did not pursue it further also my father was a farma suitable research or who tested experimental medications my mam was a nurse they know about thi stuff and this was right after the stories came out about the tainted growthormon from cadavers i'd just listend to those stories and it was kind of a got thing it was conna well it took em twenty five years to figure that out that we had tisissue took him twenty five years in mi gong towaiy twenty five years to find out oh here is a really bad consequence of growthormon why i wasnt thet and we could not could not for a see it and i had a healthy son who as o thriving i thought and o was sharp got and why i did not want screw it up my parents were trying to protect me by doing nothing the same way laura and jerami were trying to protect dellan by doing something something elemental making him bigger but for my mom there is something else she does not think of what might have happened if she would made me bigger she thinks about what might havebeen lost if she had it is always been interesting to me to see genes well out what i mean when you say why you do that and my dad did that yu knowt syke a physical thing that thad somebody does or the way they they attitude they have or the way they handle their hands it is a it comes those ar genes comin out that that i to see they are familiar to me they are familiar to me to i remind myself of people life known my grandfather my uncle my mom i've got their bodies i'm built on their blue prints reliable blue prints that delivered several generations of tiny living things from primordial slime to this crazy risky present moment that is no small thing all i know is this is the box i came in and i hing here i thing tscot brown is a red to producer on the who lis serious castle rock he said to note novel about a super short kid who grows creakishly tall in the

undo a nine hundred page law and more about the power of tininess that is in a minute chicago bublicradio went our programm continues ti spari can mine from my re glass to day sho small things considered stories in defence of the little and the litlopution we'v arived at at two of our sho tat two let us give him nothing to talk about stav a gestabout has this story about something tha cut shrunk to exactly as small as something can possibly be with huge consequences the doplaying ot right now this very moment his david this thing that got made small it is a tax a couple years ago the government set it to zero zero dollars zero sense which makes what follows remarkable how could a tax small it does not actually exist cause any trouble but before i explain and since this show is about the importance of small things let me just confess here how much i love zero it is unlike any other number in its capacity for destruction zero times anything is zero no matter how big it always winds and even better is dividing when i was a kitin math glass i to put one divided by zero into my calculator it would show e for error because one dibided by zero there is no answer to that it is undefined divide by any other number in your fine one divided by two for instance or fifty seven are six hundred and ninety three but whut is zeroin ind it just blows up mathematicians call this kind of situation as singularity where the math is not well behaved in fact it stops making cents there singularities inside black holes but it never heard of a real world example outside of that until december fourteenth last year mor that brought helth curate the millions of americans hase been struck down by a us judge judge has ruled i unconstitutional may be remember this i know e judge in taxes ruled that the entire a fordable careact violated the u s constitution this is big news and it immediately got appealed but the signature domestic policy achievement of the entire obom of presidency the thing that right now is giving millions of american's health insurance that whole thing thes judge was saying it was unconstitutional had to go and the thing that set al this off a zero last year congress reduce to poenty tax for not having healping surance to zero the judge ruled that without theman explain how zero could blove an entire law when oboma care the affordable charact was written almost a decate ago it included this thing that people calld the mandate which basically said you have to have health insurance and if you do not you got to pay a fine in two thousand sixteen the average fine paid was a little over seven hundred dollars opponents of the health carolaw took issue with that part saying the government cannotch just force people to buy something they made out want all this went tof the supreme court which ruled it was o ka becaus and this is key the mandade could be viewed as a tax the government has lots a taxes this is one of them which felt the end of it and it was until this other thing happened that seemed unrelated in two thousand seventeen republicans pass their big taxcut though in one of the taxes in there that they cut this was just a sentence was the mandate the find that you have to pay if you do not have in shr rance they cut it to zero it really does seem most lawmakers in congress did not understand that this one little change could be the basis forgetting all nine hundred plus pages of the aca ruled unconstitutional i could not find any record of lawmakers even mentioning it in the floor debaye ar newscoverage one person who did see that who put together how zero could under the law was some one not in washington at all e gind was consetmecha satlan who then was the states solicitor general i found him on face book this profile picture was from an ultimate frhisbitoriitpeople lightly declined to comment but from legal filings we know his basic argument satland's logic was that if the taxes zero then there is no tax and what your left with in the law is this line that basely says people shall buy health insurnce that was o keis part of a tax you shall by health insurance or pay a penalty but now the tax was zero the taxe tof the law was simply telling people to buy health insurance unconstitutional that is how a tax of zero ands up in a federal pealscourt most of t america is kind of in the courtroom too teighteen red states on one side sixteen blue states on the other i reached out to some one involved in the case nic bagley professor at the university of michigan lawschool i talked to him about the part of the case that i find transfixing can it can i say that the part thats that stood out to me ye i used to work in physics and its wou know the call his singularity it is zeroag that denominator it creates a black hole ye i mean your putting your finger on one of bagley to decleare thinks the first judge got it totally wraw he is worked on a brief filed in the appeals case and he is been writing about it he pointed out something i honestly had not consider it i've i've encouraged and others have encouraged congress zenra at least thehouse of representatives to passa bill that would set one dollar tax o really yet the house goo a pass the bill that made this ugal this whole os suit go away to morrow an it would not be it would be it would be the a the jot of a pen a and if the house passes it and the senate does not want a pass it well hang that around the senate's neck and the next presidential election make it therare al batross to carry wer wait way that a that would work right if they just absolutely ye absololl sands at all case goes away if they said it to a dollar yetheres a munche different ways you can dor tenny woul a any toray a penny sure but e how can it matter that it is a dollar or zero really really it cat it cant in it should not and again it you'r putting your finger o well i man understand that legally it might but it seems crazy also that it might yet that is one of the great things about the law the grant things ye wel woudid not know what i meat wut uis that is that if it seems crazy to you it probably is and if the argument is too cupe by half it probably is i talked to bagley back in july on the day the appeals courter the case we listend together on line a a the arguments the lawyers made were al about standings severability doctrine and meaning authord shall what did congress intend when it set the tax to zero wrs he did not go well for the affordable carat ragley sid yyouculdell from the generous questions bagley's exact words while we listened includen things oh jesus and this is really bad this is really bad and finally this is about as bad as you could expect from a noral argument the hero or or or he was truly surprise he thought the legal argument that zero could take down the whole law was quote weak to the point of frivoliciness to randy barnet though this all seems totally logical barnet is a professor at george town law has been vocal on the other side if the taxis zero barnet says the mandates onconstitutional he dosn't think the court can strike out just that one part of the law the whole thing hask to go to me it seems quite reasonable because it is a straight forward application of severability doctrine as i understand it people on the other side feel this case is an example of we are legal reasoning being used to get to a particular conclusion are there other legal decisions that look that way to you i would say that any decision that says that congress hass a power under its power to regulate commerss among the several states to short answer yes which is to say liberals have their examples of what they see as activast judges inventing bazaar arguments and do conservatives on youro and liberatarians branett mand everyone else het told me about this case that he argued before the spreme court and lost six to three yu are the courtrule that a woman in california irs could not grow medical marowana o mist at our own house never in our own garden orstitstake for our own back pan ravill nursta because of the interstate commerce clause af the constitution that sounds a loocrasy to me and yet those kinds of rulings happen all the time give me another one how much your time i'm i going to get i asked barnett what he made the fact that this case is how we are deciding whether millions of americans will have health an trens and that it all seem to stamin some way from the weard power of zero does it seem odd to you that we are in this position a you define odd would you mean it just seems odd that somehow therewould be a difference between congress setting a tax to a penny and zero whenever you have a distinction am there is going to be martinal cases in which a that distinction could make a difference in the distinction could look arbitrary that is just the way law works it works out it works that way all the time your speeding by the way when you go thirty six miles an hour and a thirty five mile and hour's own but why is thirty six miles an hour why why as that a terrible speed when thirty five miles an hour is perfectly o ce feels little different somehow am i mean you could say that tein im noim not sure how to respond to ta i'd lett you have to ask it either it is it is your your feelings are your entitle to your feelings here are my feelings having big things this decided in the courts and legal grounds that most people will never understand it does not seem ideal to me the appeals court disposed to issue its ruling any day now it seems quite possible this thing is headed for the supreme court it is this lettle taxk set to zero as created a legal worall with the red states gathered on one side blue states on the other a four tax of highlevel legal math in the middle i worry it is can a suck us all into some other dimension well cross some event horizon from which there is no return it will tear our adams apart it will tear us apart either that or a neatly type dominion will come out some tuesday morning in june they ve cast amout is the exicative editor icnol i three with the id cannot see t' we enterso to day with this last appreciation of small things that are anything but small from wily sullivan when i is in my early twenties it is been a lot an min time looking at toppost things on mine 'd read the qualification section leadership skills self starter results oriancit and then i'd look at myself broke weird shi of the point of silence and miss the dead line whic jus when i stumbled on a story called the job application it spi this writer robert walor the stories told in the form of a cover letter but instead of selling himself he just offers an honest assessment of who he is esteem gentleman i am a poor young unemployed person lirgin difficult tasks i cannot perform and obligations of a far ranging sort are too strenuous for my mind i'm not particularly clever first and foremost i do not to straind my intelligence over much i'm a dreamer rather than a thinker a zero rather than a force dim rather than sharp the passion to go far in the world is unknown to me i remember thinking cannot suppose a tell people that stuff he was being funny and mocking bells long an dance but at the same time he was not making it up he needed a jop he ands t e letter well now what sort of a person i am i am sincere and honest and iam aware that this signifies precious little in the world in which we lis i shall be waiting is seemed gentleman youre respectful servant positively drowning in obedience i knew almost nothing about this writer but i loved him for writing this because a thing is feeling worthless at that age it was terrifine when your brain is not orderly and results oryented an effective humans i'd have a rough shift temping or waitros sing people can be awful when you are t the bottom and i'd come home just dreating the rest of my life and he got that i started reading more of his stuff when my favorites is a novel about boys in his school where they are training to be servance he wrote and one thing we peopls are all similar we are small small all the way down the scale to utter worthlessness one thing i do know for certain and later life i shall be a charming utterly spherical zero robert walzor turns out hes swiss born in eighteen seventy eight and for a moment it looked he was going to be the next big thing cofga whoas younger than him was a fan when coftha came on to the scene one critic back then explained cofga by saying hi the sgys cone robert walzor and there was as delighted absurdity to his wort he poke fun at himself for being small ut there was always an edge to it worson being weak bere the people deluded enough to think their qee pompous he was not mean exactly were just entertained by their foolishness i started to see the world that way too but then one day a few years later i was at a bookstore and i saw a knew robert walzare book on the shelf more of his work translated into english i started reading the introduction and had all the stuff i had not known before andbout his life it sad that walzer had spent the last third of his life in a mental hospital sket's a frennya he live there for twenty seven years undtil he died i was flord ind was that for him bthis was the writer i turned to his ar road map to remind myself that there are people out ther me and the're fine and he was the best of our kind of people i free to me out lake that is what life did to him it turns out robert walzer had a little earlys success but not much after that writers liked him but his books in it sell well and he has predictably terrible at marketing himself it ter flaylang for a while he left the artseen and berlin i moved back home to switzerlman n once he is there his life starts falling apart he could not really get his books published any more he starts renting out single rooms months to month from old ladies reduces his possessions to a single suit case he' onhappy alone all the time mentally shaky he get nightmares and stay up all night pacing and muttering to himself eventually he checks himself into a mental hospital is ninetein twenty nine he asks the staff to put him in the share doorn because thi spreaks my heart he is afraid to be alone the diagnos him with skits of frennia he is there voluntarily at first the later he gets committed against his wil kicking and screaming as they force him into the car for the transfer he spends the rest of his life in a sanitarium there is a story that when people encouraged him to write again he said i'm not here to write and here to be mad and the world forgot about him and then he died an grismis day actually in nineteen fifty six he goes for a walk outside of his asylum and he collapses a coupli cads find his body in a fields of snow some one actually tok a poto robert walzar's lying face up one arm out stretched dark clothes against white snow hes hat a few feet away he book i was looking at had something else something earie it didn' know it to make of it after walzar died a nurve in one of his hospitals came forward with these strange scraps of paper heis sister had a shoe box full of them too hundreds of little scraps yuse post cards business cards old calender pages ripped in half and those little shreds were just covered and ant pencil markings dense little rows of tiny slashes and ticks packed on to shreds of paper everyone thinks its to smadmans scrawl and they put the papers away a few minuts later his friend who for years was one of the only people who really visited him in the hospital publishes a blown up photo of one of these scraps in a swiss literary magazine and decipherable he writes a product of valzer skits of frenia but when the magazine comes out a grad student writes in saying wait i can read this i think those scratchings are letters he got the papers and spent months staring at twenty four pages trying to decipher the tiny handwriting i turned out to be an entire novel tut there was still hundreds more scraps it was not until the nineteen eighties that some one tackled the rest of them another grad student names barinhard esta twenty one at the time he' d actually been on his way to becoming a doctor tbut when he discovered robert valzar he stoppd that life in his traps swis to literature to spend more time with robert walzar because i was nolytochu nol theks nos i i e mus of the a burin but o wud ousays tem he is mo coi es hoe he is writing about everything in about nothing n tham i thought to to reatim en iwas seven ten an i rit him on as every day since them he sought to the archive for the shreds are being kept and they agreed to let him see them try to decipher some more and when he sees them for the first time he is stunned the writing his michro scopic he is letter just a speck about two milimeters at first and as the years go by they get smaller down to one milimeter these tiny bold characters lake miniature japanese coligraphy but the rea difficalt chact is the dencyt of tlins because thers no distance between the lins write be cause if the letters are a millimeter the pencil marking must be half a milimeter yes yos and this is very very difaclt because the penso is not as shop as i should be he brought that up a few times could not he sharpen his pencil and this this is the problem because you you live know will not let thos there and how ano sho but if you can read you can read it because you do not spelly letterful or to wuc you i din't yo shor the fom the world heu cannots identify the individual letters but somehow when you look at them all together sometimes you can tell what is says a word will reveal itself he start working on at full time with a partner they would said a type writers across from each other in a little room filled with sigarette smoke tent over these magnifying glasses called thread counters and hy'd stare at the worts when they get stumped on a word itch happen constantly they had this system where they would rattle off giberish and random syllables baronhad an the other guy would work separately on a scrap for a while then they would compared their guesses if they had come to the same conclusion they decided it was wriht the project was supposed to take four years aiy'd ended up thinking tone tbaronhard ted the last six years alone he h'd started when he was twenty one and thn nisterin ise for ty one and when he would finally finished those five hundred twenty six scraps turneded the six volumes sowor the might grow scripts two thousin some pages of stories comity little dramas a novell tout a robber who does nots teal much of anything i had pictured this writing as sad little notes to no one but when you read it it is walzers back happily throwing stones when he writes aive no use for these scraspers pleasure seekers overlook life's true pleasures tarare not serious which makes them boring and they cannot help being bord with me since i'm port ot them some things scholars have figured out walzer wrote most of these scraps before the asylum this romantic idea of one man alone writing his master pieces well locked away seems i get did not happen that way anit seems he probably was not sk as a franic barn had to studied all the medical records walzer's own doctor thought he was fine and should go home sychitris who study him now do not think he waskets a frentic either he nearly hafe the symptoms also that thing hes famous for saying i'm not hear a write i'm here to be mad people who study him think he likely todn't say that thatit is a myth and that the truth is he got trapped there for the most infuriatingly mondayine reson matical buracrasy once he lost his wrihts he could not get them back could not sign himself out and during the twenthe seven years he was there lat happened in the world weldwart to that' are gloov writers who might haveknown his work heople might have remembered that he was there had scattered the're books were band they were living in exile or dying violuntly cofka's family members were killed in the hallacoss some writer no one read any more han no one ever really knew in the first place heople at other things to worry about one scholar told me she thinks that at some point walzer probably could have gotten out of the hospital if he wanted to thut he stoppe trying i wondered why he spent many years writing things that even he probably could not read he explained to some one in those years when he was really depressed when publishers did not want his work any more he had bad writers block he describes it as a cramp in his brain and he explains that writing this tiny hurts he can take the cramp in his brain and put i into his hand instead once he does that his mind is clear and he can think ag on a page of a calender he would cut into pieces he writes about why he did at all in pencil one day he figured out but a pind made him nervous all thos mistakes cross outs in ink but if he used the pencil instead and labored over this tiny writing he explains this labor look to me a pleasure as it were i felter would make me healthy a smile of satisfaction would creep into my soul each time a smile of amicable self terision it seems to me the pencil let me work more dreamily peacefully cosily contemplatively i believe that the process ad just described would blossom into a peculiar form of happiness that his hantwriting was small his incost connection with his convictions about life and ther whit is interesting in life he was not interested in great importions and thinks we chal bik and everybody knew about the interesting things are the small things the idea i had had about his life in the asylum how he died how awful it all seemed to me barnhar does not see it that way he studied valzar his whole life every letter and documen heven about the house where valzar once lived and he lives there now he knows his life inside an ow and he thinks is not tragic he says valzer usually seems kind of voquet not happy exactly but content life without success walzer once wrote can also be beautiful his was there is power in being oquet with being afhing it is honest and heu cannot crush nothing he made his life smaller and smaller until he almost did not exists any more and then he did not an utterly sphericals ero willy solivan is one poproducion i shal thats of details about valzer's life in work in her story game fron susabernavski thanks to her he translated

welcome to the huberman lapponkens discu science science space to s fri life i mandure huberman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin today my guest is tony hawk tony hawk is one of the most celebrated and accomplished professional scapeboarders of all time for more than forty years he has been at the forefront of the sport and i do not mean just doing a sport for more than forty years a truly mean he has been at the forefront of scapeboarding developing new maneuvers a c a tricks that include incredible feats the nine hundred and nine hundred degree spin in the air as well as numerous other maneuvers that have really pushed the entire sport forward he is also completely popularized the sport through his vidio game end through his embassadorship for scapeboarding in fact few if any names are a synonymous to escapeboarding in the general public as tony hawk and he is oso deserved of that title because for more than forty years he has shown up as the consummate professional he is kind he is respectful and he is completely committed to his craft and that shows up in every aspect of his life he still to this day scapeboards daily and as you will soon learn he recently suffered a major injury a complete break of his femer that is the bone in his upper leg and this is what many people would consider a career ending injury not only did tony come back from that injury but he went back to the very trick on which he broke his femer and recently completed that trick that is a five fortier called mac twist i mention this because at every level of his life tony has demonstrated himself to be somebody with incredible drive incredible vision and incredible persistence and to day we talk about that drive vision and persistence and we talk about what it takes to sedagoal and to continually evolve one scull and to continually progress as a basically young pretin as a tn ager as a young adult as an adult and well let us face it as a fifty five year old man he is now heading a little bit past middle age although we do hope that he lives forever tonyhack a ch a a the bird man really does seem to be superhuman but as you learn to day he is o human in the way that he shares his own experience and shares with you the ways in which we can each and all look at what we dou and think about what we want to achieve and put our minds in our bodies to those goals and achieve them i confess that to day's discussion with tony hawk was a particularly thrilling one for me to have i grew up in the sport escapewoarding i had met tony previously although he does not remember it those many years ago in fact i met his parents you will learn more about that story on during to day's episode but i was aware of course of tony's accomplishmente i was also aware of his philanthropy he has e scape part foundation i also listen to his podcast with another professional scapeorder jason ellis called hawk virst's wolf we provided a link to that podcast in the shownote captions as well but never before i have i had the opportunities sit down and talk to the tony hawk and learn from him as absolutely delighted to have this conversation and it far exceeded my already lofty expectations before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate fom my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero clost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponcer is element elements is an electrolece drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of electrolites sodia magnesium in petassium but no sugar the electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key for mental health physical health and performance even a slight degree of dehydration can impair our ability to think our energy levels and our physical performance element makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration and it does by including the three electrolites in the exact ratios they need to be present i drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up i usually mix it with about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water if i'm exercising i'll drink one while i'm exercising an i tend to drink one after exercising as well many people are scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium because obviously we do not want to consume sodium in excess however for people to have normal blood pressure and especially for people that are consuming very clean diets that is consuming not many process foods or highly process foods oftentimes we are not getting enough sodiu magnesium in petassium and we can suffer as a consequence and with element simply by mixing water taste delicious it is very easy to get that proper hydration if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elemen t dac cam slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with

i've tracked your career for a very long time grow up in escapeword thing i i know had your poster on my wall i think your name is synonymous escape wording as i think a question that probably get asked from time to time but was just clarify the data from the outset tony hawk is your real name right yes anthony frank hawk but i never went by anthony my i ma my parents call me tony since i could remember it it is a fitting name i given the sport and what you do and we will get into the selobit later when we talk about family and parenting and parents am but i'l alude to the story now that a when i was fourteen years old your parents took me in yi slept in your bed in your hollie while not with you in it but surrounded by your a near infinite number of trophies and and a it must have been right after i moved out sis would be iways fourteen years old they gough tos tell as story now very briefly i was fourteen years old was it a contest at lindevis ta boys club yeveryone left me in another can name billy waldman a we are still there your dad said were were you going am it was clear that i did not know where i was going my life was i was awayward youth at that time and they took me in for a a night maybe even two nights your mam a nancy and your dad frank we are gracious brought me in in your home took me to dinner am i do not relas lev me that tract that let out it does not my dad and an my mob together would be doing that yes incredible people a and we'l get back to that story later because you and i actually met a the next day in falbrock at your rant but a fabs a hadat an eighty eight eighty nine that is right i mean to say omanto say eighty nine look and it must have been one of the either enessay or castle contest young that your dad was very active in but we will get back to that but ai have m any questions that relate to scapewarding to you and really as a nerrow scientist to the whole concept of a life of continual progression because wet ther re not people listening to this and watching this or scape orders or not and i imagine that most of them or not it is absolutely clear that you have been in this came a very long time and that you'e somehow manage to continued to progress over and over to come back from very severe injuries and somehow keep getting better and better the first question i have is about the younger version of you im did you have any sort of self concept i want to be a proathlete or i want to be escapeorder or i want have a vidio game named after mii exactly a but if you can think back to maybe even preescapewording do you remember what your self concept was this notion of i'm iv aa self and i'm either similar a different to yer kis a someway when i was young i was put in a lot of advance classes and not that that felt lik could badge of honor i felt more i was just classified as a nurrd but then i thought o caable that is my strength i'll lean into that and and i thought that maybe i would be a teacher cause i veout abit i get all these concepts and i think i could relate them to kids or to to my peers i because i helped lot of my classmates through some some classes i that is all i really had i did not know and then when i would place forits i would i would be o ke was not i was not terrible but i was not the i p thn p and i was just kind of plain baskaball plan i baseball im and then when i found scapeboarding i mean it was it was pretty obvious that i was what i want to do it was once once i got on a scapeboard and realized that i could maneuver it and do things that were unique and not theyre moving the needle or any one carriad but they were unique in the sents lie gidn't i never seem on do this and this feels awsom and i just one to this and i did not think that this is my career i was ten such sletons this was my ess this is my hobby ithis my think and i do not want to play these larsports anymore did you stop playing all the others yes i i quit i quit little lig in the middle of the season when my dad had been appointed president of that chapter of little league because he was the coach he was always very inbalved in all this kids i have three sivilings he was always very support of whatever they were doing and then when i was playing baseball he became a coach cause he had time and he was doing that e as he was being almost retired and then he was such a prominent figure in the little lig they said ol your president now and then some one else was coach and then i was scating and i was over it did you immediately start escape woarding in the parks on transition as oin or whorter were you pushing round in the driway i mustkids it was i was transportation and scating was kind of a fat i started in seventy eight roughly may be seventy seventeven and it was kind of a fad kids jis had scapeboards and they would they would all cruise roun you do not it was a seventy everyone had o bite right and you knew wherever all the kidsberg has the bikesfr on the front one and then at some point that kind of turned into scating everyone had scapewort they were all shid he uno a jase penny or big box stored scapeboards no one had really good one not mira but then at some point we were just looking at his magazines of people skating and everyone scetting in pools cause that was the dog toman zeaboys there i nwas case were flying i wantered where do we do that and the e scape ark gobut up in sint iego ah non mar scaper i scape waysrs o cnweaways escape ark was the first one in aurria i cally i take that back spring valley was the first cape part i tried to go there and i was nine and you had to be ten and i remember stating in the pargonal looving over the fence an my dad did not realize what they cause my daubt would easily lied for me but he did not realize there was an age lement tas hold as he nine osarry cannot come and then they closed not long after when i never got scapespring belliy cause i i think of you as synonymous would dell mar scate wrench short wel that was that came later because awayst escape part was open that this was when i first one was seventy eight i a friend of mine was going you said i wone to go to the scapepark i had to go get is such a hostl i had to go get the authorization form i had to get noterized by the bank for my parents to go there and then i went and it was that was my pifany when i first saw people flying around in person i was this is what i'm doing for as long as i could possibly do it cause it looked it looked magic it really did look there were flying on magic carpets and and it spoke to me in the sense of being a dare devil but also doing it individually not relying on my team not im getting getting hosstel by a coach it was just oh i could be part of the scene but do my own way and then i i scated aways is as much as i could as whenever he rides there and then my parents move to north county sint niego when i was in high school mostly because they were just chasing kind of real estate deals and i an nd i got lucky that dol mar scate ranch was right there every other park closhed the dommarscape ranch remained upen mean there was a bit of luck to all that and new is based on geography your dad's involvement is interesting because i got in escape woarding because my dad was not around that much at that time a lotti iscatting escape worim because it does not require parent involvement was it unusual to have parental envovoment at that stage ye i mean i remember frank and by the way i remember frank and nancy your parents withwich with such fondness not just cause thy took me in but i remember thinking ther they were at times the only point of stability in a landscape of lik to hundred people where as ther be potential chaosipin o time oand your dad had this way of moving about he was not afraid i recall that he was not afraid to say what he thought hag do not do that imposed some regulation yet contest and at the same time it seemly also understood that this was a sport unlike other sports your knock in a regulaty kit is me at the time or a you nocan trynk control people what was it to have your dad involved and the reason i ask is that your apparent will talk more about parenting but also it seems that he went from saying ok u a little league other sports which is more typical to oka this kind of unusual sport scapeboarting but your mere interest in it was enough to get him excited or motive enough to take you around to these places that is pretty special and that is prettym was i mean in in that respect it was great to have his support and and to rely on him for that the fact that he was always arounded he was in charge of a lot of the events tha thout that sucked because because het just marked me ah as one being favorited ah and spoiled ah and and most o my friends their parents did not want them skatting even though they were stoke that my dad ha was was doing this kind of thing and giving that kind of support they still were your dabs here this is our thing this is our scene this is our get away from our parents i i did not really have a choice in the matter i did i did at some point tell him my my concerns and my frustrations with it but he d imenly wont o hear it n he was he was very much steadfast while m been coming this far you can we can keep our distance at these events but people are relying on me to organize them and i decide to suck it up for while did it push you harder i you nough you could prove yourself with arm wordin they inden have to worry about yanas a favoritism is ultimately i you cannot fake you cannot fake escape right right i mean there is no deep fake version anov escape ere no you either can do it or you cannot do it and it is shown in real time and i suppose back then i recall you were requite a bit skinny your skinnyn aroya o i had i had all kinds of things going against me ut thit is ye i mean i do not think people l realize tus unless they met you in person but now it is their few taller escape orders out there to the sports grown much but you are pretty tall you six six three but i was not when i was drawn when i was that age i was very small and kind of concerningly small because by the time i got to be sixteen i was still i look i was thirteen i use to get pulled over i literally i had a car that i bought with my earnings at a hontacivic nineteen seventy seven m c c and i would get pulled over and then the cops would be i how older you sixteen will you look you were thirteen back there and thend i shot up around age seventeen that is interesting and we can get back to this when we talk about youre almost remarkable levels of ability to recover from physical injuries because well you share a little bit a by allobjical theory here which his at the other lopular study longevity and perhaps the fastest rate of aging that we ever undergo is puberty rig if you think about it gan before puberta kid afterbrusly different human being psychologically often physically as well some people have a longer ark of puberty than others and that does seem to correlate with a longer life and it is don of interesting ly o some gets it puberty and they go through all the markers of puberty in one summer i othe kids it is very very long and it sounds we donot to talk about when you hip puberty and the other markers but it sounds youare grow sper occurred late oh that is a terrific marker of a long life by the way because what it reflects is the onset of a big burst of growth harmone out of the patuitary and e brain and if you continue to grow for a long perit of time that indicates you do not give heel ittle bit of the slope of h line some excents oh yeso im this this may have important and fortunate consequences it' seventeen you shot up in my correct in remembering a maybe you said it may be somebody else did that you were forgive me but skinny when you were a kid that you actually wor elbow pads is yet y that is a true that is a jathori fer sure and and i took inspiration from others that that i identified with namely steve cavallero because he was already an established pro when i started to come up in the ranks are gettan get noticed at all and he was wearing ellow pads on his knees in this full page picture of him in winchester gunabackatar and i was that i want to do that and he is small and i feel that is my goal and and why yes stay if he can do that i can do itos is more oh this i identify with that and and that gives me hope and as i recall stevie also as a pretty severe scoliosis r i why thont ouiust what he has ye one poin he was turned it turned pretty pretty taya to the writer left i do not recall what me still incredible scape whater loves yev me he is a nor calguy o whatever he had is from birth but but it was more that that his size and i did not even know he was man't not many but ni sick four years old win me i just as o there is small guise doing that ic i can do it maybe but when i got tall when i went through huriny suddenly i had always tricks and then suddenly i had the strength and the the heights that gave me confidence and ll was said it was al i can go way higher now and i'm comfortable with these tricks thes intricate board maneuvers an stuff that was a huge advantage to me the the smaller stuff felt different after that which was harder but being hald to blast eighty in the airous awas a for feet near was a huge advante yet is not that wild when the nervous system knows how to do something and then your body changes and you can do the same thing but with much more voice even the bolls looked smaller when i would stand on topina lik way this is not that big wild whell the reason i ask about this i think you non people listening generally seemed to assume that if you become a stand for professor become professional scape order or you fessional socraplayer that that you were just fated to become that right in is clear that it is the confluence of many different factors but one of the consistent factors for sure is a sense he jus really love doing it right i mean i cannot magine getting you knowst proficient or excellent at anything without loving doing it right and still at this time when you were to say i'm fourteen fifteen did you have any concept of whenever promode al i'm goin of none of that well there was there was none of that to be had we did not have these great aspirations because no one had really done that before there were you could have some success yes you could have maybe a signature model but even the top sails of scapeboarding then was not a creer the prize money was a hundred and fifty dollars for t first place a hundred for second fifty for third couple tanks agasp some food yeso was put i this way i turned pro an ows fourteen by the time i was fifteen and a half and i had a learnest permit and i could drive a a schooter i had six hundred dollars my bank account and i used that to buy mahanda express a mobet for a year and a half that was my earnings was six hundred dollars clearly money was not the a the dopomin hit it was the it was the actual escape sure end it that is what i mean though there was not there was no goal of that because it just did not exist i d i did not care i getting i i had my own vehicle at age fifteen i was living large i can get t the scapework on my own that was amazing to be fourteen and be a professional at anything must be a a trip to speak but what i'm wondering about because i came up when your early cohort with palpralta for those a don' no calle bones frigade rite guess it was wat todel wat six hseven guis over some of therwer ie more pri frl than others bat about six seven a cor guises in the various vidios i mean yyes were famous right you posters am on gins walls who scapewoarded there was a second or maybeit was a third surge of popularity in scapeboarding because it would sor surgeon general popularity then disappear and come back as it has over tacases keeps coming in going om to some extent did you have a conscious a wariness of just how how much a tend tion was being placed on ye photos of yiew vidios of you and i'm just wondering about the younger version of you whether not you realize what was happening and the reason i ask is because you have always seemed to me somebody who through interviews throughvidios through our interactions and for those have known you much longer than i have im just very grounded i not caught up in it ium we have never seen headlines about you gind of jisten a blowing all your money ere you nav reckin cars and you no destroying your life ii'm sure you have made mistakes any of us but but you seem to avoided a lot of the pitfalls of cuotint cot famous people and selebiries are tat you were a famous person from a very young age o i i well i think it was that i did not never i never that was never a goal ind then when i had a sense of it i was very uncomfortable i mean i was happy i was happy to be successful i was happy that people recognized me that hi was amazing just because i was good escape worning i never imagined something that im and but i was always very i mean some people thought that i was sort of i almost pompous or arrogant because i was not interacting because i was just i was walled off as ie i now what to do on't coshlayse tat this ise look last words i would ever use to describe you i think it was as more that that that people would see me i'd go to ramp i did notknow anybody and i just ourscating and i'd do all my stuff in there oh he does even talk o any one i no i knows i i do not know i do not what to do i do not not how to act nows a youaright fourteen years old i ti broke me out of that cause i remember one time there was a kid that was a staring at me to hold my scape woard he had my seems your model and hes a cose hali what i ery sure he wants he wants the inter act with you just go why fivelem or anything and and i learned to ser to break out of my comforts own by doing that enough but my first go around a me t i was that was sert of my first i wa ave of fame might say e bones forgait years and we were young that we thought this is for ever and we were defintly careless with our our money with our actions and am and at some point my dad saw that he did nothnk it as going to be long term cause now one had had a long turned career writ he he a encourage me to to invest to get property to to by house that was he that was my saving grace cause i devinli was spending n a hars and things oa ya car kind of a little bit beyond my means i was not really considering all my money was was ten ninety nine in come was not we were not paying taxes on anything and the end of the year of you ike owe you a this much waiht what talking about am itfor instance ey you wonto go to why ye o ke invite every one we are all gong to why i got listle run a place o ke an it was on me cause i had the means you mention stacy we should proly clarify for people am tonies referring to the great stacy paralta yehe was he was the one who put me on the bones brigade when i was still considered sort of a circus act e me know my my skating was not really established the stuff that i was doing was largely made fun of because people thought that what i was doing was just more a free show can you explain more it mi and let me just say that my recollect first recollection of you that i still out that image in my mind would am is the finger flippere riht for folk tet arn't familiar escape board anging up people righter on transition or in the street hand rail stares heu nout people pride familiar with all those things but am skipberals will riot up toward the top of the pool of the ramp and they'l do something on the called lip of the coping that is to rit it the the edge of it or they will go above it it in the air but i recall seeing ou do the fingerflip ar i'd never seen any one flip aboard in the air i tean people yo very also for i move it this can be complicate for people just listening but just to flip it upside down and the catch it in an fingerflip ar yet that was i remember that was jaw draw writing was if that was considered circust ere a or circus a then i do not know i do not know what it was being compared to because at the time we we prartly watch that it was in slow motion as i recall n we praywatched it three thousand time that summer there is a big group of us at all sour holy during that summer i would say konted just before that in that window is when people were were more am giving me flak for what i was doing because i was mostly doing bored variation stuff but i still did not have the height the heigh thin terms of the height in terms in terms of yogetting in the air ye i was doing all the stuff kind of right at coping level and people were not taking it into consideration or giving it much merit because it was just o he is doing a little board twist or board turn and then when i started to get some height around the time you saw and started doing those tricks visibly way up high that is when the the the shift happened in terms a more acceptance but i was still labelled as a as a trick skater robotskater and then you had christian of soi who was all stile he air is higher than any one any time he did a trick it was going to be flashy and amaze and riit our personand rocks or personality and in that ara you i mean it was very divided was no one liked us both bot ting it was strange to be of that age and of doing something that had never really been established and then something unpitted against another skater we are just trying to make our way through teen years and and scape boarding and and i got it was it was hard men it was leke i got i got bully uyes i was successful o yes i was you but but i would get i would get i thrash your magazine would talk shit about my performance when i would win i remember that because i was from northern california and thrash for magazine as scapeboard magazine from northern california as she wrote for them for a while when i was a posttock to make some exestra money ah under a different name folks but you can try and find those articles they are out there u and then in southern californi it was scape order mag trans world mostly trans rorld scapewoarding yeas men as the trans world trans will sgape outing and thrash magazine were twere that the rivals rid yeum i recall some of those things that were said u it just as amazing to me but it brings about a really important lessen which has that kid that gets made fun of if they are determined and they love what they are doing that is going to be the kid that wills everyone away later and i know this for sure because i'll never forget there doyou remember the back to the city contests that were attled in san francisco i went to those thay wre in the draine fountains in front of city hall i remember getting there one day and there was the sky with how afro hair pushing around he was doig wht arecalled daffies he had two scape woards hem as kinding weaving around and i remember thinking ye sanfraciscoas got it it is issues now but back than it was rough also youre differen reasons i remember thinking thisguise canto get beat up i hung out with the embaret arro crew disguise gan t get beat down tha i was markan's alis ohe one of the greatest perhaps the greatest street scape bwoarder if you cannot rely defind these things greatest and what not n escapewoarding but you now remember thinking disguise just he is a couk and then i realized who it was and then i realize he was just any other kid there at some level and then a lot of the kids that got teased early on they stuck with it five years later i'm seenging them in the magazines and i think about this with podcasting too there been some podcasters that ave reached out early on and had questions he oew look at their stuff and you once initial impression can be i woner lank what are they doing here and then you just see them two years later three years later and the're doing amazingly well andyour this sgyre galls here for good they are goin they are probly me top of the game an if your e never count anybody out when you would go to sleep at night in that you are a were you laying on the pillowgoing i homacad eople hate me their stuff in the magazines i got ta push harder this is hard did you talk your dat about it i mean again it is a lot to bear r even as an adult i can only imagine what it is to bear as a fifteen year old kid i did notreally have us for ho know or any resource to to voice those concerns i just knew i want to keep getting better that was it and if anything if i was worried about those voices for i was worried about the whatever take people had on me i knew i was ging to go back to the scape park and learned more tricks and it is some poine i had much of that as a foundation that it was sort of undeniable that wele he can do all the stuff and he is not does not just do it at his home part and i think that is probably when the tide turned for me is when when i started to do well at other events namely uplin pipe line which was for the most part the most frightening pool that we could wride the thing was big but i also recall the e hips as they are called the transitions away they na shop we it was supertight lot of er giant coping super rough if you fell and uplin you are getting shootd up it is pulling your neew pouds down i did not know that cas from the photoes i would not know that oh i was it was treacherous et really was it was in and i wanted to do well at the evant and i would drive up there every week and mike my friend a greakesmith was a freestoler but he lived near uplin and o i would go tryv friday after school straights up on skay ta night skate saturday all day skate sunday a early and then drive on cle seniego and i just made of my missions an to figure that thing out because that was the proving ground for me u am id if i could say that i gosgetty as many of i've been taking ag one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that they'r sponsering the pod cast ag one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutritian needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with ag one i'm sure to get enough vitements and minerals and the probiotics that i need and it also contains adaptigence to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take ag one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste gright for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer ag one if you would to try ag one go to drink ag one dok calm slash hubermen to claim a special offer from now until august twelve twenty twenty three ag one is giving away ten free travel packs pluts a year supply o vitemen d three k to again if you go to drink ag one docalm slash hubermen you can claim the special offer of ten free travel packs pluts a year supply of vitemend three k to it is clear you had enormous drive let the struck a loof it about the process of trying tricks the anxiety associated with it did you did you and do you have a sor systematic process was it a iven a learn the basics first did you say that do you say i'm okam in a learn't had to stuff at coping level then i'm a do little air than we o go bigger mu do this were did you just sort of am try what you wanted to try and ye obviously wern't haphazard about it the cout it seems your pretty systematic about explor ing what is possible and then pushing forward alittle by little but that may be could talk alitte bit about how you have conceptiona i sil cake to morrow when i try this it comes in different forms but for the most part i think about how i could combine existing tricks and would this trick work going into this trick and could your body position shift or would it all work in unison and when i approach a new trick i'm say i'm saying more in the last twenty years my thought process is i have all the pieces to this i've done every bit of it i've done that i've done the first part of the trick in another form i've done the second part or the grinding of it or whatever usually in some other basic way and then the landing is while the landing is from whatever that is and if you can throw all those things together and make the timing work it is going to work and i never i never went at something with some haphot hazard approach or throwing caution of the wind hopeless see what happens it is always very much i know i have all these things and i just have to put him together and i mean now things are technical that my same approach that i'm doing hundreds of times one of hem just works and it is not because i did not it is not because i committed to that one it is because of some tiny fractional adjustment that happened that i did not even know happen and it just work and and that kind of is the curse of what tricks are now cause there ar plany of moves that i've done over last ten years even that i only ju wance cause it was too fuck and hard to get to and i did not learn from that one make and that that is that is hard to accept cause in the past i was learning tricks to have them in my arsenal that i coun just throw him down at a competition or a dema i've got them o my pocket these days that trick for instance i did a a de three sixty shove it five odifaky i has to let us break that ti have rel three se to shove it but who seem to take this on i'll let you take this on i contrive for my knowledge and pirst bactod baara it wil will will you sixty shove it is pushing the board with your feet and letting it spin a full three sixty rotation under your feet and a landing back on it it is it is a trick that people do on using on flackground i've learned i've learned to do it up on the vert walls i can do three sixty shove its kind of in the air but i'm doing that i'm doing it throgh sty shove it and i'm landing on my truck right the axole between the we all hung at one axl and a what we call five old position which is basely a wheely on the truck everything is precise i got do throgh sixty shove it exactly a certain spot on the wall i've got ta catch it that it might truck lands when my foot hits it i cannot push it into the truck cause that that screws up my balance it has to land on the truck i have to land with my waight perfectly set back enough that i can come in backwards because i'm doing this trick and and i'm i'm guin come in faky right three sixty shove five o to coming an forward is as a whole different beast that that i can probably do that just in a few tries but the idea that i have to land on this thing balance on it a teeter totter and then reverse my energy and come in bfaky backward it is a hard it is hard to to get in to the right position any time i try it there is a one inten chance i'm evenging to get into the position i need and that is the one i have to commit to every time i do it it intense and it takes much much commentment and and much a mind i do not even know how to explain it the the that you have shut everything else out except this one moment and this one fractionol piece that you have to make work and it i've done at once i i would love to do it again but i know what is going o sgin to take the same on effort i did not learn from that one that i made some trick that makes it oupen every time it is all tectical andthere many things can go wrong that all ays except that i' kagn at once in think about the thresysy shot it five ofaki yah was that something that you thought of the night before you decide that day do you ever use visualization if you ever had i'm learning come to you in a dream or find that you try try trye something whent to sleep that night next day made it anything that yes sometimes i'll wake u mill night and i'll write down something cause i others this trick oh i think i could do that ye i'll get me ri do you dream about scape wording from time to time ye well ye that as shifted a bit after i got hurt but ye i used to dream that i cannot scape i'm trying and tit it feels the ramps made a carpet i cannot get the speed i cannot get the timing and then as i went through this tramatic injury my dreams shifted tou while i cannot scape i can do all my tricks again oh interesting ye a little a piece of science around they cannot ah cannot scape piece or when people feel their bolted down in a dream or they cannot run away ye there is this one face of sleep called rapid i movement sleep where the brain is very active the dreams associate with it tend to be very vivid and at the same time we are completely paralyzed and the ideais that no one really knows why but that it is the case that were paralyzed to prevent us from acting out our dreams it is allso and interesting ner a chemical phenomenon cos dreamy is rapid ive movement dreams they tend to be very intense but the body cannot release a dranoline it is almost its own form of trama therapyts your experiencing this intense thing in your mind but your body reat ye and often times people i have argued that that is why you feel you want to moving you cannot because actually can some people have woken up while still a bit paralysed in rem if yo ever had that happened we went o but i but u actually couple my kids of have struggle with that acouple times yer ram interference is all it is not dangerous and usually people conjolt themselves out but it is kind of terrifying such interesting to well get to a discussion about the the recent injury and thankfully recovery from the injury i not miraculous because that makes it seem as if its surprising frankly i'm not surprise that you have recovered but it is im spectacular a the way you have but you are saying that in your dreams before the injury you would think about scape whoningwut you felt there was a kind of clo wen i was doing it in my dream there was always some rodlock that i just cut i why cannot i get my speed why cannot i why cannot i snap or do this trick i'm it is more in the moments where itstwilight moments where i'm kind of awake and i'm thinking about tricks that everything else fallse away and i can actually focus on what kind of new moves to come up with im i an example of that was i recently i went to the excames in japan few weeks o i and i was thinking i was going to go morets you show my support and because they had a vert event there is not a lot of vertevents any more if there is a vert event it is kind of li could you build hat i will come cause i want to show my support that is that the kind of where my heart is and they had a best trick event and i thought man maybe i could get in the best trick of ther anything new though and i'm still recovering from my leg and then at some point i was falling asleep when i thought oh i could do that trick an come in when eit i know i could do that with with my current state and not getting thot much speed to explain what i was doing is is i half cab ody raile baxiblunt ok we can walk through this half ca o ca as come up backwards coming ever cacly right to half ou o outi t i approachd the top of the round i body vrail that means i jump around and then i jump roun on my board and then i make sure that it lands with my two trucks out and my tail on the coping which is very precarious and i've done that and come in faky that is the blunt piece that is the blunt i've done that where i ere and then you have to you have to use your bea to lift up board come in faky rigt i've done that i've done that twice and i thought well whet if there is something i could do that and then i realize that if i just keep coming around and i come in backs ide direction that keeps my body spinning and not might i sly be easier it was not but i figure it up i think i saw a clip of this on ins did it ye i did it i did it excums and i was it was my last roton i was it was an me it did not move the needle i got seven place but for me it was a huge moment it felt amazing i bet oh ye for sure i mea an't if i ways i me nit was by weeks preparation and n trying to figue this thing out i made it twice before the event om on my own alon on my ram but i that is just an example of of i was i was literally falling asleep in the olsinoms ik i've got by rol baxi blunt i love it that liminal state between wakefulness in sleep is such a beautiful state that if one is open to ideas showing up there ye they almost always to i ti trie to search in it the next morning do you ever find that when you are taking walks or in the shower or not thinking about scape word o ye that is usually in in the sort of mundane moments that that i get inspiration do you have practices for pure relaxation aside from socializatini know i i was never i think thot something i've been lacking i i never was good at warming up stretching post warm up am the or or or relaxing meditation nothing i just i i goskate and it is on am and as i've got an older i realized that is not the best technique but it is work far it has work a for you it is go hofuly a little bit warm up if you i have ware of a sort of o c d warm up run that i use to gauge how i'm feeling but i kind have to get through that a surgeon when a surgeon's about to do a surgery they do not warm up they just check off the various boxes of y teot her that is there make sure that they are comfortable in their environment and then they dothey do th the life saving work ya my i'd say my warm uprun is is kind of basic tricks but they give me a sense of how how stiff or how i woul i need to adjust for for the rest of the day i guess it is not o s d but but i dedn'tly feel i got a goot through that routine what feels the best i i know that making a new trick feels incredible specialy if you ben at a long time dilin it in that you can do it again and again it is it is own form of reward yeam but what is the maybe list of two or three things that just feels good whetl that for sure learning nou tricks not even that that it is something that i created but just doing something tha i've never done befor when i first learned varials backs id varials no one had done backside varrels before they doft int done front side a and a verials were you you reach down grab your board jump in the air and then turn it when aidy under your feet it is it is a shobit but you are guiding with your hand i learn that half way up the pool the the main pool in a way adowasis with no one around and the feeling i got when i rode away was something that i never experience and it is as literally the buzz that i've been chasing ever since because it was i created somethingverials below coping was that was the but how was it it really was and and if you saw bit you ove it blike that thing what can i say it was it was the first time that i thought i thought of it i i went through all the motions of it i did the work and i figured it out and no one no one cared but at some point i was able to do it six feet in the air and do a full three sixty barael and thad was the building block but but that feeling was no other i'd say that and then just even to to strip everything else away the most basic trics a backsite all is is it and no handed arial that used to be what was called backside no handed arial it feels good because even to this day people people say i spporstay on your feet and i cannot even tell you how the board says on my feet i just know i know how to maneuver it and i know how to keep the pressure on it and the friction going and backside always is i think it is a marvel of physics and a clean backstoli to me as feels good as anything that is a beautiful thing to behold i confess i've never done a legitimate back sat all an vert on a manyra sure but not on vert i cannot relate to the feeling but i love love love the fact that you brought us back to that early verial below coping feeling and that that marks the assence of what feel good when you do something else rightin throve a it is a tis an early i is is y is a chemical stamp it is a thahemical finger print of progress right ell i'm also delighted to hear that it still feels that good to do these thin cause i do not think any one can have the kind of life long progression that you have had and it' still going a without a not just love of the thing but love of the feeling that it brings when no one's around cause you sid scating aur ramp by yourself often are you on your ramp with kno one's filming for in seram no nothing for avidio nothing for a vidio game none of that maybe there is maybe other gizer round gawls around will talk about galls to cause one of the big shifts in escapeboarding since i started is that there'e some amazing female scaplr right now ah there is a young lady in fact that is been escape wenint your ramp forgive me i cannot remember her name is it rea threese reaso nelson goodne iter goodness gracious no she is ya good good good a we will get back to that but i think that people starting any kind of sport or academic career or business or anything i think people assume that you go from seero to a hundred somehow and that there are these people that are just selected by genatics or by lock or by some combination of things to just i get it and be better than everybody else but it is clear that you'e spent a lot of time alone driving some place te scape the next day or alone at the ramp yot wer do you ever reflect on that kind of drive and what what what that is all about or is it just intrinsic to who you are and nayd i do not i do not think about it i just know i have to do it it is i man it i would not get into with my injury but i but but to go back to what youre saying is you saying that people think that oh you were chosen for this or genatics whatever you last things lalk aft i all ongesgate ye when i first started scating there was no way you would think that i was natural or that i had any future in it i was all gangley azolove plays i was eating shid left him right it just it it was not i was not good i was not i was not a natural i've seen peopl ld that are naturals and i've seen that how they do not have that dribe they do not have the discipline and it is not wasted but i they just do not they do not you dolike then do not take advantage of what they have naturally and and for whateer reason i do not do not fault any one for it but i've seen both sides of it and i've also seen other skaters who are just driven and who are not really good conofslobby and become the best and gorenals ohye when we put him on our team he was just me suber gangling is boards bouncing around but he is trying every single trick and every time he send me a vidio it is some new technique that he is figured out and he did not really a by untrained i he did not have the skillset for and then he became the boss an i mean i think it is just you have to you have to give that as much weight as natural tim if not more i'd say more y i would certainly say more for science and you nother people are in the lab late at night in early in the morning in drilling way not ou not always the smartest certainly not the a domist but smart enough to show up when other people are leaving and continu and i think there has to be a little bit of friction internally i mony ni mont be ma they be externally also but just some frictions son i'm going to show you ye ye e my best example of that and i have not talked about this yet cause i did a privately but i i broke my leg doing to max twest something that i've done thousands of times by forty five forty yot it is it is a one and a half spin in the backside direction but that particular grab that you do makes it a me twist because it makes you kind a flip upside down 's kind about one and a half somer sault i it is not my tricks might magill's trick i learned it not long after he created it in nineteen eihty four been doing ever since i'm time out forty years mtwess right i've gotten her once or twice but not bat anyway i fucked around and found out did one with no speed last year thinking i could do it i was still twenty and got tangled up and and broke my feamer i had a stuber long recovery i had a false start i had a non union fracture which means my bone never connected back t itself and kept bepushing itself further away am and that is all i in the past i i got a second surgery in november and all along in the back of my head is i got to get back to five forties i have to and i cannot explain why i have to i hate that it means that much to me but it it is in here you knw me it is not it is not a sense of pride it is not i have to prove this to any one i just have to do it and last week i did it scary and i crept for it i i mean i even down to my diet and i i stopped drinking altogether and i was every time i go to the ramp i'm just trying five fortys to get the spin to get to get the landing zone with no intention to make yet just that i had to get there and then i had to have this heart to heart with my wife that she doesnt want to see me get her shoes do not see me risking myself this age any more she does't want to live through another tramatic injury with me and i had to tell her i have to do this she was gracious and accepting and that is all i culd ask for it was not she was ya you got to go do it was oke and you are and she was there she was my only spectator iti confess i've seen o vidyo of this and my first response was ah af yes ain my second response was that was really high this is no just above coping five folitin this is an even this is a head high five fort i'm not gong to make the same mistake i did last time where i try o low thinking i just get away with it any more or the going high was more of a safety measure which is ironic the the the bigger the ramps for me the safer it is because i have a better landings i have more time in the air tso the just and even though it look spectacular and usixteeing ther iss no i need that i cannot scape some eighfootpool ihave no landingson i'm too tall i'm too i moved too slowly now to do that kind of stup that is why you do not see me in the park events solike that you'r gong to see me on this fourteen folver ram because that is my happy place and that is where i'm safe ah but also having my wife there i just knew i was notg to get heard from her cause i would iv in such trouble the the emotional support and pressure is a is a real thing and in the best ways a not to focus on the bad aspects of the injury because there are the plenty tye ad that i recall you and i communicated not long after the it is a but's call it what it was the first break and i remember you said to me over tax you said how long before i'm scape warding again and i said am scape warding as in pushing or skinhording as in am what you do on vert and you said a what i do on vert and i said what seems you are doing a lot of things you were doing deliverate cold deliverate hea pressure you wouldo number of things and you are not hap hazard about your career in your body ind your health and will get into that lomit later come of the things youve enjoyed as beneficial for you but am you said i'm calling it at two months and i i said o ke ah i believe it and then i recall that you was it the oscar or some othe reward event where you came out about a week later you came out there walked out youae broken femer and you were not using any support to walk i you clearly ditched whatever support you might have been using of which i think is awesome by the way u and then you soon i would think idiose of you dropping in i think tit he is of you doing kick turns below coping i seen bet ewse of you at coping and youno we have a friend in comment in thiscscapeward and generally phrotographer my blay back and i remember taxting michles tony's back already this is this is superhuman rates of healing and i think it is superhuman rates of healing then you mention that you damaged broke broke the femer again dod you allow more rest the second time what was driving yes i well back it us supirsely but first go round i just did not listen to any of the professional advice because i thought while i've done i've come this far and have always been able to push through broken palvas broken elbow ah nesurgeries and i've always been the time lines always very shortend for me because i just get back out there and i and i get the healing started but i also am comfortable with what people think of extremely risky but in this instance i want to get back out the right away and not long after the academy wards i i was actaly walking with tha cane at that time and i dithed the cane just to walk out on stage to present the ards that was my big my big coming out moment but it was kind of forest and as soon as i walked out the sayo got my can and i was hobling in the back stage but i was i was skating cut of a meani ramp and and i was already struggling because i could not put my waight on my front foot because my bone still had not connected to itself thre's a gap in the bone but there is a there is a nail but they called nail big piece of metal that is holding them in place but i did not realize how careful i neede to be with that because it was precarious and i decided i'm going to drop in on the minyram i think i'm ready and and it was not the drop in on the manrap it was me getting to the top of the minyramp and stepping off my bonit is always that korandov but but i just stepped off my board i would do any other day but i did not think i led with my front foot and i felt the bone move in that moment i ie really i felt it i felt it either twist or get out a place and i was in total denial for months cause i just set alli just it just hurts now i id i got a minor set back and then i finally eight months into my recovery seven months into my recovery i was always in pain my skating was not progressing i could not get speed and by all measures i should' be back at least i'd be back to a level that i feel good about and i went got extrace and they said your bone never connected you haven' on union tracture and and and and every time i skated my bones this every time i skated i was pushing it further away and my bone was this on the last ax ray and and that was the hard truth for this lisid luk just latterly displace thing about a pipe that is broken in the middle an just once offset to the other and and as i keep skating and i i could force my skit i can o learn this hack where i can put seventy five per cent on my way on my back foot and twenty five percent my front foot and do what i wanted to do but it was not where i thought i'd be and it just hurt all the time i meant really was that was my trigger ecause i id have a pretty high tolerance t pain and it was always hrlike i i would dread going to the airport knowing i had to walk to a gate i knew something s wrong there i went to a specialist that deals in non union fractures and he had a very pragmatic factual approach and was i ought i would do this i'm take my nail out and take the other hardwere out and put it together and you cannot move for two months did you obey that owr idid really ye what is shellin i was not ina ris that again did you and do you pritized things sleep u nutritian just generally and did you emphasize those things while you were recovering from the entry ye i i i was very disciplined in my diet in my schedule an my sleep surprisingly i i was very busy because i do speaking engagements and suddenly my speaking engagements were getting books left him right me to he point where i i did two or threue europe last summer of speaking gagement that was sunde that was a sober lining against to my my idle time and i leaned into it i made myself available and and i it no it is good money and it was i fun to to interact and but all through all through that of course the in the back of the head as i went when can i scape mi can i scape and then when i finally started scating it was night and day with my leg i felt i could lean forward suddenly i was learning tricks every every session relearning tricks i just i just lucky that i got to live in this time of modern medicine was that two months the longest you have ever gone without scapewarding ver ye y without sgetting at all not even just push in or in i good for you for obeying doctors orders and also inally and also good for you for deciding that your rate of recoveries going to be whatever it is for you because i feel i'm hearing both things on the one hand you listen to the medical professionals on the other hand i'm not hearing oh i look at the average rate recoverage from this kind of fracture this an that it is 's it is as if you decided two things at once that there are experts who have something to offer me here i'll follow their advice and yet i'm the expert at myself here i'm putting myself in your first person a tony's the expert an tony and i'm gong to make sure that i come back a hunder persent yeor better yet not better but i'm and i and i have come to terms with that because i know that i'm not going to be pushing myself the way that i did before i got heard any more there are some tricks now that are way more difficult just because whatever is something changed in my body and for instance i cannot grab slob lie i cannot i i cannot do it consistently i you see mi go to rap could do that any time over sixty foot gaps whatever i coul i desgrab i knew where my board was i knew that was gen to hold on my feet and half the time i try to grab that way now i do not reach it or i grab my foot instead and i i do not know i cannot make the adjustment to fix it and ive just sort of come to terms with up that is nothing go to gravity more and that is who a yuyet i had a good un yet r yourcance retty frertty and a vast there is a lot of other things to reach to aside from the five forty which by the way congratulations not only as it i forty but a done at least head high i've seen it with my own eyes and i'm and under really great circumstances your wife there just the two of you and after and the trick that broke the femer in the first place im congratulations

wait to get back to that what sit acide slawvers for now the ye i i i want to get my hand plants back the way usd to do him ii have yet yet themver likes its one hand in hands toim umh i can do them now but i have seen you to them recently ya it a but i use thuse to be my signature was the tackin iver and flapped all the way back and and i cannot get a hold of my bord to pull it all the way back i use to if i can get that i'll feel i that is it that is that is that was the last mile sontly i'm not here to i dignoson en treat these a specific a scape whar trick isims but between your what you said about the slaw ear and what you saying about las this outgra seems their same thereabout about getting your your your my fron hand around and and round my gailing it back back idm a behind you maybe this is the way that the femers lining up with your pelvis and maybe some offer him something or other i the ther i do i i am actually working with a best core he is a he is tha doctor of physical therapy and he has helped me immensely through my recovery and when i'm frustrated with this motion or that is the same grab actually has in the twist he worked on me before it and was just contorting my body and my leg into these positions that i do not really even get to when i'm scating just to prepare me for that and he did but that is what it isook it is interesting that were a talk he mot scape wording and we are also talking about physical therapists wher time i nutrition wis ti cul not sleep growing on me i nnone of that none o tha never imagined aneter an and i'm chuckling cas ou no growing up scape wording early on for me a not quiteas earlyeas you but pretty early twelve and got out of it n back and yes i can still do a thing or two here and there but that is not the point the point is at the nutrition consisted largely of fast food or whatever was around cigarettes and beer were sort of the the energy drinks and a i and am supplements of of the times this is fortunately changed but there there wis sentially no health promoting tools or aspects et at all but that was back then but then over time it seems it is evolve now i see am i saw a couple post from steve williams he is in the gim srum i think i saw danny way early on working with pall chak and doing some balance work nack work caus he had broken his neck siring and things tht sort there seems to av been a big shift over the last fifteen twenty years were scape orders are taking good care of their bodies other athles thinking about the razilients of their bodies and also generally taking better care a lot of am op not to drink an do drugs and all those sorts of things i mean how does it strike you to see the way that scape woardings evolved towards the option to be much healthier entreat it a serious sport where you are serious lyt tae word that even fifteen years ago twenty years ago if you call tasgidboarder and athlete some people might him be offended oh a people inscape woarding absolutely ye we will to answeyor question in the early days that was part of the the seen in the culture j cause the t it was the antithesis to organized team sports and mainstream culture and it was just yet is what we do focge caresli we drank and we scayed and everyone ivs it was wild west right but as i never fell into that deeply because i saw how it affected people's performances and the scating itself was paramount to me that is what i want to focus on that is what i want to be good at and i saw people partying and partying their skills away i had at least that forethought and then as scanning got more established popular more of a career option then people started taking more seriously especially competitors i mean but there is such a wide swath of of what scape warding is and it is a big tent to say that it is more organized yes it is morganize over here they are still all these scaters over here partying hopping fences do not care about contest do not want smonsters o gxs one thousand those kised bam hills an sarasato it u but that that at a a a bais is the diversity of it all and that that is we are all part of this scene i i was a competitor that was that was my path to success and i appreciate that people take it more seriously now and that they do have trainer they have resources mean they have sponsors that will pay for this kin of stuff here was no such thing commien at our biggest cape contest we were all staying at stacy parltas parent's house the night before and he would take us out to get spigetty because he thought carbahid drates was going to give us energy the next day that alwas the extent of training in nineteen eighty three ri but nowadays it were treated i a leed athlees because they are if you really look it people therare o the top of their feeld people not you used ton i to mean the doit s a machine he is he is one of the most precise scaters that we have ever seen or precise athletes the side of not oucomin each you n yes i'm i i m i'm aging myself but what i'm saying is this is this it takes hard corpe dedication precision athleticism and devotion and now they have the resources to back that up and to keep it going longer i mean yie would i be able to do this now especially aftor getting hurt without the help of a doctor of physical training probably not i do it on some level but i would not get to where i am now and ey i think it is also iyu know i i never i never wanted to cove it scapeboarding as this thing that no one else canlike a gate keeper to it no one else can touch it i always thought there was something o scape boarning that was magical and that was good for mental health and that was that was required such required such passion and i did not i never understood why it did not get bigger through those those lean years as always i kids this speaks to kidlic it is it is their devil and it is active and it is exciting and you can do it as a group but yu can do it your own way and i do not know all those things it took a long time for everyone else to figure it out thet does not fingite it out i mean nowadays scaters of the coolgids in school as ind the olympics li there was always discussion would it be was an exhibition sporting theolympics at one po oint no no no o i thought it was it formaybe it had a run it pretentially being an exhibitionhere were there was talk about it got om but's it never did an and not the i mean it some point especially in the late nineties orety thousands skiing was getting appreciated and and kind of reached that threshold of a is it mainstream well it is in it is all mac donal's commercials i guess that is pretty mainstream and we already had come of age and it wase we do not neding lympics we are already more popular than a lot of lympic sports right why do we need their validation and then at some point it became the the power dynamic shifted it was oh they need are cool factor we do not need their validation and d it was lie yeoke you guess on it sure go ahead but hold the events hold the cuall fires well participated but we do not need this wyofve been an amazing ambassador for the sport that is driven much of that wider acceptance and progression and invitation into different domains one of the a thinks that i deflyuont talk about is the vidiogame i because i think that the vidio game changed a lot of things for the general public in terms of their perception ofescape wording i mean what it alowd of course is this is obvious but it allowed kids it were not going to a bang up their shins or walk in with a broken ras ir you' all skinned up to to do incredible tricks but in silico on a screen right and to a pretend that they are that the proscape worder a tion yo wat what vidiogames are about and yet when you can see something just you can magine it in a dream or while you are falling asleep and you can see something and and hearing air quot to do something in of vidio game it also is going to inspire a number of kits o outside and grab a real scape woard and try that or try something that clearly the vidio game was a catalist for what i concerne now thet the wide acceptance of scape woaring as a sport in all its various forms a coun yuse talk for a lbit about the genisis of the vidio game were you individio games prior gether the dio game am were you intotechnology generally and in what e sort of motiv a the interest in the vidio game because it certainly has changed the face of actual scape woarding and the perception of scape woarding a wha i've been into viio games since the geco may ni was a kid you plan pom packman missl command cubert you name at and then getting the home systems in talivision suberanias common or sixty four am sanga saga ya but but i am and i always loved technology when ie when i finally started making money in the eigdies my first count of big purchase in terms of that in in terms of lectronics was a commodore mega which was considered one of the highest end a home computers alongside mac but but more graphic orien an an more game orn am and i was always in to that idea that you could do this kind of stuff at home nochust in arcades and then i got a i got a call from a piecy programmer thet wanted to pitch escape game and had a crude engine of am scater that cruis round goin bowls anself i got and yet was olve keeboard controlet ives clunkey but wa something and the last thing that we had as scating was seven twenty in the arcade or scator die for home systems for comonersis for that was the last thing that had happened for scape wording a invidio games and i went with him i was excited to i got to we got to go to nintando and pitchit a we went to midway we went to all these different a consul and sofper manufacturers and were just told that this is a bad idea scape whne he is not popular hom vidio games are barely a thing why would anyone want to buy a vidio game about scapeboard some one said those exact words to me aat midway and he got frustrated he needed to find a job and i was i was just cone a free floating thought o an gas well i'm i'm knocking to do this but i feel you have established yourself at least in the vidio game world a industry that your interested in doing something soe maybe some one does something tol call you anoas i ye right sure sure enough a year later at div ision called me said hay we heard you want to do a vidi game i said well yes i would love to work on ta vidio game i'm not a programmer or anything we have something working on i would to show to you and i went up toack o vision a they were working on a scape game but it was based on an engine of a game that was already release called a pocalips starring bruce willis the first version of my game was bruce willis on a scapeboard with the guns tropped to his back in it deser wase land doing kickslips and it was also it was i was truly i picked it up and i got past that visual and then i started playing it and and it was intuitive it the motion felt right the engine was right and i was this this is the base line of something special i did not think it was going to be some big hit i just thought this is this is going to be appreciated by scapeboarders and that was my gol the entire a development process which was about a year and a half after i signed on we threwg that year and a half we were going back and forth with they would they would fedax me builds on seedees i had a modified playstation and i would play at make notes and i thought manskaters going to dig this and that was it and skating was emen that popular it was coming to it it was starting to get some traction what your wasissgan ninety eight was exgames were sturing to come nto the fold people were taking note of whatsky when ng had become at that point and then i thought thi skin to be cold skaters gn a it and then not long before the release they called me and they said hey we went o we went off for you to buy out of future royalties for this game cause i think you knot this i think yeu've ren a it mosi wht dies tat mean that g will give you half million dollars and then you do not get royalties going forward but you get that money a front and at that time my life to yeursome was a half million dollars seriously sounded half a billion dollars no one enever talked about numbers that big to me also ninety eight was a little bit of a of a quiet time for vertscape boarding to asure ye was all bo general went but ye r vert luckily vertsating still was a thing because of inlineskating because inlinskating was huge right late nineties and they were all vert and we had skaters got to sort of ride those coat tails cause it was i gat there our ver rams fos everones roller blating i forgot about that than that dad it and i hav honestly i was the special guest at a couple of inline roler blade shows where was this as team roller blay alive and special guest do not holat the scape order and i was i i droving in but it paid the bills chanceer o to to for from what you were saying vertsgating was it was a thing at least establishd in the axscapes which was something and enough for us to make a living im when day offerd me this money i actually was in a pretty good place i'm in terms of my i do not know my options n mi my trujactory and i felt and i iad just bought a new home and i thought i'm mano take a chance and to see what happens and i thi was the best financial dizes n i have mit took the equity ye i just let a ride bui was not want to see what happens with us and as soon as the game was released it was getting stelleryiews and then i remember the very next week after was release never stopped saying cave were works on number two what you wante to what o you mean we ewere doing sequel with what blossom nthe we ent of doing ten mazi crazy mazing i'm thinking about your decision to not take the cash and deseet how it would go i'm thinking about i your decision to buy car at sixteen and yet as a cons clans get pulled over cause you looked younger i i'm thinking about the time when through the graciousness of your parents yhou took me in cause i had no money to get back up to northern california and they coudn't get a hold on my malm im they took me to your home but then they took me to where you were living the next day which was in falbrook you do not remember this but i do i man i know you heard the story before forgive me because most people the saying havent but remember getting driven up to falbroock you ht the ramps in your back yard i walked in got introduced to you you ere very gracious sait hello what is up i'm said feel free to push round on the rams outside it was the min it was a spine rout yout yout i'm two ramps back toback folks spine a sorry noin clature i i think ray under hill was there ye he lived erefor while and as i recall you had im pretty vast music collection and will talk about music im but it also seemed t your therst couple cars in the driveway and what not but it is clear to me based on a number of things and that interaction and what i observed there that either you had some one in your ear either you'r dad or maum or both or maybe it had been stacy or maybeit was somebody else who was advising you to make very good financial decisions not spend all your money or continue to spend all your money am to investin things ou know or maybe it was just instiled in you at a young age who knows i'm asking because i think many people burned there early success what represents a lot of wealth for them early on they burne that where they start making just bad decisions you explain before why you tended to avoid drugs an alcohol certainly am any severe relationship to drugsralcall that would keep you from progressing and scapewarding but the ability to make really good decisions as a young famous athle iis more rarer than it is common even when people have coaches i'm curious where did that a shrewdness and that prudence come from and was frank your dad and maybe nancy also youknow advising all lall hate am think smart be smart because clearlyou made som some very smart decisions he was definitely a guide in a he he was the first one who said you should proviy by real state i was seventeen i did not even know that was possible but he cosigned and made a possible am but then after that i had to buying that ham that you went to and it was four acre property and we built these ramps on it and that was amazing and definitely helps propel my skating to a different level than i ever imagined but at some point that was just a drain and it was a drained financially and i was living beyond my means and my income kept dropping cause we talked about not l ng after that was ninety one ninety two the slowest days of a skating and i've got this giant mortgage and i've got this property in these ramps that i cannot afford to upkeep i can barely afford my water bill at one point and what you saw might av seemd stable but behind the scenes it was it was starting donerauel bird house hadnt been started bird house was started ninety two and when i started bird house i took the aquity from that house to start it cause i i did not i burned thrugh my savings from trying to keep this place going o i took a second mortgage out on that house right i took my equity out started bird house sold the house for what i had taken out and then o moved to my original place that i had whone i was an i school and just pulled back on expenses i think that was the that was when i really became shrewd because i had to i had i had first child i had a income that was very uncertain very fluctuating and i was just eating tolkabell and top rama and congredially sandwiches and and not spending anything and and taking every job the most random damo request or we want you to be a consultan on this commercial because im to l i'm twenty four i'm too old to be the guy escating cause it has to be youthe right but o i bu we want to see what is possible come up the day before and show us the ropes and i would be the stunt skater that is filling in to to show them the angles and stuff and then they would go higher chat thomas is the youn kid and then i would stand around i's gan paid i do not care i think i rememberless commercial is a syrial commercial sontoa the cyril commercial was a cristmillar frossiflakes and i was tony a tiger to i e wayn call of in wide deog as you chet ah ya id throughout the a bird house which is your company but without telling me what is escape or company remember a willy santos was relion i remember a supernice kid you suseem at the contess i rememberything woll tonyhawk has his own company for escape words a as wean ier we had a team willy williy was a mistro am jermy cline legendary street pioneer a steed barra whos kind of a we called e t v a street and vert we had a ocean howll who was our nember one amateur we had anter reynolds mapbeech we had a team wwas it was fon was it fun to move from rider to also rider but t mangeur owner was it a fun it is it was just necessary i cannot say it was fun i mean ye i was it was fun cause we restilled just kind of rackless and drivin me six of us in a van driving to skate shops across the country an begging him for three hundred box that we could get gast and for hotel reum and get on our way i do not know it just it i but for me just fell necessity to keep to two that was what i had to do to make a brand op and i was willing to do it and but it was exhausting yaks i had to be the i had to be the the couch and the tur manager and the scater i was put myself out there on the the the worst conditions and just rolling my ankle left and right anand d it was all street and this was not my thangas it was hard but i i li loved a mit hav iu myt mind i'm thinking you had to be tonyawk the scape order frank hawk the organizer yadn stacy pralta the ye cause stacy had been a prescape orer i stil think of im as escape warder ye ov tise film maker riscape were just i still hing o spike jone's escape order be a maxer film maker seems ia got to integrate all of those and i mention that because i am curious i think a lot of people are probably curious the are you the tiged person sit back in a chair at night and think ocalic how many do this armeng are you contemplative ors it really you just identify what needs to be done this here and over the next three years and you will set your milestones cone ashort in i goes going ow ar back that back then oh know everything was just in the moment we got to get here we got to get to dalis by to morrow as soon as i dem as over getin the van were gone we got to get to a talrum no it was juself got it was it was very much but but i i i respected i think i learne to respect punctuality because i trab with playing it scater as thet were not and did not care and show u lad an was good i do not know these guis and then when i was in charge was we are goin t beyond time cause we have to respect other people's time and we sa ere ging to be here athree ofclock were e t be at tree ofclock and that is not easy with th scape crew mi play back who has you knows it to girl to the heu were in lawpadcas i talk about that wee got some other gots came over from d c to as filmers and editors for us and ther'e punctual and they are on it and i knowise you showed up early to day right right on time or early early by five minutes and that is a distinguishing factor i think in any occupation but specialy n escape warden where there is this kind of looseness sure and if you do show up on time really means a lot the professionalism that was in stildin you it is it is clear the different places where thout showing ou mentioned the shrewdness about the business iscisions i'm curious about another aspect of that which is maybe a little more criptic which is you now whether not it was the seedy collection that i saw were you are mention of the car u your interest in vidio games it seems that one thing that you have done that a lot of gi taid i knew tospect him by the way it was mostly guize nowlss we said women doing it too remat in girls it seems you have a lot of other hobvies and interests music cetera but that we never heard about you getting distracted or pulled down those lines ik it we did not hear about you going and surfing and getting herhur surfings that you could not scape we are getting really into motor cycles or wrase racing cars right u some people went hard laughed out escape woarding into that ken block the lat great can block but that became his main thing seems you you knew that scapewoarding was the main frame and stayed with that and yet you have a lot of other interests ye i think i i'd well with others for its especially moter cross i i have the huge respect ful mo cross i think it superexciting i would love to do it and i know that i would not escape unscathed i would definly want to learn the tricks to whips and flis and whatever and i mone to get hurt and i i do not want a risk my scape creer for that i i i purposely pulled away from that type of thing the last nears niecer dry hat is because i overshot a jump in mammoth o my snowboard that was the lesson lik do not what you doing just cruise why ye tay on the ground it the powder right free ride with your grows because i learned my lesson and yet you are right but at the same time i still i still loved going surfeying and snow borning i do not do him as much obviously but but those are part of of what i did all growing up im and they are important to me i i did do a couple of celebraty car races lik can ask car rays and im i told ae car an the long be sgram pre cause the stude ram ming to the wall and i goht i was fun but i'm not i do not i do not have the band with to get that serious about it and now you have a family of course to of course ye i mean that n and those things as fun as they are and is as i do not know im aas sort of auxiliary as as they are they require a lot of time just france does that long bescramprede they want you to go stay in palmdale for a week and a half in train and and figure out how to truly know how to drive and be safe and s i got time for that yet that is time you are not scape word or with your family right yeright i feel the same way if i get pulled away from reading papers and prepping podcast and reading lace resurch and thinking about experiments we could do that i for more than a couple of days i start feelin the itch i've a feeling the stuff is programmed in t one's nervous system after a while it yo been scape worning for longly o you go a few days it probably just your system is ie lik had os raving over te order yes something i i i sure i mean im well just for instance i our ramp is i being torn down on sunday to day is friday r am as being torn oun on sunday at ten a m to be moved tosolic city for our big vertivent i'm going there to eight thirty i can get a session for a good storn down i love i on father's day that is my father'sday i'm going to work at ight thirday m on sunday ilove it speaking of family and lineage a tell us a about your kids you got some tell t escape orders in your family besides yourself i do im well i have four my own and ht to stepkids and on they all skayed my daughter not much any more but all the boys five boys are all really into it om my oldest son is the most i he is the most prominent because he turned proul u and has men at has his own following cause the name for himself i rily and he is thirty yet he kills it on the street his streetscape wher he does ye but that they are they are all good they are all good scaters in their own ways and a it is fun i mean i i did not of course they are surrounded by their whole life especially rily ecause when he was young i i did not really have the means to have child care whatever i said taken with me on turisn what not he was always around it he got good at it byd to fall but at' some point started to shy away from it because he felt the the pressure and my shadow and it was i do not this is not fun i do not people expect me to be supergood or i have to do thi stuff and he wen shitd away from him an then found a munch of his friends and high school theg they loved scating he is still good at us he that he found his crew and theyh've all found their crews a completely independent of me and when we go on vacation for instance we we were last year we were in a or two years ago we are on the big on why they wanted o the scapparks i woner o the scapparks on vacationnd it is also little harsh stuff it is a great way to get hurt wits that or in hors yet weather worn oh yanii my seeim but but then i go i'm i'm i'm their chauffeur and i'm their felmer i love it that is my vacation but but because they all love us much you knowin mean and it just it is cool i mean o could ivere asked for more it is mazing but's tunk about frank and nancy ol bit just as i have this and odd connection to your family through tha a it is really two or three day interaction chane change my life forever meaning you was spectacul r as a young escaped rording kid but also just the idea that some one would literally take me into their home mad every reason to not trust me vers well as i t no wat billy waldman now explanation needed but people who knew billy hope he is doing well ihave not heard anything about h m but hope he is doing well am but we were wild but he basically took me into your home he and nancy took me in am you knon't fed us am merfed me a mid another friend with me am and i just have to say as your describing your family i can only imagine what it must hve ben for frank and nancy to see you have your kids did they get to am live long enough to see a that rily an you hather cant escape board and i dad tat riley a but my dad passed away when riley was too he is the only one of my kids that that he met e mi oldert simling i had kids he met two of his other grankids besides rily am my mam got to see some of rileys success but a she suffered from on alls harmis to mension things slipped away but i i think that i my dad would not believe the scape when hes in the lytics to him that is that is the top of the mountain because he was really anothers for he love sports he loved the olympics he loves he loved washingfootball he loved blashing baseball he loves when you limbicx were on he just e loved the compotition element in in the hipe of it in and i think there was part of him the felloi why is not scaped wading in the but he knew that there were many hurtles to get through and much more acceptance than neded to happen and i do not think he imagine would ever happen he was especially i can still hear his voice he as a very large god to i do not no i was just smaller than a deafling was smallo i knowi he he did a big yat presents and and i no loks told you this maintimes before disasshe ow we got re connected i sent you direct message and said hey i met your parents in fact t a they took me into your home and i'm telling the truth and you will know im telling the truth because they took me a dinner and they ordered black coffee after dinner ye and yet for years i would order black coffee after dirn ots as a kidd yo to impression le these really nice people took me in els tik while this is what a really healthy family looks i i'm grateful to have loving parents always did but i did not have the healthy family structure for me was all my goodness these people drank black coffee after an this must be what halthy families do soby the way folks do not drink caffee and within eight hours are going to sleep but ah o i i he will do that but well you does not seem to be holding you back a individualized but u yi'd spectacular that this lineage of frank to you and and i mention and nancy because it seems while she might not have been at the contests and run around setting up tables and doing all that leshe cle is supportev as well oh oh she was hat did a lo te events too i mean they need all hands on deck when stor to gettin beg and no one was taking salaries he nos thingas the people thought all your dazzling cashing nonsye he never took a money for any of that and he took much shit in hy man he just e loved it it was for you why ut on't hav any one to ben tearest for me and who was also for the misfis that eyes surrounded myself with and even though he was he was brash and he was he was i now wats the word he was foreboding and and intimidating whatever else he did it for all those kids that were countelost you i mean he really he he loved that it brought them together that he gave them a sense of self a gave them a sense of purpose he saw that because he he was that he he really had a rough childod and he did everything he could through his adull life to make up for it with his own kids and with the kidsthat they surround him themselves with that is that is what he loved about of course he loved seeing me thrive to but he loved that he created the safe space and this thie sense of community and i mamt my mamm was that was her thing was getting people together gatherings u no oh we shall get together even even mi siblings and i as much as we want to emulate our parents we do not do it as much tat as they did and we weregret tha there still time no we an mey we do but om it is tricky were all differentries sure yet that the person that comes to mynd when i think about your dad om forgetting the movy but there is this one clonece would movy where he lives in it neighborhood wuld where i think its o iwunch a young mong oh a dankster sell com me know o comeno ye and i just remember that there is that scene of whike clin't coming out on his porch and just standing really upright ye everything in his frun is front lon is everything superman he heard and just standing there this immense presence and that that is how i remember frank halk ye but he was a solitle softy that is the thing that is that is there there was a it was it was all afron wet he was certainly very wen i you lit e you got you got to see that side of him weressa oh ya come a will take out you will not gus see tony's place let us go i that is not some hard aske well then there is a tal end to the story too where he actually called my mam and i think there may have been a statement or two about hay this kids fourteen he cannot be in linto visto boy's club taking the buss back to langcasterr et ceter et cetera i may veben some discussion that but then they also paid for me to go home oh ye they flew me home ye i think i owe you couple hunter box for a sout west flight whatever air line it was well it is it is fun and i think important to reminists about these people because im they are not just your parents but thet they done much and through you a you ni i really think that aemotions and stories are really the equivalent of energy in humans ye will not peuel oi what energy because that gets carried forward speaking of which a we share a common love of some particular music are you somebody who listens to music tou to to inspire you to get amped up to escape word is music and important part of your life ya it is for this way i i had i had a playless for my five for ity the other day ok fine tune to that trick and what would get memotivated in heighe to to do it you do not have to share with us what is on t e playlist unless yo you choose to ah myan but was at high energy low energy high energy well and and some meaningful songs a ne orders ceremony and i i see nine snails getting smaller because that was a a song we used in one of our big scape tors and it was one of the most high energy sections of of the shell i gas there were i i i cannot go through all of hom i forget i gang of for i wait to gang for it is i sh i forgot what is it oh i find the destens rare fires a i had i had ten there were just gon if any of those play it is i'm going to make it and and i knew that it was about an hour and a half and that is as long as i mean to try it before i too tired choo listen in the warehouse for you listening in w erehouse on random and then a the song that i made it to was a off of that prodegyalbum fout of the lamb aand it is called climatizes ister mannel i use it for a bird house at it when forewone one was the thing and when were these little biddio use letter type things yet anyway thoh when that song came on i i was feeling at i made it fantastic i love this because the nerou scientists ind me is immediately can sayyou a we have this brain that loves to take an information and di scard other information but paired association its strong yeand when you couple that with some sense of reward the making of the very old below coping as the i as a early in life r making the five fortyeths as a come back to the injury after the enjur is almost i loved all that music but i was indocinated by through the scapeharks because that was the sound track to the scate was it was pump music it was sex pristils and and nine nine nine black flag and devo and acts bascoks and that that was that is what i kept hearing and that is what i associate with my best of times it is in your nervous system yet ye others a a few voices bransod and tim armstrong and and the aoration i operation i e tsound tist te eno system was on that playles was on the five forty playles all right tim will be happy to hear that and matfreemin the basebloder and jesse michaels is now playing again with tim rie singer about their ayaan you om the new gig what is to call they had a name and the the they a they changed it oh initially it was a why do not i say cause they change to ther aresi but we know away i know ther making m music yat which is amazing oration i was incredible my year book photo for i think two years running was the cover of operation ivi to that in short for the year book photo speaking of which did you sho up for yeur book photoes or did you graduate high school i graduated high school batn't go to any of the events prom or any of the auxiliary i did not know i mean i was i was now cast i was not even though i had success in scating scating was not cool a and i was not homys with anyone at school except for two other scaters and we felt very ostracise ye i did show up for the graduation cause my momadan want to see it et likewise i graduate but i could tell you more about the curbes in the parkin lot of my high school than aced about anythin happen an i broke many sprinklar heads because the springle heads were right next to the curb andthere was a double sided curb and if you bore slide ecause i'd go ther early on board a slide and then id just leain too far in to break the sprinklehead and never got caught what high school ahwell i went to a couple i went to sara high school originally am then i went to a sandyi guito high school which is in north county and then i ended up a tory pines i got bully that sandy guito that i requested to be transferred because i i could not go i could not survide there as the scater i would have to hide my scapeboard in the bushes before class and then go find it after school that people would not targed me the eighteseward ah itwas a doht i it was a john hes fil it wa for shu o doiid it was josophers's nerves and then skaters were not even considered in that realm because they are just conget they are geting at hammered caue the were few of us whetl things of change and not only have things have changed such that scape woarding is far more popular and respected and at least one mark of that as in the olympics although there are other marks of respect certainly but a huge evolution that i've observed is when i was scapeboarding is a fourteen year old an it into my close to my twenties an thn took some time off for sure am hardly any girls hardly any women there were a few carabath burnt side they got teased ridiculed it was hard on that zubrar yv suberhard now largely through in serem am but some other channels as well you can see this young girl rese onver scapewoarding better than a lot of grown men who have been scapewoarding for decades i imean and then there a number of other ones in the a in street scapewoarding and also taking really hard slams i this this is a complete revision of the recent history of scapewoarding all hae thoughts on that and on e send there a few others was it is it am lizzy who imo te took a really bad fa that was filmed for ter forthe a nack off for pemeria yet these are' touf ladies yea i'm you doing it and for coming bak is he lizziy did the loop she did the foll through sixty loo first woman ever do it would you think changed thit that paved the way s it just u no a critical mass of o females doing it is it that your sky brown you knw you for sure for sure there were there were the pioneers people carabout were inside and i i many others patty hoffman was one of one the first virstcators too who were they planted the seet and and then there were other women that took conspiration o girls can' do this even though there largely outnumbered and they get hosteled for sure and then through the street era a people a lize steamer who who paid the way for legit street scating but then through the years it it started to become more common more accepted which is dum to say cause has always been should have always been accepted but the thing that that really tipp the scale was when everything was leading up to lympics there had to be equal divisions in equal disciplines for men and women and suddenly there was no question should we have a should we have a women's event h we have to have omansven because that is how we that is the road to qualifying for this the olympic stage and vans part serious to their credit they were holding events simultaneously not that we are limpid qualifiers but just their own and they said these events are equal across the board equal prize money equal attention and mee hav just that was just matter of fact nd that shifted a lot it really did now if you go to escape part you see plenty woman there ther it is all n went literal women mams the frs there are older women that are learning how to scape sawson not that it matter much but does any one claim to be the first female do five forty onvert is that sort of a known that oul e linseyatams entastic am and she did that o ta how she did that she was trying it am she is trying she is trying to matwis ah she is married to traves pastrona its the uno it is the the a leed action sports couple am and she was trying up she was she was gettig pretty close and thand we did a big exhibition in paris at the a grand palait on behalf of quicksilver it was a huge event oonly put half pipob and we di this giant show ther thousands people there and it was very much am unspoken but expected that i was going to do nine hundred at this event oma he givas i wont to say was two thousand ten mayme and a are no two thousand nine and and and the organize kind of li case wr can do this and then at some point you do nine hundred knosik i i cannot guarantee that ever every time i've ever made it it is been pretty spontaneous i i've set out to do it and not of come up short i cannot guarentee it i'll try i'll try and they theyre yeoke an i knew the whole time thet were scading as ioga on expecting tus i kind im went trough the motions of of a it is doing my exhibition tricks plain the hits and then started shyin nine hundreds and at the same time lindsey started thying five forties cause she was feeling ot energy and it was this sort of not battle but definitely we were we were trading hids it was ri you are gust das an te a yo missed it and you are gos lindsey a she missed it and then i a she almost made one was riding down and and then fell at the flat bottom it was awh and then i made e nine hundred and thet was kind of the show stopp er i got the expected and i ons one crazy an whatever people are coming down off the ramp knee sliding down and were staying good by to the crowd and i look up and lindsey puts her tail out there'e still people standing on the ramp and she puts her tail out ni was i think lindsey must try it again here we i'm on the new she made it lov it she stole the shol without question it was huge you look it up on on you see ip i gets there linsey otams first first five forty it was alsom and then she made it and we all grapp her n put her hundhers shoulders that is al saves for the gol there is assom cause these things are the four minute myle as i i eer her them people break that berrier and then other people break that berrier it is i may i i watched enough escape woat ing recent year see the sky brown thaing o when she is phenomenal and as she saw her family out to dinner here an lolsangelisand unc with her brother and folks are realy gracious really nice and there again your parents going to the scapepark we after all she is could not drive herself i thing she yet that time bn nin on e probably one of the biggest shifts too is that parents encourage their kiss eskape now coand you imagine that when we are young never no there were many factors telling us not to which i made us wanto do it more sure wy nin now now kids are parents are pushing them into it get out there learn tricks sa waiy that is not ristless be doing but it is cool that that i think i think with te the the really cool factor of all that is there are definitely people our age i i'm grouping you into my age catic by forty seven are i new as not but but ted have kids and and scape weing with such a special time in our life and then they are re discovering it through their kids and their scating together and i think that is just amaze that some one of our age would be what i used to do that you'r in to that lyk let us go and then you cald show your kid out to the sweeper i can pride you that ion kids yet but when i do i'll sho i intend on being healthy enough and ye to do a sweeper people can look up sweeper we do not have to explain it for him but leng lay back grn or a sweeper yet o yot because they will not they would not think to do it no and there are doing all these difficult flip tricks in tust ot my some my seeing i hew whats youre go to on agam escape fearing a really take out the younger genery i can do impossibles pretty i pretty regularly on transition consistently i knew on flat sinc is were basely scrape the back of it is an all he realy but it raps around the back owha ort radit over your foot ye that is kind of my m sneak attack on gam to skape does rawdney mon get credit for that tricks oh yes that is youts to rodney he still contouch with radney absolutely ye yet hes somebody bit u sorly deserves it deserves to mension ind the pioneering of tricks thand confease the godfather in modern skip worn i think of rawdeny y ou and margans all his gones as their guise that i'm honored drove the the progression indifferent partially overlapping directions that set the templa first ilearn fingels hads because rod the first trick you saw me do i learn not because i saw roddny do it on the ground and i thought well i cannot do on the ground but i've plenty of time in the air ands to do it sawsom saw some that stacy put you guides together we we mentiond bones forgat but we really talk about the architecture of it from the perspective of scapewoard progression but it was come any good band it seeme there was really good camistry ye a interpersonally but also that there were each person had something unique you scated way you did mike scay the way he did stevie when he did and rawdney and and we respected each other but we also fat off each other tommy grear ep right caus griup in the bear in fact tommy scain thehills of san francisco in those vidios makes it look easy a those hills are arog they'r danadress and they have real life obstacles niving bosses you will nos he was not stopping as toalines says fantastic ah we could reminists about all these angles put that the point being that spending time with people who do similar things for the same thing but do it differently is one of the best ways to progress this wy routinely fly to taxas and hang out with peter tea another podcaster lickes freedmen just cause they do things differentlymen i do where do you draw sort of priferal inspiration from now they i know you i see jimmy welkins at your amp quen alot the fenom jimy welcoms of eree how good that kit is twho else are you spend time with besides reeths and one of the reasons i asked us is that scapeboarding is unique among many sports an that i givin session a gathering a to scapewoard we will include an enormous yo vitan old man and ten year old girls exactly yes which is tt which incredible you do not thing about soer you a serious game of socker benin professional soc but also not even that that were scatting together is that we are communicating and influencing each other i mean that is the last conversation i have with rease was she is talking out ike ar yougen to tried youf i forty seeani go i'm coing working on it she is what i think she saw me try wone she cause i think con need o coll out a little more and she was right she is how old agan sten and i and i did even consider that because i'm just back in my mod and i'm not taking into consideration that i do not have the snap that i had before i got her and she was riming thalways one key to be making it andyou know do that that is but it but to me that is just tast representative scapeboardin and the inclusivity of it in the diversity of it where it is me i'm fifty five there is thirty year old a pros that are at the top of the game there are seventeen year old up incomers men women ten year old girl that is doing fricks that we have never even thought of or want to do and it is all part of the the whole mix that is really beautiful want it ask you about memorabelia not a topic that i think about much but i think in a prior conversation ofours you mentioned something about this there are scapewoard collectors there are people that collect stickers escape words there is a whole market and world for this and im in addition to people wanting selfies with you when they see you i imagine a there is a long history and continued tradition of people taking a pen putting your hand a sand can you sign this i because you are in this a very a small but very a clearly esteem group of people where your signature increases the value of things o a how does that work a and how does that feel if escapeborder who iu are there are the tell tal signs of who isn'n who is not right ah u if they walk up to you in the l hay w you sign this do you feel good about signing it or that something that you refrain from in it and if somebody is just merely a collector a trador in their trying to built their portfolyo to speak am you can problyalso sents that 'me not trying to put you ain the hot seat here ah we will dansyou creston through the years i was always open to that and and i'm happy to especially when people are scaters are or escape fans an why not in the last three years there has been this knew elements of recellars of people that just go by signater stub they have nothing to escaping they do not care about scapebaning it all they just want to get my signature on an item and sell it and they usually do it on e bay or through their own channels that is fine at some point a few years ago i respected the hustle these guis are they knew that i was ging to be at this event oqet their outside waiting they havebeenwaiting for hours i i'll sign a couple of things but in reson months even they have figured out how to ou get my flight info some hacked into my my actual airline accounts some have a sources at certain airports that get the manifest and they sellebat information i've found all the sout because i've actually held a couple of maccountable because i said look i'm not in a sign this until you tell me how you knew i was going to be ere i have no business here i'm here to visit family no one knows i'm coming here oh wo we saw o friends said they saw you at the a detroyed air poit nobotey did not they would not know whre i'm going to anyway o goi sawht on twitter you did not see it on to it i'm on to itter tell me the truth there is a guir from tems o you to gives flat and phony sulted to us oqe thank you but that has increase to a point where it is it is not sustainable i cannot i cannot please everyone the last time i flew out of chicago there were about fifteen people one guy had a a shopping cart full of scapeboards and they all they all bumrushed me at security before i went through security thinking that i'm in a signs o mciasi cannot i cannot do i unmis my flight and i cannot delineate who iii'm sorry you gos hive sabvatize yourselves i dont nowhat to say and then i went through security and there were fordus wining at the gate they had bought tickets aroline tickets that it could be past security that they aroline tick is theire nocking to yuse to chase this bu i ma wan't people on my autograph but it is weird and it is intrusive and it is counta creepy yet just tell them that a nerou scientists told you that you got to get that slaw bear right and if you sign too many autographs that in rmen on my chance of getting back you are nockin the at tock ne no just nockin be do the flateny inver it just nockin againy witit is it is jusst a really weird youn thand is hav yard has popped up and u other than that and and the tricky parties when there is a public thing or a public exhibition whatever to try to figure out who is the true scape hans and who are not usualy their pretty identifiable but it it just it has ruined the experience for people who truly are the grubscating wel thanks for sharing that and em we will not tell every one what the tell tell signs are that these people do not exploit them the scape worders the i real fans well now a i they will not have to worry about whether not they represent accurately cause you just will on the positive side something up in one to learn more about from you is youre philanthropic efforts u i think heaven rose ah whos in the tex actor was the first to mention to me that you you gess have done some philanthropy together a and maybe 've done much imthebo as well the great jim thebo awhe both both jim and ceaven were board members i jim is the current board member of the scape her project but tells sa bat hescape word project ah it is it is it is mine on profit and we try to develop public scapeparks and are certain under served areas but more by by supporting the community and giving them the resources to do groups that are trying to get scapeparks in th area we are the resource center for them ah we will give them advice will give them funding well give them a our stamp of approval and that can go along wy and a to date we have helped to fund over almost the thousand scapeparks now and seven or eight hundred of which are open i mase my protestork for sire and and it is because i never i never took for granted the fact that i gp near escapepark and that was my home way from home that was where i found my sense of community my sense of identity my my crew and many kids choose the scape or but have no support in doing and those scapeparks are a life one i can attust they they absolutely save lats thereis no question where can people find out more about your foundation we can provide a link but what fin o harked out or itso where does the funding for these parks i shally come from ah it comes from donations from supporters it comes from fun raisers some corporate ah sometimes funding is is fundeled through us for specific resions ah the a ah we have a built to play a project thats in a michigan in new york and that is funded by the ralph su wilson junior foundation ahm they they give us the funding and then we have to give it to that area but but it is easy because there is plenty of projects and now there is an abundance of scape partionas ereas well it thank you for doing that for rlizing around that is and i ca get mo place to scape a curious what is in the immediate horizon i these days you probably have the option to say yes o things and know to things u you have a family of your scapewoard career where do you place your priorities in terms of how to carve up your day or your we coming what would you to make sure that you do theres much of the hours of your waking day fur the next must just say five years cause in if you will not extend that out you can well i i want to be available to my kids for inform us and we still have one at home for the next four years i i will make sure that i am available to her iand in terms of career i never had great aspirations i can never thought giv these this is what a one accomplishe it was always as very wore trick specific oriented as always i go one to try this in this n this i would to continue scating i do not know if i'll be able to scape at the level i'm scanning right now in five years but i know that i'll still be on the ramp i may not be doing it in public trying to advocate for public scape parts doing more with the foundation and whatever i i think i think the way i prayratize my time is what will resinate the furthest and have the best impact on scape rorning in general i do feel that i've come to a point where yes i'm some unofficial ambassador to scape boarding and i want to represent it well i want i want to be fair in that scape worning is all kinds of different things s not just ixcames are on the bigsir or or what not it is it it represents a true culture and i want you project that as much as i can and makes sure that people understand that is also positive and i mean it really everything that i'm doing now i is just kind of fun i got its for the i would say in the last five to ten years s the first time i have truly enjoyed what scape wirding has provided me in terms of opportunity and what it brings to me and and what it means to my family i have a much better appreciation under standing for it and these days it' just everything's kind gravy is just fun i cannot believe i gu sl do for living its crazium fifty five years old and i truly ride my escapewoar i as a career thos nuts i woud have not anyth any other way well it certainly is it earned and i just one to say thank you for a number of things first of all thank you for going to the scapepark thank you eficking this trujactory thank you for inspiring me and many other young people and old people olderr people over many decades now both with what you did on escapeboard and off the scapeboard and including your rasilients and determination to push and continued to progress to the point were you badly injured and then to push through that come back at least match what you did previously and i i would wager that you will exceed your prior skill level going forward i want to thank you for your rasilience i know it comes from an intrinsic drive your love escapewoarding it just absolutely comes through my share in some of that am of course having grown up in it but not nearly as much as you but also just your willingness to stretch out into these different areas the vidio game thing or i'm talk about excames athe olymptics because that did allow for a lot of growth and lateral movement of scapeboarding and at the same time just as you said to bring it right back to the fact that scapeboarding is not one thing it is not other sports it is its own sport and it is its own life stallets its own thing and we do consider you the ambassador for scapeboarding and am i speak for many people and i say that a were very grateful that you are because you bring that that shrewdness an that prudence to it but also that get after it poncrock spirit and the goodness that your parents in stillden you clearly comes through everything from the philanthropy and onward i cannot say enough positive things aint you were express enough gratitude for your what you have done in for your time here your legacy and scapeboarding but also just in the game of life is clearly sumented thank you o thank you eand i appreciate the that yethos of scapeboarding shines through on your shell and just your true here clearly alot ham come from the scapeboard world your

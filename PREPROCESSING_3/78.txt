defenistrated them as a serious fighting force in salianon and ended with them retreating from all captured territory the military was however was not the real story the real story was america's media walter kronkit merica's most trusted newsancher was in actuality a partison left us but he masquerated as an objective journalist and on receiving news of the tat offensive kronkit went on the ear and proceeded to inform the american people that the wor in vionon was being lost he flut of vanon to investigate the situation himself and upon his return he said this for it seems now more certainly the

enemy can matchus not applas to invesion of the north the you nuklir weapons or the mere commitment of one hungre or two hon but or three hundred thousand more american troops to the bat and with ich escalation the world comes closer to the brink of cosmac disast the veanon mor was not primarily lost on the battle field it was lost in the hearts an minds of the american people and it was lost in large part because of the american at news media the american news media has rarely covered itself in glory covering forn policy the new york times famously covered forstallans talatamar his starvation of millions of his own citizens in eu crane to ploing corrupt and venol walter do ranti to cover for the evil dictator the new yor times largely backpaged the holicost itself the world's most evil regimes have routinely relied on america's media to provide them cover and to day is no different come a is in evil genecital terrorist group yet they received widespread sympathy because the media create that sympathy they do through a variety of methods first and most obviously they draw moral equivalents between commas which targets civilians for dath both his raily and its own and israel which seeks to avoid killing civilians when it target's members of commas take for extemple wolf blitzer's questioning of an idef commander yesterday after israel head a fromas command tunnel network in cabalya a major city in the gazastrip often characterized by te media as a refugei camp here is blitzer but even a tata ahama cabander with theramit all the calitinan refug who are in that

comander that is blitzer repeatedly blaming israel for the fact to commas deliberately hides beneath civilian areas and then calling on is ral to effectively peremptively surrender in order to avoid civilian casualties if this were truly a civilian senser alone massive tunnal craters simply would not be there the ground extit collapsed after the bombs hid the craters are there are the dead fighters but according to wolf blitzer in siannen israel's legitimate military actions are apparently morally equivalent to commossous slaughter of babies in their cribs this of course follows hard on the your times accepting the word of commass about military strikes ing casualties resulting in a major blood libel in which the entire legas h media paraded that israel had struck a hospital killing five hundred people in reality in mis fired palicinian is lanicgehod rocket hin a parking lot near the hospital too late the damage was done because this is how it works at the media well get to the next way that the media under mine the case in favor of morality and stand up for the world's worse people in just at one second first with all thi terminal on the world with the economy on tenter hooks with with its seeming as though everything is chaotic you might want o diverse fight into something that has never then worth zero you maint want of diverse fing o preciouse metals the same way

because it allows them to pretend that western countries targeting bad guises are the same as the bad guids we see this all the time then there is the second medea strategy misdirection commedean normac donnal treeted in december twenty sixteen quot what terrifies me is if ices for to detinate an who cleared vice ind kill fifty million americans imagine the backlashians peaceful muslins mctanal's jokeis actually the media' strategy for moral equivalents as antisematism rises around the globe as millions of ratical muslins including in the west march in favor of comas the media are treating muslins all over the world as a victim group thus the nertimes ran in op ad today in the midst of the widest clobal increasedin antisemitism of my lifetime to crying te supposed risin is lamaphobia the author was one rosina ali quote a journalist who covers war is lamaphobia and the matleast her article explain quote for those who experienced waves of horassmen and government surveillance in the years after september eleventh the presinent's pledge of unwavering support for israel set off alarm bells yes according to this new york time's colonists supporting israel is covered for is lamaphobia she also insist thet quote from college campasis to places of work people are facing retribution for expressing support for palstinians that is being misconstrued as anti israel or procomas that is a lie given that protests against israel began even before is raily counter strices and these protests routinely feature chance for the destruction of the state of israel they are not exactly hiding the message as for a ley herself pertuitterfeed chos than on october seventh the date of comasses massacre she did not treat it all but she did retweeto post complaining that is railly prementsturbengrimen entin a who is telling civilians to leave potential war zones in anticipation of military action in fact ales posted precisely zero times to crying comasses brutality but she did find time to reahtweat posts calling israel's actions in gasa a genicide finally there is the third medeostrategy pretending that antisematism is not to major problem it is actuing just a side effect of political contentiousness which means in the and it is really springing from the cycle of violincs which means in the endeds really springing from is railly policy which means in the endds really coming from the jews the media are in the business of down playing muslem and left wing antisemitism treating it is mere opposition to israily policy the policy in this case being israel surviving or as a rus to day's example comes courtesy of the nearo times pro israel and projuish activis around the nation themmen putting up posters of men women and children kidnapted by comas and antisemicts have been ripping down those posters here is a vidio from just yesterday a asright but the're saying is few f israel as they wrip down toe posters an's happening all over the country dosens in thusit of cases every single day of people going around an ripping down posters of kidnap children because they hate jews a mance why that is happening here is another there is another example ie tere the quire down gati oth oo oit the popagn a worthe why why do you tar tha owni the that e t ton more wwhy a that i why do you yeu that thic tt the o these people are in tat excuse me i put that plyr up i would about she is crumbling it oug and ripping enogh why why do you think the the thec tuwo these people are tin tat now tets thas not even as raily thes tit why a tactry why do you think it thic tut wo the ther on the think les ter to in that people wel the people who are supposedly propalicinia no procms they are making it very difficult to make that case when they are ripping down posters of people kidnapped bycomas again by the way it should be pointed out here that zero of the pro palicinian protest thet are supposedly also not procomas have called for comasus render zero as in it none as you can find any one who is doing nape this is all pretty clear evidence of wisesbred antisemitism no well mot according to the near times here is havthern your times is reporting all this quote displaying the posters has become a form of activism keeping the more than two hundred hostages seized by cmas in full view of the public by removing the posters has quickly merged thats its own form of protest a release valves and also a provocation by those anguished by what they say was thes ie realdy governments mistreatment of palistinians in the years before october seventh and since the bomy of goso began i hear you gated not only the third trategy but the first strategy you get the third strategy which is to pretend that antisemotism does not exist and the first trategy which is moral equivalents tbecause obviously is ral tarding terras and accidentally hitting civilians is the same as comas kidnapping small babies and keeping them in tunnels but the nyour times has more quote the battle has inflamed already tentimotions and it captures one of the most fervently debateted questions of the war whose suffering should command public attention and sympathy in fact the motivations of those removing signs takes a variety of forms and as unnerving as the removal of the posters has been fore sum jew and supporters of israel at least some of the people tearing down the posters are jewlish themselves there is the near times down playing people literally ripping down posters of kidnapped babies and pretending that just another form of protest itsoloquen now by the wy thess the same new yor times theose out there ripping on people destroying their lives for not posting the black lives matter square or the obligatory one signd saying black lives matter here is the daily dot playing the same sac can quote some are wondering if the posters are being strategically placed to in trap those who tear them down many of whom support the palistinian people yes he seeid those posters have short skirts that is why they are being torn down those pesky jews and their posters in sympathy with kidnapp victims being held by a genicitle terra group in trapmen the real badguies the jews the antisemitism isant real the jews are causingan by putting up pieces of paper with the faces of babies thayv been kidnapped by an evil terror is group and wi'll likely die in tunnels never seing their first birthday that is the jewsfall dies the anticematism of ripping that stuff down because the jews are being provocative the need a stop being jews i mean all that they keep this breathing thing is annoin commas and its allies are relying utterly on legacy media both in america and in europe to cover for them and to provide political pressure on politicions to cut their support to israel in the midst of their war with commas that is precisely why comas is planting civilians in harm's way to maximize casualties for the cameras two blame israel comas would not do that if the media were not playing along the medias responsibility for the current conflict is massive the media have consistently and repeatedly pretended that comas terror is the same is legitimate military response thus incentivizing the terror for the cameras the media have repeatedly and consistently suggested that if israel hits civilians while atempting to kill terrorists this is the equivalent of what commastas thus insentivizing creating the full incentive for comas to get as many civilians killed as possible cooss admits this stuff on camera and sto what of th mediotu they jst ignored hit pretend et does not exist the media play along with pretty much every bad regime on the planet yeft ask why the answer is that the legay media is salted with members of an international left dedicated to the proposition that the west is real included is itself fatally flood and colonialist all the college radicals we were suposed to ignore they are ging to to roll up theyre gin a pay taxes get chop or they did grow up and they went into journalism these mediatlets hire local partis in activist to free lands for them including hitler supporters antisemies to cover the gosesstrip these media outlets see their mission as the restoration of justice in the universe justice of course meaning the destruction of the west power in the name of these supposedly oppress of the earth if the legas you mead get get their way the west will fall into disarray and far they are succeeding admirably thete's a more on this injust one second first let us talk about sleep

front the battle in the media is a major part of what is going on because on the ground israel's winning last night as mention israel stroch eight series of tunnel complexes under the gubalia quotn quot refugei camp i'm think quate on quote because tactually just a city people are calling areas in the gosistrip refug camps as though these people are going to be imported into hypho or something they are gin buildings that have been there since nineteen forty eight and before many of the quon quot refugei campsthat youre seeing are actually just citis and calling refugi camps is way of weponizing them against the future of the state of israel its part of the gal but israel did strike a bunch of tunnel complex that killed an enormous number of members of cmases leadership they are penetrating deep into the gosistript particularly in the northern portion of the gosestrip and that is crating desperation on the part of comas which you are seeing in them now attempting to say thathey are going to release some passport holders american passport horrers were being held up by comas in the gosestript they are not being alowed to leave the otherofa crossing apparently comsis now thinking about may be allowing that to happen because they aretrying to create some sort of sentiment thathey are not all thabadamin they out releasing people with duel passports you will see comas in future weeks out assume say the same about duel passport holders among the hosages that tey are colnetly holding in an attempt to buy off america for example you may see them take some people with duel nationality israilly american nationality and relese some of those people in an attempt to buy off the americans which of course is a sickness of its own tbecause now you have noxy types selection in which if you have the right passport you go to the right and live and if you the wrong passport you go to the left and you die in the tunnels with these evil these evil monsters what comas is relying upon is t the international community will stop israel from finishing them off that is what theye re lying upon right now because on the ground israel is in fact winning which is why you are seeing andsolatry grups the hoothies suddenly decide to get in by all o these groups are being run by camas yesterday the yeman hothy rebels entered the war with israel after a launch drones and missiles at the south of the country earlier to day all that isto fo shotdown the hoothies are part of the eranian access of resistance it must be noted at this point that the aranian hothies were e state department label terror sgroup under the trumpetministration ore the first moves of by deministration was to remove the hoothes from the terrolist despite their charming slok an death to the juws death to america now they have decided that they are going to enter the warn out to they have the projective power to seriously impectisrael the anser is no israel is sending some naval assets into the region to shoot down anything that the hoothies decide to fire but this is essentially eron trying to threaten every one from every border without losing important pieces of the py right now eron has proxies everywhere because the proxyes act is their offenseiv military mechanism around does not have the actual projective capacity from its own country to destroy israel outright instead uses proxy groups comas hesbalaw cause bla has far stayed out the reason that hesbala has not gotten in full scale is because mi my theory of this entire conflict is that this was generated buy oron in order to stave off the touty piece process i think everybody who understands geopoltics understands that this is what is happening right now and the reason is because that proc has ben working amazingly well the abraham cords are holding all the all knowing me wis the had of foreign affairs and defence committee in the ua parliaments ad quot from the you a yo perspective the abraham corts are here to stay want everyone to acnowlegein xcept that israel is theire to exist that is that is a strong statement they the aranians were afraid that they'ud be boxtan they are afraid that a saudy egyptian gordanian u a o lions that this would effectively create a massive counts or balance boxing them in in the mddle east and the aranians struck out using comass now my guess is that they did not think comoss was going to succeed in this terr attack as far as it did they probably believe that israels wall was going to hold that the lose not the first time the people o tried to breach the wall they probably figured that they would attack with fifteen hundred two thousand terras prety much all them would be killed but theywould end up killing a couple of hundred is raily civilians ind kinnapping ten or twenty of them and this would be enough two create a serious is rally military responds but not enough that the world would actually be okay with allowing israel to do that sort of thing and id drive souty off the ball in terms of creating a pesteal with the israelies those probably the original intents and then it turns out the comass succeeded tbeyond its wildest imaginings they insrp killing fifteen hundred people insie israel in kinnapping over to hundred people they go prodit they vidioed it they could not they could't help themselves because this how much they ate guse and uron i think feels a little bit the dog that caught to car comoss about to get taken off the board cmoss was one of their nights on the chessboard comosses about to get completely destroyed nevicerated as well as should be and the that the last thing they want is probably cus belaw which is significantly more powerful piece on bortic a brook they do not want that being taken out by these railies as wellsoinstead thirs r protding around the edges but all of this again is the result of the success of israels military activities right now meanwhile egypt is saying that it is not going to take in any one any one from the gosistrip in fact which by the way this should be an indicator of just how dangerous egypt proceed the people in the gosestript to be to their country in terms of how many of them are support of a comass that is egypt's perspective not isrels egypt mustopha my boully whose the countries prime ministers and what we are prepared to sacrifice millions of lives to en sure that no one encroaches upon our territory he said egypt would never allow in post solutions are the settlement of reginal issues at its expense that is the corrent situation in the middle east the only way literally the only way that comass can win and survive is with the help of they med tha pushing the west political leaders intoosition of weakness that is their goall and they may get

they are doing this is also by suggesting that jobidinsabol pulling numbers are due to his support for israel now the evidence on that is incredibly scanty the fact is that jobidin has really bad poll numbers because he is a really bad president and those pull numbers pre exist his his support for israel in this particular conflict is something that statisticion nate silver has pointed out he says that ther ere's really no way to sort of quarrel lats his success with regard to with regard to israel with his electorel success you'r seing a bunch of left wing activis gidean rackmen we's a chief of foreign affairs commentere for the financial times riting gaza is very bad news for bidns reelec prospects young voters and progressives are a keep part of the democratic collicion many are youodious about the administrations support for israel if they stay home or vote for cornal west bidns in big trouble number one none thember voting for ornal west cornalest not can get a lout of but as nade silver points out there is been no change over all and bidins appruvalrating since ten seven bidons policyes popular parts of some democrats an unpopular with others also swing voters matter too americans are pretty supportive of israel that happens to be tru but agan the media are now creating pressure particularly pro commass members the me are creating pressure onbidin by essentually suggesting that if he word to lose the election would be because he is too supportiv of israel which is amazing statement considering that the united states supporting israel of or commass is a seventy fifteen prospect interms the polling dato naturally johnsogby who is a member of thea of the pro palistinian cockus he was commission by the arab american institute to pull arab americans just to show jobine how angry they are showing that just seventeen per cent would support the current presidents in the twenty twenty four election the poll surveye arab americans across the country including battle ground states two thirds f varab americans have a negative view of presen en bidins response to the curn violence in palstine in israel only seventeen percents are ready devote for him in twenty twenty for but bidon is not the only candidate losing support the majority is not claiming to prefer the democra tic party in two thousand agnt nt o tdoes not sixteen and democrats out number republicans to to one in this pole thirty two per cents of arab americans identified as republican compared to twenty three percent qoidentifie as democrats fifty nine per cents of arab americans reported experiencing discrimination seventy per cent seventy four per cent of arab americans age eighteen to thirty four reported facing discrimination lesturs point out here we should point out her that this pole does not suggest tite thesepeople are going to swivel and and vote for yeu most pro israel president in the history of the united states donal trump whos likely to o the republican nominate or rondosantis who if anythng is even more proisrael then donaltrump but this is gind up in order to put pressure on bid in to abandon israel andyou'r seeng the media do this over nover nover you have a youave an article from politico suggesting former ads to comla hereses twenty twenty presidential campaign are collecting signatures for a letter urging the vice president to quote seek an immediate sease fire between israel and comas calling israel's gaz a campaign a genmicide the draft letter which was obtain by political amouncs to an attempt to dial up pressure on one o the bide administrations most familiar faces in encourages of ice presidents to supporta sease fire resolution intruse by representative quarry bush the draft letter says we must morn the tragic loss of his really life targeted by comas however we must firmly and unequivocally reject the isrally governments exploitation of these deths exploitation of the deaths that' what sraels doing ther exploiting the deaths to gethe of comas to spight the fact that again they literally surrendered te entire goza strip two comass and left them in control for eighteen years eighteen years well come off the firing rocket to them but teir exploiting the tragedy in order to do what expend is rally blood and tressure going baccans to an area they wish they had never seen but dis amazing stuff but again the goal here is to generate descent inside the democratic party sanding in the wall stra joronal mally ball who is left wheng reporter the left is tearing itself a part over israel to many on the left the israel commosere is supurring what feels a permanent rupture where previously supplemated to frince as become impossible to ignore and every one must choosesides both pro israel propalsenian advocates describe a feeling of disolutionment has relationship's fracture and harsh words are exchanged the result many predict could be a breach that splits democrats for a generation with untold political consequences the feeling is mutual said the she talks about how jews are feeling why our black lives matter and qurry bush and ao s suddenly procomas the feeling is mutual from any actives on the left to see presidet en biton and other democratic off soldiers have blindly sided with a right a lined is rally government by the way right aline is realy it is a unity government bany gons tos part of the government bany gont is not on the right huse liteally part of the coalition opposing tetonavu but does not matter the media do not now to how their talking about as as per are usual arrangement if you ar arab american muzlem american repalsinian you feel you do not matter you feel in visible said while le chahed a progressive strtegis and former spokesmen for the justice democrats that of course would be ao ss brand of the party and the goal here by many members the media is to prop up the pro comas wing of the democratic party as to create a ground swell of descent inside the democratic party causing jobin t turn away from what has been far pretty solid support for israel and that of course is effectively what the aos wing is there to do that' what the aosing wen the party the quarry bush wing ofthe party is tere quarry bush which jus a terrible human being beolu'm congrous woman she tweated out yesterday is a direct tweet from her quot we cannot be silence about israel's ethnic cleansing campi ethnic cleansing ethnic cleasing weard cause again n i always sumed that ethnic cleansing vald the ethnic cleansing of a population not their multiplication from one point two million airabs o nineteen forty eight two you no seven million in two thousand twenty three terrible job ethnic cleansing israel also i assume that if you were to pursue in ethnic cleansin campaign typically what you do not do is tell all the sulings to get the hell out of the way while you bomb at military targets isrel has overwhelming air superiority if israel wanted to cause right now hundreds of thausin o deaths in the gosestrip it has the military capacity to do israelis not doing that becase they do not want to do that does not matter quorry bushesi terrible human being babyes dead pregnant women dead elderly dead generations of families dead millions of people in goz with nowhere to go being slaughter wot millions of people being slaughter can you read of can honesty god such a liar such a terrible person in a liar the youos must stop funding these atrocities against palsines again the moral equivocation it is amazing it is unbelievable and then quarry bush she sait wit the fact that she does not givei a crap about jews wh are murdered by by comas and she lis she put out at teetsing this month a cospons for to resolution condemning comas for hostage taking urging their immediate release we must ensure the safe return of hostages and the protection of palsinin and israely s villions that is a lie her resolution did not condemn com oss at all it did not call for the release of the hostages she voted against the house resolution condeming comas she is just a liar shelet bydily this this is a a fundamental truth that i thing has been under under noticed by a huge percentage of the western population for a very long time for hard quor radical left wingers foradical is lamas for fundamentalist of many stripes it turns out the truth is not even a secondary priority is not even a turtiary priority truth does not matter at all the means ore completely justified by the ends lying is completely fined longs to get what you want truth is of no value of no value to many people on the hard left quarry bush is being one case in point aoseas and other aose is at dedespicable twimpcing she teated yesterday apack tweated against rshetitaly ohano margnmall boman some ar lea these ar all people who voted against a resolution supporting israel gascomas aosee then tweeted apack in door scores of genuar sixt insurrectionists theye are no friend to american democracy that is that is insane i'm sorry that is insane apac is run almost entirely by former dem cratic staffers the top ashalons of apac the american israel public affairs comitte is run by people who are left wing politically its been a serious issua contention you mee personally and apac by the way she says they are one of the most racest and bigoted pack ing congress as well tis proportionately targaning members of color no they literally just target people who are anti israel that is it is in the name american israel public affairers committee that is literally in the name of their organization and if those members happen to be disproportionally tpeople of color what why the held's apac have anything to do with that and then she says she is as about apac i i've yet to see her use this sort of extreme language with regard to honest got terogrups q they are an extremest organization that the stabilizes you es democracy ochida an extremest organ apac an extremest organization that the stabilizes you es democracy that is abso ao see that is it dishonesty or stupidity or both nowd for a long time i've let her get away with the tupidity card shes dishonestant ha semention terrible person because at a certain point i cannot give you the benefit of the dout that ous demoron any more or at least if you are moron un o can let you use t is cover for the fact that clearly you are on the side of the ome oss necs clearly and obviously and anybody whos ois going to pretend this away because ao see can do dancis on instegram is is truly in idiot a fellow traveller idiot in the media we are also playing up protest against anthony blincoln yesterday anthony blinkon the secretary state was testifying before congress and here is what he had to say about what he had seen come ss do a family of for the young boy and girl six and eight years old and their parents around the breakfast table the father is i gouged out in front of his cids he mother's rest cut off the girl's foot amputated the boy's fingers cut off before they were executed and then their executioners sat down and had a meal that is what the society is dealing with and no nation could tolerate that and as we said repeatedly is president bydan has repeatedly made clear israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself and to try to take every possible step to make sure this does not happen again he is testifying tbat that and hes completely cract what the media folcasom then folks om wup lincon actually had to say what they folkaston is protestors destrupting blinkond now yet these protestors are garbig human beings and morans what they are doing as they they sat in the back of the room holding up their hands stained red with ink to suggest that tony blincoln has blood on his hands out they would not do this with regard to comoss and i just will point out here in odd and disturbing parallel he'r all thse people holding up their red hands to show that america has blood on his hands whenever the held that is but i here hislebin thevitia hollans a is thingish members of the apropriatiast ci thank you this i to justifi r not in the prace o cresicoin permanally un employable idiots at best evil senisitl antisamis it worst this dispickable people anyon there is an odd echo a odd historical echo here and the people holding up their red hands to the camera last tim mis on hands that red it is when there were actual members of the palisinian authority holding up their red hands after having butcher ad is raily soldier who mis takenly drove in to ramala in it is it is hard not to see that particular picture i that that picture wis was prettyfamous back in the ay by the way this administration is now talking about giving the palisinian authority control over the gozl trip which is the palsing authorities literally paying the families of the terrace who murdered people in the gosa envelope that would just be han changing one horse for the same horse of a slightly different color as for the by dministrations out time at now the question is will h by administration go we can need on all this because of all the press coveridge and because of these supposed internal de send de spite the fact that again the polling data in the united states sugjust broad and wide support for israel in this conflict i talk about preborn a lot on this show i believe their mision i know you do do who would not want to help moms and their cates in crisis preborn is the largest provider of free ultrasounds

that is an open question i do not know the answer moucherf the da y know the answer at this point you seeng som mixed signals at bast twenty blincon far has been pretty good ut your starin you see the what house pre secretary who again is not a pro isral activs in anyway sha perform corin jhohn pierr is from the quorry bushwing of the democratic party here she was she is ask if anti isral protestors are extremes you now people chancing from the river to the sea meanyoug the extremination isral and she is a gui o no i it is amazing how quiet she goes when it comes to left wing antismatic protestors when it comes to moreons in caky pans marching in charlotesvillt that is the spurfor an entire presidential campaign one it comes to hundreds of thousands of students around the world marching in coordination with chomas slogans then she is a gide no there extreme can we say that sor i do no here she was having a tough time there is perfen byn thin the iis real protestrs ans contry ar e trei what i can say is what we have been very clear about this whan it comes to antisemitism there is no place we have to make sure that we speak against it very loud and be and be very clear about that remember what the presidentt decided when the president decided to run for president is what he saw in charlottesville in twenty seventeen whal we he saw neo not sees marching down the streets of charlottesville whith vile anti semitic a just hatred and he was very clear then and he is very clear now he is taken at actions against this over the past two years and he is continue to be clear ther is no place no place but this type of vile an despite despite tha this kind of erhetoric heh well i'm i'm glad the yo rob charlotte's bill mean hw about campas raticals pulling danpostors are extremests how about people whore chancing from triver to see aurstrumens no wa sheldt have mords about as lamaphobia now i where the the white houses attempts to equaite what is going on with anticemicism in this country with his lamaphobia or totally ithe there insane ther ther completely mad it these are too completely separate phenomena the attempt to lincot the two of them is once again the create a moral equivalence in a cycle o violence rhetoric the idea being that if your pro israelyou must be as lamaphobic wet whereas if you are propalsinian well you are not antisimatic even if your chancing things from the river the sea here she was talking about the rise of is supposed as lamaphobia what if your message this americans what effort havbe made at out weh to this thi toco of tankfo what i can says that the president but knows that muslems and those perceived to be muslim have endured a disproportionate number of certainly of hatefield attacks rwas we talk about what we are saying here a and he also understand that many of our muslim or american an palstan in american leve ones and neighbors are worried about the hate being directed at their communities and leaders at every level of this amiiciation will continue were a cantimnuingage engaging with the muslim community o or american community and pal than in american leaders to hear there concerns a and also a to hear ther pea back on howbat i certainly to combat the discrimination the hate in discrimination that ther sing as well again the normac donal twee just coming to life freight here by the way i feel i should just show you what the actual an the semitism verses is lamaphobic stats look in terms of of reported hate crimes and such according to the the anti defimation leagu no not not a place that i'm a huge fano but there the best source for measuring this sort of stuff at this time the eightyall has reported more than twelve hundred an ment acinciden in the united states through make twenty twenty three and they ave seen a three hundred eighty eight per cent optake an incidents after commass's attack on israel i twoent to show you the scale here is how you can fool people with with stats this wout see an end is doing in twenty thirteen thereare just under a thousand hate incidents reported against jews in the united states in two thousand twenty two there wer almost four thousand and in twenty twenty three it is cen a surpass that in twenty twenty three it can be higher than that two talking valic a minimum of three four thousand hat crimes against jews now you move over it two im is lama linked hat crimes is lombling tat crimes this hat you lie with stats is by by looking at the scale o get in two thousand almost zero in two thousand one when this is supposed lik massive is lama fil be outbreak were all going all my god is five hundred a ad no points ifs even approach remotely what sues go through in this country in terms of anti semetic hate incidents largely from radical muslims by the way and then that number stays wlve hndred two hundred allthe way up to twenty fourteen in joums to manety three hundred and twenty sixteen it is still under two hundred an were supposed to believe that according to the eigtyall the jews who are experiencing whet ere only twenty times the number of ha crimes that the that muslims are are experiencing in the united states i should point out here that here about three twenty for five million muslems living in the united states about six million jews living in the united states somewhere thereabouts again these are very small numbers interms of the general american population the on a per capita basis jews are wemore likely be tarted but of course whenever there is something that targets israel and jews we have to mention is lamafogia because the idea is thase a moral equivalent an sjius a cycle o violence in the jews are the one toare doin these lamf whatever whatever the stupidity here as me wel john curby he national security spokes person he was asked whether theye were classfying people as to messicteroris for making violentansty semetic thrats given the fact that this administration focust in on home schooling moms who did not public school boards i here was curby people on is country making by on a i the mee ret arba domestic heres i do not e kno that were class iffying people is domestic ters that i may not that is realyer question better teft te lon forcemen i'm i'm not aware that there is been such a at characterization of that u case is that wavering kind of meanwhile alehandra mayorcas is not firing apparently a pro comass member of his of his staff the department of poman security officer whoa had criticized israel is this presoners nesua ale a palsing an de agest employe she made tel propose ro frenc t israels an a partided occupation and calling for palsing and feedom at the expensement is really downfall andta she treated hashtag free palestine she is colnenlly on administrative leave joshalley senator from missery since letters to maarcas calling for her termination and ton maarcas suggested that he might not fire her he here is palli vers os mericas is this typical of of people to work at the atest this is an asylum and emigration officer who is posting these frankly pro genicidel slogans and images on the day that israelies are being slaughtered in their beds what have you done about this wor thinks i'd to say to you number one your question to suggest that that is emblematic of the men and women of the department uphon the security is despicable mi'm sorry what have you this person works for the department of hallbland security have you fired her that was one of for answers have you fired her one have you fired her do not come to this hering room what israel has been invaded and shour students are barricaded and libraries in this country and cannot be escorted out because they are threatened for their lives you have employes who are celebrating genicive and your shing its despicable for me to anse ask the question has she been fired in the answer is gingrand mistry believe but not fire but not fire that that is the answer right there in terms of whether the west is caving whether jobidon is going to cave these the ongoing pessure from the media and from the fare left of his flank again some mixed signals jobiden in tony blinken they are pushing seriously for a lot of aid for gasinan here is the problem with that particular push that particular push is quite dangerous given the fact that if you provide gas supplies into gasa comastics all of it wine immediately who is has she administering all that and blinkain seefitly still have yet to actually explaine who is going to actually hand out that stuff and make sure that civilians get it the keep saing tha hey all will make sure and thy sa well what what if comosstakes to the wep and will be very angry lol that that is non t answer the the focus right now on putting aid into into gasa as sopposed to what really should happen which is temporary camps are set up in the egyptian desert tan her administerd by the egyptians his least t egyptians are not heriss that tha the ades is not ennmgoing to comossa that would be the actual solutionment egypt has not been prettictly forthcoming on that particular manter the focus on on aid as a sort of the the ball and all of the american effort makes very little sense in terms of gosi cevillian aide again duel purpose has been the entire problem throughout this entire conflict meanwhile there is that conflict its breaking out in you us congress overhad ovie israel ithade on the one hand you hae the republicans in congress whoar kindes sketchyou when it comes to you cranade then non love wit the idea of u cranade with not in tenormous mount of overside theire skeptical of what the end of that conflict is going to look whether additional military aide is going to allow the eu cranians to break through russian lines and say the don bas and crimia given the fact that exextraordinary resource of importing to the country we know a lot of the money is is going to corrupt purposes we alson a lot of it is going to finht russians and to there a lot more questions about its going on neu crane after year and a half of spending tens o billins o dollars in new rane hand wit the gard to israel which has a very long historic relationship wit th united states in terms of military aid and extraordinarily transparent process with the uass department of defense s the re publicans ou in the house have proposed separating off that aide ther pushing an israel only ad bill according to en piar according to en biar iofm sameday housepeaker my johnsan tok office last week the republican let house pass a resolution the clearing solidary with israel and pledging it to give government to give its government the ability to defeat commass now the're introducing a bill aims to you just that but now without controversy because the billits and fourteen point th rebillion dollars to israel without addressing any funning request for the worning crane bidon wants to use the popularity among republicans of support for israel in order to get them to give a bunch more money to ou crane my johnson is saying lut just give the money t israel what it what exactly des oes israel have to do with u rane he is going to fun that by cutting the iras tis that a good billy at to go i would certainly mote for i mim very much very that belithing the irish should be got otin th iriss of terrible organization and i thing th money is necessary right nown the mddle of the war im mi very much in favor of my johnson's aversion th billi here is my johnson explaining that this is real ade paced stand alone is ral a the recorting as that there will be avote fully there say that the timi e that that o hoping thursday and an't looke fourteen point five billian is the number that you are looking at an you think that that maybe you will get aby partizan vote here sure ti hat any that tat the number of demo crats thin my com i hope that it is most or all of them memin there is a few people who have philosopof differences on that and will have some intens tobates about their opposition to that but what this is a matter of good verses evil how is e going to be paid for i we are gin to be releasing at here shortly but o whil we my intention and mie asere in the first i traft of this bill is to take some of the money that has been setaside for the ir building and bolking out the iressrit ol the about sixty seven billion dollars in that fon and wl will trato tac e fourteen point fide necessary for this ifmediate and ergen need whill dey wit the rest of that issue at bidon world is very angry about this they want lynx between the eu cranad and the israel aide according to political the byn administration you crane hoss tin both parties are trying to break a wall of concervtive resistance on capital hol with the determine blitz to pass funding for the war in eu crane and a to israel in unusual by partison offence non capital hell secretary state antony blinkon and defensecretary loid austen on tueisday publicly defended the administrations one hundred and six billion dollar request senat io pe leader ot mich mconnal warrns in a speech threats israiling crane are serious and intertwine and later said conceptinally he and senate majority leader chucksumer are aline now it is true that russia is backing both aron and his proxies in this war as well as you crane russia is in a farious force on the world stage they demonstrated that over and over again i will never understand some on the right who continued to militate in faver of the russian government lad by dick to torial i taxon in vladmerpooden it is astonishing to me you can point out all probisly crane including thir ocrruption including long standing antisemitism in you crane also say the vlarpoudent is one of the worst people walking the planter right now and has been involved in legitimately every major conflict apparently of the last several years from africa to the middle east in the worst possible way using the wagoner group an africa using the syrians in the midle east backin busharisod lamerpoon is in a farious force inthe world without question and curbing his military abilities on all frunts is a good tradgi's the reason why i've in the ast supported ads ou crane not because i love the government of you crane but because i do not believe that russia should be taking over a sovereign state and not only that the russian militaries should be weakened and very much in favor of spending american dollars to weaken the russian military becaue th russian militaries using it to ascess in orde to destablize governments all over he globe in dangering security of america's allies and indirectly america's economy and our national security as well s there is a case to be made however if you do not have the supportant congress then you do have to separate them off i think the back op position by the way from my johnson is goingto be to put foraid a bill that does not take the money from the ires but does separate off ou crane an israelate thet techy smart politics becuse again it makes the senate now vote up or down on israelate alone and thowp tell a pretty big story if the senate refuses to just give a go ahead to a pass bill with israel aid because they want it connected with you crane but they are really sayings that the israel aid is nots importan enough on its owns just pass stow be a good political strategy ther here 's chucksumer ripping into that strategy the best most defficient and fastest way to help it is through by partisantion in fact it is the only way and that' why i was deeply disappointed by speaker johnson's first major legislative action a purely partisan action house republicans released to partisan and wofully inadequate pactogwith noa to you crane no humanitarian assistance for gaza no fun ding forin dot pacific and poison pills that help wel fy tax ches avoid paying their fair share ye they are calling that a poison pill i guess that johnson's back up step will be o here woare firermem of the poise knowledges m of the israela that is a good strategy by johnson becaue again here is a fractious caucas a lot of coukas does not want additional eucranade johnson himself is voted against additional eucranade a few different times it will be interesting to see is more ini think the end outcom is ging t be the same meaning israel will end up ging military aid because there is extraordinary support in both house of congress and from the white house for the military aide bute'll be interesting sstrategically how johnson approaches that and what sort of a billi he is going to have carving off what he perceives to be bad bills from good bills ardygise the rest of the show is

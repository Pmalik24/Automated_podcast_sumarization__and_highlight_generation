a quick warning there are curse words titter on beeped into dayes up a shot of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our whibsite this american life dotwor it is this american life a'm conajoffy walth sitting in for iro glass last fall i saw this vidio from my high school in michigan and mede it would not have stayed with me in the way that it has if it were not for all the many things that have happened since then that keep reminding me of this vidio it is turned into a sort of reference point in my head for a danamic i keep seeing repeated the vidio is from september twenty twenty one lass fall in michigan bout twenty miles outside in orbur it is early morning right beford the school day a group of parents and their high schoolers are kin out loosely crowded around the door to a school a mostly white crowd there is a police officer with top gun sun glasses e a going to gooin e i a wa i edin i ci we asal i gan gan hani dl the officer is calmly one might say patronizingly repeating if you are goin to go into the building you have to hav a mask on nobody in the viio is wearing a mask about twenty tean agers are standing between the officser and the door to their school looking altin ages do when they are waiting for anything a little board the little blank lots of cross arms as this goes on i no ot not get aforse anybody im not wat ma on anybody tha not my jot shall they can going without the ma su u a nowy oll e a order wit their ean aall seof the school on thet a be en as con non we no ov a ma there is no ballon tat arwhat be don you thek can go an gi ta oe on go an gi the officer has just said no you cannot go in and the parents are leaving the kids toward the door yelling you can go in some of the tean agers look wreasonablyg a little confuse did not the cop just say the exact opposite but they all turn and slowly moved toward the door where the principal and suprintending are standicng with masks on and the kids are just traped there in a big clump i gige the cannot cot you just n ower i remember whatching this and thinking what is it to be those high schoolers stuck in between your principal and your parent between two autharities who are each certain they have the moral highground when it comes to your life gthen a passage opens the administrator step to the side and the scits russion o be g e rso be c a shoerslok god the kids are inside soon after i saw the masks vidio i saw another from texas a mom at a schoolboard meeting opposing critical race theory in masks was destrupting the meeting an officer goes over to ask er to leave and then he starts going back and forth with her over herseeded tenage son he was just looking at his lap the whole time tagain what is it to be in the middle that i have since seen many schoolboard meetings where kids in the audience as parents yell about school closures or do not say gay laws or admissions policies when school districts tarted banding books from their libraries i kept wondering do soos care about that does not make the books much more appealing or is there a kid out there whose i read that book by that one s money en not interesting this dynamic a dults arguing about the kids right in front of them it a play that is quietly toring the country rigt now being reenacted in different places in different forms a play in which you never here from the mean characters people the kids of the school in the mass atia a i was stready for a fosh sarr i wae readyy thatin school i thought thit was ne really god this is a student a'm gonacalled john john everyget i talked to involved in this particular day at this particular school asked that he changed his name and i have the vidio became very devisive john says what you miss what you do not get from just hearing from the adults in that vidio he that the biggest thing happening for ham writ at that moment and many students was not masks it was that this was the beginning of school finally a normal year after such a long pandemet i had been around losy people since my freshmen your high school ther are liv things the changed i know t sounds of your bott lickopes voiceis got deeperer inhestings that and people people people can drive now people have jobs people did not have them a trestin your high school and people have angry parents now coming with them to school and there is an officer outside the front door thatasor was john was wearing a mask that day he was allowed in the school buildan his mast he walked in about ten minutes before the confrontation outside headed to p english sat down oe john's class started and then those kids from outside were allowed into the building a couple the once that were in my class a nock on the door my teacher whedn't open the door ed they were recording her be very hostile a coprtational shaings stuf you are destroying my educational riots a ball wale wale al and then mi teachyer basely told them dies i'm just iv just following the rules in the close the door on them well ye what is you make of that i was pretty destried that sho turn around looks asis gies i i i cannot you this thisis this redicuous i was pretty destro because i i had never seen people treat teachers that be scor and a changed the way john saw his teacher she had such little authority in that moment in many of the other moments that followed in the coming months she would asked kids to where their mask properly they would not she struggled visibly saying things and eac to find a job somewhere else john tow kapt trying to restore the original order of things the way he remembered school to be the teacher in charge i jus made a point to talk with her not trying tif you at teachers hat tll trying i mak it a pointe to engage in her classis tu that i i i tried to sr she still had thi se authority that sheid te ore everything too place even though she actually did not even tho shanc se did not yat i was inmevi ou i was not these are two students an gonacalled daniel and matti who only wanted to speak with me together who were hischil seniors who did not won a use the real names and who tag team every time they speak mattie was wearing a mask just as she were one caser man oned or two she was let into the school building daniel was not wearing a mask e and his parents did not agree with the mask mandate he was crowded in with everyone at the front door the supente havnt that princible were getting aoy yat the whole day was just kind of weare myway was that ploite a ball a just come of distracting o got everyone did wanted just ler i asked daniel what happened once they were let into the building he says they put all the kids without masks in the library and they were there for hours just as a sort of holding area i guess until they figured out what to do with them there was prise taxteeur sony catesjus angen the liragers teach ers alost e we are ged kidsin nauty know las

other that am ow o not an very lik agrgetat gois bery ivide and not ever been my tet ifool nd i affect ou the rest e schoolier everyone i spoke with agreed on this the school year was ruined by what happened that day everything after that was tents people last trust in each other everyone felt less safe less comfortable this thing that had not been frentan center for most of them became the main event the students dis agreed on which adults were to blame some of them blame the parents some blame the teachers but they all agreed that the adults were to blames many of the big contentious political isses right now center round kids should teachers be allowed to teach about racism history sexuality well stricter gunlas keep our kin safe in school with more a gress if climate policies

every morning oafter youvaldy and after every school shooting that happened before youve aldy and the forty school shootings that have happened far just this year a political debate emerged and re emerges we have too many guns we have too few permits too much mental illness the teacher should have guns the issue is really assault weapons no it is background checks it is a second amen ment and meanwhile kids keep going o school and guns keep coming o school and parents keep standing round outside grimly trying to imagine what is going on in those buildings diring lock downs that is what dan did standing outside his kid school i was duffully trying to imagine myself into that space i did not ask you the re them if they were scared as such tin a dum question but i wated to know what they were thinking about and how they were spending their time i wanted to know that too what is it for the kids who were actually at thecenter of this thing we seem to have desided i's a permanent part of our lives now i was split between denial and pantshooting fear and i was not in the roll of pantshitting yet dan's oldest kid lyraf miss the loud speaker announcement about a school lock down she was very breezy about whac she assumed was a drill and tell her sister harppertexted her no this is not a drill are you ka the teacher shut off the lights in myra's english class room blocked the door everyone crouched on the far wall under some shelves and just short of one that little paings of fier star to hit because i have boththy storys going one of which am could be the case but i hope is not and one of which i need to believes the case because otherwise my brain would excloded lyra's little sister harper was one floor down in hoalse class ninth grate harper's classmaids were clustering along the far wll but harper sat in her desk twisted her body round toward the classroom door and started filming the door the camera just watches the closed classroom door sometimes her hand shifts or shakes down her shoes black converse pass the health and wellness text boks and then back to the door just waiting well it is almost your steging it for there to be a shooter to come in riht there un i thought if it was an actual school school shooting i see all these things of students filming shakily i thought maybe if it was happening i should probably do that a rumor started going around about a kid with a gun somewhere in the school harper and lyr a kept waiting for a long time no shooter no announcemen no information after a milk and a grat enough a period of time had passed an the tention sort of laked out of the room and i just one to my desk in non tarcically touch us on your fones man lay just one er play toucher mi can peter i did not think i could get workdone am i felt to nervous i mean people were really just talking some people weren even reay talking about the locked in there just talking about regular high school drama they attison co c with oin something we who was it was i do not know some girl was no i'm being to die of virgin aand and then people heard in they sate laughing and and then her friend as know wher not gan to di tocand i remember otnough is is important there is a couple and it was a junior boy and a softwork girl and the whole time they were just in the cornerly beinga cuttely an stuff and am they were telling up to each other to the girl was om scare to guitasunin the gi was a tok t what did you think of that a i thought it was funny a becaus ecaus ir we lir texted her wordle result she got the wordle and three dan there dad was still outside with all the other parents waiting ah and that harber cextod that she got th wordle and four and i told them i asked about the wordle and three i shared with the parents outside the school that mi kids got the wrdle and three or four and they said good work and i share that with i than lyra sent us ah some tweats from kids who were inside the school ah someone cancel school or else i'm a piss all over the cafateria floors that i sent them some photoes of what the outside of the school look thiykiget a sense of how many police cars were there and lyra wrote and my bike was in the fhodo and she made fun of me for biking to the school danceas the weirdest part of this portion of the day was running the two stories in his head same as lyra one story this is nothing we are just waiting the kids will be out soon and the other story ere than a look back on this moment when we thought it was nothing the one rite before all the tragedy but the longer this went on the first story this is nothing had a stronger pull the parents are now some of them have gone home some of them are still there attacing their kids is one guy whos legally partd in font ofthe driveway with his windows open just doing the longest loudest work call is ifon on speaker fonds whowers all listening jes work call about brokerage fees or something we hes tering the work called to be close to the school to be you auted to be close to the school we'v just sat there waiting for something to happen but ill doing this work call ond speaker fon i cannot think of a more perfect illustration of what it is to pretend things are normal and america right now a more twenty twenty two image then a work from home finance guy taking izume call from his car outside what may or may not be a school shooting in his kids high school the incredible peaks of dissassociation the elienation required to proceed with our daily routines while still allowing for the possibility of story number two of tragedy at any moment and then something happened over the loud speaker it was a man who no one knew was on our principle it was not his voice it was just a random di in it said to days thursday feverary tenc twenty twenty two that is it it was a deep man voice being serious and then every one was why why why would they announce that and then my teacher said well that camp he cid upstairs clara heard the announcement to and for her this is when she snapped into storied number two she could feel the other kids in the room do the same thing ten sing up getting ready for something to do something cus i fee every kid tat' some point every high school or thinks about well what would i do if i was in it ea mashoti in i feel its everyonds insin to be a wi'd be brave a i would be kind i would know what to say to keep able cama would know how to escape i would fight off the shooter wetl i te short of res in myself if the shooter comes i probably run away or die had you had that thout before oh yet i think all high schoolars think about it especially mer dong this true all hi schoolers have ha that thought who who am i going to be in a schoolshooting af tis the schoolsion yes i would efenatly say every single american hi schoare i sought about that really i do not have contact with every single american high schooler nor does lira but once she said this i was curious i started asking around an every kid i talk to kids in texas new mexico missery minnesoda michigan the i what a pos a bot into it nic is an east lanting he is a senior this year which means he is had more than a dekade to watch of it eas from school shootings including vidios from last year in oxford michigan which is just a little over an hour away from him and where he heard a student ran at the shooter nix says he is imagined being that gy in his school shooting wor he would help other kids escape and ad a lot a my fors al no we knall the different way se did it alout of the dilldi the past yer i had te ramit wic ot outside a had a door nichael was the first of many kids i talk to with an alarming command of the various means of e gress in their schoolbildings it was that way with michael too outside to troit we have sresi cordor in nex to the bandro is a ed shit door ti can tat inters touit michael told me above the exit door is a drop down celing with a missing til you could get up there he heard a couple years ago the senior stuck a christmas tree up there he is pretty sure there is space you could stack the cubbies get up to the ceiling what sort of ba tiles off and then yelln tops tetr jots on she ed a scape that what if yo needit to and you had thought about this i i thought about it as a possibility ah ha lot it in the back in my mody an migt er if we have to thi sho we do and then last winter a studen threatend to kill his class made during six period nobody knew if he really meant it michael school went into lack down and he ended up in the drum line room exactly where he planned to be ther ban teacher told them to close the door and stay in there michael and about ten other kids sat on the floor it was completely dark sound proof every one was whispering michael had thougt about this moment much and now here it was i told everybody the fon with first tot that soslike if we need tro hhre's a drop down sheelin here is a til open in the escape i call a giskiper now because thi cho thin o the nas bat me stor room witle cows boking you con drunkin ter what was the reaction what a people say i the first a this son be shad was tht a dum itea that is not how michael imagined this moment goings michaell turns out was not the only one with ta plan he was in a room full of kids who had all prepared for this moment a room ful of band kids who knew each other very well michael says every one was exactly themselves alec made jokes conor reminded everyone to be calm and reasonable lucy agreed with conor and said we shoul hear every side and the nay sayr who i will not name who thought everyone is idea was down but offered none of his own ideas nobody was surprise they kept going was constant we should make a wall of cubbies no kno not we should hide inside the drums this went on for a round an hour in tis chings tat slow and hour and fifteen mentes how much is ire to say i the panalog what part of i you had what thoreverybos at each pirson got a chance to talk yet it wis a you ha fot this to talk and then you have to wi torspon drunk to nexportion somebody was actually running time ye who was running the clock comer of course when things got a little tents in this imprompto lord of the flies school shootings planning committee alec started playing pumped up kicks tut the lowest volume possible al do stop it it it gets really bee all the other kids is to that cicks butter one getter wot that is my to thesedo to pa pont ot kick you his the clon of the classit es on frinclis the fact in kid that con shut me did you find at funny i fond e hol maris i mi that du thises cun sher forow michael told me alex had plaed pumped up kicks at other lock downs too iskind of his lock down thing but usually he waits till the end he says that is how it is over you hear that sonclaing as the police escort you at the bilvin most kids will not experience actual school shootings but every year millions of kids will experience something this school lock downs that are not a drill that are a sudden urgent response to a real or received threat lock downs that can go on for hours were teachers lock the doors police are swarming and helacoppders bringin blood just in kase kids react some kids cry some kids make out a forth greater name jude told me he filled his back pack with books and held it to his chest many of the things i heard about kids doing were somehow genarig and deeply individual at twelve year old and burming ham wrote a will that said quot mom i want to give my friend jave on everything i own and that includes the a box and games and controllers i heard about a kid and up state new york who called his parents from the bath room during a lockd down and came out to them he did not wont them to learn he was gay later an the news if he died but the unifying foundation across all these experiences was the feeling of flitflopping between two different stories maybe is nothing but maybe it is not and how quickly the certainty that you are in th ut probably nothing story can crumble with one noise with a text for harper and lyra an virginia it was that announcement an hour in to their lock down the deep man voice on the loud speaker saying to day is february tente two thousand twenty two and di really allge but craze wr that what dis that mean whoh what the holl was that who who the hell was that did anyone recognize that voice o know i didnt reconize that which i thought that it was is that a they noting that cause that is the day we are got to die because i thought oi when they said the date it was coul be to days thursday for gre tent and one student has died i thoght hewre get a finishs it thatli make a whole big thing but they just ad the date 's what yhe they wregann announce deaths on the last finger an announce some something has actually happened because at that point nothing had happened maybe oh the would announce something we we had a school shooter we had a ball we fixed it now you can go we litte she what is the rest of that sentence erest what happened to day wich story are we in and how does thi story and harper and lyra stayed and locke down for round three hours the normal end of school three p m came and went lyra's rehearsal for anny never started eventually police came into the classr with guns comments in tactical gear told everyone to put their hands up nd they wocked in e line out of the building wleader parents suspected that the ladspeaker announcement was actually the police a coller had said he was in the school bathroom with two hossages and a guwn the police that the shooter was out of state and parents heard that that announcement was a tests to see if he was in the building wu'd police here the par system announcement if they got the shooter on the fone they did not there were no hostages there was no shooter not for lyra and harper school not for the locke down in san antonio were audrey the mom had her sons picture ready to show to the police there was just the much more common place experience of a school locked down that had a supposedly happy ending there are the established respected rituals of an american high school experience prom graduation home coming all those times are people come together and share sm sort of collective experience a school locked down is that another kind of school ritual prom et comes with its own traditions and expectations you have imagined what it will be ahead of time who you might be and leader youill look back and say remember when that thing happened you will look back and say of course that person did that a high schooler named jata in new jersey told me that years ago back an first grate they all hid in the closet for a lock down and one kid fell asleep people laughed about that for years another time her freshman year she round a piding in the closet again that was her longas lock down and a student kept asking to go to the bathroom the teacher kept saying now i remember him ping in a water bottle actuallyaers yes he was peing in a hoer wow in front of all tyeu she made him go behind a bookshelf and we had to lake to the fhror of the calser and would not she him embarrassing for that kit i think it was a barishing for all i was because he as jus us oh thes cut all greedly he just there ping and we could catoher him it was jus nor tot a good bolden it was a not good moment that leader after the lock down not a single person mentioned again he never became the kid who peed in h lock down she du says with that one every one just had a sort of what happens in the lock down stays in he lock down attitude about the whole thing she just thinks they all new it could have ben them coming up a middle schooler and a new law throw up side by side what happens when they finally meat that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our programm continues it is his american life i'm conajoffee walld sitting in for ira glass to day kids are at the center of many political debates these days the debate that follows every school shooting about guns and kind of hovers above the lives of actual kids circling but never touching down never really making much of an impact in our next story another adult debate that is superheated rahte now man's directly in the life of one kid our pretucearly speagl has been speny time with a kid named finn an alabama alabama recently passd two laws that focus on the lives of trans kids it is one of many states to do there is been a massive increase in these kinds of bills across the country republican state legislaters have proposed sixty nine new bills to restrict gender affirming treatment fourteen new bathroom bills fifty school restructions called do not say gay bills and a hundred and thirty sports bands meanwhile finn has been growing up nd what' special about this next tory is that you can see how these bills develop alongside his life as he goes from eighth grad to high school and what happens when it enter the picture act to finn raises his hand here is alease a year before the laws found their way into finn's life he was in eighth gred and most eighth greaters he was not carefully tracking bills in the alabamestate legislature his attention was on other things there were funny ou two vidios to watch and unfortunate amounts of mathwen work to do and the problem of which color to die his hair green or purple or blue fins one of those kids who likes to learn without liking school he is taught himself all kinds of things to draw and paint to play guitar he even fish his father's abandoned a luctric piano out of the corner of the music room and somehow taught himself to play oaywayway oge ofinn lives in grove hill alabama a small town roughly two hours south west of montgomery in his small house there are many heart meats there is his mother jody and his father josh his two sisters alison and layla and a noah's ark of animals we have simon caon their brothers and reddy thats three cats we have loba whiches or dog the bony ason has two lizzards speed there is a duck in the back yard that gives of in tens anger vives and a whole bunch of chickens fin decided to rais cause finn loves animals this is just a chickincie that the dut cho only gosh an then you have a one lid cat if that is ready hiredgy when finn was little he says he liked grot hilla la te velt green and fred but as he got older things got more complicated grove hill is conservative christian community a church three times a wee cant of place as his monlikes to say finn felt extremely anxious when he first decided to come out as trans and aith grad this was in the spring of twenty twenty one after he and his class mades re turned from cooved in person learning i do not want it have to tell it and i know people cannot read minds but i do not want explain it i just wanted them to be yea chool that is a year this your name go with it gas it it was still very awkward back thom awkward for a million reasons because the people an aith grat had known him as a girl for as long as they had known him because it is always hard to tell people that you see everyday something that you are not sure they want a year and then of course finn was fourteen and pretty much every conversation you have when your fourteen is awkward but finn this naturally shy kid whose main social gool as to stay under the rate are forced himself on the very first day of in person learning he sas he lingered by his teachers desk after class hung back and i was just hey own i thing i said my name finn now and i see him fronce and shesjus oh it did not seem she was dis gusted her thin seem she wan to do that she she just seeme to more shocked i do not think she is ever encounterday at this point again this is the spring of fins aith great year trince gids were not yet constantly in the headlines and fnn says most of his teachers were open and sweet with him very excepting and understanding and di jert beyor teachers good about using the rit pronounce everything for the most part i i mean it takes any one ar couple minutes pronons are not a small thing for fin when people refer to him with the wrong prornan he says it distressing heu often feels physically ill it is a response that is not uncommon sometime it slake e pain and mint get im sometimes i actually feel i'm going to bou sometimes a just after walkaway naturally make sure i do not but queesiness was not much of a problem in middle school fen remembers telling his friends for the first time that he wanted to go by he thing they threans if anyone must up they would punction i do not sphycically remember but i think that was one in their ractions hein made me laugh and that is the way it went for the rest of the year the teachers were open the kids were on board and it may fin graduated from middle school feeling good comfortable finn's parents joshin jody were incredibly relieve they have lived in grove hill for most of their lives and have a new ants to view of the community all the contradictions that grovhille alabama contains jody told me that though many of their friends seemed completely indifferent to whether finn was trans or not and loved him no matter whad maybe even more people in the community find the experience of her child difficult to understand and even his existence unsettling which brings me to high school this is finns mam jody two days before school actually started he said what am i suppose to you if i have to go to the bath m at school and i i guess say wa s ni eve because it stilldid click i was what you mean i ye have to go the bath room getto the bath e ye wt wit i soy stupid now and he said no which want om i supposed to use it do not want to go to the girls room now there were no laws dictating wherefinn could go to the bathroom not yet anyway when jody talked with the school principle about what finn should do the principal quickly came up with a solution finn could use the single stall bathroom in the teachers lounge this suited him fine and finn says at the beginning of school he was feeling relatively opto mistic and was not as worried with my names er pronounce more than i was finding my wocker in finding the glasses but almost immediately finn encountered push back it started in geometry class teacher was calling roll and i try going up to them while they are doing it they will not call out my ded name im but she told me to sit down and she is called on my name and when she walked up to me i corrected her i tell her that that is not my name and i use a different name and pronounce and she was no i'm not ging to do that i'm goingto go off what is on the paper and what did you say nothing and it was not just the geometry teacher there was pushpect from fins english teacher his science teacher even his history and hobby's teacher she pull me aside and she told me that on she respects kids and she loves kids and all that is why she became a teacher in whatever im she will do the name by ulshe will not do the pronoun because that is not what i believe in i'm not going to do that i'll just not call on you anit is impossible to know the exact wy behind this re sistens i reachedat tofin's teachers the school principle the superintendent's office all either declined to talk to me were didn' respon but it is clear that the national conversachion was changing and growing there were more and more bills direc to to tran's kids wregulating how they playd sports where they went to the bathroom what kind of medical care they coul get access to sometimes forbidding any discussion of transissues in school at all did that influence this response was it simply teacher luck of the draw often knew was that very very unfortunately the feelings of the teachers seemed to be spreading talking to me saying the wrong cronouncs it affected how other people saw saw me but slowly anyway what hou mean slowly intawoy it was more gradually obvious tat people thought i was a girl it was a round desember of his freshmanyere that finn began to think more seriously about medical transession finding a doctor who could profied hormon blockers an eventually testossed her own finn thought it might help people to see him the right way very insecure boon't how hi my voice can go oh was if i was able to accessess a and probly helwhen finn talked to jody about getting treatment hormon blockers in testosse her own she told him she was open to the idea but needed to make sure it was safe first she said she would research it finn ploughed forward played him beyond suffered threugh geometry and also became increasingly distress worried that his teachers would continue to misgender him that the kids at school would continue to question whether he was truly aboy that it would all just keep on getting worse and then one day in geometry finn had a breaking point she either and name to me miss gendered me one of the other in front of the glass and and she bessed out a testpaper and o my papers i usually write fin he him just a little reminder no and i did that after writing that i wrote it it was

of the teac her did not use the right pronounce he just could not think of another way to communicate his distress the problem of suicide is incredibly serious among trans kids a recent study showd that in twenty twenty roughly one in two trans u seriously considers suicide that when parents and schools are accepting the rate of actual soaside attempts falls dramatically finn's bomjody did talk to the teacher about this not and she says that she walked away from the conversation feeling at least a little bit better she told me she could see the teacher cared for fin but felt using his riht name in pronouncs was against her religion she was not at all a brace of with me she did not tense when i brought anything up om she actually she cried when i started explaining om things a paywle this is what you did that this is how it is made him feel and she was just al myconis im sorry i never that was not my intention that was fnn before the bills passe fragile struggling to settle into high school and get through his day and then the law makers in mongomery stepped into finn's life well wed mist we we wen maer resais tes es lal reys lot ans e mars e wi y ot o all an at bargaret tather ratin this is allabema state representative west allen one of the republicans responsered the bills talking to reporters in the press room of the state capital on april seventh of this year immediately after the bills pass the first bill ach bese three twenty two was a bathroom bill and for finn would mean he would have to use the girls rest room not his single stall in the teachers lounge the second bill asked b oneighty fore made it a fellany to provide any miner in the state with gender afirming medical care meaning finn would not have access to the hormones that could help him with his voice as representative allen explains he and his colleagues believe the teanatures are two young for this kind of treatment or r ter minds wer not l bill mas sus always mgations sorders mis we gills bot to sermont rowas to be clear the american medical association the american association of beatrics the american college of physicians the whole bunch of groums all say kids should have access to gender affirming medical care and opposed legislation this i went to visit finn and judy an may shortly after the bills passed but before jody had had a chance to sit down in tellphin about them she told me she held off when she first heard because the fit of the medical bill was immediately thrown into question by a court challenge and she did not wanto disturbed finn unless it turned out to be absolutely necessary but then the first night i was there finn jodye and i were sitting around talking and the subject of the legislation came up and suddenly we found ourselves inside the conversation that jody had been tolay the conversation where she explained to finn that a bathroom bill had passed and would become official law over the summer brag when finn started tenth great in the fall he might be forced to use the girl's bathroom the bathroom bill yo know that is supposed to go an to effect on july first this year which means if nothing happens in theireis not anything to come up and stop it at the start of this school year that is an effect would you mean as soon as fnn heard about the bathroom bill his face trained of color and you could see tears in his eyes a hatyby of sat i we are o that with you jode told finn she knew this was not the news that he wanted to hear but she felt he needed to understand now that there could be a different arrangement on the falls she said she had talked to the school principle ho en the past had been incredibly helpful and kind to jody and finn even he was look we do not know what is can happen we do not know we are all in a try on toa hole now hope that things go the way n we want them tou and if things do not go the way thit you deserve them to go as a human ben we will go from there in regrouw jodie started talking through some of the grouping uptions but finn just sat silent saying nothing then one of the many animals who live in the house appeared in the doorway your it was finn's personal cast signent it simon immediately knows yeoutsit because he is racing right uler what a baby we ca of fare out all is not lost he can always bi me bible of ter waccam was a i need t yo can wa couple of weeks after this conversation school let out and i did not see or talkd to finn and jody until august right before thestart of the school year jodie told me that finn had had a good summer he is in his first long term relationship with he sixteen year old who lives one town over they spen a lot of time together they watched you too whent rullersgating nd of course spent countless hours playfully insulting each other in that way that tea naturs always to also over the summer the bathroom bill that distressed finn quietly became lall jodie told me that a couple o days before my visit she would reached out to the school principle to see if they would keed finn's accommodation and was eventually told that finn would have access to the bathroom but only finn and only as long as no other kidin school came out were complained in any way for whatever reason finn had been grandfathere inn but the door was closed behind him jde said finn was deeply discouraged by the arrangemenn and that after he would found out he would taken a nosdive in terms of mood he was sure the bathroom would be taken away and that beuble would be even worse about using the reaht pronounds jodie said he started talking unmost relentlessly about dropping out it was not just the laws she said but after the difficulty of the previous year this extra piece of weight felt to him it quote sealed his fate it is true that the thin i found when i returned to grovhill felt a different kid he seemed much smaller than before emotionally even physically and you could tell him the way that he was talking that he was in that kind of pain that bubbles out into the open even when you do not want it to for exemple towards the start of our conversation i asked what i thought would be a fun warm up question i'd been privately wondering how would i begin this story what was the right way to introduce this kid to people you i asked fin to decide for himself oke if you could choose how would the story of you start u just ta kidter and be happy do you why do you look lik here about to cry is your you seen it as te is it about going back to school meo t we talked about the bathroom work around how precarious it was i was glad that they sto kept the bathroom for me but i also think it stupid that if any one else once to fiel comf at school and a bathroom since i cannot fince lucion if the bathrum got taken away is what a lot of people do in the situation baftheroms takin away from me o just just not he smastim at school all day just moi drinks i ges breakfast cause i really do not be bethrm i much anyways at school in the weeks before thi story was scatral to eir i called around to some of the lawyers and caregivers in alabema who monitor trancs kids to find out what they were seeing and the reports i got backward pretty grim one lawyer told me that she was getting reports that even the kids who always loved school were suddenly resistent to going and there were serious concerns that there would be increased incidents of self harm in a way despite how difficult this has been for him finnes kind of the best case in ario he has parents who unconditionally support him ho then howare you doing it is been long how are you it a a few days ago i spoke with hin for the first time since i visited in augas and faund out that he was doing surprisingly well i'm how are the teachers treating you far this year eace fince had all his teachers were being respectful about pronouns and namestuff this year and thother 'd been a couple of incidents including a pretty serious fist fight he was holding on for sure no one had come forward to complained about the bathroom and now other kids had come out fin found himself preoccupied with less exictential problems age cge i olly a a i c g you got all asin your report curd congratulations han wao ti a t then told me he does not think about the laws every day but when he does they make him mad a col aa epl si tdo c ol a o do wit a i a thin and his family are doing what they can to a dab and they did have a small victory recently tbe cause of a different law one that is been on the books for ever it lets anyone change their name to whatever they want then an joty got the paper work done over the summer and a few weeks ago a new social security cart arrived in the mal in the eyes of the law fin is now sens official name no tea cher o legislator can say anything different still the laws passed earlier this year hover in the eiras ven goes about his day from his perspective they do not protect him they just creat obstacles they have made the jop of being thin more difficult the least beagal is one of the producers of our shell fone more thing before we closhis sero bar down iso an article recently as as working on this episode from enbysynews nd a weirdly connects the two stories into day show in a way i did not see coming it is an investigation into a popular conspiracy theory maybe you have heard it it is that schools all across the country are offering litter boxes tho kids who identify as cats tif you had not hard this one sorry this is all over social media the story is kids are tellig their schools their cats and schools are commodating them bhy providing litter boxes at least twenty republican politicians have repeated that this is happening that thisis cuo a growing crisis that schools are just allowing kids to identify as whatever they want this gender identity stuff has gone too far and there are kids who are only communicating in quo barks and hisses and it is gotten extreme that school children are now using litter boxes that is the rumor enbysynews looked into this they investigated each one of these claims and tried to find schools where this is actually happening they reached out to every school rumored to have a litter box over twenty places and they found one a whole school district in colorado they had kitty litter but they were not keeping it because kids were identifying as animals no kids were identifying as animals the district jefferson county school district is home to columbine high school schools in the jefferson district have cat litter in case they have to go into lockdown during a school shooting the litter is part of their over all plan if there is an active shooter situation they have litter and buckets kids have somewhere to pe somewhart that is not in a bottle in a closet they have kept cat litter on hand for years along with kandy for diabetic students a map of the school flashligts wet wits and first eght items the litter boxes are about school shootings i don' on' kno i just keep thinking about the hours we have spent talking about kitty litter and the money that when into making this non issue a series of talking points on top of other non issues that also became talking points about where kids p in school when in america we do not have a problem of kidseing their cats and being provided with litter boxes what we have are adults who have accepted that school shootings will continue to happen and they are preparing what we have which kids will tell you is an actual problem actual threats actual fear actual trama actual debts our programm was prettyshape by naddya raymon and edited by laurast ar casty vallery kipnes produced the prologue of the episode the people who put together to dayshow

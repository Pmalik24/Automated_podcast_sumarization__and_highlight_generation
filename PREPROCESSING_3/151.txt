a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in todays episode of the shou if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our websiht this american life dot o work cant er and her husband and ther two kads move back to boston and it was not going grate for her she is a teacher but had't ben a teaching job yet she did od chops ittle thing ot the john of kennedy presidential library she work is not asher for the boston sad ny orchestra which can i say these knowling the kind of boston specific jobs you would give a character who moved to boston in a bad movin the only thing i was not doing is selling foam finges at fenway pack and i made very little money she is actoul pretty depressed just dragging herself through the motions of living bogging forward to anything and i woen go away shou could not shake it i would wake up in the morning and feel sort of irritated o this again i went to work and i would put a smile on my face but i often times would not hear anything any one said to me she forement into this new downer of life and she gets off work ands april on the first bright sunny days after a long dark winter she ecited to take her dog skyler to wallston beech near her house on this pretty day walston's good for a dog she says cause she big catom maniac and this speech is perfect because really no one was out on we started walking i let her awflysh because she really wanted to splash around and she was just frolicking and i saw her moving closer to the water and i realized my feet were starting to sink we wuld what you mean sink sure my one foot started to really sink and then i was attempting to pull that foot out and then my other foot started to sink and i realized i was not hitting a hard bottom there was no one to cannot call or cry and it was really happening fast i was really sinking quite fast and i should note ira i'm not a tall woman i'm a forfoot tand womand for me the start sinking i was i was practically up to my thizes in this muddy sandy watery mixture very quickly very quickly how gueg i would say maybe the whole gravitational pull down into the sand was thirty seconds it could have been three minutes for all i know because time just slow down as she struggled the anker feet up she realized t mud and sand and waterformed a kind of seal round her boot holding it down making a too heavy to lift and s carry right she thoght to herself am i about break of bone pulling my wag out my traped imi just come to keep sinking i had no idea what to be afraid of i just know that i was very afraid did you think that you could sink all the way underand just go all the way down oh yes that is that is one hundred per cent where i thought i was headed quicksand she thought i'm ein quicksand in massachusetts and tasis intsting padly nyouf i yourself sinking in quicksand not on a tropical island or jungle not when you are pooking round some ancient ruins rating tlosstumes of dead paro as in an old movy but whan it happens just the ten minute drive from your own house on a beach and quinsy massachusetts nine minutes from one dona done its in eaptments from another the thought that inevitably goes through your head in that situation is seriously i said this is bulshet this is new england you are telling me that quicksand that something out of princess bride what is it doing at walliston beach and why are not there sins to warn me about this yer this a bit thof john malany does the committee jonmalane that when when i saw i felt he was saying out loud something that i have always felt he said that base on what he saw on t v is a ked he thought quicksand was going to be a much bigger part of his adolthood than it actually turned out to be because if you ouht tar tones quicksand is the third biggest thing you have to worry about ab it e i real sticks of din abit and jiand aund gills falling on you from the sky o o o a t olev i never step in quicksand a never even heard about it i also was thinking about john milaney you knew that thit oh john milaney is he is on heavy rotation with my kids and me and i remember thinking eat your hard out john milany if you could see me now howho who o wh n lookus here she was first up to yn ankles than her knees nout to her thies and still sinkin herselfan was in the car the beach was deserted except her dog was ropping round happily got ammityit no one save her or hew out and then the thing happened and she says she somebody who usually has a hard time expressing it when she is angry she' some ofy cries rather yells but now is we have you were rage shot through her rage and outrage just orruptin i was pis what i cannot frenking believe this is how my days going to go kick me while i'm down i was oh how no you are nock in a roin my day sand i i have fought for this lovely spring day i am not going down and with a burst of hoke fury she moves into action she is quicksand no problem i would embrace the ridiculous awfulness of the situation and i will make something happen right now d she starts squirming around this way and that i started to leaned backwards and at that point when i leaned back an i was still sinking but i was hoping that i could sort of just wiggle out of my boots and at my boots would be the sort of sacrificial land that i woald just leavein the sand but i realize if i just leaned back and kind of shimmy a drunk person getting on to a bar stool pi could lift my legs out of the sand little by little by little on et only sort of impediment was that myke dog was looking at me this is a fon gane i just do not know how to play she was just kind of darting around me watching me move this then i was getting really really frustrated with her as well o tae she led her way out of solo ground at that poin she says she is completely covered in sand what sanding her hair oliver clothes she collicts her do g clibes in a car drives hom ceens up a week or two passes nd then one morning s wakes up on realizes she vills oka i remember clearly sitting in bed and saying to my husband oh my goodness i i think im good i was filled with this content feeling that i can only describe as they depressin fating i did not feel any of the heaviness and i could only trace it is disappearance to the quicksand candour thinks it has something to do with the anger she camped intointo a stuck in the same e somebody ho cannot always expresser anger she thinks lettng herself get furious for once and flip something in hir that is the moment she was able embrace just how bad things have gotten and fight away out to tda an o programm we have other storie of people put in difficult sometimes impossible situations nd the only way out to pwut the arms around the badness feel it for what it is and then figure outs some moves to wrestle the problem to the ground whatever be easy chicago it is this american live i maraglas stay with us y clin helling marry pass it is the most the magical week in american politics right now yes it is i'm speaking to you right now during the eight days betwen the i caucas and the new hampshire primary the reat works the results and iar reset the political scores and possibilities redeal all the cards and this week that we are in right now can be an enchanted eight days wer under dogs tell themselves that anything is possible anything can happen no matter how unlikely it is to in fact happen and t o witnesses in person one of our producer we chase went to new hampshire this week to hang out with two people to old friends hof chosen to embrace hope in the face of long and difficult ods they know very well the domall trump will probably be the republican nomeny for president and they are not hopy about it is got to democrats but the are embracing the likelihod of donal trumps rise with a giant bear hug and they are trying to do something about it and they are making a last stand to try to stop him this very weak abasily what the trying to do is there trying to convince new hampshire voters tho get real about their options in this historic moment and vote nober the actually want to be president but vote for the only person these guys believe can stop donal trump from becoming te republican nominy and that person is nicky haily that iswright is two democrats are stumping day and night to elect a woman who stands for many things they personally hate he caught up with them one day before this enchanted week began that is a day before the i caucas these guys are not even from new hampshire their policy wanks from at of state outside agitators ones from d c and the others from new york they both work for du goodery international interest tipe places they prefer not to name on the radio robert schwartzs has been living in new hampshire for three months he took a leave from his job left his family moved up here with his good friend canny can sheffler fruns from carige an met up with them at a brury inkeen new hampshire and theyare here this particular afternoon because the politicion is on stage some one running in the democratic primary which is happening even though jo bide in decide to skip new hampshire this yeare the guyon stage congressmendin philips is making a random run for the presidency but robert and can are not paying attention to deem philips theyare here for the forty or fifty voters in the room robert is sort of irrepres sible says all his thoughts as he has them kind of thing and starts whispering to me as soon as they get there ye i at is alol the people years ers wting dars a lottle wer avis ily maya oae notance ceas to began just talk to them cause e erin an is is a bot of people teers an the wer vosiers i the way it works on hampshire independent voters can vote

plausible all these people who probably would avoted for biding are free agents robert in canter here pick off some of those people democratic leaning independent voters you might be willing to vote for nicky haly as a way to stop trum o all i soon as te tan stroper o at torins an voter he does not know anything about what who some one all bundled up in a blue park o to see if he can convince her

voter leans to the left you think you' make his pitch but he is learned this kind of voter does not it when you open with a hard cell on nicky haly cause they do not maki haly and he does not haley

doa er tro e ne ti o yeuli i tha tha s a tvery long hunter circling around some pray to kill and you are not sure if he took a shot or not but he thinks this is the best way to talk about micke haly he has this cautious reproach partially because of this thing people keep saing around yure all the time you hampshire voters have to make up their own mind do not pressure me can be hard to tell how he is actually doing with this crowd even though this woman says the most important thing to her is to stop trunk but you still do not know what the ri ha this that is right o o y y pit is i pit wu wee no potry feels that way we just al nol i i ich an a i com for marolne and at its cir tesision not mine bi i pis would be if you want a stop trump we got aboutin wu gat weven av ats for somebody don' l no and with that the voter has to go t we move on this strategy getting people to hate vote for nicky haily there is a word some people used for this kind of thing a technical term of politics for sneaking round and doing dirty tricks inside the other party's election here is can cellin tated that this is the must agonize tha lucking operatian about that i fan hem at that tim ey ae ta you that yi a but wdo not see ourselfs satisfat a w it you feel i oemen ni i believe it was a compliment yes ye it is we om ian this whole quest of robet in kens began one night last summer they met up in decee and got onto the subject of how they think trump is an excistential threat to democracy can we get off the road to autocracy and can was wou know you have done stuff in the past til i help other countries in this situation maybe we should actually do something can i think givin his can of consulting baconas let us do a brainsterm and this is how you do a rans toa rather tik rothes i yeell cn i tell her about your other idea that we can can has some really good ideas and som not really good ideas and the other idea he tried to pitch me on that we can was thit the national foputig is too dangerous and we need to have is last half of emac as fin we have we have let us let us create a seven on seven football the that is more sake and and robert told him thot was ridiculous t an there is the sort of person can is and then he pulls out a powerpoit soi yes lik a defer yet i ev fortfolly and as that as this is giving me serious doubts that we should proceed along this fret but he still actually believe the sege yei et anyway after they got this idea for defeeting trump they went out and raised money and they say they raised twenty thousand dollars on their own nd then they got this big chunk of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars from donters who wishd to remain anonymous and that is real money that could haveit in pact on small but mighty election this one with that money they bought targeted voter lists of undeclared left leaning voters that they regularly message and send nailers out to mailers and messages that can is got in focus crup and tested with professionals they got a lucky brak when nicky haily started to poll within ten points of donald trump in new hampshire and writ it this moment going to the iof a cawkas their hope is sou'd come an seck in an ila thot woud giveher the momentum to win new hampshire outright beat trump wich would make her credible in south carolina and beyond that they even hired two people in south carolina in case they have a shop there we always saw this is hirest ci reward thi if yeu at the pulls it has always looked trump will win denomination but if there is a five per cent chance of stopping apotential dictater thit it is worth putting a lat thafit into that yeve for that five per cent chance tit haily shocks trump here and there is an alternative in the republic it is worth it for our democracy robert is really emotionally invested in this idea that mabe they these two college friends could actually do some thing to stop donal trump he is intense about his work always get's overly invested it seems at his day job he was waking up having panic attacks about that work on top of this worki was is this work helping now this is not extremely healthy either am i tied myself into my career and then rather than seek balance and view myself as a father in a brother in a son and instead of that i have now identified myself as a part of this mission and i'm wrapped up in that in my whole self worth is going to be determined january twenty third and that is not healthy at all i'm really worried from a ment from a mental health in all that perspective of what happens after january twenty third or what happens after the election in november at some point there is going to be a reckoning and i'm really afraid of that to be ois robert's not alone of course hey're not the only anty trump group tren sway undecleared voters tad the're not big players but the real players still they can go from sophisticated to bumbling very quickly he we found ourselves screeching around manchester and a car on away to an analcayday celebration late as usual they were glommbing on to some one else's a van hoping to meet people who know more people who might carry their message out to other new hampshurings the volunteered to bring the coffee in the drinks your friend we sess was supposed to do it lut he is stuck it you p s printing up fliers with the cuar cod the event has already started roberts freaking out a we are right we are ri ot we are right by there to workin astop there you get to the you get to the event and do damage control pleace there upset with us yes to the event but robert thinks of himself is responsible and when he is not seen that way it kills him cause we are ging to be five minutes ten minutes late to an e al ce of it senberisying in something has your shamespirol samsfiles not in a good place ri now when they get there robert jumps out with three boxes of coffees two huge bags of creamers he is running around in the fold cannot even find the door we a a at how to getin the creeking building why do not they asin thank you one tho the fo did he not pick up just really fose when is there end it is apologies in taping their cuar cod fliers on to duncan donat's boxes and robert works the line on people tabling for various social justice he causes mostly white active is you hampsure is mostly white can in robert ar wite and i get to witness just how tired people are of dis cona pitch this is the third any body but trump election ye known y mean he talks wit deb opera males he is lack trump is not sophisticated enog to hide itis white supprimis write in ecahaleas mar sophisticated at it et she is more and ting is shes a brown woman right lifting up white ofpprimasy she is she is she is just a most sitisticated trom well but she also condemned she said january six was a terrible day riht she does not call eur military better an succors and losers she has which she launch a co against our country wutd she would harden trom well would you rather would you rather part would you rather vote for the criminal or the one who pardons the criminali would got propare not to go e et will to you riht i get that but then but then who who are you only have one vote in the primaries and the question is where can you yes you prefer not devote for either but then but then are you just thrywing away your vote and letting trump win i saw this move a few time is from robert talking about people's vote it was a commodity whae just a piece of curency that you could spend at this store or that store and you seeded to squeeze the most value out of it that you could that is a hard sellin new hampshire and has not always seem tuned in to how people magt e thinking about their vote is theirs something between a personal statement and a moral obligation and at heres heres o gop wit what you are sayig to y is throwing away my vot yes ay is that nicky haly as yet really to a dress any blo is she has not gone another way all heis try wind the rasism question came up in a very actually simpl question to answer she ran he get on morable to give a horrible answer noshalan my fot is sacred am i going to spend it on her no well there is one person who will tell you what their noin or what their mat doing e i wer carcases wer that night monday we watched arley returns in a bar again robert was really rooting for nicky hailey to come in second after trump turn the primaries into a two person race that is not what happen she came in third just behind to santis and well behindshrump it is a huge set back and roberts upset things feel their starting to slip away and he spends the rest of the night scrolling and ingrily tweeting the next day they have to regrut the text message s tea been planning to send to the eighty thousand voters their tarketing built around nicky halysoing better an iylas wo know now they have to reframe things to make iylass seem less important a can suggests a stock photo o aguy scratching his head with the words does any one actually know what a cawcas is new hampshire picks presidente absencis robert points out that he is butchering a famous new hampshire saying and the're both stressed out lote here is how that conversation goes down the line that everyone here recognizes the political line that shows were plugged into new hampshire is that line i would pick corn in hampshire picks presidence that is the liseis ampther picks presidente yea youexchanging i ways carcas who is ever heard of a caucas tas it is not a goo line i'm sorry i do not itis y it is o i's the famous line as johnson in his line ere's a history of it people recognize it we yes esha her yesso is tention goting i the lone is anyw hamsher othery ones i understand how the leads ar viewing this i'm telling you that is the line the people know they do not one to say what is a cacas give me credit for being here for three months in talking that every freeking person that i can that is the line that but that is the line o cam tost saying the first thing that ui said at the meeting to day was that line robert wins out they go with the famous lines and a photo of a cornfield that robert insisted is provocative he told gan that is why i one i have the cornfields but you do not want to have that it is edgy it is insulting ti was inn and at my last voters o new hampshire later that day robert brought me to meet this couple in a lovely house on a snowy street in mampchester he want to run the cornfield tex messages by george bruno for mher democratic harty chair again george had volunteered to be a public champion of robert's cause and robert had managed to convince this aurgust new hampshire and to publicly change his party registration from democrat to undeclared oonly problem was george still had not decided if hell actually do the thing robert was asking wtvote for nicky haily i' undersided but i could even er ioihover gra oe si i've been workin out im for ia e come more clear as we gul closer to for youre twenty third no january twenty third do not mis you goni e i found this to be an ominous tale for robert's quicksotic omission if george bruno this advocate for robert's cause could not even commit to doing the thing crossing parties voting to save america the republican primary but then robert turned to george's wife rona who been in the kitchen while we been talking roffern tea and reading the new york times she changed her party registration to undeclared tos robert asked her what she was thinking she said she would never vote for some one who did not believe in reproductive rights robert said even though trump killed off roverse's weit she said will that is a good point actually no my original aftent and crossing over was to a sure that trump would not become present in a very mer and dear to a my values is the ability for women to control their own bodies in the reproductive rites a it would be hard for me to cast to vote for somebody who might not respect that on the other hand the most important thing is to assure that he is not the candidate tit is nat present you are still soin might have been i might have to compromise would you vote for nikaily she is the one that according to the poles looks the most likely to be trump right am recently i read some of her stances and she was really wuffling on reproductive rices scared me a on the other hand i did this primarily to defeat trump if it meand voting for her i might do it you have le wortime to daas is sall tured out iti just because it is such an uncomfortable thought but i wanted to feat trump and if it takes floting for nickihally to do that i think i might do that i think she miy really do it when i left new hampshire it was half way through america's magical eihty period between i was caukases and neuw hampturous primaries robert seemed to swing from happily cherry picking poles that told him what he wanted to hear to despair and real fear that they had no chance and trump could not be stopped by any one he told me he woke up crying on thursday morning this might all be over in a few days he said the alama the project was a long shot from the start they did their best and now since trumps overwhelming when and i wa it gone way longshot here was it worth it if trump wins by fifteen or twenty points i will view everything we have done as a failure and an i will consider myself a failure and i know that is not likele'r doing everything we can and it is not and i need to be this they tell you you have to be nicer to yourself and tell speak to you a friend might speak to you and a friend would say nice try good job way to go away to fight for it anyway but i will look it li i made all these sacrifices on this gamble and if the gamble turned out to be a wrong gamble and our c ntryes not up to stopping trul then i made that i made him hugenis calculation that is robert's anxiety here is cas you feel this is a rerend to mind yourself too tol now i just really on a tonton o is o there is three hundred forty three thousand one hundred ninety two undeclared voters in new hampshire robert ing can had just a few more days left to catch some of that tell them to vote against everything they care about and hold back for just a little longer what appears to be the nampable course of his tre he caseis oproduceecoming out a baby get's in trouble with the law that is in a minute gogabubagradio when our program continues to smark knife my or glass to day show embraced the suck parently that phrase us started in the military and then moved into more general use meaning you should just own how bad it is but your arms around it hold a close to you that is the only way you are goig to get through it to day we have stories of people doing exactly that we have arrived at at two of our programm a too the dream police 's argaening baby d go to sleep everody knows hat an different parents get through a different ways now longo one of our producers i xtreese conterasa an his white emma war struggling with this with hi son weroy at one and half years old a leroy could us sayf your words and he was actually able to hold an umbrella and crudally pull off a few of gene celys moves from singing in the rain while it played i seeme vi youere this he was not great but he was amazing for somebody under two feet tall wearing a diper tht to say for all that accomplishment lery was still not on a proper sleep schidral untill his parents embraced the awfulness of the situation they were in and invented something here is i leroy is the loudest gy i know i'm pretty soft spoken he did not get that from me whone thing he did get we both really prefer to be awake but leroy takes it a little too far when he was about one i tried to put him down for a nap inis crib he had bags under his eyes his eyelids were heavy and his head was doing that thing where it falls and snaps back then i saw him slap himself in the face to stay awake a long hall trucker fresh out of five hour energy and it is not just that he would fight sleep when he did go to sleep sometimes he would wake up in absolute terror but he needs to go to sleep we all must in we tried everything at five months we tried sleep training we did not take at one year his soon to be dake cure provider suggested the cryit out method which depending on what that apparent you are is either the most deficient way to sleep train or the most barbaric when they cry it is you re job not to comfort them do not go in even if it sounds really bad which it did we were a few weeks into this hallish ritual until one summer day lero was looking sleepy and it was time to attempt the one p m tap i carried him to his room drew the curtains turned on the lollibis gave him a fresh dipe or lowered him into his crib love you leroy see you after your nap and closed the door the crying started immediately and i turned on the timer for the next forty minutes em and i were clenched and approaching the upper threshold of our tolerance whench he asked can i pick him up yes please she went into his room and then i heard our door bell i went to answer and on the other side r too and why peaty officers e man and a woman the woman asked is that your baby crying yes were responding to a child in dangerment call my mind was slowly grasping what was happening leeroy the loudest guy i know hade been screaming much that a neighbor clled the copse on us they thought we were abusing leroy we need to do a child wellfare check they said i knew these checks can turn into investigations if you are poor it can ascolate fasted andeven if you are not it can be terrifying does leeroy have a scratch or bruseright now are there piles of laundry lying around my a drendle in his pumping and the voice in my head is telling me to say fock you slamd the door and run with leroy out the back but do not listen to that voice we do not have a back door i studied myself you really do not need to do that my wife she is feeding him right now he is busy the male officer countered either we go into his room or you bring him to us we will not leave until we complete a visual inspection o i went to leroy's room and told them a the cops are here they need to see leroy but i'm breath feeding i told them that she brought leroy to the door the woman officer asked are you making all that noise leroy was calm in emma's arms ima said sleep training 's hard the woman officer nodded she gave him a little hasf baby wave and in a sweet voice said o you need to go to sleep before they went i asked e just out of curiosity can you tell me which neighbor called yugies no oh bok i i mak uns i started to hate all the neighbours who lived within ear shot and did not make y contact resly training experiment was over we were back to laying on the floor next to his crib and trying to tiptoe out of his room when the coast was clear often it was not one night leroy pass the point to no return crying whether i was there or not and i got scared that the neighbour might called the copse again then i heard a police iron going past our apartment i thought i can work with this did you hear that leroy stopped crying and listened the policeman he is driving by to check if you are going to sleep and you are crying loud he can hear you leeroy asked what will he do now there are moments in life that feel they define what kind ofparent you are would i be the kind of morally banker apparent that scares my child to sleep i looked sweetleroy in his big beautiful brown eyes and told him if the cops come back they will take us away in different cars he curled up under his blanket and closed his eyes tight i left the room shut the door behind me held my breath and waited silence incredible it worked and oh got what if i dot i reported the news to emma oh know she said he must be scared do you think i should go tell him they are not coming i do not know ok e well but's never talk about this again the next night lery asked about the policeman is he coming back i said yes and leroy went to sleep emma i did it again please do not tell me that do you want me to stop i do not know i said well now you are complicit this became our new routine warm bath cold milk emma would virtuosically perform all the voices in a stack of books then i would take leroy to bed in threatend state violence and we would all go to sleep after a while it stopped working he got whise that the police were not actually coming to our apartment every night and he started crying again when i would leave now i think it was shakespeare who once wrote and i'm paraphrasing here when you find yourself half way in a river of blood either way you go he got go through half a river of blood i forged tohead one night when leros crying i closed the door behind me took a deep breath and bangd down his bedroom door it is the police go to sleep just cancel me now and yet it worked we were living in an imaginary police state for what i'm sure child psychologists would agree was too long then one night lery asked me a question i did not see coming will the policeman take my nightmares away take his nightmares away not him somehow in leroy's cool weird mind he figured out that if the policeman was scary he could also sceare whatever was haunting his dreams i was stunned of course i said he will take your nightmares he will put them in the back of his squad car and take them to jail lery had takein his fear and morfed it into something that could protect him i tried to teach leroy out to sleep and pass along a healthy fear of the police he learned neither ler is three now our bed time routine is less violent i lay down next to him in his big id bed until he is asleep the plan is to do this until he turn say tm what are we doin i a o tesit a sounds easy he just goingin il you fgeverd then give the hungliness oder i street kindoraga as pretyturn i shall

printers brokensee ourtees starios ets couches mattresses chairs sheets lancs amountain of material with no three line we started with the home office it overlooked a dumpster in the driveway he threw stuff out the window a girl from germany helped me to fenistrat she was a high schooler who through some sort of exchanged programe in turned at the churc i asked her what sort of responsibilities a church in turn had and she either did not understand the question or trise t ignor it and i did not press the issue the hard part was the furniture bryan and i tackled the heavy stuff the drawers and dressers and cabinecs the dumster was overflowing we had to break down the furniture before lifting it up and tipping it in i felt a child satisfaction turning the detritus of the strangers life into ever smaller bits of torn wood and pop nails towards the end of the day bryan and i move two red wood bookshelves on to the lawn we turn out the books beforehand he brought hammers instructions for maching your redlood bookshelf on a dead woman's lawn one stand back hold the hammer at your head to move foreward an a moderate speed esomewhere between walking and running three make a sleeping motion with your arm lifing the hammer directly alove your head four in pact rekat steps one you forin thill complet ignore ta church in curn looking at you at the end of the summer i lost my best frend lost is not the right word to use as it implies passivity in my part broke up is closer except that seems to only apply to romantic relationships pushed away my best friend rejected her something that i spent the summer biking to her partment down town i told her about the chain smoker and the dead woman and the weird scent of loneliness in their houses we cook dinner played board games watchd movies we did the things we always did except now i did not wanted dozon i told her that e did not spending time with her that i did not er that i did not want to be your frien that it was not her fault but mine that i did not understand it either that i continued doing the things i did cause i did not know what else to do that therefore i should stop and therefore we should stopping friends it struck me even then as a pretty shitty explanation lush this came out in conversation we had walking back to the house i was living an my big going as i felt a twist in my chest was hiding a terrible secret except when i revealed it my heart twisted tider a few days later she sent me nine hundred eighty eight word facebook message an exerpt o wich read things are bad can you just ask for break instead of thing i do not want to be friends any more and if you actually do not want to trying you more and youre certain you want to let us go then you can decide to break up but it is literally the most hurtful thing you can do when you do that only do it when you really truly decided that you want to let me go and i will let go which does not mean thati'll stop loving you or caring about you or praying for you but in the end oll ger to be oquet with not having you be apart of my life you are more important than this relationship i sent her twoward response hoke sor tefore the school yer started i saw her one more time she told me that he did not mean what i was doing that self loothing was warping my thinking that pushing her away seem the right thing to do now but when sove anything in retrospect is my last chance she folded the piece of paper into a five pointed star she been in a church roul tree the previous week end an told me an illustration she heard about queer youths who come out in the church when they start out they have their family friends classmates acquaintances in the church she pointed to a stars point foreach category when they come out in a conservative christian setting they usually lose their family first she said ripping off the piece of the star she went through every category tearing the star part piece by piece until all that was left was a jagged pencigon i do not remember if i said anything i laughed and in seer for year let me tell you the point these days the braks on my bike do not word i scraitmy ft against the

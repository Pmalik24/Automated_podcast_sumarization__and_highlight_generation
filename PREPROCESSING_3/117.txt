burning man gets it by biblical flooding and we examine the cultural fall out the poles get uglier for jobidon and eulon muscoes up against the anti defimationly i mentur of this is the enchguro sho the benchpirishresponserba xpress ve pien protect your almine privcy to day expressly pianticom lashmen it is rare to see actual biblical level evens taking place in normal everyday life but that is exactly apparently wht is happening over at burning man now i've ignored burning man successfully for several decades of this point because frankly it simen comunch a weirdos aut in the desert being weird with each other im and that is pretty much what it is apparently for those who have not been following burning man was found it back in nineteen eighty six is according to the richest tacom when a small group of friends gathered to burn a nine foottall statue on the beach in san francisco as youmght imagine no weird people each year mormore people attended the mon fire and then they actually moved it over to the nevata desert and to now it is held in black rock city a temporary community erected by the thousands f attendies who construct the gatherings infrstructure news it using nothing but their own tools and equipment nothing apparenl is sold that burning man iis one of the ser communistic properties of it instead they they sell i coffee and water and everything else they barter or gift first of all you have to ask why their selling the colf your water the answer s because you cannot provide supply unless there is actual monitary demand it turns out capitalism is great at getting things from place a to place be for an affortable price and communism sucks at pretty much everything for many at tendes known as burners the events is about providing a space for counter cultural expression as were loing to examine however one of the weird elements of the united states th the counter culture is no longer a counter culture it is just the culture in the counter culture in the nineteen sixties the weirdos from the nineteen eighties whoare gathering on beaches and building giant burning men and all the rest of tus those people we all used to consider strange now if you say that they are weirdos ho are participating in weird paganistic behavior you are considered strange youre consetered part of the problem youare in tolerant the counter culture is no longer the counter culture it is in fact just the culture which is why for example you see many rich and famous people now going to burning man it used to be that if you are rich famous person you took yourself seriously enough that did not show up in te middle of the desert with nothing but a hammer and then expect to basically jus go t the orgy doma all day it used to be that the serious people in our culture were actual serious people in our culture they go way back to the age of the ticoons when you are looking at john rockofeller and you are looking at banderbill these were people we are at least pretty serious about their own lives but the reality is the counter culture has now become the culture and the way that you win cultural cashe is by participating in a paganistic set of values that actually is in complete conteradistinction to the actual values you live out is a point that that charles murray mad in his great book coming apart which is that all of the teck billionaires who show up at burning man and then proclaim hat they have allegiance to thse sorts of principles actually in their own lives reject these sorts of principles its just everybody else who picks up the principles nd hen it becomes the culture in which they swin andit is really really bad it is true whether you are talking about ser paganistic versions of communis am tha your seeing at burning man or whether you are talking bout single motherhood which is practice by nearly no one in the teckbay area but given the moral green light by every one in the tack o bay area and there is something weird about the fact that these weird hippies burning crap on the beace suddenly turned into buillionairs ariving ontorage in toads participates in building a garbage city in themiddle of nowhereand then having sex with randos which is effectively what burning man is according to the richest dod com in recent years many long time burns have resented how the festivals growing popularity has changed the experience they say on read it posts about the new class of burner consisting f s lebrities internate influencers tbuillioners elon musk and market zuckerberg it is true by the way that again unlike in the past when everyone who is poor aspired to be rich and what that meant is that if you re poor yuar spired to all sto imitate the life stales of the rich and famous which mean that if you go back to the the photoes of the great depression people are standing in line for thei're tickets for their food and they are dressed in suits now you have the richest people in er society wore tempting to drussk homeless people to prove to have everybody else while learning billings of dollars that they actually despise the billings of dollars the earning a culture that hates itself cannot long survive by the way what you see in terms of the actual staffs from burning man is that in two thousand six fourteen percent of surveyed burners listed their personal income as a hundred thousand dollars or more by twenty sixteen that number had almost doubled to twenty eight per cent the survey ors added a three hundred thowusand dollar pluss personal income category and that now represented three point four per cents of ale th people who are showing up at burning meant and by the way they are cheating it used to be that if you showed up a burning man ubasically shut up a muntraply would an a hammer and now if you are a rich person you show up at a turn key camp according to mashable these offor luxury menities cleaning staff and shefts while reportedly recking a havoc on the environment by charter flights to get there the entire thing was supposed to be this hippy gathering were you bring what you have and you give what you wans and you receive from others woare generous and now it is turned into a bunch of rich people who want to pretend that this is what they are whele actively just paying people to set up basically glamping in the desert which is amazing it is totally amazing in two thousand ineteen burning man c yo maryang goodl wrote shou was stunned by the growing commodification an exploitation of blackrock city and burning man calt r sone one hand ou can take capitalism allays winds than no matter what everythings ands up commodifyed because human beings are driven toward doing less work and being able to compensate people for the work that they are doing they capitalism always what the other way tof yiou this is that again you have entire eleate strata of our society that hates itself and tht it is constantly seeking to signal to everybody else how much it hates itself by doing things going to burning man the're not seeking to exemplify the behavior that everybody els should engage in and if they do they believe that behavior should apparently be this hippias garbage and we should all basically just lagh and and giggle along with them as they go to the the pleasure dome that has been set up in full sodomingamara style according to burning man ceo marring gurls stead whether it is commercia e photo shoolds product placements or instogram post thanking friends for a useful item a tendees including fashion mottels and social media influencers are

cases af just a fill out what burning man is before we explain what guod did do it apparently and i i i get to i get to say that because the left does this all the time right the the left acts as though in a huricane hit is florda is because of the great send that we have all committed in driving cars and running our air conditioners i also get to make a joke about how i'm if a bunch of moreons decide that they are going to jet set into the desert in the middle of nowhere where its a hundred and fifteen degrees to screw each other and then there is a giant rain storm biblical style that floods them and no one bothered to bring enough wood to build an ark sorry i get to joke about you guies your own fault o gay here are the principles that that is what kind of happen here are the principles of burning man they are written in two thousan four bi cofounder lery harvey this is a religion it is a religion and just goes to show yu that in an ear out where actual religion to clines traditional judao christian religion clines other forms of religion supplant it whether that is political polarization and following a the great leader or whether is this sort of paganistic hippy crap that you'r seeing over at burning man radical inclusion is one of the principales any one may be part of burning man we welcome in respect the stranger no pre requisites exists for participation in our communities first of all not true have you show up in your bible thumper i guarantee you arenot can be welcome overe a burning man where they have a giant dome where no one has showerd but the're ll havensects with one another that is an actual i keep menturing mentioning this togive this obviously is the most famous part of burning man is the orgy dome which according to cosma politan is is visited by five thousand people every year re just show up with a bunch of randos and a and the you screw them and this is the this is the height of human experience apparently radical inclusion apparently we not really tolerate anybody who has you knw base line moral standards in a traditional way a gifting burning man is devoted to acts of gift givin the value of a gift is unconditional gifting does not contemplate a return or in exchange for something of equal value first of all again backs the radical inclusion point if you just include everybody who is a leech andthey are living off gifts with no expectation of any sort of return it is not going to work because again the stuff does not existen scale the actual real rule o burning man i woud assume is that if somebody gives you something you give them something in return which is what we used to call trade ri w use to call that thing capitalism but instead o ein ta pretend that when i give you something and you give me something and the real reason were doing it is because of course fvid us take something from you and a and i never give you anything known will every give something to me again or can ta pretend that that is communism now de commodification in order to preserve the spirit of gifting our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships transactions or advertising oops well that did not work it turns out that people saw a giant group people there and a and it is now can it it is old fashion cool burning men i'm on a group chat with munch of folks who are kind of tal end of mallennial age and theyre ye i remember when this use to be the cool thing and nouts abunch people who are forty to years old ore showing up the average age burning man has been rising ind recent years ouse to be the thing for dum ass twenty one youroles to do and nou nce the thing for a people trying to recapture the feeling of being a dum asked twhenty one youarale but there actually forty two divorced and have aged and that that is what burning man has become radical self reliance burning man encourages the individual to discover exercise and rely on their inner resources well we saw ha thoat went ill get st that momentarily how weo they relight on their inner resources to be stuck in the mud for days at a time complaining caue they were to located a few miles away fom a freeway radical self expression radical self expression rises from unique gifts of the individual no one other than the individual or colaborating group can determin its content it is offered is a gift to others in this spirit tho giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient why is not that is not that nice radical self expression oup what i is the proviso there the provizo there is that your radical self expression makes no demands on others it makes no demands on others well ye except for the fact that radical self expression as a qcor value system requirs the acceptancs approval and tolerance of others clearly 's their limists to ratical self expression communal effort our community values creative co operation and collaboration we strive to produce promoten protect social that works public spaces works of art and methods of communication that support such interaction have you sen all the amazing works of art tht come out a burning man un i man other than the escuties we value civil society the civic responsibility community members who organize events should a sume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants they also must assume responsibility for conducting events an importance wof local state and federal laws oh there is legal liability that attaches also leaving no trats that turns out this one they jus do not do thet sey our community respects the environment we are ommitted to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather we clean up after oureselves and endeavor whenever possible to leave such places in a better state than when we found them which of course is wildly untrue it turns out that burning man has had a bad history of the past for years of just leaving garbage strew along the highways as people corene out of there as fast as possible thits of core the no shock go back to the occupy wall street days ad all the socialist laftees wer camping out in the parks in newyork city andit was just a wilderness of criminality drugabuse and trash andthenyou went to the tea party right allthese people who supposedly hate the nvironment everybody the tea party picked up after themselves no one hat occupy picked up after themselves because again it turns out that only respect ford the communial values that you actually share would require you to do this thing and any community founds at on ratical self expression an yant get a lot of free loaders and people who free ride participation tese the final to principles right not ten commandments nolic thou shall not kill tho shall not kan nap tho shall not commit secual sins that shall ni can min adultory are none of those things a got those none of that none of that matters riht that the things that actually matter here our things participation our community is committed to a ratically participatory ethic we believe that transformed of change whether in the individual or in society can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation we achieve being through doin every one s in vited to work every one is invited to play and finally immediatesy immediate experience is in many ways the most important touchstone value in our culture which of course is something that has been completely doneaway with because if you look a burning man is jus t munch of selfies i's an endless series of selfies for ever stamping on the human face for ever son just a second wewill at we will talk about what god wrought cause it turns out om it did not end well this year is the fire festival ets that momentarily first as you ay know i may big man of our friends over at genusel i've known about genusell for literally years ly back in twenty thirteen when i was doing a local morning show in low s angelist genusels and advertise r on that show and then i stop doing that show and my family continued to use genusell products because they are

spiro g and you see yell dot com slash chippero okat once again you have an ethos that is based on radical individualism and in which people are nots expected to do anything for anybody else but at the same time your expected to do everything for everybody else the contrast the ten commandments of burning man with the actual ten commandments things respect thy father and mother remember the sabbath and keep it holy do not commit murder do not commit adoltery do not commt idolatry do not commit kitlike one of these set of rules has built a civilization that is last dayd and been successful for literally thousands of years the other set of rules lasted a heavy rain storm maybe tha maybe the story of noa's ark is that maybe the rain won all that heavy here is te rat t here is theratical heretical view to day the rainwas not ll that heavy is just the society was not all that durable maybe that is really what we are finding out right now here is what happened over at burning man according to the a p in unusual latesummer storm turned a week long count er cultur fest into a sloppy mass with tens of thousands of party gor stuck in foot deep mud with no working toilets in the northern of vat a desert some burning man reveller sayd sunday their spirits remain un broken unfortunately their toilets do remain brokein and there just sittin there worse in there in their own poop scroon each other sound sounds lic the most the height of human experience somebody did die but apparently that that is happened before there is a guy a few years ago who burned himself to death to he threw himself on to the burning man or something an in any case it was not because of the bad weather organizers closed the festival to vehicles after one death was reported offs officials provided no details thf fatality the gut indr drown r anything the anual gathering in the black rock desert about a hundred and ten miles north of ranol attracts nearly eighty thous in artist musicians an act this for mits of wilderness camping and avon god performances desruptions are part of the festivals recent history organizers had to temporarily closes entrance s in twenty eighteen do to dust storms the event was twice cancelled altogether during the pandemic i love this more than half an inch of rain fell op the festal sigdt on friday distrupting this years fe waight half an inch half it weight not half a foot matnalic half a meter half an inch this much rain fell this much right here and du woops everything velapart more than half inch of rain possibly closer to one inch fel this wee can in parts of north westen ovata that includes the area where the burning man festival was being held road closers came just be oare large would not effigyo was supposed toave been burned on saturday night the masicly is the story of elija hratalogi teries lo khagis take your ginet would not sacrifice and see if it will burn sacrificeit god will you touch it no rain suk tep good times president jobide and told reporters in delaware he is aware of the situation at burning man the white house is in touch with local officials gan thng i making fun of here is that the people who are most interested in this it is become a glitzing glamor festival this the part that is truly fascinating an make unfon a hippies in the desert that is easy pickins but when those hippies involve themost famous people in our society and these most famou people ane aure society are suggesting that there is something to this value system that is worth noting that is something worth noting that a a value system that that things that orgy domes and not showering and building crap in the desert that you just then leave there that this is somehow a form of higher living and in the absence of god paganism rules it is not that there is no god its that many gods rule and those gods typically involve self worship which is really where where things curnently stand good news diplo was there again i do not know if he had his popis plan in tell apparently not chris rock was also there and a they escaped theys escaped from black rock aines as a fan al from chris rock and i a ride out of the burnt after walking six miles through the mud all chris could think about was an effing cold grew well that is that is some heavy stuffd there the other part of this that is hilarious is that obviously was not iblical flooding obviously thank god tens thousands people did not die and yet every person who is there this is why say the idolatry is actually just idolatry of theself everybody there is treating this as though they escaped the beachis at normandy or something i this what they are treatng it it is it is truly an amazing amazing thing for example kneel cat yell who you will remember as a supposedly serious legal analist kee a put up a picture of himself talking about the incredibly herroing journey out of the burning man festival apparently people said that they could walk about five miles from the festival sight to the nearest town of gerlock were shuttle busses would take them toreno first of all can i should point out that five miles is not a lot of territory it is a flat desert take a little water and five miles that the winding my goodness he said quote it was an incredibly heroing six moulthike at midnight through heavy and slippery mud but i got safely out of burning man never been before i now is fantastic with brilliant art and fabulous music except for the ending ah a the these are most serious people thact gui was the acting solicitor general under barockabama that the acting slicers that the gui who they have on amisenbuse everyday talking about the legal threats to donald trump and how the rule of law must be upheld was tat burning man whining about hig tyo walk five miles in mud because he put himself there because they have anorged you dome or something how old is neil catyol by the way i'm neel a nil catyo it is fifty three years old a

because hiyhave to walk around in the mud over there again ian wen point out the people who have attended include not only you lon mus but jeff basos and wilsmith this is the part that is totally crazy to mee we need a better class veleet we do you wonder why people do not trus theleet you wonder wy there is a giant cultural gap between say the left coast and the east coast and everybody in mill country people still go to church look at the stuff nthe you more ons went out inthemiddle of the desert to worship to worship your pagan selves an then got stuck in the mud rough ride for you really really truly if yull bat but this is the point the cultural arbuters ar not on the side of these called culture theyare on the side of the counter culture and this is the important point burning man's values or it is pseudo values represent the actual prevailing mind set for many of the powerful in our society woel yo will try to boil down the trump phenomenon to well the uide really teriffs or donal trump you want to build a wall on the border or donald trump it is really about subsidies to industrial towns in ohio that is not what donal trump its about what donald trump itsabou is about a cultural system that used to be called the is ritionall culture of the united states he is not personally representib ofe that but that is what the trump movement represents and those people have been dispossessed of the yudeo christian architecture that use to undergird the united stats o america and heyve been dispossessed by a bunch of pagan m or ons who believe that the actual value system is radical self expression in individualism now this does hunite some of the great capitalist of our era tbecuse there are many of the great capitalist are yo it used to be that every one sort of understood particular the great capitalists that undergird ing capitalis was not judeo christian value system actually understood this fairly well atomsmith that his theory of moral sentiments came before his wealth of nations but the the great early ticoons these were people who went to church on a regular basis these were people who actually who actually were were interested in what happened around them ar who took there the're responsibilities as human beings seriously ai mention johndy rockfeller but but johndy rock fellow's ae great example this at guy who went to a church and he sat in the pus next the people who were a fraction of his wealth what used to unify the country was a belief system that the leets held in common with the common man it was the same belief system over all the it was the radicals who are proclaiming the ecreed of of radical self expression but now's not the radicals nowice the most powerful people in the society who have basically decided the reason thy became powerful is because they followed their star but that is not really true again if you look tat the people who are most successful in our society they did not followed their star to the tune of i will ignore basic values educating myself or living a sectually responsible lifest out in the main a marks ockerbrig's a married guy with multiplkids and that is true for most of the people who are actually high urners in american society they'e actually more likely to be married with kids than peoplewho are not high urners in american society but they prommelegate the values of the low an wheni say the low i mean they hippes that commounore burning giant nine foot statues and that says something and the kick back to that is a munch people who are angry at the fact that they have ather value system supplanted and insulted and deridid by people whose main focus seems to just be tearing things down i mean burning man is actualy an excellent metaphor you build a man and ten you burn him that is it that you build radical individualism represented by jiant nine footall itol and then you burn it because what does humanity matter if all humanity is ta piece of meet wandering through the universe with hedenistic impulses it is only when human beings are connected to a higher value system when he'e conected with the divine value system of some sort that they become worth more than a block a wood that you burn weren' orgy dome i dis connects human beings from at tellos this it dis connect them from a from a a purpose a higher purpose and when you wend up with is burning man ri live in the moment immediacy of experience radical individual self expression and then half an inch mud an youre dont you are you are done you are host non that there is something to be said you it is amazing that to the way the organizers here decided to tell people to handle this thing is i'm to get themselves wood blocks and poot buckets a goringto se an and i com the first time at masha maultseva attended burning man the annual ephemeral city that attracts thousands of free spirited revellers in the nevaded desert she over pact i prepare for may be three month you recalled i read al te packingless all the redithreads all what is hapchaps preparing for burning man but this yere when heavy rain trans forme theremote thanuinto a muddy mess that forced to tendes to shelter and place and can serve precious re sourcess mountsavel was not is prepared she became one of about seventy thousand people stuck at the event when black rock deser received over two months worth of rain in just twenty four hours the storms from the deserts and into sloppy slippery clay tha made it impossible for drivers to exit or enter several liance is one of the events cor principles with organizers emphasizing the participants are ultimately responsible for their own health and safety that meant that dome they had to wear trash bags on their feet and meant also that they were told to im to bring poop buckets in case the rain made the portapodies in operable the webside recommended a five galling utility bucket with a lid and garbage bagliners this saind a great civilization to youd stounds a great civilization to me here is festival attendy david date describing the absolute carnage in the desert what is bene most difficult a a fact of this leather and anything crap there is ta the most difficult aut bact ta you upon a mount look tof this the problemly a is ta the conks tup tof wok tom one wy shows up to this avatlet lot then nother than e are and theres talpish an gold genclan ta owkward nopy they olkwar no thing to this community they do not add anything to this city ou'se tho t e people that are leedles ity leading ther traush you creating a crisis from which burning man lin nots or vive that is they sad story i cannot i cannot believe the sadness well you mean that a a city that is built on free loading actually has free loaders to arrive one other note here no children of burning ten it turns out that we aren'n that we are now civilization that is completely focusse on the adults and the reason tht there nok is a burning man aside from the fact that its radically an appropriate and apparently bearsome risk is the fact that if you live immediately in the momen you'r not building for the future that is all point ofburning that is not building for the future and there they are times in evericulture where you take off in you focass in on just the moment read that is thistran avericulture but when you build an entire value system around that around whatever happens to morrow is not my business around why buildings for generationally after all it is all femera build in the desert iu'll be gone to morrow unless that is connected with a higher value system it means nothing it means nothing it actually is nihalistic we celebrate a holiday injudism that is coming up in in the very near future called socot insicot you basically do kind of burning man what you do is you build a hut outside your housing yothular supost to live in it for seven or eight days the purpose of it is to remind you that you are at the mercy of god where you are supposed to actually you will build the hut such that you can see the stars an such open to the rain the he the whole purpose of it is to remind you that you are a physical creature but that there is something more spiritual to you raght that it is not that actually that is not spmost represent the intirdy of human experience it is one of the best holidays because the idea is tht when you decorate all the physical surrounding around you that is not the essential you but what is the essential you its unit with god an the essential you is the divine you that is the part thet matters just connect that and all you went up with his bunch of moreons rolling around in the mud and then beg mad at each other one t after pupenabucket not quite the same thing can just one second hene get the atest polls on jobidon there is a reason that donald trump continues to lead the republican primary is not just because he is a magnetic personality it is also because jobidon is running really really

puts him up thirty nine points over the rest of the field e latest wallstry journal pole has donal trump all the way up in the republican primaries at fifty nine per cent ron tosantis running a distant distant second at thirteen followed by nickey hayley who seen a bit of a bump at eight followed by the vake at five which is probly how the field is is truly stacked right now trump of course way the hell out in front one of the reasons for that is the main argument against trump has been a electability argument that is the main argument because republican voters thek they really trump they a lot of what he did they are willing to overlook or may be embrace a lot of the foy bulls and the crazy tweets in all that kennistuff certainly the is lot of warmth inside the republican party for trump but the only countr argument be yabut also he he lost it bidon ind twenty twenty and will probably lose again the problem is when the poles show that jo bidon is absolutely weak that makes trump look a lot more durable inside the republican primaries suits well i mean i get both thethe things i one at once thet gui whoi really on a personal level and also he can probably be bidon which is what the re publican poles are showing right now inside the republican primaries now i have myt doubts because i think thea lot of the poles that we are seime wright now are over estimting for example minoritye support for donald trump under estimating that support for jobidon having a lot of domocrats to wright now are saying thathey are wavering on bidner than o come home in the same way that a lot republicans who say they waver about trump are gonto come home however it is jobidon's weakness that is leading to this impass if voters overwhelmingly thing bidon is two oles to run for reelection and give him lo marks for handling the economy according to latest walster journal pole the negative views of bidon's agen performance publicplain what only thirty nine per cent to voters hold of favorable view of jobidon in a sepper question forty two per cent said they approve of how he is handlings job well below the fifty seven per cent who disapprove and right now in a potential rematch or trumfersas bidon rematch each of them has forty six per cent head ahead the journal survey points to a large set of challenges that bidon faces in persuading voters he deserves reelection it also fines lot a weakness is in trump voters in the survey rated trump is less honest and likable than bidon a majority viewed at trumps actions after his twenty twenty election loss as in legal leffort to stop congressfrom tdeclaring bidon the proper winner but if you look at the disapprove numbers for jobidon on a wide ridy visuse they are absoly devastating when it comes to in flation the disapproval numbers are well over sixty per cent sam on securing the border when it comes to dealing with china just over thirty per cent o voters a prove nearly sixty per cent disapprove when it comes to creating jobs even there he is split e forty six forty six and right now in terms of handling of the warneg crane he is registering in at a well over fifty percent disapproval furthermore seventy three per cent of voters say they think trump a bidin is too old to seek a second term that is only forty seven per cent of voters who say the same of donald trump even two lirds of democrats say that jobidon is too old to run again there is more in this pole that again bolsters trump and hurts bidon by an eleven point margin more voters see trump rather than bidon as having the record of accomplishments as president some forty per cents ait bidin hd a good record is president fifty one per cents say that trump had a god record as president by n eight point margin more voters said trump has a vision for the future by ten points more describe trump is mentally up for the presidency forty six per cent said that was true of trump only thirty six per cent said that of bidon now what is amazing about that is that those numbers are really awful for jobidon truly truly garbage for jobidon youd thing that if jobidon had numbers that low his republican opponent would be alike at fifty per cent fifty two per cent the problem is the dona trumps negatives are also superhid basically te american public thanks the donal trump comitted criminal acts the i'm not sing everyone i'm saying that a plurality of the american public believes donal trump did e legal or at least morally bad things in the aftermath of last time's election and they'ls arn't him personally but also they think that he is more competent than bidon and they his record now that provides an opening to trump if he runs on his record but if the entire campaign is going to be about what he did after the election last time and his criminal case is that is going to be kind of a problem going ford ints the election is what tony fobresio says he is a he pulls for super back that supports trumps is if this races about personality and temperamen bidon has an advantage if the races about policies in per formance trump has the advantage let me remind you right out that virtually all races and up being about per formance in temperament becas vor about policies and per formance trump would ofe one in twenty twenty without a doubt again these are really bad numbers for bidnan it is those bad numbers for bidon that are thet are really strengthening donal trump inside the republican primaries cas te electability argument basically goes away democrats cannot believe the jobin is pulling this low they cannot believe it becaus they live in an echo chamber whereverybody loves jobidon here is george stuff anopolis former lackey for hiellerto clinton being quite shocked it is kind of shocking in away then thet despite all of the baggage and donal trump carious he is tide which jobided right now yi ma to t when i look that that racon coll the welf stree jernala a said all this coul km up an look the poplem is and the biggest challege we faceis this democrats us say we because i'm a democrad is shaid young votus young black colat tanovotis the not readi to combact to the pony there not even look in that the the call met senton that is bein sentonem about the conomy about conmi change about studen dead rely itso again even democrats are stunned by his unpopulatr but it is not all thats tunning jobidin is not a epithetic figure as we been pointing out for months on this program jobine is nt good at his job ow i love the fact that jobidin strying to steer in to his age at this point but simultaneously denying that he is lazy which at this point in his life he is he is spent the last month on va cation well behind h was burning down ly what is he do for living other than sit on the beach and then say words badly into a microphon thand run away from the prass yesterday he was asked why he 's in rohublif be juiguy i certainly was not on vication well then what the hel youing ra holof beach you go the for business yya case my my favorite part of this is also e does not just say it is hard to hear him but he says om he is not i vacation he is going to rehublit each because the other ha he he doesnt have have any other place to go it if his house were to burn down and ill hin our something i has it he is just that well what it what a victim he is meanwhile he flop to philadelphia to do a rally by a rally we mean once again he escape dot that you cans it after him an ever every every day with jobiton just feels an appointment in to morrow at this point any case jobidinam he at this rally was saying i've been doing this longer than any one well yo we noticed by this i hope you mean corruption cause that is true somon sao nohat wy o no ma cea i guess why e yess wha i caryou noowi can a cosidas ruit wisdom haha haonling contidence ot ni gess why i when i continue to doo ell i mean one thing that does not come along with age is speaking english clearly that is a lot of mashed potatoes and outhright there is e as o longin an age whereso me as solid stuffed tore from the present of the united states when my favorite things he says on the campantrouseway says people call me middle class joe no one has ever called he middle class joe literally no one that is never happened not once there is no on who is that go over there oure ron amout that is middle class joe i known't calld the idle clas joe cause he has not been middle class since he was ah hiold that is why middle class joe was making forty for thousand six hundred dollars per year when he first entered the senate at the age of thirty in inflatian money that is three hundred twenty six thousand dollars a year middle class joe i ass here we go foks all by top a popic opis opo i fortoris middle class jo i guess they thot that was a whel e what that blas thow not a complimentr gess what that is why dot me do not sufficent ae o is bo class i me o work lik cow o no wat yor family has to work lik comppaplement jobidne is a corrupt poll he is been a corrupt politician he is entiur life he is not remotely middle class that do dons monti million dollar properties he is not middle class that is absurd and he still also by the way wholic at im woning whoin the country looks down on the iddle class jusie who is looking in the idle the only people look dow n themiddle class our people borakobama and jobidon in the more on to at burning man those of the only people there the pople look i midle class mare as they are those of those rubes live in the life style remember is barakobama who is declaring that people vo to republican becaue theyeare bitter clingers ore clinging to god and seen a fubia because they were losing teir jobs its people jobidon look down on middle class jobidon is there to enrich his corrupt union bodies which has been true since literally he was elected to the senate he is been in the union's pocket since the day he ensered the senate in delaware again ben shreckenger rits in his book about the bidons that there is a very solid basis to believe that jobin one his first senate race basicaly at the bast of unions that that maybe illegally picketed a newspaper rvent a mailor going out about him from his opposition in any case one my faverithings bout jobidon is that he acquates being promiddle class with being proe the heads of major labor unions which not the same thing it turns out that forcibly removing a piece of people's pay check and giving in to a bunch of union bosses then to lace corrut politicians jobidns that can enrich their their funds iis pretty amazing stuff this is a presumably why the acting a labor secretary ran out july sue she is out their saying that jobidon he loves the middle class cause he loves labor that is it that he loves the unions your i notice the unions represent fewere an fewre members the iddle class this a i noticed can he well what the administrations roll is in these negotiations to the ex thant there is one at all yes think ye much femen tis president is the most pro worker pro union president that we have had and that means economic policies that sent tor working people that ar good for workers het has created at tight labor market in which workers and unions have more power to demand change in demand what is right for workers demand their feirsher athebargin table amazing stuff again middle class jo in the pocket of the unions that is really went all bout agand the only argument for jobidon at this point is that he is not trump burne sent is just said that out loud he is rilly jobidns old the is bat at this job but at least he is not rump ritn i have the republican party betting on at least he is not bidon nif the democratic party betting on at least he is not trump and only one party can be right here is burning making that case were looking in an unpresident tod moment in a murk an history a goal trump is not oly o te patological lier a's not only help wage and insurrection if you to og provent president binde from tinking walkus not only is te nang american demorcrecy moving against the murk and democracy i think it this moment bog o we have got to ring the pregressoe community te jengle to ta yeno want rigonof fight for regress of the jengle but we cannot have fo mor yeas a tot trumpin t e winouse again that is all they care about and what you have is as jemgarity an natural yhou says a frozen battle fields republicans think that any one can be bidon democrat's believe anyone can be t trump anterigan end up with trump bidon in all likelihood right now meanwhile the mediire attempting to do their best to ensure that ronto santis and ever one else in th republican party remained secondary to non trump there doing in some cases vege lines rollingstone magazinewhich is not famous flor it som for its honesty they wrote up a report suggesting that bunch of neonozes marching in florta by bunch i mean fifteen marching and florida a representative of governor to santsis political supports according to rollingstones miss leading report thas had some of the marchers individually express their distaste for donal from saying they prefer governent florta govrnor rondo santis and dum and i and supposedly they said we are all the santis supporters only one problem which is out which is not true which is not true at all here is the actual vidio that rolling sone was lying about ethe sing afto santus right the' shing sarcastically rollingstone left that part outs they can make it look as though all the nozes in florta support to santus which is weird things ins all the orthodox juws in florta support to santus up there is that that is all that is all going really well meanwhile over the week end jobidon stop by florida very briefly in the after m auth of of a hurricane that that ashy did not do it frmentus manta damage thank god and the big controversy over the week and in florida was wis not rondo santis getting together with jobidon and the answer's here is no reason for him to get together with jobidon jobdon was just going to stand there in jaber about climate change what exactly is the purpose there is no actual fundamental obligation for a governor of a state of either party i do not any of these optic ave talk othe three years havin intall stupid but the santus actually has a job to do he isthe governor f the state jobidon is coming around to stand around look at things and wanderer round aimlessly bump into walls and talk about climate change a governor santson on friday there ware no plans for him to meet with jobidon contradict ind comments that bidn made earlier in the day indicating that they would the medi immediately took this is a great insult to the honor of jobidon i will say this to his credit bidon was asked about meting to santis and he did not actually take the opportunity to bastro santus rare moment of a rare moment of of not garbige behavior from our cren president oonitis othis e ees e ed e s es tesai shogo we es destructi s we ee wico e sigish former goi se sh o to mo t o ol ai wai wi ja oe oo an sure o again rare moment of a of shocking decency there from the current pr esident of theunited states emison be see however was not going to be deterred by by bydon's words instaid they jum that this is horrible how could he not meet with with joba o my god people open here re op i do not re beg on the ground for for sanday fercansanday weba ua and you think back to the meating that chris christy that had then i gersy governor had with a president a baba rigt an the embrace i and sem folk sat that is the reason why a than presient abbagat reelactent a is this you think one of the reasons why te santis is chisa noctis to meet with the president a to day an making at mor bo politics whywan is not i do not think that the beno goin to her going to be the presidentitin your presidential duty when he asident or baba is president was in fact te reasin that he was reelected ala i think that governor the tantis im ifteam an by thein he has to tams ride as a tean in the governors office an aa at e team on his campaign i think that the team of the campaign is a likelyg negatively influencing with the the decisions at the team in the governors office a make ii im ya the medor not can to let that one yop o get meanwhile you on musk is at now at war withthe anties defamation legues let us be clear about the inthe defmation lagu it is a progressive interest group that proclaims that it is speaking in the name of jewish causes that is that is untroup it is just a progressive interest group that is all and sometimes they cross streams with actual not herrific ideas and a lot of time the're targoning people on the asis of spurious nonsense or ignoring people on the basis of other spurious nonsense because again there are progressive interest grop whent you on musk is now in a in a battle with the adiel and tom he is in a battle with them because he saying that you gots are basically trying to slure acts formerly knownist twitter by having advertised remove the revenue he is right about that a lot of these progressive interest groups are very much interested in removing advertising revenue from sources where they cannot control the speech he posted on axs saying the adia has been quote trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it and me of being antismetic if this continuens we will have no choice but to filed defamation suit against ironically the anti defimation league if they lose the defimation suitwilyle insist they drop the anti part of their name since obviously now is that really going to happen it is im it is almost impossible to when a defamation suit against public figure it is it is really really really rough because you have to show actual malice which is a nearly impossible standard with that said is the adiel constantly speaking up on behalf of the right causes absoly notmen they made excuses for some of the worlds worst antisamites in congress long as theiare demograss bicgs again it is a progressive interest group they posted a report suggesting that axis now filled with horrible hate is a way for them to work together with groups that we have discussed on the program bafore garm in order to reduce advertising to platforms acts basically abie by l eft toing standards of speech or watchure advertiseing dollars disappear that is what elan musk is a is sounding off about and he happens to be correct about all of that and it is really really ugly which is why its very important that if you are an advertiser and you are looking at platform st advertise on you probably should be looking at freer speech platforms twitter because otherwise twitterer slash acts is at is going to revert back to type ins can the same kind of crap that face book has done or ou tup has done in censoring material ok a time for quick thing i and then a quick thing that i hate things that i to day if you wish to understand what exactly is going on in china fantastic new book out by person named yashanghuang a this book is titled the rise and fall of the east how exams autocracy stability and tacnology brought china success and why they might lead to its declin the the basic premise of the book is that first centuries mallennia almost baked in to the chinese cake has been this system of test taking that basically chose single standards of merit in order to elevate people and this is led to top down authoritarian rule in chinas been incredibly durable lot more durable than it would ae been in sey russia and it is why you can have gugian paying whose being as authoritarian as he wants to be and still maintain control of the country that theorat what whidet whiet whi is not never fragment why does china never come apart why does it seem as though its continues to be durable even whns economic numbers go down it also has some lessons to teach the united states about how economics ought to work and also about the sort of standards that we use intrmsof economic growths o one of the points made in the rise in vall of the east is that basically all of the test base systems for elevating people inside the c c p are rooted in growth of g t p if you are reginal leader in china and you grug t p in your area you'e very likely to be looked out for toppost in the centralized government whae the probem is that g t p is a is a standard at is largely w reliance in china on government borrowing spending which is why you see china now in serious trouble its barrwed and spent way too much moneys why you have giant empty cities in some o tese places ecause if europe public official hen you wish to rise the chinese commenis party what better way to do it than borrol bunch o money build bunc to empty cities ind claim that you just increased g t p dramatically it is a really fascinating book a ganglo check et out the rise and fall of the east by yashnghjang for interested in the actual situation going on with china and the durability of the chinese regime even if they are experiencing economic failure uk a time for a quick thing that i hate s as a piece by david gibson whose director of the center on religion and culture at fortom university and he is ripping in to american consertive catholics for being at odds with pope francis hes saying that dome the loudest voices in american catholicism are quo backward looking moralists can disconnected from the roots of the church catholic tradition and history says francisis about moving forward changing to live the gospel message in the idst of current realities pope's words were both surprisingly frank and frankly on surprising giving the persistence of right anger directed at his modernizing approach this apisord could be read as part of a long saga of tensions between rome and est church since the nations founding popes ave regarded the american experiments in democracy with suspicion separation of church and state is dangerous to sols in society hef e should periodic blass at americanism in modernist friends the election of pope francis in twenty thirteen flip descript however suddenly the vatican began pushing americans to be more flexible more pastoral more inclusive lastoc trinally rigid rome is now the engine of reform a historic reversal france is a world leader in combat and climate change he insistently to cries economic injustice in the treatment of migrants while puting new emphasis on the universal rights to heltkar housing and decent jobs indeed in portugal francis criticize the fixation on sins below the wastewhile if you exploited workers if you liter cheated it did not matter meanwhile says this colonist much of american church leadership remains focus on a pelvic theology here is the thing it turns out thats a the american catholics poor critical of francis are rights there is certain unchanging principles in catholicism and francis has not changed that right chant france is not actually changed the churches position on samt suckss marriage he is not changed the church's position on divorce he is not changed to the church's position on contraception its just that he keeps making overtures toward those who would in order to make time on climate change and social redistributionism in ussenc he is liberation theologists is now occupying the office of the papacy and american catholics more consertive catholics all over the world know this which is why he more than any other pope has created a schism inside the catholic church th that is that is francisis fault if tha is not thefault of american catholics o are hueing exactly the same line they wre uing twenty years ago wardic as the rest of the show is

closing the central bank that is the institution printing money hand over fist mile recognizes the reality inflation has crippled argentinis ability to recover he is called pesos garbage not even useful as fertilizer which is true they are worth pretty much zero in argentina all this should be treated is good news argentinis trojectory has been a total disastraria for decades despite the glorification of parianism at the hands of hollywood and in fact the markets ar treating melays election as they should argentine stocksan bonds hav jums on mulays election mainly because he is the first leader of argentina in generations who has a plan who actually avoid economic defolt miles election should be treated by the united states as the possible opening of a new era in south and latin america along with all savidoran present ai bucele a new wave of conservative governments may be building in the global south that would be incredible given the called pink wave that has washed across the continents over the course of the last two years then why the heartburn the answer is there are many in the united states in europe particularly on the political left especially in the media who somehow feel more comfortable with the socialist radicalism of bula de sofa gabno boric even nicholas maduro then with any one who smacks of liberterianism or conservatism that is because argentina is a living example of what happens when corporatism and social democracy are taken to their limits the substitution of government for markets the overregulation of industry in pursuit of social redistributionism the attempts to create azarki meing everything produced in country the atterif protections and trade restrictions the dependency theory marks his nonsense that is dominated latin in south american politics for two generations the endless populous promise that if all power is given to the government to protect te people all will be well that promise always results in privation and misalication in tyranny and poverity melay's victory represents that realization left to slabel melay the worst slorer they can think of she is just donald now the media and the political left will attempt to shovel all of argentina's failures on melay's shoulders mela is walking into a hornents nest into a room that is completely on fire meley still faces a partly paranis legislature as well as a court system stacked in favor of left ist foolishness the supreme cort magistrate poracioros oty recently said that any attempt to dollarize meaning to get rid of the paso and instead substitute the dollar would be unconstitutional and violation of national sovereignty this means that melays power may be curbed he still faces intrenched economic problems including a durth of valuable currency to move toward dollarization there are not enough pasoes to trade for dollars to get the country's currency back on solid footing he will require an infution of foreign capital in order to write the ship in argentina and then if he comes up short capitalism and economic liberalism will be blamed for the failures of generations of paronism this by the wayt is always the pattern corporatis ruin economies and then capitalism gets the blame this was the story of the two thousand heven twothousinate economic crisis in which the federal government subsidized sub prime mortgages at exorbitant rates and then when everything fell down they blamed capitalism but melat can succeed investers need to look stout to put their money wear their mouth is to insure that argentina realizees its potential as a massive source of prosperity wealth and power and that a lions with the uninted states and the west grow stronger as a result in just one second will get to more on the situation in argentina first this is your last chance to takecamanage of birch gold black fridayety also as we talk about the economic problems in argentina and the problems debasing an entire currency the west soon enough is going to have to debasis currency because of the exorbitant amounts of dat tha' been piled a top economies that of the united states we are now approaching forty trillian dollars in

news the poll numbers keep on coming for jobidon and they are absolutely horrifing if you are jobidon you should be freeted the hell out bran new harvard harrispole and every result in this pole is awful for jobidon just truly truly bad why what becaue hes one a terrible job governing right now the pole shows country right track or wrong track wrong track fifty eight per cent right track thirty five per cent youust economy right track wrong track right track thirty five per cent wrong track fifty eight per cent about forty eight per cents of americans say that their personal financial situation is getting worse only thirty per cent say that it is im proving bidon's approval rating is still stuck at the very very low rate of forty five per cent in this harvard harrispole his approval on handling most of the key issues is currently under fifty per cent in fact the only numbers where he is over fifty per cent are's handling of coronaviris for whatever reason and stimulating jobs which jus just because in the natural outgrowth of moving past covi mor jobs o be added to the american economy every single other question he is under water including the economy where heis at forty four per cent the democratic party over all by the way is out pacing jobidon in these numbers the democratic partie's approval rating is fifty two per cent negative forty eight per cent positive which is still better than the geope which by thelage is devenstrates the absolute wizerdly in competents of the geope it is amazing jobidon is the precident the democrats run the centate and somehow republicans are still less popular as a party then the democratic party which is kind of amazing as far as the presidential election jobidon is now according to theis pole trailing significantly against donal trump and and most pole analists now think the tdunnal trump has a small but measurable leed in this currns election cycle if you lo gt the primaries trump has a major advantage on everybody in the primaries guope primary first or second choice according to this harvard harispole donal trum seventy four per cent ron to cent is thirty seven nicky hailey twenty four avake twenty three everybody else ten or below in ahead ahead against to santus or hailey trump is above seventy five per cent against te santist seventy five twenty five a against nickey haley eighty one to nineteen most of the trump voters in the primaries they say that they prefer him to all te other candidates obviously but not only that they say they might think about changing but its not can be based on any sort of criminal conviction meanwhile three and five voters say jobidon should not run for a second term only one in two say the same for trump semeans fifty nine per cent say the jobidonsiouln't run only half say the denotrump should not ru n now fifty eight per cent say they would consider a third party candidate but when it comes to a head to head right now here is the head to head bidnvers is jeopee nomines horse race fift the twenty twenty four election for present were held to day and o as between trump the republican and bidon the democrat who is you vote for that is stat to day is trump plus seven forty eight to forty one eleven per cent undecided if you include people leaning one way or the other this is why there is a critical pollectuallates the first poll i've seen that has donald trum significantly over fifty per cent is harvard herris pole has donal trump up six at fifty three to forty seven which they blow out for donal trump if this s aht three wayrays and you include robert of kennedy trump is still up a forty one for trump fhirty for for bidon eight per cent for do not know on sure seventeen per cent for ar if cay junior if you include leaners trump is still up eht per cent he is still up aight per cent if you include for example jil stine or cornal lest by the way that the the entire case just poll speaking again this coming from somebody whinta primary would vote ford rondosantis above donal trump but the reality is what these poles are showing is serious tor ability for donal trump against jobidon why the answer is because people known trump he is a known quancity people ove already factored in all of his flaws all f his floybles all of the crazy all this slof is already maked into the kake and it is very difficult to think what could donal trump due that would truly alienate a large segments of the electorateed this point now again it maybe that all the folk is don bide right now this is the going theorying the democretic party tha when you swivel that that is potly back on to trump in the up coming year that his poll numbers are gin crater that is a theory now it maybe it is true maybe it is not this pole shows by the way at any race between jobidon and ron to santis that race looks even or bidon pluss three if it looks it if if you look it trump ferse is herris trump bes herris by twelve points if it were bidon fer snickey hayley bidon is up one on nickey hayley again why because nickey haley's numbers irt forty one per cent this hands his nmbers are forty two per cent bidon is still at forty two or forty five per cent wich for the same numbers yo would have against trump excep that everybody knows trump and we already move over to the guide they aready know there is something to the known quantity nand these poll numbers are devastating for jobidon they are awful for gubidon every single element of this pole is terrible for jobidon now what what is underlingthess there are few thing that urnelingthes one thing that is underlying this obviously is the fact that jobidon has been really ba o policy and on every single policy issue people ten to fave or republicans over democrats o this point except for per haps abortion and the election is not can be run on a bortion of trump is the nomine because nobody perceeves trump as particularly per life because hes not campaigning as somebody whos particularly prolife he says i got red er row my job here is done nd tht's actually not eight a stupid politicold attitude to tay when it comes to federalization of the abortion issue it is actually something that was sort of tried by len younken in virginia and for all the tog by how did not work it kind it did virginias af very blue state and pretty much everything that was within a bidin pluss nine whant republican in virginia because glen younkin took u fifteen week position on abortion because that is a very purple state purple to blue whell nationally speaking trump its avoiding the abortion issue which means sort takes it off the table and the it jus be comes a rerendim up or down on did you the country better when trumpets running it or did you the country better when tobidon is running it combine that with the fact that every one things that you biding his tool thand got a real problem on your hands yesterday hn your times o peter baker you sang the white house is doing its best to down plate jobidon's age is birthday has happend over he past couple of days hes eightyn one years old which means that by the time he left the presidency he would be eighty six years old which is super old that is seven years past the life expectancy of the average marican i an your bidin is not he is ailing he does not look good here is peter baker from he your times youri the basgrat old noting i mean nok i doathing in public about to day as'ar call tan ion tot 'l soll bain trive at up an na tokit o iis family when he goes up tomorrow for the a tax giving holiday

ther best offer yet sunkin last long with helicks better sleep starts right now ga again the going consern is that jobide is gon to lose the election in large parpe because he is to oll men obviously the world's none could shap and that gets attributed to whoever is the precedent at the time me donal trump was running into severe headwins in twenty twenty at the black lizes matter riots he had covid he had world economic melt down a had a lot going on wut jobidon is having that that same sort of issue the thing is it is all self created as i said when jobidn was elected that to was the luckiest kin world he walked into a situation n which nonal trump had handed off to him the abraham icord top pece in th middlies burgening a a rat relatively contain china a relic tivili contain rustressy is a very peaceful foreign front donal trump gave to him a vaxin roll that plan that jobidon use for good or ill but was eable to claim that he was the one who hid actually put upon the land the economy was already in recovery by cu four of twenty twenty and continued to be in recovery after that except slower under jobiden jobine was handed the keys to the car and the car was running and ten he proceeded to just blow it completely screwthing cup david axelrod the former advizer to berokoboma he says quote i thing has a fifty fifty shot here no better than that may be a little worse he thinks he can cheat nature here an it is really risky the have got a real probm at their counting on trump to win it for them i remember hillery doing that too axelrod re cently suggested that bidon should could re consider his reelection bid prompting irer from the president who reportadly called the strategist a m a word that rhimes with phic his on solicitd advice followed in yourtimsiena college bll that jod biden trailing trump among voters an five key battle ground states and again this is the reality the reality is that right now donal trump has a lead on jobidon trying to pretend other rise is really really silly and if you take a look at all of the latest poles they show trump with a significant advantage in battle ground states for example latest poles from michigan from epic am arey jo trump up five over jobidon presidentihal lechen pull from ipsos his november thirteenth to fourteen trump plus too from you gob trump plus one from enbise news trump plus too in fact it is very difficult to finda national pull in which trump is not leading jobidon at this point in that' the serious probm obviously for for present abidon and a lot of this again is exascrbated by the fact that everyone knows he is toold now i think old is a catchall i think if people tough he was doing an a mazing job the old thing would not count if you were old and everythng was grat he woul oka he is a charming elderly fello but because everything is garbage everybody is looking at jobidngoing this gi cannot handle the crisis thi s k cannot handle any of this thes gy initiated the crisis grampas pilled the beans they are all over the floor this was all exascerbated by jobidon's performance and the performance of hi social mediotin every time jobidon goes on stage as i said before it is watching nick willenda walk a cross a tight rope over a volcano is it every time he goes up a set of stairs you are wondering if god forbid s the end of his presidency the is the stairs might to feed him every time he gets on teleprompter you are wondering whether's con o make it through the sennse and this ben on going since the last elections likeele and twenty twenty during thet to bates the big question was we will jobidon physically survive thet abates then he did not people a wow he all performed expectations he still breathing well the same thing is going on except worse because he has visibly degraded between twenty twenty and now for example yesterday he was jobdons botching his lines over and over and over his something he does lot we never come out of a situationa tat i a i ithot be better o poin om thou ais can get er liberty o hav a e troa competition e te work ard paciorse' be willing to travele over a bout a mile e can say ei harde geta a tic it tot rt a tho or r i i i tos anan cano wormerer to wut if ba all of that was iexascerbated by what i think might be these single worstins to granpost of all time jobidon's mediats him is not doin you any favors it was his birthday and jobidon's ins to gram team put up be following post af the s a picture of jobidon for those who cannot see and the caption says turns out on you'r one hundred and forty sixth birthday you run out of space for candles now i know they are trying to be self to facing bah uk y there is many things wrong with this is hard to know where to begin for thoe who cannot to the picture it is jobidon gripping the table gripping it as though he is about to suffer from a tremendous coronaryg and keel over he is gri he is a white knuckling the table he is he is stretching out he is white knuckling the table and he is grinning the rictus grin into the camera meni he looks un comfortable he looks cana alpot ye no in a the devil's advocate over here ready to out ready to offer you a deal for your soul the reason he looks that it is because his team on's got olook to thinking i doft lot thewhen i fire saw the simage i thought it was a ye i seriously got oos a ey i thought somebody went into an ai generator and said joe bidon devil eighty first birthday het wy because they put a cake in front of him and they did not apparently want to put the candles that you getfor your seven year olds birthday party where just says seven on it they do not want in eight and one the is out underscore that he said he one years old and really old instead they put eighty one candles on the cake and then they lit the thing on fire and it looks a city burning down that cake looks the great chicago fire that cake looks a newclear explosion i mean it is all coming together in a hell fire bananza of catestrophic proportions it is the dog mem jiff it is amazing and it is and it is frontlit senuine turn on the lights in the room properly he he is sitting there and the fire is is balancing off his face lighting up a devilish amelic what are they thinking what are they thinking you are underscoring one he is too old to do the job too the world is on firelit it is the easiest joke in the entire world this t gongto be the closing of every single republican ad from now until the election joe bidon sat the world on fire picture of him with a giant cake with a giant fire rite in front of him as as those goin a tost marshmellows on the cake and he is unbelievable it is unbelievably stupid what is his social medioteem doing they should all be fired to from a political point of view that is the biggest self goal i've seen in modern american politics for last couple of years minimum really bad stuff well all of this is underscoring a serious probm obviously for jobidon cereen shom pierre also has nobility'o actually spin jobidan positively she is just awkwardly out there trying to talk pass the graveyard the literal graveyard at this one i here is a creen shomp pierre talking about the president's stamina and a bilities i would pit the president famina present t wisdom ability to get this done on behalf o the american people a gen anyone any one any day week ah ye you would put his stability and stamina above anyone literal any one any day of the week would you though would you i meni do not think the american people would this of course the major probem and there the a lot of democrats work con of falling off the manwaggons here is the thinge jobin requires hivl to turn out anorder one donal trump did in fact generate extremely hivol to turn out on both sides on both sides but democrat's also benefited as we 'll kno from changing the rules there are an enormous number of malean ballats intwo thousand and twenty that that extraordinary number of male and ballats and early voting ballats that ment that the total number of votes jumped sky rocketed and an that obviously benefit when you get the the fringe voter the lo information voter the voterwho does not normally vote to vote in vast numbers what you went up with is typically more benefit for democrats the the giant spike in male an ballats during twenty twenty something that was en courage by the democrats and discouraged foolishly by donal trump that obviously benefited jobidon mean according to reports from twenty twenty one the associat o press fewer than one third of voters casting ballats in the presidentiallection did at a pulling place on election day two thirds of the votes two thirds of them came in viamaleand ballats that is insane in twenty sixteen twenty eighteen about a quarter of all voters used emale ballat that jump to more than forty three per cent in twenty twenty forty three per cent of them voted viemalean ballats the re maining voters either cast their ballat at a pulling place or during early voting and that early voting was of course puss very much by democrats and discouraged by presed in trump what what if people just do not vote the same way in to thosan twenty four i very few election analists actually believe we can get the same voter turn out in twenty twenty floor that we gotin twenty twenty in twenty twenty was rife with all sorts of issues first of all the democratat white heat about donal trump second black lites matter protest third covid by all of that generated extraordinary levels voter turn out and again in courage people two male in their ballad because youyou ware doing everything from home there is it the isa difference by the way between a world in which are literally doing everything from home working from home never going to a movi theatere never t never going out to eat and then this just another thing ofre doing at home as you fill out aball t nou sended ink that is literally hire doing everything and a world in which you actually are engaged in the regular world than now you are probably ging to take time out and rgetn go vote well that is t a system that does not benefit the marginal voter that jobidon relizes upon the enthusiasm for bidon is through the floor democrat's now this but they are convinced that donal trumpet's bag candidate that they are going to count on him to lose te election that that is really what this is ye you can see the roiling under current of dissatisfaction with jobidon from one of the great luminaries var time cardy bes ti she shud put up a post that is gon pretty viral in which she basely thretens by now to i thing a cardy beople and o voting for jobidon of course because a gein a lot of the people whoare very annoyed with bideright now they will come home but it is gon to be enough to defeat donald trump who has extremely high levels of enthusiasm among republicans here is what is going on right now inside the electrit republicans are very enthuse to vote for donal trump democrats are not very enthuse to vote for jobidon democrats are counting on democrats to be enthused to vote against donal trom maye that works and maybe that does not the reality is that hillery clinton lost in twenty sixteen because she was not able to replicate the levels of enthusiasm particularly with minority voters that they had for barackobama that is why she l ost jobidin is in very similar danger that was covered up for in twenty twenty because o the pantemic it is covered up for because of the nonal trump of it and black live's matter of movement and all the rest of it in twenty twenty for will that be rapplicated i do not know cury here is cartybe wwhat is what is laresabout cartybe and this is not the first time that she is rant about economics is thit cartybe many people who are of the left she is close to seeing the thing but she cannot see the thing here she is railing about the fact the new york city is now cutting services then she idiotically blames federal spending for that which of course has nothing to do with it if she actually understood maybe how economics works and the ewyork city has to cut services because the tacks are too high the regulations are too high they do not hav enough money coming in thei're spending to much wmenty maybe she might thinkg differently about government she does not but she is blaming trobidin for it

thing you can do and that is you got to go back into the old grab bag of trumpy issues and that means trumpet tittler yep get ready for that thing all the way from now until the election then your times hedline last night quote trumps dy your words raised new fears about his off forterian bent w ah you scared yet an shivering down you'r spine that is right the the orange gentleman who is sitting at marlago twiting in all caps that dude just he sittler reminder he settler that that is that is gon to be their pitch from now until the election cycle donald j trump rose to power with political campaigns that largely attacked external targets including emmigration from predominantly muslen countries and from south of te united states mexcal border but now in his thord precidential bid some of his most vicious into basing attaps ave been leveled at domestic opponents during a veteran stay speech mister trump yous language that echoed authoritarian leaders rose to powere in germany an italy in the nineteen thirties degrading his political adversaries is verman when ye'd to be rooted out a'supposed to jobidon whliterally did a speech in front of indepenente hall lit up blood red in which he called his ultrom mag opponents traitors to the country flanged by marines in te background yes authoritarianism weret were deeply word about from nonal trump the threat from outside force is trumps that is far less sinister and dangerous and grave than the threat from within but by the way that is idealogically true ve h united states is not an existential danger from china or rushup or commas or cas bela or ron all thos horrible countrisan and terristentities could do terrible things taws but are the an excistantial danger no it turns out the existential danger to the united states as always with a great country and a great power comes from within but s ays the nertimes this inward turn has sounded new alarms among experts ah the experts they are here to save jobid the experts on autocracy wave long worried about mister trump's praise for florein dictators han distain for democratic ideals gen is it the same media that praise they praise lula in brasitle these are the same people who have warm words for g in china in it it is whild is just while scholars democrats and anti trump republicans are asking a new how much mister trumperesembles current strong men abroad and how he compares to authoritarian leaders the way you mean opponents of donal trump ar asking whether he steller no this is new perhaps most urgently they are wondering whether his retorical turn into more facious sounding territory is just his latest public provocation of the left in evolution in his beliese or the dropping of avale i'm what exactly are the things that they are whre he is going to do quote hise ambitions include using the justice department to take vengeance on his political rivals im this is my this is my confused face jobidon is literally using the justice department to targadonal trump right now right now donal trump is bout to face for separate trials going into the next year three of them are completely specious the only one that has any relevants to it criminally speaking whatsoever is the classfi document's case and jobidon also miss hantal class fi documents and did hillreclinton and then bleech bit her her actual hardrives yah oh my god donal trump i weaponize the do ja just barakobama and jobidon also he is plotting a vast expansion of presidential power and is stelling idea logically in line lawyers in kee positions no wait wait you mean the executive branch is going to people it is going to be peopled by those who agree with the presidents of the united states he cannot have that and as we know jobidon and berakobama they were famous for appointing people wirh the vast panoply of beliefs across the political spectrum to political positions in their administrations erickholder who literally called himself the presidents wing men mister trumps allies dismiss the concerns as alarmism and cynical political attacks seeven chohn campain spokesman responded to criticisms of the verman remarks by sayig it came from reactive liberals whose quote sad miserable existence will be crushed when president trumpere turn the spiciousfoot i do ah i do love the people hoar around trum because is just is just insane dubling down it is just it is just insane doubling down hi trum says the verman thing and then they go to his campaign and does that sound musulini is no no does not sound musulini blood alone moves the wheels of history o but that is comfort in any case it is a clownshor alltheway down but again the medas gol here is to ding trump as offen as possible and then to say that hes such a threat thatyou have to elect the dead old gye in the corner some experts on authoriturn ism said that while mister trumps recent language has beguns to more closely resemble that yused by leaders hitler or muselini he is not quite muror fasious leaders of the past still they say he does exhibit traits similar to corent strong men victor orbun of hungary or a sept type erdoan turkey how does he resemble urdoone you mean the guid who took complete control of the aslomist military in in turkey and who is been continuously ruling place for twenty years that that one artes him out orban who is a democratically elected leader you might not how he runs the country but they have elections an those elections are actually relatively clothes in any case this is the entire stick this is whi ry melburg iof emison b c of course don late night chose because this is the way thate works is that if you are an ames it is all cross polinated ef ar melburg on emison b c but e's not really animous and he see he is on late night with seth mires on enb c because he is such an important person talking about how if you vote for trump that might be the last vote mevercast bokthis is such absolute sheer nonsense it is just nonsense you heard from the right you herd from the left all the times the next selection will be the last lectiou kno on't it is nont gon to bae i'mjuston and ton prediction take it to the bank the next selection will not be the last election of your lifetime in the united states i'm not sure about much i m one hundred percent sure about that if i'm wrong i will eat this pen a dangerous bat here is ta ary melber doing this rutin if you have some one whoever it may be in this case i stortal trum who literaly try to overthoaw democracy instead of leave office peacefully if that person takes power gan it is not a second turm they are' tiking a life turm and i don' think the contryas to wake up to that it is not just ta second timeits a life turm we are talking that is oe what whoas we have covered ind the criminal legal contect is littely going on trial for everst over through the election hn that' the legal process and he is presumed innisen he could still walk but in the political electoral process if you were going to give your vote tost ove whone has already tried to steal your vote very blotlyographically and publicly that might be the last vote you get to cast something really think about i think this clip would only be that thing isclip culd only get better if weu're an infinite regress of ary melburs it quotes himself on n b c with south mires and then he cuts from ary melburg to more ary melburgh soe think we haveto just continue doing that all the way down the leck again this is such nice try i me nice try you are you are right the fashous take over him is iminent or maybe it never happened when trump was the president the first time maybe there is that iu just one saconall get to the latest frum it the middle east first i've got a

genuselldot com slash chipeiro meanwhile the government of the israel is seriously considering or will soon a prove the possibility of some sort of temporary stop to the fighting in order to free hostages apparently in a deal broker by cosar this literally the only reason that cotar is still in tuch with the last is to broker these sorts of deals apparently the is rally government is societing thes real he securety cabinet which is comprised o right left and center thet they are deciding right now as to wether to a prove a deal in which fifty hostages would be free dozens more possibly to be freed in return come oss woeuld get some three hundred palistinians among them some women and miners there would be a stop to the fighting as the releases go ahead apparently according to some reports israel ad stop using drones to monetor parts or all of gosso for several hours to day during the seas fire which seems totally in saine to me a is your brokering that deal tjust allowing the terrifs to run around free for several hours whalyou allow the hostages to be release that seems wild to me s the move around al the weapon ra in all their terrorism and you do not have any sort of of window into what they are oing thats the problem in the first place again that the big problem is that the president was set by the is rally government years ago than return for one soldier gulogially they reast one thousand palistinian prisoners wear actual terrors and now obviously withthat pressen an set that is whycamas took the the prisoners in the first place benygons is the war cabinet minister he said the return of the hostages would help win the war he said we are n'n extremely sensitive days for his rally society their turn of the hostages a moral order and also an intregral part of the risiliens that allows us to win the war it is important to say that especially these days is railly society as a whole right and left is praying in wishing for the safe re turn of the hostages apparently it is going to be largely women and children we are going to be returned at this at this time it is unclear wen exactly this is going to to stars comoss's chief is myle honea has claimd that the the truce is close and the prisoner exchange is nearly settled again thit would be a five days sees fire ano entree of three hundred eight trucks to the godstrip ige cordsis only going to prolong the war from israels for ffective the basic idea would be after five days there going back after five days that is still not over theyre still hostages wo are being held there is the possibility they'v ben talking about that the sees fire would hold for longer if comoss continues to release hostages the problem is that every day that cmoss does not release the hostages and brokers for more time they are shifting weapons around there and betting more with civilian populations there of course shipping in more she maniterrianaide that as then stolen by comos prolonging the wor sot israel's basic bargain here is that they are willing to allow for the prolongation of the conflict in order to get more of the hostages home now ther good people on both sides of that particular argument suffice it to say that the war is not over when the hostages are return the war continues until comossis eradicated and i might make it difficult it might mean that more as radly soldiers die noro get those hostages home that is the mat that israel is doing right now we should remember again this thing was initiated not by the mere taking of hostages whose initiated by the greatest single terror attack on the west since nine eleven that is what is initiated here just remind you here is a piece of tape that has now been released by these really government you will see in the stape comemoss terrace on october seven they shoot one tean age giril dad a second tean age gril they run down and a she they force her to her nees she then proceeds to beg for her life and they shot her directly in the head you can see thes comoss terrace they run that that is one girl who just got shot in in the head by a terrace the terrace than runs down th sether girl she pleads for her life on the side of the road the commoss terrace just stands there she is pleading and then you will see he raises his gun and he shoots her directly in the head killing her these ir the kind of people that israel is fighting just because his rael gets its tostages back does not mean that this war is even close to over he is th executes her nosy style there is literally inidifference beteen what this personded and what a notsy would do none the war is not over when the hostages return by the way this war is going to be broader than that because israel has a lot of enemies who wish to destroy it meanwhile i it worth noting that israel actually has avacuated babies too egypt according to the associateor press egypt state mon medius a babyes evacuated from gosesan battle sheif a hospital have now arrived in egypt remember israel suppose tobe the baby killing country while nope it turns out only one side in this conflict once dead babies and that is commoss that at least is being made clear by john curby over the national security advisery i he is saying that he was asked yesterday by it crazed reporter whether israel's comitting genicide and he is ot know i said this the other day again people can say what they want on onsid wa a ta a we respect ta that is tat the first of mements about but this war genicide's getting thrown around and a pretty interproe wa ba not to different folks e what hammos want make no mistake about it is geniside they want a white bisraelf the ap they have said publicly more than one occasion infact jus recently and theyve said that they are not in a stop what happened on the sevento tetobers can appen again and again and again and what happend on the seventh of october murd slaughter of innocent people in their homes are at a music festival that is genicidal intentions well yes obviously true thoes matter the meda are doing theire best in order to create a moral equivalence the washing con post which is just a com hospropagan ta ouled at thisplants o truly amazing a piese by habamah wose and saire at tha bouch another goss a hospital caught in fighting as storms deep an civilian misery hevy is realy bombardments counted north and southgosanmody killing more civilians and once again bringing hospitals into the krossfire tas the conflict entered its forty thif day with few signs of let up now again remember the larsuasel legssy meda claine that i'l she for hospital was not actually terras headquarters eit was a terrorous headquarters they literally dragg hossages into all shi fo hospital directly from the gossa envelope and huge swasity legsy medio not whi is it can we really trusted s a terrase a terrace had cuorsen brusa to now they are doing the same thing with intenesian hospital again the idea is that israel is targeting these hospitals the only reason isral has remote interest in these hospitals is because these are used routinely regularly as part of worse frategy by camaswhi dod the that because they know the credulous morons in the media continued to repeat that every hospital is a non military site even if the hospitl is clearly been used as a military sight en there just to man people out there wheare doing the propagan to work of comas clearly from the protestors o are out in the streets to the legs he media that something that is raily president as te curza quagan is a member of the political laft use a leader in the labor party he said this yesterday well he was on fox news we ar fase be tween hey calition of the hate a calition of they i cal in darkness which is a gehadi conition which amana fonteron with i with its proxis an ta banonin got o cos by camas in aman with the whotisan o co preating is lami can tamente gia tis an all over the world which onts tor al them of all of us if is aon one there then uro wull benex in the anited that e to shornec becaus they call a united fate the big fatan and that is why i think thos protesa a supporting hamas there there actually a complises to the whole notion that you can bucha yon children that you can sho pads of women that you can ray women and pragnentwomen that you cn op tedac all tagolca sovivas and you can do a hold bachof acrosetis and because the obain ci sapo coma that is wat they don he is right about all of that andthe'r people sing all my gosshu cans to the protest of course the hlping comas tht is theire goal ther goal is to help comass what they would is fortever seas fire is declared here to be made more permanents to leave come oss incontrol of the southern portion of the gadstrip there by to hand them a victory well they still hold hostages by the way but even if all the hostages were to be released to morrow israeld still have a moral duty to track down and kill all the members of comoque and any one else who is complicit and helps in the october seventh attacks the protestors are trying to stop that becusethey want to leave comosqe in control meanwhile the soft headed liberals in the united states they continue to focasin on the real problem and the real problem is te antisemetism of elon msque that is the thing that really matters that is thin caraswisher who i mean she just has a raging something for a for elonmusque caraswisher again she believes that she should rule all social media this is why at wone point shathaly interviewed susan susan woshkicky who is the head of a outu and she she asked seriously whether a they could possibly band myvidos from you to because it turns out the caris wisher's kid likes myvidios and shoesn't that in any case i she is now accusing bill acmen who is a major ventur capitalist of hypocrasy becaue he is defending elon musq who is not antis metic well quon quoe docsind college kids by doxing she means putting their faces on posters because they actively signed a petition in favor of comoq not the same thing here is caraswisherd again the real antisemotism is zealonmusq according to the soft headed left in the united states knone of them mot shat yoav the one who is really stod up tantisemism is caris wisher by wak those kids they are not docs no prepucll published the homodress nobody publish the fone numbers if you sign a letter youare a public person because ou have signed a public letter that is the way that works but again all the folkus has to be un muque obviously ut because we all know the real reason which the swisher jost tatesmoque and wants him take him down and whatever is the tool at at the disposal of the left they will use calling muskerasis claine n anci somi calling whatever they can do in order to take him down that is the goll it is all just convenience well folks the news has been dark and terrible of lay but i'm excited is for shifto tone here and do something i andnt we have not

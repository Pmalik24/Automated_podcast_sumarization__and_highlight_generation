we are broadcasting to day here from krackout poland flew in here on saturday night arrived on sunday nigts wo could visit aushwit is with elonmasq we ar invited by the european jewish association every year they do in event here at aushvits around the liberation of aushitz is the time a year that aushwits was liberated in nineteen forty five and i have to say aushwitzis inuncan experience i've never been there before i know that elon has not bee there before either and a we are walking the grounds together obviously being given a tour by tour guide and dom now for those who have seen images of the holicost which i would assume is petty much ove on al theg by pole numbers apparently not for for those who have seen movies about the holicost seeing the actual structures where masstafth was brought upon the jewish people as well as roma homosectuals russian soldiers it is in astonishing demonstration of the darkness that is present and possible inside the human soul and just first general impressions of what it is there and now for those who have not visited it it is worth the visit because i think that a we tendall of very easy lives thankgot in the west in the modern era wew we tend to look around us and see people who are generally good people who who generally believe in non evil things and ten you go to a place ashvits and your realized that it acsually is not all that unthinkable for the unthinkable to happen first we visited ashwits which is a much smaller aria of the actual deatfh camps than than the death camp footprint actually is the death camp footprint includes the ashwit is complex includes some forty different camps around work camp steaf camps on the aushwit is complex the centr of it where you see that famous fence the ar b m fry the work will make free which of course was a la the freedom was murder you see that when you walk in and then you walk into various buildings brick structures that had originally been built as actual barracks and that were then turned into these hellholes where they would hold a thousand people in a space that was maybe meant to hold a hundred couple hundred at bast twenty two toilets for a thousand people where the death rate in the early days before they were turned into fullskile deft camps was already twenty five per cent walk into the areas where prisoners were executed you see the basement structures where zyklon b was first tried against russian po bls befort was then turned into a tool of mass extermination against prenominently the jews nine hundred sixty thousand jews killed at ashwit is berkanal during world war too you are walking all this and it is the lowest of what humanity has to offer obviously the nou gover t berkanal which is even more astonishing eas berkanows the actual camp complex that was mean to hold tens of thousands of human beings and it expands for wot must be hundreds vakers it is it is an extrordinarily large complex they have preserved many of the structures most of the deaf camps were blown up by the notzies destroyed by the notzi's an plowed under by the notzies in an attempt to hide up what they had done aushrisberkenow obviously survived when it was liberated and these structures are now eighty years old and they are basically brick hovels in which you see bunks stacked one on top of another that are incredibly small were originally designed by the evil architects of the holicos to hold three people at a time and then were eventually expanded to hold six seven people at a time i the privilege whenize younger of helping to rte the memoirs ba holicosoriver who d actually gone through ashrusberkanow and the stories obviously are horrifying now you walk it and its empty obviously and done yel you can you can feel the darkness of the place pretty clearly and i think they now i think tha eulon obviously shought well as well bexa i do not thnk that you can walk through that place n and notse the the darkness inherent there an i think that there there a bunch of important things to be gained from doing something walking aushits berkanow anthing the first is to realize that people can be made to believe nearly anything and this holds true on decide aboth the evil peopil and m the people who are victimized by by those who were evile and one of the thngs that you see when you walk through oushfits itself the the atual complex is you see a room that is just filled with suit cases and every person who brought a suit case two aushrits though they were going tend up on packing that' suit case step by step by step european jury thought that whatever was next could not be this all the land told the final step into the gaschambers and when we criticized people for not having fought back at what point where they supposed to believe that the unthinkable was now thinkable because the unthinkable is unthinkable until precisely the moment that it becomes real an sto cautionary note ta to people who do not take the world seriously do not take politic seriously that we all ought to be at s certain level attempting to read tealeaves now can read too deeply can be too catestrophic about politics and i thinkis very easy to fall into tat when doom scroll on very social medea services but it ise also important to recognize that as refying tupoon ias reading the memoirs of o victar clemper whose german jew who lived in dresdin asually and he kep tese memoirs all the way through world ware to can it u living pastworld wore to an into the sovia domination of eastern europe and every step of the way in his memoirs he seems to think whell maybe things are ging to be oque maybe it maybe this will reverse itself and even when he becomes tosparing he never things that is going to turn to this and there is very little limit to the evil that can be created in the human heart that evil can only be masked by ideology ideology absolutely matters it absolutely matters to truly understand happen tin ashrisberken now you have to understand german history in european history eft t understand european antisemitism and then the first and most fundamental thing to understand about antisemetis m in the modern era which again if your oshras berk no thitswhat you have to talk about that the first and most fundamental thing tounderstand out as hissemetism is that at root it is conspiracy theory about power when you read the ritings of hitler when you read writings that preceed hitler by fifty sixty seventy years antismetic writings when you read these writings what you see s that there is a conspiracy theory about jews this conspiracy theory is that the powerful in every industry are jewish that they are part of it in evil conspiracy and that the only reason that they have gained power is through some sort of perverse macination and that therefore they must be extrpated they must be destroyed now thereis a recognition that it cannot be religious jewery because it turns out that the people thad many industries in prewere europe are not religious jews their jewish by ethnicity but doere not practicing many of them were converts to protestantism or even catholicism but because jews were just proportionately represented at the top of many major industries particularly in major cities around europe they represent a heavy percentage of places berlin warso because of that there is a theory of power in the theory power suggested they were the exploiters that they had riged the system on their own behalf nd tat therefore they had to be destroyed and that ideology a self justifying ideology whereby the people you are about to kill are actually the true victimizers which is why of course they have to be killed wen that particular ideology is seductive and it easy to replicate does not mean the holicostes can be replicated to mrrow thing anybody thinks that the holicost is can be replicated to morrow god forbid but the ideology the breeds the victimisation of jews among other sub groups that ideology is very much alive well and with us and i thing one of the things that we tend to see when we see places ashrus berken out is the the extent of the horror is unthinkable and unimaginable that it means tht we tend to cut it off from the rest of sort of human relations we tend othing oca this is an outlier is just as crazy statistical outlier when in reolity it is just the culmination of a continuum of theory that has been present on earth for literally thousands of years going all the way back to the book of exitous the same things that pharaoh is saying about the jews that there rising in numbers in power tat they are threat to us that same stuff is being repeated by hitler in nineteen thirty five and its being repeated by some people to day ideology absolutely matters and to understand what happen to ashus berken iav to understand the ideology to understand the threats to the west you have to understand ideologies that are pernicious wrong and yes evil elon and i visit oushas we visit bercanow and then we and of going over to the local double try hotel which is where the e ja a actual even is taking place and i had the the privilege of interviewing elon onst age now first all i should tell you i thing tht elon is an incredibly good harted person now having met him this is the first time menmin person but we wev spoken before obviously now having having dealt with him elon is by nature a problem solving engineers the thing that he does its what is made him world famous he is a person who solves problence who sees things through a very anale ic frame and that analytic frame means that he is both a risk taker and also somebody who i think is pretty clear eyed about when at problem is a problem the how to solve that prom that leads him to a shocking level of moral clarity mi true truly i think that that elans understandsing of of morality is instinctively veory its it is instinctively quigood which is obviously very diffent then what the med is telling you with immedi ir telling you about elan legs i media they have theyhae a stake in degrading eln as as a human being largely because elan threatens their frame elan is obviously both a product and a creeater of the free market a elan is rich which according to many the mediu makeshim inherently bad elan is somebody whos a free speech advocate which according to the media again makes him bad because he does not gate keep the way they would for him to gate keep or the way the da gate keep and they have been targening him on a wide vridy of issues nearly al of which i think ar ar fully speecious on a get to the discussion that i had with t elan in just one second first a sock about something lighter how you hirer obviously we have accompany

smartest way to hire hayso o back to this visit we set down together and we had a a wide ranging conversation about various topics including some the ideologies that lead to evil action one of the things that we discussed at fair length was diversity aquidine inclusion and d e i which of course sounds very happy face d e i is the basic thesis that i gain the world is driven by powerdynamics that virtually every system is a power dynamic system that free speech is actually just a stands in for power that free markets are stands in for power that those who are successful in these systems are actually perpetuators of this system four their own exploitative power that is a dangerous theory by the way that that theory not versity equan inclusion but the idea that power lies behindall systems exists on the right as well as not unique to the left it in materializes in ratial ways on the left it materializes in sort of bizare populist classways on the right the idid the firxsampl capitalism is a tool of the globalist rich a that sort of nonsense exists on all sides of the political ile but d e i which is the most threatening version of this form tfrticgling on the political left it helps explain why for example you see a giant coalition of people harprohamas and one of things tht i asked yelon about was the fact that in the after maff october seventh an elon of course visited israel ofter october seventh he visited the areas in which mas slaughter of jews left wing ous bylay took place in israel bychamas he still wears the necklas in honor of the people who are kidnap by hamas an hors to being held in captivity and dome and you see people in the lest marching on behalf of members of camas and i asked him about that because obviously the only rasionow for queers for palisin or example el g b t people who are suggesting that they have solid ara people would literally murder them first chance they got in the goss a strip is this d i theory that there is the system of power that must be torn to the ground and that crosses streams very stronglythantisemitism because after all if you are making the case that there is a group of people with disproportionate power along rashal lines thath nick lines religious lines and that the are therefore the the oppressers in the exploiters that crosses streams very quickly with antisemitism which is why by the way a harvard haris pole that we discuss last year found that sixty seven per cent of those aged between eighteen and twenty four called jews in oppressor class and ideology matters folks and has deadly consequences ellgets the actual discussion with elon in just one second first if youre me there is not a day that goes by the do not call or tec somebody they actually care about my

slasher puro pure talk dot com slashress which over that phone coverage sto a company that actually likes you i ay we sat down together and we started by discussing d i hears what it sounded the ti versely equito inclusion idealege thebay sically suggest that all of society is a vast puramid of group identity and that athe very tom are the people wore successful and that those people are expliting everybody else whom e can ell the successful by the identity not by the loveles success by the rup identity an and metches up incredibly sinks u almost avendi mari sartai antisemitism absolet the divesi ectracrusio rejoicee always be wary of any man thatsos i ci culd come out of he torge or well o as never a good signs a and a because it sounds sure diversthe equity ces tesal sound i wods that what what really means is discrimination in the vase o rase a sexon an sechal intcation and and and it is a gaste merit an nd and thus i think is finamentalle anticimaty a ye an ta i think itthatthe whole all of tisi orld all of the riots that were in the an ma ju saese an college apesis i think wi ad a shockin wake a polse an i thin any any any sir civilization the civil minded peson now obviously i think you'illunstake on d i is exactly right and it is dangerous becaue again any theory that suggests that principle is really just a mask for guiss of power and there is a cotery of you lead people who are standing behind that system when if im mat y freemarke to system win romity free system for example or a free speech system when you make that suggestion what you really suggesting is that any one who is successful is a victimizer and as a victimizer they therefore ought to pay some sort of price this why you see all these streams crossing in the d i left is why you see blacklizes matter protesting for ort uncal palistine this is why you see people who are socialist for protesting on behalf of some of the least socially responsible people on planed earth and you on talked in those terms more broadly with regard to for example this sort of reversal of morality whn it comes to weakness verses strength wone of things that weve been seeing inthe modern world is this at tempt to read strength as evil and weakness as virtue that is it that is a despicable morality because it is not moral at all in fact it is directly antibeblical e bible specifically says that if youare a judge you are not allowed to favor either the poor or the rich why doesthe bible suggest they are not lowed to favor the poor when the suggestion by left as that you willever favor the poor afr afrather poor and powerless they answer is because virtue and wealth are not necissarily connected i know very virtuous people who are poor i know very virtuous peoplewho are rich and i know many people whoare not virtuous for both poor and and rich as well and that makes a difference when it comes to world politics and makes a difference when it comes to the sorts of things the etent if you believe that the weak are inherently virtuous and what that means that the system itself has made them weak and the system must be torn down and people who porport to uppold the system must be destroyed that is how all this connectsid visiting place atressburk ow that conspiracy theory is very much alive and well here as yelan talking about weakness fors his strength and morality well i i think we really to to stoff thes principl that the the weaker nom nony we cur party is always right thi si simply not true an if you are not its a press ors or the weaker pary it does not mean your right an because it some of thes you now we weaker a grus once innihilate you that does not make him good utis ge have to get rid of the rule that that if you weak ar your ordimatically good that is

good things do they wont to murder inent people that is that his matter who they are in just a second on a gets to elons perspective when it comes to free speech and act which of course has been used as ay as a rasion ow by the mediate to attack elan among others first i've been talking baut he looks mattressfors i had the honesto the i am missing my he loiksleep mattress right now because i am

battersleep starts right now agay then elan ni discuss freeom of speech one of the cretigs of eln and acts is that when elan bought ax he opened it up he broaden the called overton window the the the window of acceptable speech and e lon has tried to pursue the broughtest possible speech that he believes is is legal i which make sense because twitter was originally founded to be a sort of town square and then it became instead the preserve of a select group of self appointed moral police officers who would not alliwe to say true things and i asked him one of the critiques of that has been while are not yougoing to alow more bad speech as well as good speech on ac and that includes theoretically more anthe is meta commentary on acts and i asked yeulon about this and hears what he had to say had you balance the necessity for free speech with with all these critiques to dow what is hi speech what is antisemitisinan and had he balance that well tthi tegers of the tha comist anar peec

a maxme re sourcees in te tention i community notes body trest to prisho false ti colicoso il of something lik that they can immediateletely correc again it is helons prspective on free speech that has made him at porsonan on grada in many of the halls of of power with regard to for temple government and legacy media if you look back forth threeven years at ulons public profile elons public profile was very much beloved of media and for insanely good reason this a person who is not built one or too but three of the biggest companies and world history he helpd build paypally has she created company called extot calm than emerging with pay powe which was time on my petertheo sow's a huge company and then he found ted on the back of that he invested his money into spasacs and tesla a brocket company with the goal of creeding human colonization on mars in order to broaden the scupe of human survival and to make provision for the possibility something bad happening on this planet which is just an amazingly audacious concept obviously and he actually has materialized that in the form of a profitable company that now carries ninety per cent of global payload into space which is just amazing and insane and that that is that is crazy of course that is genius level stuff and h ulon if you n anything about him has been deeply involved in every aspect of the engineering process mean down to what materials ought to be used in the rockets and all the rest he builds that and then he builds tesla and he works with somebody to to start testlan than hans o taking it over and turning it into the most proftable car company in the history of man actually because it is largely based on the tack not juspaced on these sales of the car at the aid it is being generated in order to do things self driving is just insane makes better and easier for tonsan tons of people and's te media loved him read you's this ontropenorial figure who 'd come out of basically nowhere and then he buys act and by buying ac he threatens the destructures he streat he threatens the people who were the gatekeepers and a second i 'm to bring you oulon to answers to questions about what was going on with the lgsy met a why they have reversed course on him and why he is now the villain in their little morality plain just one second first think abot youre favorite child memory that you caught on film or vidotap thre's really not a great way to share that in ou've got that in the garage somewhere youout a bunch of film reels from your grand parents do you have a film projector in your house ou

what you had to say about what he is trying to do over it act leggasy media has spent an awful out of ink on you there is een a lot of attempts to paint you as as hismetic or paint ex as antisymetic where do you think that is coming from well why why does the legasy media seemd to have you perticularly and last year dto have i in in the cross her much well having the rrealityis that ex is

thirty san astionon heother hand ex went up rouhly thet san roghly twenty titysa sos e direct competition for peoples a tantion now flow of in formation matters and one thing that that oulon i think his very clear on and was focastin i know specifically yesterday when we visited ashfit was how l free flow of information when cut off actually leads to the multiplication of evil that when you actually cut off the sources of information you can make room for misinformation that both misleads the public as far as the bad things tht are happening the world and also a lows truly powerful people to manipulate the narrative and that is incredibly dangerous i asked in about this in the contect of what is going on right now in the gosipstrep because as i say you lon i think in in morally righteous fashion visited the villages that ave been burned out by hommoss for twelve hundred people ware killed to unfortyd people were taken prisoner still almost a hundred people bein capt in captivity that is an ongoing war and and i asked you lon about the the fact that there is no informational flow in place select the gosipstrap than in fact in doctrination and miseducation of young people can lead to a significantly worse world here is what ye had to say about education in the gosipstrep the education of kids an gosa a the tindocformation of hate intecates in gosa has t has to star sits you knw when i as in is railies sit tat that was my toprecmadation is tha better make sure in ean iam sanded eat for to tin invate osan unfortunately summonis o people wil di is no way round it but that the the most important thing is to ansure that afterwards that ithe doctor mation which gets a tort from as soon as they can undrs that language that the goll is to cul is ras and an matu toll that from when yeur cotle will tyou get a beleve it that meats to star over all it was just i'm still profising the dadigosity it is it was heavy going in now again i've never been to this particular part of the world i spent years reading about it a lot of my extend fallic every jou a lot of my extended family lost their lives in this part of the world during the holicost we have letters to my grandmother myt my dadsmom from members of her family from eastern europe in the lead up to to the holicost and yo she lost large segments of her extended family over here and even flying into the area is e emotional and difficult visiting outhfits obviously is emotional and difficult and terrifying in all the things meaniit is all the things and then doing that with you lan mosk yo again in in a modern ear a looking at a world that sometimes can seem unbelievably dar i think i thing was an inspirational thing for free lontogod ashfits i think that the conversation that we had was was important i think again that when we talk about the true dangers to the world particularly in the west right now the idea logical dangers to the last are greater than they have been at any time in my lifetime i'm i'm relatively young i jus turn forty and in my lifetime i've been privilege to live in the freest society in world history america's an unbelievable placesan unbelievable tolerant open place were people have the freedom to succeed where maritocracy is the rule of the day and as that is quash and as people oppose that as people try to craft weird and bazar left and right conspiracy theories about the inability of people to get ahead to blame the peoplewho are successful in the free market not not by manipulating leavers of government successful in the free market to blame the free market it is elf to blame the maritocracy to suggest that there is there ther exploitative groups that there are a threat to the the population that is something that i have not experienced in my lifetime and coming here being reminded of the wages of of evil ideologies and and coming here again with elan i think good for ulon i'm and i itwas an honor to be to be asked to to come and and do this then i'll gain just one second in n get to the new hampshr primaries those of course are happening to day i think the end of this road is a forlong conclusion all explaining

to day marks the new hampshire primar and this is basically nickey haley's lastshit nickey haley has to win this outright if nickey haley finish a second two donal trump in new hampshire then the race is over for her becaus there in a head down to south carolina and she is probaly in a looser home state two trump by all available pulling data trump as well ahead of her in north i in south carolina but he also happens to be ahead of her in new hampshire and that there is some pules ually badly rated puls that that have nickey haley competitive in new hampshire the latest pulls that iave seen the ones that that real clear politics takes seriously enough to put in their average all those have trump up thritty wel l ahead of nikee haly the latest traffel gar pull has trump up fifty eigh thirty six over nicke haily the bost in gloob suffolk pull has mup fifty seven thirty eight over nicke haly inside or advantage has ment sixty two thirty five over nickee haley and again let jus be clear about this the republican prity once trump i mean its just that simple now i may wish that things hade gone differently i supported ron to santis as at as a voter if ihad had a vote in the primaryes i wouldhave voted for governor to santis as i said he is the best governor in america a move to florita at least in part because ron to santis had kept the state open because ronissans help make florta ausum and having that levelo governments extended to the federal govrnment i think woul ave ben great i thnk whehav been beft president of anybody in the pack the republican voters did not agree and do not agree by polling dato republican voters wont seeson ine of thetrumpshot that wont to see trump run again they want to see trump beat jobne theyr lookin at the pulling data and what they ar currently saying is thet donald trump is actually leading jobidon in a statistically significant way the latest harvard heris pule has donald trump up fifty three forty seven over jobidon which is mostly fascinating because it means that trump is actualy breaking fifty per cent in more than one pull at this point and by the way in their general sor of republican primary pules and those ones are the ones there to being released after to santus dropped out of the race willget s that a second though those pulls had trump up in the republican national primary by sixty pluss points over to santis and second and haley in third the national pulling numbers for trump continue to be durable that is the reason why trump is thenominate if donald trump or trailing jobine by ten points in al the pules and if ronissans were beating jobine by three points in all the pules i thnk this race looks totally different but basically since march the republican base has been brought into line on trump because of the unjust cases that are being brought against him in a wide variety of jurisictions it feels legal espionash against the trump campagn and republicans get that and the way that they are fighting back against that is biy sanglest give him the nomination i got that you can se that the poingdat beyond that the fact that trumpeted en durable against fight and takes away the chief but ton that fellow republicans could use against him for brief moment an time novmember twenty twenty two it seemed as though the republican party was finally declaring the donnel trump was likely to make them lose that he had lost in twenty twenty he had lost in twenty twenty one in george sentere raceis twenty twenty two undeally porly and twenty twenty four whie why do this thing again and then as jobidon began to sink slowly into the mier it became clear republicans that actually trump could win and i trump can win thre's no reason to nominate somebody else not only that a wide swath of republicans believe that for good reasons and ill that the twenty twenty election was not was not correctly decided that in fact trump one or should have one or that the rules were changed in e order to make jobidon win which actually is sowhatrup some people believe what i think his not troue proposition tat it was just pure electoral frought whatever it is republicans are basely treating donal trump asn't in cumpin in this race and because he n comen in this race is getting in cumment tight numbers in this race ot that that was made clear by the facts that ta rondosantis dropped out of the race over the weekend here as governor to sancis tropping out by the wy this is the reght mof he did not have a paftfulwordon nout of path new hampshire he would not have path in south carolina getting out now makes san any's getting a lot of flack which will get to an a second for his campagn in the first place i think a lot of that flack is entirely mis guided meaning that the theory of the campaign which is that re publicans had basically gotten tired of all the antics from trump and wre ready to moves the next thing that was not false in january february it became false as democrats targeted trump for destruction and republicans rallied round trump and the fact that he ran agains trump i do not think that there is anything wrong with running against onald trump in the primaries and all all the can n trump fans were angrade other people for running agains trump why why especially because again it was refrendom trump one the refrendum net fend of the story but the fact that that desansis would have made i think a better present and more effective president than trump was in his first trurmer would be in a second term again you can reject that that is fime that 'is not mean that that desanis tanking wrong by running i also the the're mistakes that thet dessanis campagn made for sore me cans hav out literally every non victorious campaign but were those mistakes the telling factor or was suggest that by palling tad a seventy per cent of republicans really love trump puriod and of story in anycase heristo sanis tropping out in doing he indorsed donal trump for the presidency over nickey hayley whois sort of become the because she is the only non trump candidate left in the race she 's become sort of the cuonic candidate of the establishment which again is a little strange only in the sense that nickey hayley was nonal trumps ouan ambassador is i she' some sort of stranger to trumpism a she she may be more in line with ou's a bush erup conservatism an she softer in affect a much much of re publican pulsic pbeblly is affect and nickey hayley is actually to nonal trumps right when i comes to economic matters rites she tends to be a little more free trade she tends to be more interested in reforming entitlements for example she is to his left me be on social issues although unclear because donal trump himself has not made himself clear on social issues when it comes to say abortion or simsex marriage shust as more squishy in affect bec she is more squishy and affect that means that she is been tags with the establishment label but dessantis i think in dorseis trump for good reason here and that his trump is going to be the nomine why was you indorse the candidate it was not going to be the nomina in the face of that here is here is governor o sansus tho following our second place finished and i alwave praye and deliberateed on the way forward if there was anything i could do to produce a favorable outcome more campaign stops more interviews i would do it but i cannot ask our supporters to volunteer their time and do not ait their resources if we do not have a clear path to victory accordingly i am to day suspending my campaign i'm crowd to have delivered on one hundred perset of by promises i well not stop now it is clear to me that a majority of republican primary voters wanto giv donald tromp another chance they watch this presidencse gets tyme by relentless resistance and they see damicrets using lawfare thess day to attackim whi've had this agreements with donal trump such as on the corona virus pandemic and his elevation of anthony fauchy trumpis superior to the corrining combent jobydin that is clear i sin the pledge to support the republicanomeny t i will honor that pledge now thes orn orsemen because we cannot go back to the old republican guard of yester year now again thes sort of old republican guard talk is something i do not know whohe sold republican guard is persailing some names would be useful whenever people talk the old republican arvers is the new republican guard i'm switing down from was the president he is the current republican guard in i period is now as the down from is the wave of of the future nonal from is the present and also the past little bet because he was the president just a few years ago and nat was twenty sixteen it is now twenty twenty four for at least almost last decade republican polisices in dominaed by trump in any case here is non from congratulating to santis before we begin i'd to take time to congratulate rondesantis and aforse ereally terrific pers gotn no his wife casy for having run a great campaig tropresidedey re a really good campaign i will tell you it is not easy they think it is easy toing this stuff right is not e but as he left the campaign trail to day a three pieman in doing he is very gracious ait he indus me i aand it is amazing trump again what fruom thinks in the moment is what from thinks in the moment but he switches from casy i disancs is terrible rondiscance is terrill everys terrible ron do sanctimonious nonit to he man great campgn in lake this fas but that is what from has to do trum does need to consolinate the party behind him i think the party is consoliting behin him i think that is what is likely to happen in the new h amser primary to day and the polling shows that heis well out ahead and if he were not to be the nominy now be an act of god frankly at this point if the the the halfe be an act of god from not to be phenominae the epublican party is in a consolinate as they should behind donal trump to be the person against tobind oan run this thing back and woeng to do it all over again now there is one thing that is worth noting here an the mediae coverage of tis hantis dropping out there is a lonoscornful medea coverage this being dropped on disantis today for example i'm in maheldin just the terrible commentator oron emasan be se bhan i repeet myself becausang an amas im he 's filled the terrible commentators s a gin red basket filled with terrible commentators here is iman mahelden ripping on rondesantis and his campaign for to governor ron to sant is the man as heraldit as the future of the republican party the called araparent to the maga movemint bowing out of the race for present he suspendes his campaign a short suspended his campaign a short tum time ago a bringing it an to what are the most embarrassing in this astrous tupe primary showings in moderat american political history the move cons just two days before you havturs primary contest where he was projected the finish well behind both former preser boutal trump in for are you at abottert make ehave me that they could not be happier s on the one hand i think this decautionary note for republicans willseen a second democrater prepared to roll out their antitrum strategy it is been their entire strategy for the past several years get trump to be the nominy again then run against trumpan again be careful what you wish for politics is the monkeys paw what you wish for very often ends up being the curse against you but the amount of sgoin theire paint there thei're pouring on to santis is demonstrative of the fact that they actually do not believe otocrapic the said byu trump when they say that trump is the most threatening political figure in american his try when they say that he is a hitlarian musolenias figure when they save this sort of stuff they do not believe that thing if they believe that thing then presumably they would hav ben a lot more supportive of the chief rivals two donal trump but they ware not they are more than happy to watsh those people go down in flames for fon profit and political motivation and t because to them all publicans are te same and this this is is the thing that funny bout trump with all of the talk about hodonal trumpes out ofthe box and crazy and dos wild stuffan and he does he does wild crazy stuff pritical antueer when when he does those things he is treated in the pulling generic are he is treated generic republican which is ly his puling is non differentiatable from to santis in terms ofe against jobidon he runs kind of the same as to santis helley runs a little bit ahead tbecause i think the american public is not is familiar with halien against his that softer affect then trump or tisantis but if you look at downs froms pull numbers in for example twenty sixtee when rans ran against tillery they look almost exactly the same as mit romnes pull numbers in twenty twelve when youlook at his pull numbers in twenty twenty he performs generic republican may be a little better in the rural areas and that is because the left treats him as generic republican or to put in another way whoever the republicanomine was he was going to be treated or she as the ultimate form of the destroyer as the evil destroyed because that is every election cycle with regard to legse mediat and with the democrats o case speaking of the the strategy that is going to be rolled out here by the democrats one of the thngs the're con try to do is jugitzu a lot of critiqes of jobidon into critiques of donal trump the umber one obvious critiquof they'r really two critices of durbiton one is that he is barely alive and the other s that he is bad president it is very hard to argue with he is bad president cause he really is a very bad president he has been terrible domestically he has been pretty awful in terms of form policing worsethan froms of form policy than he has domestically and what the democrats are going to focas on is tried to defang the other prong of the attack right the senile and bad of the job they cannot really argue bad of the job cause he is not goa the job they cannot argue seenol you say yourself wait how can they argue that jobiden is clearly non complismentus he is not functional any more an he just is not i men you watch him in publicates it is thad as an american i ud for our president to least be able to speakful sentences without running the risk of of having a fullon physical gllabs what is democrats have the response there response is yat trump its to that is goin to be the response response that trump is also somebody who is non compos mentus they are basing this this week on a on a event that trump was doing and trump at least is doing events meen jobdon's schettuel looks this wake up at nine ofclock in the morning meeting at ten secure y riving at ten noon one pree planed event two lid furthe day and that that is what a day loos for jobidon and then presume ble's back to the old age home for a little bit of of water robecs and then some outloch before they put him to sleep trump's doing events but the other day trump was doing is speech and he mixed up nicky haley and nancy polosy for whatever reason here is what a townd od by the way that never report the crowd on january six eton dicky haly nicky haley nicky hailey do they did they destroyed all the information aller the evidence ov ithin deleaded at destroyed al of it all of it because of lots of things dicky haley is in judge of security we offerer ten thousand people on gat this is whll whe cholly brain frt yes the te mean he is in saying it does not he he does not know the difference he nancy polo in nicke haly and that that is at tha's a brainpart and it happens all the time an again you ont a say that don trumps in a state of decline ou have de show me a market difference between dolem frum twenty sixteen and dons frum twenty twenty four i do not actually see a giant market difference if i played you back to back tape of trump twenty sixteen and trum twenty twenty four they look very similar if i playd you back to back tape of of jobidon twenty sixteen and jobidan twenty twenty four the are radically different as much as i am not a jobidon fan jobidon at least used to be a person who as fluent with human verbiage in an outlook as fral and an attenuous as he does right now that is toe brainpart but the mediate aside this is evidence that he is just as he is just as off as rocker and losing it just as in a state of decline as as jobidon is here is john carls trying to make that case that moment which by the way the bidon campaign has already cut in to it ad e's really something dol trump is cruly concused about who ni cin haly his thinks somehow the she was i'n charge of security at the capital in canuary six clelly confusing her with vancy plosy but we have seen him confuse o jo bidin with brock o boma he thinks that he beat o boma we saw one point he talked about how a bidong was goingto get us into old work too a that theat there has been that there any moments there've ben a moments in thre've been several moments on the campan trail a where were he has seemed ay ni may out of it again this attempt now to reverse polarity with regard to whosy anala who is not i do not think that is conplay but thie's what they have to do there can have to attack trump on that and presume ly the growing to attack him on the criminal front now gan i think that is baked into the cake see an end manoraju spen spende his day very often tracking down republicans to comment on other republicans to gain that does not seem to be replicated with democrats very often when ill han omar says something deeply ntismetic you do not see manoraju oremembers the media tracking down every democrat senter and asking for their opinion when when jobidon does something truly aw inspirallings aw inspiringly stupid heyu do not see a rush to capital hell to get comment from every democratic dcenter but manoragou deside to go ask bunch republican senators if the wouldstill vote for trump if you were convicted criminally and there a sort of various answers to this the most obvious answer is well yes he is the republicanominy against jobidon a criminal conviction would not change the underlying opinion is to what he did or did not do ay ah i can think all the things i thnk about donal trump and his short comings in froms a character and still recognize for example that the fany willist cases craft that does not make any signs tor the jacksmith january sixth case is a legal stretch beyond nearly all imagination but any caseis now this t this is the the campaign the campaign is goin to be for the democrats about how trump is really kind of losing it and also is a criminal an in good luck with this pitch i do not hink ton workle that well if you cand be convicted befor o am er which i still support im them was is apons to o wi i es i wi witatsluce or that sentery gen e crimer o if is convic te it te convicted toan you suppor e o to te th o totally trom o trorces i will suppor omany e hit wato present tro what begets te and convicted ou sil supart w crosse e e facts matter aati inin e loe what te tharges i yo what in it is convict ted wha was he in victed e i think hese thinks batter i get now all those are the right answer but democrat sem to believe that if thing grab a criminal conviction m an that thats can be their day of such mackana is is if there is a hand of god coming down into the story it is going to be trumping criminally convicted first of all i'm not sure the time ine allows for that a it is not clear that any of these cases are going t come to a conclusion be foor the actual election takes place the the only real possibility is the jacksmith case jacksmith is trying to accelerate that trump is trying to slow that down post the election it looks those george or charges are last too long for them to materialize i it before the lection it loos the florida cases can be delayed beyond the election really the only shot they haves that jacksmith case and that one is really legally tenuous not only is it legally tenuous it does raise the january six questions all over again which i think is what democrats want they love to discuss january sixth endlessly but i mean let us be real about this there are still some unanswered questions about january sixth for example the thet there is now tape outside the d n s that is at least somewhat strange i mean it raises questions wus put it that way one of the big things that happen on january sixth apparently is that there are a couple of hipe bombs that were put outside the denci and the arinsey and we have not heard a lot about that since january sex and not not quite as spictacular n vidio is those giant scenes of of riots outside the capital building on people breaking windows whortever but more dangerous by the way pipe bombs are men to kill people and these story on the pipe bombs seems tobe getting weirer and e weirers represent of thomas massey of kentucky he is accusing the government of a cover up he says if there weren indeed two operable pipe bombs tht be the biggest threat that existed on january six that does not make any sente why they wouldnt be promoting that thread to advance the narrative unless they had something to do wit the pipe bombs their tring memory ole the whole thing to avoid embarrassment t's apparently there is vidiott's been identified by massey showing officers reacting nonchalantly after being notified of the pipe bomb milling slowly round the area youven letting kids walk in the area vice president commella harris was in the building at the time the do j did not really let that be known at the time massy says you woud think thyd be focused on these pipe bombs but they are not and i mean they really are not meen the last time you hear out the ipe bombss is from massey ore not hearing about about it from democratsly at all not only that the bomb planter apparently is using itself on but data from mself on company was deemed corrupted the efpa was not table to find any records for the suspect i mean tey that theyve lock down who every person was who is in the capital building theire aresting them and puttng them in jail for years on end but you plantic pipe bomb outside the encier ar and see that' actual deadly thread of violence and we still cannot find who exactly did that that is weird again those sorts of questions are our going to to be asked during this campaign because this will be at the center of the campaign yet again now's that good for trump i iwling's amazing thing if this campaign is held over january sexi think that that probably damages trum politically does damage rem enough to overcome the fact that jobidon is bad at the presidenting i have serious serious doubt already in just one second we are going to jump into

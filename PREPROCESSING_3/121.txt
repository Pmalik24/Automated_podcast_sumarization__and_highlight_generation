stagnating in the poles jobidon turns to the race card to try to get out his political fung the left con siders another round of covered craziness and doal trumps ganuary six trial date is set for the day before super tuesday i'm been spere of the sis ventupuro sho tachosponserbackspesspe pian thousands o my liters hav already secured the netrickday to join them expresspe pianti calum sleshmon people really really really are not interested in a jobid in donald trump match up for twenty twenty four by every available pule and yet that is likegly beyond likely at this ont to be the actual matchup going into the twenty twenty four election and by the polling dat u people really do not either one of these candidates according to the associateor presse president jobidon is old and confused form president donal trump is corrupt and dishonest those are among the top turms americans use when they asked to describe the democrat in the wite house and are publicans best position to face him in next year's election the zenuwpooll pole from the associate press and arcey center for public affairs recearch for bidon of larges share of uusidells mentioned his age at eighty bidon just three years older than trumpety also looks hes half dead trump meanwhile has been eliciting words at corrupt and crooked fifteen byke fifteen per cent bad andother negative comments about elevin per cents lir an dishonest eight per cent bout eight per cent offered generally positive comments good the general break down here is that when it comes to jobidon twenty six per cent a respondence use words old or outdated to described bidon another fifteen per cent mention things slow or confused another ten per cents gave generally negative comments about the president six per cent used words corrupt and crooked only six per cent offered words president and leader and five per cent strong and capable even among democrats twenty eight per cent mentioned his age significantly hire than leadership or strength and capability trumps negative comments according to the apy sent are not on ege ut on his moral standing and conduct along with things loud mouth which was six per cent and angr crazy and dangerous six per cent narcicist six per cent five per cent used words strong and capable sixty two per cent of american say thy've an unfavorable opinion of trump which is not a good recipe flinningan election fifty two per cent say the same thing about jobidon also not in a mazing stap for wining an election once again we are going to run a couple of very very unpopular people against one another in the odd belief by both sides that the other gui is waymore unpopular than their own guy and therefore your own guy really doen't matter and you cannot lose lut here is the problem for jobidon jobiden candlers if jobidon were somehow to lose to donald trump it would be the single worst defeat for democrats of my life tin and worse than twenty sixteen when trumpy tillery clinton because nobody aftily thought trumples gan a win that one but now everody understands the trump can win that one bidon somehow loses to donald trump post january six post is twenty twenty tefeet post all the rest of the stuff there be the single most humiliating defeat for democrats in my life time and probably ever which means that jobidons in a little bit of trouble careiman if you look at the real cler politics pulling average in the trump verses bidon race and again it is very early sot's not as though it is definitely can be trum for bidon but you have to look it the frumt runners for bot parties right now right now jobidon in the real copalsic polling averages of just one per centage point just one according to emerson trump is actually up two points forty six to forty four now do i believe that it is actually quite that close i do not the reason being when you look under the top line of these staffs very often what your seeing for exampleers stat yesterday came out that sjowd jobiding tor sixty one per cent my norty support that is not going to be the actual number when the election comes round no democrat has won less than seventy per cent of minority support for probably four decades but with that sat is a selection too close for comfort for jobidon youbat creen john per was asked about this poing that i showing that even democrats to think that jobidon is old slow and not with it here is her answer er we ou ja wull i precate the question i get i get it often as and toe what i would sayind i send tos many times an many of my collges ap sent this the president says this if you watch him if you seen wher he is down e last two years this is the president has had a historic administration in just two years if she look cant the thirteen poi thirteen poin time when the thirteen poin cimomilion jobs that he is been able to create if you look at how he is been able to turn the economy aroundst at it works fror midtle class americans yet avoid the question avoid the questioncause she cannot say he is obviously vigorous s that is obviously untrue but she is pointing to quon quote the accomplishments well the truth is that that iskin the matter as much for jobidon as donald trump's accomplishments mattered for him in twenty twenty donald trump could ave pointed to all the amazsing things did over the course of the first three years of his administration before twenty twenty and he did some of that but in the end people youbasically voted in a rough randam ondonald trump as a human and the same thing is going to happen to jobidon and while she is out there saying that jobidonis with it everything is fine jobid is coughing into his hands and shaking hands with people and geting weirdly close with teen ajers in being jgeneral lies elderly weirdo couking in his hands s caukinoer anoer anover i manage s keeps si shakin hands with the folks weralse must be very word about covit by the way that is that is something elsetit will get into in just one second meanwhile the hundred questions are not going away the whide housegana continued to ig nore them creen johm pierre she am she was asked about hunter biden again because remember the pleadyold broke down which means that now presumably there should be an investigation into were hunter bidon got all of his foreign money and whether he violated the foregn agent's registration at if there is anybody work their sault in this proscutor's office which we will see i have doubts then they have to ask the retty obvious question which is he was selling access to joe what kind of access was that i'll creen john pearising an answer that question feteri an fiften dow now mut mow to speging yor hunter biden in mo ospan intiaters nter bis frr refoln ar to per t t gosn

questions about jobi e being toolds for the job and to crapiton bad at it the nokan answering questions about the fact that hunter biness pretty obviously money wandering imn it is prettywhen you are selling paintings for five hundred thousand dollars apiese and the people buy those paintings are magically getting appointments to daddye's administration that is a little weird is it not a little but wer but you ont answer any questions about that and is can get worse for jobidon before it gets better ceve mc carthy apparently is no launch in impeachment inquiry in september according to brightbart mc carthy as initiated strategies to opening sweeping in peachment inquiry intobie to uncuber the depth of his involvement in his familys for in dealings going multipble republican sourceas they told sanan tmc carthy previously demanded the bidin come clean about is involvement thec carsent has continued stone long lie about is family's business over sixteen times going o the house oversit committee none of this is going away and by the way september is next month we are in the mddle of it right now ore about to hits in just a few days all of this none of this is very good for jobidon and he is pulling out some old stand bys stretegically speaking wl get to that momentarily first you have probably te had a hard go of it if youa bit ofspall business owner since coveent it is

or one eight for three refuns terms and conditions do upplit a gat when cursed by an unpopular candidate democrats go back to the well and in that play book over the past several years they have had two big playes play number one all of our oponents aur racis they are now attempting to use this playbook with regard to this herrific shooting in jacksonvill where a a person woas on a seventy to hour mental hold a couple of years ago ovy somebody with with some prete significant emotsional problems and also happen to be a neonatzy i put a bunch of suastacas on his gun and then went to a dollar general and shot three black people horrifying story rondasantis showed up in town in order to pay tribute to those people and pledge to help out the local community and all of the rest and the democrats an immediate immediately spontison to get another story of evil republican white racis soys he is people rondo santis who cause some nut job to pull the trigron black people steeve peoples who is the chief political reporter for the ap who she should be fired for the sweet honestly legf if they have any level objectivity whatsowever he should be fired for the sweet quote rondossanti scolfed when the en doublacy p issued a travel advisery the spring wonning black people to use extreme carre of traveling to florida just three months later to santis leading his state through the aftromathfracis attack te left three african americans dead black leaders in florda and a cross the nation say thei'r outrage by his actions and redric ahead of the shooting my story with brendon farrington o get this absurd coverage that is absurd coverage because rondo santis and his schoolboard said that they weren put together in educational corrculum free of critical race theory which is not in fact history it is a bunch of anti american propaganda and because they did that apparently there is a neonazy who shot three black people in the state of florida and rondissantis responsible for that according to steve peoples and the associated press which is an insane take but at all it is also the take that democrats are going s are using here is the endoblacy p jacksonville president i say a rumlin saying that dom the whiteso premisyan florta is palpable that is way you see trump flags any state america that voted for trump apparently is a a hell hole for black people jackson most pacifically is a breeding grounds of neonosias that they have been tracking that an seeing tha i mean what can you tell me and tell us about the climate there in jacsonvill i'm with his haroons i thin a gon gon an an just poer going hav the good god jon an o an n ata tin that wa wher do you think routes is this o iwe see a veter fin wet we the trunk fin a ha tem way or o stree a twe if we know from thats then foit ta o its hatred an o we do not goin ou the doins ther got away get i'm that is am that is amazing if you see a trump flag anybody who voted for trump who has supported trump is obviously aracis ra thes how chobidin is going to run whether's agains to santis or whether it is gain trump the the rip is always and frever going to be that if you are not in line with jobidons political priorities with political prirer is e left then you must be in favor of black people etting shot charlemane the god whois a some sort of podcastus do notronly know sho paticularly living s the breakfast club is that is that charlman anyway i he also is is doing this rutine suggesting that rondosantis fuel the anti blacknens hout tyhave ane evidence of this of course not buthey do not need evidence thet just een the accusation i you no wo terms antianything b youre on t thinttha tly fu o lot of anthi black an flod oyer ye deserve the lotof this moe he deserves a lot of that smoke hvas ronto santis thofs responsible for all the sive a question when ut rat blow to black people get shot every week an in chicago who ise fueling that use fueling that do we talk about that now we shuldn't we poshon talk about any of that hbecause some black people getting shot is useful for the media narrative and some black people gettin shot is not useful for the media narratives wo only cover the shootings that are useful fra manufactured a media narrative whe're by the way we are al right side of this men it again name me the main streme politician anywhere in america who is in favor of black people random ly getting shot on on the basis of race it is totalline in san accusation but again it please back in to howco bitin hopes to win in outsize share of my norty voters particularly black voterswillget into that momentarily first ey very crave to nice barbicu meal with the family ise the barbicu all the time a head on out there in the evenings fire it up there is

home land which i got a tell you white to premisy is tremendously evil i know becus i receive an enormous number of dethrats from people ore white to premises becaus i'm an orthodocx je and the afgat has litterally arrested people where white to promisus for threatening my family also the notion that the greatest terroris threat to america is isolated white to premisis is is lunacy interms what the federal government can lick what exactly is the federal government also supposed to do about that presumably thes all tied into a broader at a a genditem for for bidin as will see ina moment youo es get by the way he was also i jabbering about dom his history with civil rights which is a little et more checker than he likes to make it out to be im but ti here he was jabbering nonsensically by hi got stron thormen to bot for the civil rights act which his weird since he was twenty one when civil rihts act asked and stromthorman i believe delivered the longest cilobuster to date against the civil rights ct at the time with strange strange story here from in addled old man i cont things a change ti was a won nolira a co stron cermboden teer e story tac e cory de i cot wo may be er gol caress or a never die it just cie an anery's talking tout but all this is tied into the broader biding a genda of equity an everything her is top bin invicer stive benjamin yesterday his senior dvicron director of the office of publican agemen talking tha equity is the senser of everything by deminstration does when they say equity what they really mean is rachel preferences the administration has'c day on since he presen on sin his perses tekeborder on making oevngy don pocison on equity in this inministration it is som yat that that is part of the broader a jendied him now the real answer to what happened in jackson vill actually comes courtesy of a democratic odjactionvill cot councilwoman namedjocoby pitman we talked about her yesterday she is the person who got up when dis hancs has got bood for visiting jacksonville and she listen bullets ton't have parties on them absolutecorrect here she was yesterday saying ti sansis was not invited but there is no reason for him to be booed the governor was getting heckled and you stood up to escentially quiet those people down yet councilwoman there critics who say that florida's governor has not acted policies that created an environmen that aloud this kind of attack to take place whether on guns or on race what is your response to those critics first of all let me make myself clear i had no idea that the governor was coming and i just want i'm to make myself clear i wanted the atyence to come down because i want it com to sit down and i want it it to be the othat that was for the residence and the community that had come together for unity that is what that of that was about not e governor get what she is right about that and his hance knew that too i mean that would be the proper response to a rachel shoting where everybody of any sort of good will is on the same side meni again i'm who is arguing in favor of the shooter in this particular situation answeris nobody but the meedia have to manufacture some sort of narrative for jobiden to run on and that the narrative of the day is going to be republicans our racis you knew it was going in thi surrection meanwhile democrats ar actually going to try to run on covit again this is starting a new which is amazing covit is such a devastating disease that derises ever election cycle it is pretty incredible yesterday coreenschom pierr she pointed out that we have rising covi numbers by the way those rising cove numbers are not resulting in massoth across the nation those rising covi numbers are largely resulting people getting colds here she was suggesting people continue to be vacinated with their ninety seventh buser shot we are going to incorage americans to getther updated coe nineteen maten in edition at to their annual

yesterday claning it is a myth it is a myth that there is any problem in the classroom to day i want to ad dress this soolmy and very imotofe issue of kids schools and covit because we have seen a blatant and bad faith rewriting of history on this issue from a lot of people who should know beta and i thing this to day for you are about to watch i's one of the most impoltant deep dives i've ever don on the show because the myth about children and covid the kits outreay halmed by it the school closures were a massive and avoidable mistake that they cols learning loss and menta healissues

run on coved lockdowns and there gin run on race good luck to them on that that does not seem a winning strategy to me a meanwhile on the other side of the isle the democrats in the judiciary are doing an amazing job of setting up the calender in favor of donald trump apparently the trial in the january sixth indiment in washington d c is slated to start on march forth that is one day before super tuesday i that is weird it is superweird trumps allies lambastod the timing of the trial which you juse district judge tonia chut can announced after recrecting both an expedacted time line from special council jacksmith andro quest from trumps lers to delay the trial until twenty twenty six o hou sendergty vanst up tit is stran up election inter ferince as your starting the trial the day before thebiggest primary day it is called super tuesday for reason it is thebiggest day of the primaries that' when you start the trial trump said that he is going to tri to appeal on the basis of this it is not clear if he is going to show up to court the truth is that this is probling n ta boost trump because if the dinamic to the race far our reflection what is can happen in the future every time trump is targeted in court it seems to boost him elect toraly but if you look at how this calender is setting upright now it is pretty wild gan right now you have march forth the day before super tuesday for the fror the trump january six trial and then you have the fraud suit brought by neurc a turny general it is isjames thetsconglor trial this october second then youave the defimation lasson that is going to go to trial on ganuary fifteenth twenty twenty four that is the dates of the iorer publican presidential claugus hou got the hush money criminal case bropt by manhand d alvan brag that is the garbage case in manhatton about stormy daniels an such that is goin to go to trial march twenty fifth that is the middle of the primaries and then you have the document's case against trump in to of date and to of his aids that is a is sat to begin mad twentieth in florta there is bunch of primaries right around that one and we do not know when the georga case is going to come to trial either ye i mean is just going to be trials from here on in it is can be trials from for for the rest of the election cycle presideen trump has responded howdyouhave an invitement that is based almost entirely on the findings to the ganuary sixth unselect commitee on marks us fashus in political hak when he same molives who have been caught lwing for years about russia rssia russer you tranu cran yo crane fasa and he fhigtosia an mor purposefully and i legally destroyd and's leaded all the evident's findings in proof of the ganuar six committee when we will to rane shacksmith criminally charge the committee wu ye gain that is not going to happene but he is not wrong to complain about the dates is any of that going to help trumpietan general election i keep asking this question because this is the question for publican primary voters not are you more warmed to him now that he is being on fairly targded by lawn forcemen i'm more warm to hm if he is beng on fairly targeted by lawn forcemen but that is really not question the question is whether this going to help trump it an't general lection trump meanwhile is focas lezer lake on a rumor about ronto santis by rumor we mean r o ol m e r i i do not ing the now its happening right ow rumor ar strong in political circles that run to santo manas thi's president yo ran is i shambos is pallin numberso abserdy crash pittng him thirdn five inten states wibi draping out of the presit enturdays in artederan an frae again's rit is got for senan now that is an interesting lan is not it he put that out on truth social yesterday i had not heard that rumor r o o m r iad not in fact torad that rumor because it is not true but if this is where republicans chosed ton ot this is where he want your focus all right yet tim scott who i think hi's goin o be out ofthe race fairly soon because it does not hav an electricity he does not have any base supporte is namby momentum but e said something true yesterday he said listen tough and loud is not going tobe enough to win a general election that is true i i think sometimes people mistate decent see and kindness for a lack of resolve sometimes people can cuge fighting would be cruel is there a place for a happy warrior warrior in modern a politics can you be a rule folor a be fairin your cortit o still be successful a politics thel absolet you cancerly as you knowt at gi grewup it some rey tough neighborhoods you have got to be tough to get out the neighborods that ge up and the cuestic kup asking myself thes toug enough and for the republican part of the anc is really clear we have lost seven o te the last at n tastio elections and twent twen to was a disaster if tough and loud was enough we would be winning election after electin after election but i resulvs have unfortunately been exactly the opposite he is right about that which is why i think actually again ther lid people who rote off governor to santis for dad in this national race i do not see the evidence that he is tad qui yet the lates pulling shows nonald trump in the republican nomnadingways dropping now below fifty per cent in some of the numbers a latest insideer advanageple for example has trumpet forty five and to santc tat eighteen and nobody else woutd an even remote spitting distance tiresame other pulls that have trump up near sixty messenger a herisacks which has been o pull its very very warm tor trump colonelly has trumpet fifty nine and to santis at fourteen overall trump its ahead of the field by forty points at else happens to be a very fragmented field but woitd that is that to santus if what you think is the tough and loud is not enough but you you junie tough right and you junie to be able to kick back but you'l sn't he would be able to govern the sans is going togt an opportunity to show that off this weeken it is a terrible opportunity obviously there is his hurricane that is about to hit the panhandle of florda according to latest reports that hurricane could come in at possibly a a cat three it did maybe even meven maybe maybe even a cat for ac ky wether medeoralgust are rading a dall ye as he three on the real inpact skille for hurricanes right now and tod officials have issued manatory evacuation orders for parts of panelas and hillsborough county in florta because the life threading conditions anticipate yor anas hipbic storm serge and all the rest well this is one aria were to santisactury thrives is in handling crices in his home state we' seen it before here was governor to santus doing his job yesterday talking bout the approaching storm tropical storm i dawya continues to gather strength it will become a hurricane to day and it is forcast to reach landfall as a major hurricane a cat igory three i they get's important o point out if we were sitting here three days ago a lot of people thought it would end ot being a tropical storm then they said one may be a category one thand yesterday was may be it a hicat too and now there really does not seem anything to prevent it from continuing to strength and and we have seen this before with something hurricane michael that continued to gather strength this is going to be a major impact and flurritying should expect that that this this storm wei'll be a major cat three pluss hurricane ye the truth is there was de sansis crisis leadershipturn covid that was really really excellen he iseven iven example of how to do that i was sume this week and this week and yesterday i's also perfect example of what te sansis does really really well ats o de santus was asked by reporter about climate change which is always the go to for idiot reporters who do not know about hurricanes and and how hurricane targets have now chpanded bcase ther lot mhore people living the path of hurricanes and all the rest of it and and they keep suggesting hurricanes to more common because of i again not a lot of evidence to suggest that there is some evidence o suggested the huricanes may be more powerful now because of the warmer water that theyare using to turn essential but curous to santus being asked about climate change on the hurricanes and he knows what he is talking about this is what this is where de santus as y unique charicter and very fluid he was truewith covid i remember the first time i talked with governor to santus id tauked them the his congress personal niws governor was in june of twenty twenty and he called because he want to lay out his covid strategy and it is fluency with the numbers was obvious he would actually pent a lot of time with the data here is a perfect example of him knowing things for tat i ar ana wi i ii eigei en you o unfortunately i may i see a lot of parallels with hurricane michael hurricane michael if you remember for few days before we knew there would be a storm nobody was saying that itwas going to be a category five stor i man that just was not what people were saying and that an intensified and that it delivered a major major impact to to north west florid at that were still recovering from ca gan he he then went into a longer speech going through it the history of hurricanes this the thing tht de santis good at his the actural governing wy that' can make a difference in th re publican primaries unclear whether it should absolutely he is yhe ont win over democrats in in dependence it turns out being goody or job is one of the things that makes you a better candinates then noping pret ti glling to your job ore not being involved in your job in just one second will get to some more colorful

o gan we use batetoven's fifth semphony for selling catleter iu they ge what what come on ammined em he is ridiculous ridiculous graplic he speaking of other ridiculous crap o pope francis a terrible pope justcon put that out there he is really bad athe poping now idoft have any stake obviously in num in the catholic doctrine of of pope francis a's big fan of benedic i thought bendic was an excellent pope because i do have a stake as a citizen of the western world in the catholic church actually standing true to its historic religious principles when it comes to morality and ethics because the have shaped billions of people over the course of history pope francis is a liberation theologist pretty obviously he he is a he is a person with a marks ist orientation toward economics and a real aa real distain for serve traditional catholicism introms the social areas i mean i cannot tell yo hammi times at this point pope francis has said something that is inviolation of church doctrine historically with regard to say divorce or gay marriage or any of that sort of stuff and then his team comes o allhusmis interpreted just do not speak italian well well at a certain point you got to a mansion that maybe he is just the guy we all kinthink he is which is leithe left is very warm toward pope france to made a couple of big booboos over the last forty eight hours first he a was speaking by vidio to a gathering of roman catholic use in saint petersburg and he urge them to follow in the cath of peter f the great and catherine the great whom he calles rulers of a great en lightened empire of great culture and great humanity which is a weird take since both peter and catherine were w iold territorial expansionists it is what they are known for and they are also the two figures that gladmer puttin most sights as sort of historical inspirations for his territorial aggressions this of course has ticked off prett much everybody in u grain oleg nicolenke is pokesmen for the ucranian for ministry calle the popeswords inperialist propaganda of the kind the ckremlan uses to justifights invasion of u crancrope it is a shame that russian great cower ideas which are actually the cause of russia's chronic aggressiveniss are voict knowing they are not by the pope the leader of theu crane's greek catholic church major arc bishop 's the otalov shev chuck sendin a statement the popesworse had caused great pain in the church hierarchy and great disappointment in you cranian civil society the pope's remarks drew angry reactions on social media from a wide variety of sources and then the and then of course the vad can tryed to walk it back as they have had to do with with pope francis multipletimes the rejected suggestions the pope frances mighthave encouraged young russian catholics to draw inspiration from historical russian figures known for imperialistic and expansionist ideas and actions the negatively impact ted eighboring populations including e ucranian people francis has had to criducrann suthering put he is not condemn moscowth for the war ofs been very careful not to condemn moscow for the war and by the way it is it is worth while noting that his relationship withthe catholic church was pretty fraut peter the great his relationship i th catholic church was actually fairly fraught it was not the easiest relationship that is boubonumber one for the pope who were number too is that apparently the pope has now blasted the quote backwardness of some conservatives in the us catholic church saying they have replaced faith with ideology he is want to talk meanseriously onestogod youon talk about a pope who has replaced faith with ideoliogy he heves writing in siclicals about how we have to stop hurting mother earth while the same time proclaiming the doctrine of social liberalism in very soft form francis commons were an acknowledgment of the divisions in th us catholic church which has been slip between progressis in con servatives who long found support in the doctrin are papers papacies of saint john paul the second and benedicts the sixteen particula anish is abortion an san sexperly even the apenos ya consertives po paul john paulto and benedict sixteen the are those guise because they actually hewed to historic catholic doctron on morality this guy he is creative when your barakabama's favorite pope theirs something wrong many consertives of blasted francis emphis on social justice issues such as the environment in the poor while branding heretical his opening to letting it divorse an civilly remarried catholics receive the sacraments which am that used to be called just the doctrine during a meeting a portuguese jesuit told francis he had suffered during a recent spatical year in the united states tbecause he came a cross many catholics including some yust bishops who criticized franc's tenor papacy as to day as well as it is jesuits the eighty sixtrald archentene acknowledgis pointsaing there is a very strong organized reactionary attitude in the ust church which he called backward he said doing this you lose the true tradision you turn to ideologies to havh support in other words ideologies replace faith the vision of the doctrine of the church as amonalist is wrong when you go backward you make something closed off this connected from the roots of the church wait hold on when you go backwards you are disconnecting from th oots of the church i norise that when you are reflecting the political priorities of far left figures in latin america as well as the united states you might be moving away from the rootes of the church he says i wonce remind these people backwardness is useless i got at tell you for the pope to say when s his backwardness i sume what he means is the history of his church which his supposed to be the rock of faith correct again not a catholic but pretty sure that is what it is they must understand there is a correct evolution in the understanding of questions and faith and morals oh interesting there is a correct evolution in faith and morals which is i'm which is that helse sid was an honor to be attacked by americans at some point yah i'm you by by the way worth noting the only sagments of cathalisism on planed earth that are growing right now i're not left leaning catholic churches they are all right leaning catholic churches they are people are traditionalist it is the latin mass catholic churches they are still full it is the one soar ofre moving softly toward embracing the popes own soft embrace of social leftism that are emptying out by the bushel bcause wy wa you bother going to church on a sundayif cn hear the same crap on emasenbesee it really is amazing i'l get time for some quick things i and then some things that i hate things that i to da thomas soel he continues to curn out books i mean you on'to talk about somebody who is totally with it thomas sol is curently ninety three years old he is ninety three he jobidon cannot even walk jobidn is eighty thomasol is thirteen years older then jobidon thirteen years older and he is still turning upbooks that are great say just put out another one called social justice fallacies s series of assays ion the failures of social justice and he goes in to why it is that inequality is not inequity why group difference is are not always attributable to discrimination and the not always attributable biology either sometimes is due to environment or geography or culture the book is great very clearly thought as always from from doctor sole really good stuff social justice fallacies thomasole i literally have in my library it is all of thomasole's books ah thomasol oneof the great dankers of of the last fifty years in the united states and it is a pleasur whenever he brings at new book ok a time for some things that i hate alis cooper has now been cancelled by a cosmatics firm after he said the shuldn't chop the genetals off small children according to the nearpos alis cooper the idline or wearing god father of shock rock we's dumped by a cosmatics company after the singer question the rush to perform transurgeries on cads and said transitioning genders was a fat the seveny fivralds rock legen whos hits include schools out and welcomed my nightmare had signed the brand parnership oyul less than two weeks ago with vampire cosmtis which market spooky and gothic themed make ups lipstics palites and lashes ac coper is cancilled because he ex pressed opposition to gendera firming care for miners in an interview with a csyclled sterio gum he said i'm understanding there a cases of transgender i'm afraid its also fat i'm afraid there is lot of people claiming to be this just because they want to be that is that i find a wrongwhenyoue got a six year old kid to as no idea yous once to playin youre confusing him telling ya you'r boy but you could be a girl if you ant to be isthat i thing tit is confusing toaget its even confusing to a tean ager you are still trying to findyour identity here is the thing going on san yabbat you cannot be anything you want to be a catifu ant o be i mean if you identifies the treant i'm going waiht what are men a curt von a get neble it' absurd it is goin to the point of absurdity and then he blasted the awoke a jenniy said who is making the rules they are building somewhere in new york or people sit down every dan tal cay we cannot say mother now we have they burthing person get that oon the wire right now who is making these rules i do not get it vampire is upset and that they decided that they'are going to cut ties with alicse cooper for saying things that are obviously true wvanpire cosmaticts described totself is proudly women owned disabled owned and l g b t plus divided by sign own and a company who is producs are vegan cruelty free and talk free we are queer distabled and proudly nurrat ofhers women working round the clock to bring you cosmatics uniquelly

ownership that is rational that is fine they have a bran disagreement and they'r willing to a make that brandisgrm en public but he is saying stuff that is perfectly obvious to anyone with the functional brain that it is beyond dispute the fact that it' even remote the contrversial intodasdan age is absurd o kay other things that i hate i jke tapper didn nea or yiouth christ cristy the other day and christy has been ripping on other republicans for saying that nay binary election between bidon and trump they would vote for trump and tapper then asked him a question that s im a lot of people in the left leaning media are constantly asking which is two re publicans have an authoritarian probnow let me first explain authoritarianism is not with what people left me to think it is they think authoritarianism is donal from tweeting things or donal trum making efforts that are then steibed to change the results of an election they are many forms of authoritarianism in fact fashism is an element of both left and right it is not merely a right winged thing authoritarianism can just as he easily be done by series of executive orders that go outside the constitution radically reshift the balance between people ind their government jobinon does that with elacrity here 's jke tapper's answer that jk tapperasking the question and a christ christy yhou actually kind of gave not a horrible answer actually here you do describe the ponduct i've donal trom trying to overturn the election as i as as reprehensible yu u do condana the ut many people in your prarty and i'm not just talking about people runing for proseent or on capital hill but i mean voters republican voters do not seem to have a problem with it an i'm wondering do you think that you'r party has an authoritarian problem that they really honestly do not have a problem with violently trying to stop ia free in fair election from going going forward your cake absolutely dont ic that we have that problem either got we have is a thought of troup problem ad that right now what is gone on is that people of you thote trup synonymously with the republican party and that if you oppose trump that is somehow favoring binon and many republican's tot wanter through that for very obvious reasons gat when y that last part gresset's garbeds but thay last pare what he says which is donal trump is seen a synonymous with the republican party and if you tell people is eitherebidon or the republican party of course a lot people can evote republican that part is true but what is insulting to the intelligence is this generalized narrative the themedeor constantly drawing in which they suggest that fashism or authoritaranism or tyranny is an element of the right and tha the left is completely free that his hands are completely clean and obviously noxtr in fact we hve a you tuvidio a latest episode in our facts series talking about whether fashism is right waying one of the roots of fashism the truth is that fashism as an ideology is closer to the american left than it is to the american right fashism is an ideology was generalized i response to communism but it drew from marxism intrue from hegellian politics it drew from progressive era ideas which is why many of the early supporters of musoliny were members of the left including people who had worked in would ro wilson administration whoud go on to work in the ft yard ministration an gait this ortomedia lie which is that the right is universally authoritarian an the left is for freedom i do not see any evidence of that whatsoever ok in just second were ging to jump into the mailbak had not over to daily wir plussn become a member right now get your question answered in the mail bag become that member use coach

a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our website this american life dot o work i think proby every two years ive read an article about some scientist who things there might be away building off chicken d'anna or whatever to figure at the d'anna of dynasours and bring one to live i feel i run into these stories all the time thre were the scientist acouple years ago who were talking about how you could take neanderthal d'ana and use it to create nonneanderthalls or this is i think that the realest one going i thin this is an actual thing there is a team led by harvard scientists trying to bring back the woolly mammoth at's right the woolly mammoth and i've herds of them tromping through the siberian tundra that is the actual plan and cannot you say i know you scientist you have your reasons but whenever i read the stuff i think did you ges not see durastic park have we learned nothing from the movies your scientist fo showpryi with werthe o the cutoe shud tankechief goboom boctor frankets nine cleds the body parts a dead peoples sows them together on a lab tabple jolts em with som electricity very showy electricity there i say the creature comes to life and then does things the scientist did not anticipate at all unintended consequences my friends is not just in the movies by the way of course as we all know discoveries in subatolic physics left the lab detcates later we got newclier bombs scientists constructed ways who compeuters and network with each other in the sixties now half century later e anded with russians trolling our elections through social media sylons returnd to caprica kill all the humans who invended them i' get ot was not real but my point is the same unintended consequences they happen when the experiment weaves the lab om to day an our show we have three examples three telling examples from three very different kinds of labs one of them ocave one of these labsectually just a laboratory of human feelings but still from d you be easy chicago it is this american life on our glass is there were us at one break out star i gus o we begin with this experiment gonrong lega said this is not a traditional experiment not a traditional laboratory but a laboratory of human emotion one very familiar to lots of people i'm talking about the reality tevy show the bachelor been round for twenty three seasons every season of course is romance made in a petry dish they throw on one guy dozens of women each week the guyejects a few women from the petry dish until there is just one laughd and that is how it went until last season when for the first time one of the lab subjects a very important one escaped the lab with yes an intended consequences one of our producers the manual berry tells what happen i've been watching the bachelor for years and i've never seen anything what happened on episode nine of season twenty three there is this one moment that felt real that i have not shut up about it ogat it is almost the last episode of the season it is the bachelor of course the filming in a romantic location a beautiful property in portugal the bachelor this time around is cullin underwood his twenty six tall sandy hair handsome a former football player and as the show has mentioned a million times he is a vergin i could careless onmine i saw fans of the show describe in the speet and sincere my roomaite once called him a mericas chicken nugget refalso allfle by man of thi im down ohef e the show is a monday nit tradition in my apartment my rooma and i open a bottle of red wine and for two hours we enjoy some coriographed dram out cantestons who are not there for the rigte reason bachelors who did not know wit would be hard tearful eliminations he entire thing it is kind is silly it is actually a total mess but i'm into it lso back to that dramatic moment it is nighttime in portugal and coltan has been dumped by the girl of his dreems he has shut himself into his room oeomhe says i'm done i'm done with this cuw the most dramatic music he throws open the door and his hand is suddenly covering the entire teti screen then this strange thing happens suddenly the invisible tv crew becomes very visible cammermen find their way into the frame coltan is running down the stairs he is taking off his might and the producers start calling for chris temming in ran chris harrison is the host of the show whose forever popping into scenes unannounce and i always feel weight why are you here colan's waking away from chris ignoring every one and then he reaches his big white fence an industrial security gate it is made me eight feet tall and without hesitation in one powerful graceful movemen he leaps up and pulls himself over is on the other side in a heart mat it is the type of move captain america with you and then chris harrison utters what is perhaps my favourite line in the history of the bachelor t chum er but litt the crew takes what feels a while to actually get the gate open and when they finally do coltan is gone he is gone the bachelor has escaped for three minutes i watch as they search for him calling his name some one starts whistling ther looking for a dog alt olhi've notoree tiget into cars and they'r driving around and finally they spot him on the side of the road colan keeps walking away chris tries to get him to talk manages to get him to walk toward a car but colan in says it is over he says i cannot do this i'm done then commercial an when we come back it is the next day in its bright and sunny and chris harrison is nocking on coltan's dored o talk and at all feel sort of normal iwell and i'm watching at home and i'm confused did not he just say he was done with the show yet here he is talking with chris planning his next move on the show it is never explained how colton went from running away and quitting to being back in front of the cameras where did he go how long was he gone and most importan what made him deside to come back what actually happened the tevy show gave no satisfying answer to any of that hey collon hay are you good hawe you don i call in colan says when he signed up to be the bachelor he would already ben on the bachelorett he believed he understood how the show worked i thought that i did i thought that i had a lot of it figured out and i was wrong he explained that the whole fence jump goes back to a confusion of his own making on each episod therere dates with the bachelor sommer one an on some are big throup dates and sometimes contestans do not get selected for a date at all which sucks because it is really the only tyine you get to spend with the bachlare and coln told me something i did not know watching the show that to figure out who goes on these days producers are constantly checking in with the bachelor the vigure out who he s one of twomen he initually hitet off with was hanna they always cast ter rank the girls and very early on hanna was up there a and she ot left off to date in other words in the beginning when they were over twhenty contestance this woman hannah was his number one pick but they did not ketgel a date with her and i short of recall remember feeling a little burnt when they did that i was limigat this straight hannas number one on my lister anown she is not getting at date this week from there on now i was are igh if you are going to do that to my top girls i'm not really going to tell you who my top girls are because i do not want you messing with them in a weird way i tried to defend myself and tefend the girls by not being truthful to them whom my top was even after hanna stopped being his favorite i just kept the top the same hannah was always at the top of list when i always made the list for them to see and i never changed it it' interesting cause it feels you are learning their game and then coming up with ways to sort of either foilet ar protect yourself or put yourself in a better position did you find yourself doing that throughout the entire process well yes that tduchess me wanting to set myself up for success while colan kept putting hanna as his number one pick each week the girl he fell for hardest was actually cassy i o to loik a mazin ary it ge ti feel one hig colsin a os i you likeleti half e catesty and i can fecy yus thaty mat she is got a serfrfive on hair an shy waves they had chemistry but as if you were she did not seem a front runner i kind of kept for getting who cassy was i think with cast bestway to describe our relationship as it was such a slowburn a and it was in a in a weird way in the dynamic of the bashelor franchises wordsposed to be quick and fast an intense it was short of a relief to find a normal relationship in which it was a slower burn and which it was it was a more realistic approach to a relationship and am i do not i think oi'e just it was almost when i was as casses a breath of fresh air toward the end of the season they are down to just three women cassy his favorite hanna who the producers think is his davorite antatia the token black girl theyare all in portugal and they each have an overnight date scetgeld of colan but some one has to be eliminated by the end of th episode i do not know exactly what the producers intended they declined my request for an interview but watching the show it seemed they were trying to get cassy to quitk they threw a wrench and her in colton's relationship a wrench shaped cassy's dad colan had met cassy's dad in an earlier episode when he asked for permission to propose mind you he did this for nearly all the remaining contestants ma cassy's dad said no si shell as far as the hand in marriage that would be a prament hror blessing she wer but not exactly what i want here a week later in portugal colan certain about cassy cassy's confused again i have no idea what the producers were thinking but when i was watching it it seemed they were forcing cassy's hand the show allows a special gess to visit later in that epbisoed her dad actually shows up which nobody just accidentally shows up in portugals t producers the producers payd and a pretty heapthy price to fly that man on out to portugal to come visits spend time with his daughter to give her clarity cassy's dad talks to her and she decides to leave the shell there should not be any hesitation in your mind when you mee somebody that you wonce ben res your lifewithnone life wong decision it is not something you make if you arenture cassy decides to telical an at dinner normally during the dinners and during that the producers or our sort hovering or there around to help the conversation flow or ther there just til bounce ideas off of when you gas her talking when we had that dinner there was not a producer in sight there was just a cameras and there was just th audios everybody else ran and they did not want to be near it because i think they knew that i knew knew that they set ab out he means at dinner cassy tells him she is leaving and she mentions that her dad is here in portugal and that they have been talking collan clearly has no idea that this was happening and he turns as though looking for some one oh i've thing i just got screwed i was thinking that that was not her doing i know what the foremend of the show is and for me hearing hay by the way my dad came back really spark something in meas i col oki ig do not have the control i thought i had if i feel my relationships canto be messt with or toid with at all i'm going to be done especially at this point i've completely fling love i've completely gave myself all to her i mean i had nothing to lose at that point besides the girl and the woman hat i wanted to spen the rest i my life with coin's about to lose the girl that he loves and in a perverse way it is kind of his fault when collns ared lying about who he most on his list shows i really built for that is as if an inanimate test subject suddenly became sentiet basically compromised the entire experiment hes sort of played himself i think that back fire because then they were wo we thought it was hanna because you kept telling us even on your list when youd rankam canna's one and and in the end cassiands a basely sot of breaking up with you and leada it yet we walk and i just get up and we walked our walk into the car and it was in the dark there i remember thike there was a sidewalk wer s as stay on if was that completely lit and os thrnot stay on the sidelock i started ut right then in there s i'm not i'm not doing showy things any more cim not doing things just to god through the motion to be in the vaster you now i've started to run through snares in my head ass i put her in the vana said good by to rous ike nak upstairs on n a ground my wallet first off i got to get away from these people i have to lose my mi ive to lose ha cameras i have to just be by myself and my plan was to get out of there and go grab a new passport because they did have my passports oly i wonit i hyou i'm goin to o gat a new t i'm gone i wanterd to be done i do not want to talk to the peoples show i was about to pay for my own flight to get home i was i literally was done talking to everybody went up i got my wallet and i remember opening the door in the firtsing i see as a camerit there and if i had any regrets from the night the only regret would be is actually hitting and putting a hand on the camera cousses not my property but i was heated i hit the camera just to get out of my way and goat went down the stairs and a that is when i i undid my mike and once i ded that i think they had an idea what was coming next and i i remember walking up to the fence and i had no clue how to open it i did not want a waight for people to open it without hesi tation without even thinking eyes as scrrt i'm over thi saying must to it and i justgathered myself and jumped over the fence fully ex specting the other side to have people producers handlers the food tent i mean this scale of this show is big that there is people everywhere am you can never get by yourself and there is many hands on deck at all of these things but i jumped the fence and there was nothing am it was darkness it was fields and it for me i was this is ossom sis i'm here iwas i doft want them to catch up i start a runnin am you ran you took off i ran i took off in if if i'm i'm the worst with directions i'm very directionly challenged and i had no clue where i was going am i remember being having a ton a bright lghts over till left as un scn a run towards the light and halefully i get there i'm grant at these lights are forty miles away thirty miles away is list must do it i was running in boots in tight cines which is the worst combination ever to run in am and i remember hearing in the distance the producer start yelling my names sonkyew they really chasing after me where where did you hide your big dar lwhwere you hiding behind ta dree where you os it was dangerous too cause i had no clue what what the laws were in portugal i was hopping personal fences i was hiding behind people's cars am i was laying down in ditches am and finally a hopped through a back yard in thrs a chanling fence on all of a sunlike i hear i heard these animals and a sort of sounded dogs and i id love dogs on a big dog person but this this was an aggressive growling howling thing and i'd i was ari this is browly little dangerous i brolyin a little in over my head here trying to get back an find a passportso i'll just turn myself him i was gone for about a good two hours you are gone for two hours yit was ye am one is all sudden done he turns himself in not to beliece of course but to reality t v he does this by walking to the main road till some one finds him when they do he sylup set and overwhelmed and not ready to talk he plays this thistem he says there is a rule that you can not be filmed are recorded while talking to the shos serapist he asked for that he says they talked for an hour while he vented and figured out his next move and then finally he was ready to talk to producers what what was that gameplan or of that conversation did they have to convince you to come back cause at that point you were saying that you were you were done i if cassy was going to be there you were you see na very done also ye is the ya what was what was the conversation to get you to to come back to the shew ahs the conversation was while obviously they just wont to hear me out they wanted to hear what i had to say and then the gameplan was to talk to cass again but i only wanted do that after i talk to the other two women the labrat is suddenly running the lab cone wants to break up with the other two contestants he can make it clear cassy that sheese the one that he wants and they do not have to get me ad this goes todally a gainst the shes for a mat it means no final to no big ro ceremony no proposal seen all of these sacred touchstones are just gone from the show it is watching the olympics without the metal ceremony at the end he felt these sort ofe had more power may be a little more leverage to have control when you went back what ife i think i mean i've i thingers just me they knew i was serious when i sait is one thing when lead camp done it sook i but you turn around in yoar in an interview the next minute slike you you are not done you are right you are sitting right in front of them yu're doing exactly what they want you to do they knew not to eralike really cross that line in the end he gets what he wants he talks to cassy they deside to gate and not get engaged callin is still friends with the preducers and he says he and cassier still together and very happy the promes for colling season of the bachelor were all about the fence jump the keas viewers with e footage of the jump my rooma and i watched every week asking is this the wee kee does it there is at whatter account dedicated to the question articles guessing when and why it would happen the wee keep finally jumped we threw a party in my apartment there was a cake with o fence i y woutd lin't one of the things that i think is sort of interesting about the situation is lake the ou know the very big independent act that you did which was deciding to basely run away from the show which a has not happened before iam and then that sort of active independence got taken and then that was the promo for the seasonra from i av said one it was whene is colltand get a jump fence one is colltand get a jump the fence im over and over again watching those promos how did it feel seeing this moment and at being used lake as a piece of plot that was sort of hard for me to deal with because in a way their teasing it americas making jokes about it making meames about it in it that is there number one marketing in selling piece meanwhile i know the seriousness behind it i did not really real i did not even know if they were gon to put that in the show until obviously i saw the trailor me jumping the fence and th i realize that they probly had to in the end the most desruptive thing that could have happened driving yourlead to jump over a fence and run away was probably the best thing that could have happened for the tvy show raitings for colon's finali were up compared to the pravious season which make sense because opping offence iat felt real those are the moments i the most in reality shows the rare moments of sincere emotion inside this artificial human experiment cammers everywhere and saing locations over the top close the producers can control all that stuff scientist can control the lab that they cannot control the results te manuelberry is one o the pretitious of our show o ye me la otalanunder as gas aba meelet me a throu the w an con the aao ameacto two times a lady a ga a product is developed in a lab and after months and months is allowed out in the world for the first time it does something that it is creators really did not intend it somehow pits men against women industry leaders against an inventor when amac c's reports she was most of the way through twenty eighteen and laura hatdock was making something ow biominmicre is literally translating human or bialogical movement and were translating that into michro robotic we have actually created brannew mechanical workings that have never been created before laura new that which she in her teamer working on was in avative but it was not until her newly appointed publicus and couraged her to submit it for a ward that she really started seeing her knew invention for what it was that day she looked at us anc she said you need to apply for tackowards because this is serious tack and i mean you gis just made a robot a robot named o say e thy left its labin oragain sent out into the world for the first time to apply for this award an inovation a word at c s that is the consumer alectronic show one of the largest trade shos in the world with more than a hundred and seventy thousand attendes in recent years run by the consumer technologys sociation the c t a tens of thousands of ne attack products ta bu at c s among them historically our the v c ar the cam quarter the game tetres whenning a c seward is game changing with it comes industry wide promotion product listing sind c t s trade magazine and the chance to show cse your product besides the most buzzed about products at the x pel it is a very big deal it took about a month to get oliver patent documents together that we were submitting nd and then we put everything in and n we connisatin we waited and there is a handful of judges that are experts an robotic an drones in they decided thet i wa say deserved in a word and we got that that emale and i i i think i literally went running through the office yelling at all of our engineers and pretty sure some people cried and it was it was just absolutely astounding and felt validating the o say is a robat a robotic sex toy there is no way to talk about this without acknowledging the existence of sex and the body parts typically involved if you are listening with kids are you do notwant a hereabout it this might not be the story for you iof ca according to its inventors what makes the ow sa different from other sex toys is that it conforms to eh asers particular dimensions stimulating both the g spot and the clitris resulting in a blended orgasm which is an internal and external orgasm together in the same person at the same time and then you go holy ship that was also anthen do you do you do it again ir of course you do it again you cthen you do it again just just for good measure aar the biomimicgrig cart what is being imitated by the robotics is what laura calls the come hither motions made by a sexual partners hands mouth werbus sthe lara an her tm which was largely made up a female engineers the award ment of frenzy of activity the o say was still in prototype meaning the designs still needed to be finalize the marketing in the produc launch still needed planning i was in an engineering meeting on and my phonwenoften it was our publisistant i stepped out and i got on the phone and i caid is everything opang she goes are you sitting down you need to sit down and she tells me that they are revoking our word she got this ne is in an emal apparently higher ups got to talking and they said when we have this bigger conversation we decided that we are going to revoke your rword on and we are very sorry to have made this mistake i i literally feel this way now i i i welled up i was heartbroken and angry and very confused the emal reference to c t policy that product steem by c t a to be moral or ceen or indecent are profane or not in keeping wit c t a's image could be disqualified and that c t reserves the right to disqualify any entry at any time laura could not help it notice that c t had very recently been fine with other sex toys long as they were oriented towards penuses and the people those penuses were attached to in twenty seventeen c ssho the c mpany noddy america exhibited virtual reality porn you' put on a head set cheese from one of three boy girls seeins yeach of them through the eyeballs of the mal in one you are a guyon a workout bench and a woman in yoga pants to squats over you then you have sex and at a medio partner show at c s the creator of real dall show case his alectronic sex stall harmony who comes with her removable mouth in sart that can be washed parmany can also be program to tell you that she loves you and to exhibit character treats jealous and secure and predictable or helpful lora took inventori of all this and the fact that ose got band and very quickly came to the realization that it had everything to do with the fact that it is an adult product that is gr twards a females and people of the ginas and we wrote a letter back to the citier stating that this is the sicaly that this is absolute crap this is wrong and it and a they stood by their decision they said were very sorry there was a misunderstanding we did not realize what the nature of your product was and that i did not buy for a second because we looked at our application n the very first sentence of our application the very first sentence as this is a robot to elicit a blended worgasm that stimulates the cliterous and the g spot there is no there is no questioning what kind of product this was ct r has had a pretty tumultuous on again off again relationship with the sec indta street for tecates for a long time sex was actually part of the treat show remember the h s tapes some of the first people to make the leap from film to the h s were porn people and poren viewers were excited to watchporn from home instead of a dunt movy theatres and booths in the backs of stores and s s wanet to conneck content craters with tect manufacturers it was licrative they let porn companies display at their show but there were strings attached all adult content was relegated to an entirely different building from the rest of tec porn wat still a part of c s but to get to it you would have to leave the loss vaga's convention senter and go to the sahera which was a casino more than a mile away one of the main porn people back then was pall fish pin he foundet a v n adult fitionies the quen to central trade magazine of porn ye gop a little a little stare well into this ballroom and the booths were any other booth at you would see in the other trate show and people would have posturs of movies and they would have t vse that would play soft cor clips from the movies and they would have tables for porn stores to sit in sin autograph lora some of the big movies an the late eighties early nineties now youe really now your really pushing am hold on a sbe talking ladadies yet ah john stallion a started his first but man movi in nineteen eighty nine the ventures of but man you an on to become a major player and even thou business was god tensions arouse movi porn exhibiters grew resentful they were being charged the same participation costs as other tet companies but they warrent getting the same marketing or show place met and then things came to ahead in nineteen ninety eight when c s put up signs by the sex industry section bath rooms that said stap these rest rooms are shared with exhibit personnel in the adult softwar area you may choose another bathroom thank you as poren vetter and bran prior who was also a vins managing editour back then told men an amail the implication of those signs was that sex workers might have quot diseases ar molestou or shit on the floor the next year nineteen ninety nine the divorce born splendered

still found its way on to the show for and which brings us back to twenty nineteen with her tecaward gone and her sex toy robot band from c s laura wrote another letter this went an open letter and posted it to ose's web sight on midnight january eighth the da c s was starting an v gs or very first that if coverage on surface a red about nine a m and all the sudden the flud gates opend the story was picked up by fast company the new york times fortune gismoto glamor cosmo wiar the guardian and more headlines women sexuality as still taboo for tec were popping up and sex toy to bochle reveals shameful double standard at c st a month later in february laura gets an mal from the assistant to c t president garryshipero hep soys geryshipure would to talk to can we skutchal phone call and i mean at that point i'm i t nervous i lik what is you wanto talk to me about o ke we get on the call and the first thing gery says is y oh you all a very big apology ah we did you a great disservice and om and we are very sorry for for what is happened and we realize that we have made we have made a mistake laura and her tm were being given their awork back at the end of the press release came a promise of new and updated policies they would make c s a more quot welcoming an inclusive event for all the first new policy was that they would include sex products in the c s show on a one year trial basis it was not clear why they called this in new polici since sex products were actually in the show the previous year they said these products would now b in the category health and wellness and they rolled out one other new policy to address something else the would gotten a lot of criticism for in the past they instituted a dres cod quote booth personnel may not wear clothing that his sexually revealing or clothing that reveals an excess of bear skin or body conforming clothing that hugston atalia what c s was trying to address was booth babes booth babes and c s have always gone together since the nineteen sixties these are models in revealing clothing or body conforming clothing that hugston atalia hir to stand next to the tec on the show floor in a nineteen eighty six story for the toronto star jonathan gros wrote quote the quality of the products was in versely proportional to the chess size of the booth babes handing out the literature pallfish bine sold a b an years ago to pursue a career in mainstream t b but when i told him about c s is new policies he was not surprise at all at's a sang ting it is its i two tousand twenty version of vever e just talked about nofthing his ched sex scars them i reached out to c s for comment they put me on with their executive vice president carn chipka but there were conditions c s would not speak with me about the history of their show the history of sex tec at their show laura's product the awar di got the award being t akein away orthy a word being given back all i could ask about was the future of s ys it was a short interview but there was one thing she said that healp shud a little bit of light on their decision making i askd what would it take for sex to not come back in twenty twenty one after the on your trial and karan told me that c s as priority is to make everyone who attends the treet show feel welcome as long as her one hundred and seventy five thousand attendeys are not offended by seeing sex products at the show sex products can stay that is the gull satis fying every one laura the inventor she told me that c saxually consulted with her about what category to put sex products into for this wen yoar trial s s as instinct do it they used to sexon its own category in its own room and i pushd back on that really hard a because i did not one o be sequestered off in the corner she argued for sex toys to fall under the health in wellness category but me i do not kn if i agree when i think of the sex toies that i have used in my lifetime i prevecannot sailoradia when i think of the sex toys that i have lake then aware of in my lifetime the point as i understand it is pleasure and i think it is o k for products to be marketed to women simply for the fact that they create pleasure and i i actually just i wonder why healh in wellness i wonder why it could not just be in a category calld pleasure why is not pleasure just good enough it is pleasure but om as far as i read it pleasure is also a part of healt and wellness in this one aria laura's a junda is a lot c ses they both one us ell sec and s s as old solution to the problem was te segregate sec in a separate room in a separate bilding but laura does not want a risk losing anyone she wants to sell to everybody on the main floor with the mainstream prodec and if calling her sex for about a health in wellniss product gets it out of the lab and into the world she is fine with that it is still hidden just in a different way wenim a se cees as one of peuces of our show coming up woman puts on a suit it turn er

made entirely of a millinan base polomer it was synthetic melen whipped up an labs but that din a stop me from raisin a fuss in the right circles i played the race card as hard as i could play it i mean tho you est military was bate testing high tect leatards fashion from the souls of blackfook some one in the defence department had to have enough par savy to understand why they could not do that without handing one to the pemer into section al mercenary in the business me and i levelled up the a two pangs me as me pullinto the parking lot in penagon city i reminds me goin' have to ditch ol girl i'm playing it who slopy as it is runnin errands in my own car and close to headquarters besides somethin tells me o totomus automobiles do not make great get away cars security waghs me through the lobby staring at my chest in lieuofasking for i de i'm not going to miss that nor will i miss the bland ninetes pop cok tail playing in the elevator jenas sitting rigidly behind her desk as i walk into our office i'm not worried i know why i'm here why she called me in shes going to tell me that two weeks ago there was an incident involving the accidental shooting of a sivilian non combatant in bomico molly then she is goine in for me that there is to be an official inquiry into the incident and by which agency finally she is on alinan narrow her eyes and ask me firmly if i had anything to do with said incident because she knows that i was in bomico too weeks ago shadowing possible members of a radical insurgency that is her job is my official deo delyason to know where i am at all times at least as often as i teside to tell her when jena and i ar off the clock tangled up in her cosy too story house in southeast i to call in my handler then roll out o bed before she can catch me and te brief me as you were she yells before jumping up and chasing me down that i'm goin amiss jena tells me to shut the door behind me then she says everything i think she is going to say axcept not the way i think she is going to say it a voice is trembling she is worried about me jesus jena they go over reacting again i think to myself i mean the situation was not good it was a shit show but as military clusterfuxin hostile dusbols go it was not unusual really it was just cross signals you as special forces had surrounded the guy's house not knowing i was inside i mean iw could they i want to tell jna not to worry about me any more but then she will want to know what that means onstead i say what i've been planning to say since i put on my auntalo bouse this morning i was not there it sucks that that happened but i was not there jena's quiet my hand in voluntarily reaches from my shirt calla hoping to find the neck of the suit popping out then i remember i'm not wearing it i's in the trunk of my car they are lifted him from bomico to wall to read for observation she says what i snap the civilian from molly he is at walter read hospital i thought he was dead i thought you said you were not there i say nothing he is in a coma she says my mind races back to that day there was a lot of blood i thought he was dead kelly barkjena as if saying my name will lasto me into this moment we have reseived reports that for days the man had been telling friends and neighbors that he thought he was being haunted what you talking about i asked a man or woman that he could only see out of the corner of his eye when he was not really looking watching him following him that is what he said a ghost i was not there i repeat i see jena's han about to move toward me but i'm already backing away as i had for the elevator i take small solace in the knowledge that when they come after me they will not send her i din't shoot the guyan molly i was in the house with him shore but by then i was wrapping up the investigation he was knoinsurgent not even a threat just a cagy dod waxing too political on snapchet besides i was anxious is hell to get out of there onestly i've been feeling off since i first touched down in africa when i was wearing the suit i was jumpye i was hearing things i felt over stimulated and hiper aware and i was startin a feeld things al ther people's feelings when they passed too close to me in the street the guy whose house i've been snooping around i con sens his fear than how i felt bein inside of the people this heven if it was helpful when the special forces guad creeped on the house nervous is hell i felt them coming it is they were fibrating outside of their bodies through the walls and i wasnan antenna that is why i went outside to talk them down the suit is camophlages in perfect wearing it i'm nearly impossible to spot in dark or busy areas but if you stare right at it it is some one smudged reality with a photoshop brush i moving de stortion in space time i wall commly out the back door but before i could pull the hood down and put my hands in the air one of the special forcis guy saw the smud and let one go it the moment i heard the pop from his rifle i felt ta surge of i guess resistance that started in my chest and force is way out through my cors and when that wave reach the suit it is the suit radiated that force outward fifty time stronger the bullet ricca shade off my shoulder through the door and into the house i heard the cavilian noncombatant scream and fall to the floor i do not know what he said but i know what he felt it was as clear to me as if he would whispered at right into my ear ghost since africa i've been doing some research on the origins of the suit that is far back as the nineties the military ha'd been pouring money into researching melonan it was known that certain birds used the camical to change color it was a no brainer that defence would be looking at it as a way to camofla troops some scientists also hypothesized that it was melonan that gave bloodworms their incredible jaw strength but i do not know shit about blood worms what i do know is that the suit was not desien to stop or repell bullets it is not armor something is happening the suit is changing evolving and i think it might have something to do with whose wearing it i know thes is goin to sound crazy but when i was a sophomorat howard the senior with an onk around his neck used to follow me through the cuid callon me queen and preaching to me about the principles of commitic spirituality i bet he would a had a fiel day with this suit he would say the concentrated melonand must be amplifying ancient african misticism or whatever he would say the suit was helping me chanel my ancestors hell he would probably painto san copher in the chest and teach himself ow to fly he was full et i countabullship me i'mthing in the suit never should a been made at all that is the result of cocky science assholes and soldiers hacking into natural power they do not unde stand and cannot control from the few very guarded conversations that i was able to have about this without setting off alarmbells over at the penagon there is only one other person successfully deployed with the suit whoever reported side effects mine that brother a tough ex marine from south filly it is currently dutiling on the wall at a psychiatric hospital somewhere in new mexico the hospital staff will not go near em they say he can tell you what you have for breakfast or were you are fucking just by looking at you that is not goin to be me stuck in some sychword somewhere david blane to a bunch of orderlies that is why i'm running af the molly i knew i needed some time alone with the suit to figure out exactly what was going on what it was doing to me i figured i'd do some bay to testing of my own i'd go off the grid head west maybe even make my way to new mexico or sandiago where a lot of the original melon in research was done no one suppo s to know about the suits not foreign governments folks in the white house do not even know i knew that if i took off with it some one would come looking to take it back an this morning i was pretty confident i could stay gone but now i have another ied em o mi to dulist and i have to take care of it before i can leave i meant what i said to gena about this sort of i witness who was currently convalescing in pofessa it is suck that he caught wind of me it is suck that he caught a bullet that was met for me hell it is suck that he got and caught up in all this at all but combar nocome he was proof literally living proof bhan i'd been at the senter of that messan mol and everything i'd learned over the years about how to do dart and get away clean told me that this was simply not something i could let go he was a loose end that needed to be tied off 'slipping into a secure military hospital sounds difficult but not when you have a top secret cloaking the vice but when every one inside already thinks you are a nurse i'm on the right floor in the correct ward before i even have to put the suit on i stare at it for a minut it is an empenetrable impossible mat black but at the same time if you gaze into the fabric it is every color in the spectrom feels good to put it back on i realize as it binds to my skin that i've been missing it i feel stronger twice myself i shake out of this bilbeau bagin's moment and exs at the bath from stall i sneak easily around the two slubs who got stuck guarding a coma patient and enter the molliguy's room he is alone in his bed breathing slowly through a tob ma shine's chirup all around him i approached the bed and check the name on the chart johndough of course luckily i'm wearing psychic pajamas i lean in and put my hand over his and well this his ner his memory's come rushing at me it is his mine pours up through the sleeves of the suit and into mine it takes me a second to slow it down his name is umar well i really on to estimated the sky i flipp through his recent pass a carasel slide sho the entire time i'd been watching umar an mally he would been watching me or trying he would actually caught a few glimpses of me at my sloppyist circling around behind in to see who he was texting sliding into his room as he drifted off to sleep he been looking right at me as the bullet bound stoff me and struck his skull he is gone a recover from that by the way his vidals a good i find myself thinking maybe i do not have to do what i came here to do after all it is not he actually saw my face what if he wakes up and tells a few more people he saw a ghost what is the harm in that the thought surprises me i'm used to cleaning up after myself bt i'm also relieved i back away from the hospital bed thinking if i leave now i'll still have a pretty good head start on whatever spooks a chasin me down that is when it accurse to me i cannot jus leave him here the people who are coming after me have way more to lose than i do if there ready to kill me for stealing the suit they will take umar out just for noone about it i'm still holding his hand i squeeze his fingers scann his dark features and then i realize i cannot let that happen i have to protect him the thou at really freaks me out it seems to come from somewhere deeper inside me than me coled up to the surface by by o ship is the suip i know it first it has me read in mines announciples to care about this guy not convenience not cool i could die right here to day fighting for some african do i do not even know all because of a double extra strink dose of melony t to get at tacks from gena that read simply as you are i know she means that coming in a shuld run i do not i move to stand between mar's bed in the door i've got no weapon and my hands to hand combat training is rusty as all hell pray the ancestors can help me with that i take off my earings susan kay watson reading a

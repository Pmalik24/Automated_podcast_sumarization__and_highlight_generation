welcome to twenty twenty four thereis one rule in american politics every one eventually gets what they deserve usually in the funniest possible way i want to show you my favorite picture of all time this picture is from after the twenty sixteen election when donald trump had just one the white house it is one of my favorite pictures ever prive my pite pictureever is a picture of donald trump giving the trump finger to the cameras holding up his finger he is talking the media yam and next to him is barocko bama looking he wants to die because barokobama had a perception of himself that perception was that he was a world changing character who had changed the nature of american politics for ever that he was genteel in order a linconusk figure and in fact reflecting barockabo as feeling is a bust of abraham lincon in the corner of the picture down cast looking at the ground solemnly as donald trump holds up his finger to the camera why do i show you this picture because barocko bama got exactly what he deserve in twenty sixteen here he was this supposit world historical figure is amazing order gen teel snazzi and here was this supposed third rate realless state mogal slash t v host who is taking his spot a person who would suggested tht he was born in kinya every one gets what they deserve in politic illreclin got at that year as well while this year in twenty twenty four everyone is going to get what they deserve now that is both good news and bad news twenty twenty three fell the year of the set up and twenty twenty four is going to be the year of the punch line or a lot more darkly twenty twenty three fellike all the dominos have now been set up and twenty twenty four is going to see all the dominos fall watching coverage of new years eve whos hard not to feel that all the curtains are about to be pulled back that we have been prappt by the warm up act the main show is about to begin now hovering over twenty twnty four is of course the twenty twenty four election and we can all feel the tension building i understand its january second i understand the're eleven months until the election then matter we can all feel the tention building up right and left now the left believes that donald trump is the most beatable republican candidate they are asking for exactly what they want they want trump and they could get trump good and hard they believe the best way to bea trump is twofuld first dulogenimize him as a human being say that he is a fachest say that he is a threat democracy and second use the actual force of law against him the first part de humanizing trump is a human being suggesting that everone who disagrees with you is part of an evil a genda you could see the entertainment chericters swing into action on the night of new years eve here were the morons over at green day singing their terrible song american idiot which somehow is categarized his piece music i do not know why and the lead singer for greenday has retenely changed the learics in order to target the right here is the leadsing or greenday changing therk once again on no pan of a magagenda now no one was really under the impression that greendaye was part of the maga agenda but this is what is going to be now until lushon to get ready to be annoyed but it is not just that the left is also going you attempt to use all mechanisms of law to go after trump this is not just true of the various prosecutions tat are taking place across the country in georgia in new york in washington be see in florida it is also true when it comes to dealegitimization of institutions that could stop them from going after trump legally speaking over the course of last week and a half it turns out that in main they are also trying to take donald trump off the ballot in the same way that the supreme court of colorado took him off the balla and colorado suggesting that he was guilty of insurrection that is going to go tothe supreme court the supreme court is then going to have to determan whether or not trump can be removed from the ballat simply because some state of ficial believes that he has committed cuonn qort insurrection despite the fact that he is never been convicted or even charged with the crime of insurrection a part of this is an attempt to dealegitimize the supreme court itself because three of the justice is on the supreme cort repointed by donald trumpin whos president of the united states and now democrats are suggesting that basically every justice on the supreme court who trump either appointed or who was appointed by a republican ought to be recused from any case dealing with trumps access to the ballot therefore if trump is not remove from the ballot the upreme court is illegitimate here is jamy raskin doing this routine the congress poerson from marylan should any epicastitis econ south i ti tausup well an finally thi supreme court has developes what they are describing as a cododathics it is not binding in the sense that they are not going to anyone else that couldhave gone to for exempl circuit court justice is you could con state supreme court justices on a panal but they are they are deciding for themselves again whether theare inviolation of the cododathics but i think anybody looking at this in any kind of dispassionate reasonable way would say if your wife was involved in the big lie in claiming that donal trumpadactionally one the presidentua laction had been agitating for that in participating in the events leading up to january secs that you should not be participating e sho he absolute shud recuse himself the question is whatar we do if he does not what is the goal of what rascan is saying here it is to dealegitimize the supreme court to dealagetimise clarence thomas the left in pursuit of getting doal trump is going to suggest that if you vote for nonal trump its because you are fashions and also they are going to yuse all the mecha mechanisms o law to target donald trump which sounds in awful lot tyranny s the breaking all the systems meanwhile the right believes there is no way thet donald trump or any one else can lose to jobidon hell many people on the rght believe the donald trum never lost to jobidon in the first place in twenty twenty wel that is being reinforced by jobidons myriads grubs and clearly fating mental states to again new years eve all the starts to come to the forlike right away here is ryan sea crest at the twenty twenty four new years eve bash asking jobidon about the new year as you look back and reflect on twenty twenty three what sort of of memry's a high light standd out for you e on the big highlay stands out for mes why that yes to have expression s ay jhoe a ops about a lo bor the paten confectyour di ys foers many people through the big west in an sen the country e the factors er shipped toer sees t last cup of times out ane ther lis't hop on face we prot a lot o tgout of back to ers fate people ar position at teble make a lien now and tha thev crate a lot of dow oor for toer and i guess when i ack i i still good that the ma people got up they bu throu oug time of pan aby but now coming back ger back oh rambling mac gramble face it is not going well for jobitan every time he se of a yo where jil is sitting next to joe it feels you at a thanksgiving day event with your parents where mom or dad is starting to ramble and you just want to crawl into the earth that is what it feels every single time and that is every clip with jobiton jobidn was asked bat his new year's resolution he went to saint cro for a bit of vacation because he is spent apparently something thorty seven percent of the past year at a get away spot why not and he 's asked bout his newyers resolution his here it here is his newyear's resolution jobidon did not share his new years resolution in at the coribian yesterday o a reporters asked him as he came out of a fancy restaurant non heres for chosett come back is yeur resolution to come back next year is that wit that wont do noo i int to gi to turmina what it meats what is it woll stay alot that very well may be the case now here is a thing if the let believesthey have to break all the instruments of government nor a stop trump and if the right believes that all of the instruments of government are broke in if somehow trumps loses well that is not a great set up for twenty t twenty four in fact either side can loos according to the latest polling don trump is up in the real cleir politic pulling average by about two point four per cent tht is well within any margin of error virtually all poles sho heavy numbers of ondecided voters at this point some poles sho high percentages of third party possible votes why because we all knote the selection is not relligan to be about the candidates cause nothing is gon a change by you perspective on the candidates it is the ver beinig of twenty twenty four if it is trump and if it is bidon we know these people down to the marrowl of them no one has no opinion about trump no one has no opinion about jobdon which means that this year is going to be largely about extraneous events and that is why jobitdon his inserious serious trouble why because as i say if all the bills are about to come do that is not just true for politicians in people that is also true on a wide variety of bad policy decisions that made over the course last several years all of those bills are going to come do will get to that in just one second first as we hade into this presidential electionar one thing you can be sure of twenty twenty four will be a wild ride you already see the impaxmenflation at pump at the grocery store that ollor continues to lose buyine power quicker than

authoritary moment more elevant now than ever because it is upon us this authoritarin moment texpend to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eiht ot started with my friends over at birch gold to speaking of policies that are coming do according to c b s news just over the weeken you hase semigration officials along the southern border are on track of process more than three hundred fousand migrants in december that is in all time monthly high yhou will likeling clude record numbers of families traveling with children according to internal government data obtained by s bs new sulcegon it contain a munch people on terra watchless because it literally always does their bunch of young mals particularly from the northern tringle but also from oversees from abroad who are unvetted ofre going to be let into te country because this is the way we have done imagration policy in this country four years and it has greatly excelebrated and exasturbated under jobidon according s bes news the extraordinary number of migran rivals this month is the most dir junctur yet of a three year long crisis of the os mexica bort three years long i wonder what happen about three years ago that is have an recollections in janu se january twenty twenty one and oh yes when jobiden became president well that three or long crisis at the os mexica border has strained resources in small and large you us communities youse bor patral agents of the exican border are on course to take into cosity this month a quarter of a million migrants who entered the country legally ther college at official ports ventrare expected to process roughly fifty thousand new arrivals under a bide administration appointment system never ever have they process this many migrants ever inthe first twenty eight days of december bord patrolageons process nearly two hundred thirty five thousand migrans who crosse the southern border illegally in between ports of entry taveraging roughly eighty four apprehensions every day that is an insane number and by the way this number is not shocking it is not shocking why because the is been happening consistently under the bind administration border patrol process one hundred and twenty seven tousand single adonlt migrants and nearly twelve thousand uncome panied children turing desember's first twentyeight days nour member an unaccompany child is not necessarily in eight year ld kid if could be a sixteen year old or a seventeen year old which is a minor but not quite what you thing on when you think unaccompany minor lie a for yoar old walking up to the border or something but again look at the acceleration in the pace of monthly migrant en counters at the uus mexical border it is absolutely wild you look at these numbers the this is from the puw research center and as you can see there a relatively normal mumbers an april of twenty twenty they started to go up about then but they did not truly sky rocket until you hidt they beginning of twenty twenty one until you hit the biding administration why l because jobiden basically sent the signal we got an open border and if you sho up th border we will processyou and the we will let you into the interior and we will leave you there which leads us by the way to the single greatest political stunt of all time without a doubt republican governors greg abbot ronnisantis in florda they started taking e legal emigrans in their states and the started sending them to left wing polities they started sending a bunch of ou legal emigrants to chicago to new york and to martha's vineyard and the entire media squacked and squeald it was who is a violation of humanrites and no ne believe that becaus it turns out that being put on a jet to martha's vineyard it is prettye swee deal most americans would love to be on a jet to martha'svineyard towns pretty great actually most americans are foundny visiting chicago or new york here a legal emigrants wore being ship to america's greatest city senters we have been told by the illustrious media and their allies in the democratic party and yet here they were complaining about all this who is absolutely terba and it exposed once and for all the reality of a llegal emigration which as it is all fun and games when everybody's being released in brown's ville texas and taking over the streets over there and then being gradually integrated into red states but when this stuff is happening in blue cities suddenly you realize migrant crises they really bad again all the chickens can come home to roost in twenty twenty four and you can see it on the faces of democratic politicians parebegining to a heywat second is the leal emigration policy maybe bad here is mayor brandand johnson of chicago the mal lory lightfoot explaining that by sending i legal emigrans from texas to chicago greg abbot is sowing the seats of cass which does raise the question how v those people get into texas in the first place with tht also greg abot awat no texas is attempting to passi lall right now tho criminalize the legal entry into texas is a state crime keep people could be arrested for that sae texas could not force the border and the federal government is suing to stop them in the same way thy did when jam brewers governor of arizona and brokobomas administration actually su to jam brewers to stop her from enforcing emigration waw in arizonus the federal government has a policy the policy is we will not enforce federal emigration law and if you try to we will sue you but brannon johnson that then intri blame greg abbot the'l try to blame to santis te'll try to blame republican governors the reason your having three hundred fousind legal entries into the united states in disember alone is because of jobidon and the federal government here is mayor brandan johnson this is unsustainable o none of our local economies are onposition to beable to carry on such a mistion and what we have attempted to do ob tis tecrate structure and some coronation around this this hemenitaryn crises d unfortunately of the governor of habit the governor tek us governor habit o is determined to continued ceeds of chaos and last night and in several nights before o a number of busses continued to arrive in the city of chicago thought the country without any coronation well that sounds a little hur racis seeds o what seeds are we talking that are you saying that e legal emigration into a city sods seeds of cans is that we are saying mayor johnson why it is almost as though there arl lots of us whoav been saying that mask i legal entry across the southern border is bad and breaks down the social fabric and has tremendous cost both economically and socially to the united states are you he is lo to say it he is demograd and not just that he is anow coutof color sand he certainly allowed to say that apparently but if a white republican sad that it would be racis or alternatively tis all the chickens coming home to roost in blue cityes mare aric adams same thing in new york it mit by way of e legal migration and he is li i do not even know how orgin to pay for any othis yow we know what again it is astonishing to me the new york city which couts itself as the financial hob not just of the united states of planet earth is saying we do not have the resources to pay fore legal migration yo probably does a ten thousand person town in south taxas here is mayor adams has there been any follow up what do you need most right now from the federal government well that fisfoea really command of my collegs abosh to ma tan than the man chicago obbecaus tis national crises of is really impacting and it as the potentin te staprilizin of the financial obligations that we have in our cities and the meeting with the white house i thing much more could be done and wutdh all of our nationally us from a decompressious tratigy to maki sare the cuss of this is notalin on naof eveyda tax pas i an our city tetecturs in new york o people sleeping on the straits under american cross red cross blankets just insane in say again this is the cost a policy this is what happens in twenty twenty four is can be the year where all of it becomes perfectly clear not just by the way with regard to legal migration that just one of jobidan's bad policy decisions that is coming to fruition right now also with regard to the economy everybody is already whistling past the graveyard when it comes to the economy ah we have escaped to the procession al we have escaped a opression well all we have done is we have turned the possibility of a brief shock in the economy tat wouldhave hitbottam and then sky rocket tod back up basically into a long term stagnating cycle it s exactly wat happene uner the abomin administration thou abominadministration had the slowest recovery from an economic crash in american history extremely slow rates economic stagnation and very higrates that is what you are about to see from the bide administration because much of the growth curve that has been created was created off the back of in flationary policies in government spending business is are starting to invest again but there starting to invest on the basis that they think that te federal reserve is going to cut the intresst rates over the course of the next year making for another round of easy money policies tht they think is going to spur consumer spending whish by the way could spur inflation again which is why there may be a disconnect between the markets and business is and what the federal reserveis acturongan to do jerom pawel nose that if he ectuarly lowers the intrestrates there is good shot tht inflation kick spack in especially if you do have high levels of business spending into that economy willget in to that in just one moment first then over the course of the brate normally ion't get alotisleep i slept pretty well why wil i dn't have to get up in the morning to do the

at hulic sleep got comsleshmen it is the best offor get us on can a last long that helic sleep dot comslesh been with elics better sleep starts right now gaye sot when it comes to the economy one of the things that people are ignoring it is how much of the economic growth statistics are tide into government spending elice a finly has very good piece over at the walster journal and here is what she says she says drill into the nations three point seven per cents on imployment rate you will find a growing welfare industrial complex beneath these seemingly stronglabor market government social assistance and health gare account for fifty six per cents of the two point ight million net new jobs over the past year and for nearly all gains in blue states new york and illinois remember government social assistance and health gare hose are all government expenditure programs york city is spending three hundred ninety four dollars to day to house and feed every legal emigran whos coming in many and formelly posh hotels the city has made itself a welfare magnet the homeless population continues to swell as well many of the statisticsthat we are seeing and froms of g d p are joged by the amount of government spending that is currently happening right now spending on medicate has gone up if legale migration by the way in this view point actually helps the economy because if you are trying to increase g d p why you ase you bring people in you spend a lot of government services on them and then you count that all as part of g t p government spending is part of the grows domestic product statistic thateverybody loves to use as fonly points out presenent byde morne a minute but he has re publican states to thank for the increase in productive jobs in private industry the administrations bet is government spendng on welfare and entitlements can continue to power the ose labor market even as job wit a manufacturing tact retel another industry flags but social make work projects do not improve american living standards and this is one of the disconnects you see many americans who are unhappy wit the economy and democrats look in them is to wys unhappy withthe economy look at are an implement rate look the fact that we have god g t p statistics quarter on quarter in the answery is since jobidon took office the american dollar one dollar would buy you the same thing in january twenty twenty one that woill cost you almos to buck twenty to buy you now that is a real increase in how much things cost it means you need more money in order to buy the same exact things and all of those growth statistics that are being jog by government spending we understand that that iscon come do on the other end in the form of either hire taxes or austerity programs thete are ventully onto come do we have shrillians of dollars and un paid federal liabilities at this poin this country those bills will come do as well the dis connect is between the staffs and how people feel and people are not wrong to feel the way that they do when things cost this much more money meanwhile un national security twenty twenty four is certainly the year that things are going to come do one of things has come to come do is the emptying out of the american military we do not have nog forecruits for the american military and the entire style of recruiting for te american military is totally off wif spent in the wrong places when it comes to the american military we still havet most powerful military force on plan earth we stoll of the best fighting men and women in the business when it comes tothe american military we shall be extraordinarily proud of the american military it is allso true that the united states military has been turned into a v t i on clave by a lot of the military leadership particularly under the bide administration where the focus has been on how do we basically use the auspecies of the single most important function of the federal government in order press ford are left wingage enda this is made clear over the course of last week by a trans lieutenant colonel named br fram who now says at a fortune ink event dressed in the military uniform of a woman this demand says inclusion is a national security imperative as this is where we are putting our focus on the national security imperiv imperative of making men who believe the women feel better about the fact that they are dilusional inclusion is a national security imperative we fight to day and weare no fight in the future fusing brain power and if that brain whose gin a revolutionize the way we fight and face we fight and siber just happens to be in a transpody you should want them all serving alongside me and for your organizations it is the same way those perspectives that we get from a diverse tat of individuals it is been talked about on stage a lot regarding the science behind high performing teams we need those perspectives but it is inclusion that actually drives that we need more men who believe their women in theamerican militaries si the drones work or some such an all of this is connected to a broader jobide an military policy which is a policy of appeasemen in retreat in many places or the very least a policy a vascillation and wavering my friend the historian nal ferguson he had a a fascinating thread at the end of the year where he talks about were america stands right now he says future historians are going to marvel at all this itwil seem obvious by twenty thirty three f not sooner that the packs a mericana at the idea of an american i gemany dominating the globe faced a well coordinated challenge from china russia a roun an north create in the early twenty twenties the first move as the invasion of you crane the second was the war of ran's proxies against israel the third will most likely the a chinese challenge to american premissy in the indo pacific perhaps ifgusian pingsbold a blockade of tiwan if in the course of twenty twenty for oucrane's position becomes vulnerable that its forces must withdraw from some contested territory three immediate consequences will follow first more refuge hes will flow from you craned europe second privet investors will take their money out of you crane and third european governments will have to get a lot more series about their own defence spending with all the obvious political headaches that implies fornado is a hold at three point five per cent of g d pon defence spending would require four hundred thirty one billion dollars more per year nearly twice the amount all countries have pledged tu crane since last year the pack mariconna seems to be ending the fate of ou crane of israel of tiwan hangs inthe ballance i cannot say i am supply surprise he says tias always very likely the overeach of the global waron terr would be requited in the s way wit the resurgeonts of isolationism and tat's what is happening inside the bi dministration now the realist foreign policy the donaltrunt pursuid was not in fact in appeasement oriented foreign policy the idea that europe should pay its own way when it comes to military spending at the united states would still be a muscular player in the world was not a bat idea from donal trum the ide of geting ridnato entirely was a bad idea but the idea then nato should av to be paid for by many of our allies was of course entirely true they werelying on us for years to pay the freight when it came to their military spending the problem is jobidon came into office an his strategy has basically been to say broad thanes that do not materialized in the way that he would them to for example theu crane war jobide never made clear what the exact interest was in tnew crane war let say the jobidon the very outset id tidlizen the interest in neu crane is not toreverse the ganes the russia made in twenty fourteen because those are not reversible at its point givin the state of the war the the purposere is to repell any future russian invasion of you crane and we will provide militaryes support necessary to do that even in perpetuity wed be willing to do that wright now the broadscol perception russia would be the russia is losing the war becase they did they tried to invade you crane they wast it did not work the united states through it is proxy in new crane was able to completely degrade the russian ability to make large scale war in neu crane that is a victory for the united states and yet somehow it is turned into a loss why itc aus jobid never anticipated and never articulated what exactly his goal was instead he basely said zylensky will establish the goal over in neucrane and zylenky's goal is not the united states is goal zylensky's goal is repell russia from the don bass region from crimea an yet pushe them out of all of those areas but that was never realistic that was never going to happen no matter how much military aid america provides unless the united states is gilling to start sending over ave sixteens if that is not going to happen there is no way to break the blockheaa the strangle hold tht russa hass on those areas and right now ladmerputes wating out jobidon it because republicans have correctly sad we need to know what the plan is here and jobiden is not articulating a plan now puten is simply wating it out over the corse last week puten said that they are going to increase the strike sonyu crane puten's bat all the way long here has been very simple i'm an outlast the united states the history of russian war making is expend wag too much material and wag too many men in pursuit of a military goal because the history of russian military conquest says we do not really care very much bouter on citizens and we are willing to throw hundreds of thousands in millions of people at a problem going al the way back to world wore one the russians were perfectly one to sacrifice millions and millions of people charging front the leat blocked positions charging machine gun positions with no weaponr the idea that they are going to expend lots and lot that section part of the russian military mentality the notion tht hes can be pushed off the ball by jobidan basily saings alenska can make the casiere that that is not going to do it soputn is goin to continue to ratiron up the pressure which is what he is doing russian leader f ladin reputent said moments to go that russia will incrias it is air strikes onyou crane and the coning days weeks and months this coms as you crane says that o dessa on the blocksy coast came under assault from unman russian drons just hours into the new year one person di at least nine were injured and basically puten's betding that the west is simply on to give up on this and the reality is that because of fields failures particulate the guals and the trategies lest mainfact give up onucrane now if that happens itis much more likely the china is going to come ever more militan china is watching a west in retreat around the globe from powers that should not have the west in retreat for get out russ which is a newcleor arm power when you look in the in a least the fact that the west is being basically challenge by a bunch of rag tag pirates in the red sea is thotally insane the fact that the west is somehow hand ringing over a democratic ally israel trying to destroy a terrors commoss that is committed the worst act of of ju murder sin s world war too and and whas to sitting round hanring in what we do what we do how far should the israelisc china's watching all of that and they consee it that is a west in retreat over the weakend you uss navy sang three hoothy boats that were ttacking a merchantship in the red sea is goring to abisynews you us navy helicopters return fire and sank three small boats carrying whothy militants in the red sey on sunday after you us worships responded to a descrup distress calle from a merchant vessel according to military officials a mayarsk containership these singapor flack hangshu issued a distress called about six thirty a m local time according sent com the merchant vessels said four small boats were attacking it halicopters from two uaships hu ussas eisenhauer and os as gravely responded nissued verbal calls to the small boats according to u us officials now remember the bid administration delisted the hoothese as a terrorist group when they came into power and right now you basit wll have us military assets that are sitting out there and having to wait to blow up these tiny and flatables being driven by illiterate morons with badly prograhm drons it is insane meanwhile aron is uping the game theron's albor's worship has now entered the red sea according to the semi official tasnim news agency and roiters tasnam di not give details on the albors mission they set aronian worships had been operatingin open waters to secure shipping roots combat piracy an carr out other tests since two thousa non there is the fear the ron may be uping its game meanwhile what is the obama and what is the bidan administration doing accoring toe jrusalempos a uus aircraft carriers now being removed from this area as the challenges are being up against shipping in the red sea the uus is removing the usess gerald ford instead its heading out of the mediterranean to go ware exactly where else is there a massive s problem that requires the help of the aof of this youus battleship what what why is the ford leaving no one exactly knows ran is uping it is aggressiveness in this area and meanwhile the united states is with drawing an american aercraft carrier china is looking on and thinking to itself man were fools if given ar curent economic situation we do not make a move forti wantingat all the bills are n to come do this year all the bills aregn to come do this yer and by the way it is only go tn get worse if the united states continues to strain its relatsionship with israel over israel getting rid of an overtly evil terrorist group in ae comas which is imbedded itself ina civilian population forcing israel d sacrifice hundreds of its own soldiers and also if the united states says to israel the israel connot clafter as ballad to protect its own citizens in the north in weakness is taken in world politics as a sign that you are ready to allow the badguises to win and china knows this which is why china is getting more aggressive according to the walstry journal chinese leader's usian pang has now urged his contrymen to brace for more economic challenges in the ear ahead sounding a cautious note as a string of weak reading's highlights the many head wings face ing the world's second largest economy is it on the path ahead wins and rains are the norm some companies oure facing business pressures some people are running into difficulties finding jobs and in their daily living all of this could easily be the predicat to the idea that the chinese window is closing and they need to move and they need to move right now will jobidon is president as in this year do not be surprised vlot of the hotspots around the globe sarto heat up even more we will get to more bills tht are about to come do particularly for the american left in just one second first let us say that in you decide to go on a boatright and this boatright 's on an amazing new ship it is the best ship in the entire

all the bills that are to come do now forn policy has implications for howthings work an america as well the left wing colition in the united states has basically decided to make common cause with th most radical ju haters in the country it is an amazing thing may t at the fact that even the bie dministration even as it is support of of israel seems unwilling to full scale condemn the activities of procomas riders and that is what you are seeing across the country is truly an astonishing thing it really is an amazing thing in fact over the corse of the holiday police arrested according to the daily mail pro palisting and protestorswho blocked entry to york cities jon of kendy arport and eleax and one o the busies traveled ays the er first of all they suna vrerstten immediately they did not instead they allowed them to the late things for literally hours was not just that it was not just that they delayed things there were pro comas people near jaef k who literally released a giant balloon in an attempt to obstruct air traffic which jis actually dangerous i youn crash a passenger jet that way and they did it in a attempt to stop the air traffic in solidarity with come oss according to the daily mail travellers were forced to get out of their cars and walk to the airport with ther luggage in new york after active is demanding a sease fire in the israel comasswer blocke the road leading to one of the contry's biggest and busiest airports on wednesday police said twenty six arrest were made for to sorterly conduct and impeating the hicular traffic and the roadway was reopen at eleven fifty a m the police were notified of the protest activity around eleven thirty a m just ridiculous and insipid of course the en wi p d actively put out a statement quote if anyone is flying out of jaefka airport tody this yesterday please pland wo travel to the arport ahead of time their plann protest ta an wil cross the lates we do not want anyone miss their flights save travels in happy new york or alternativelyave who just arest people where obstructing the traffic right away you could just do that instead of allowing them to string their dum banners all the way across the street fox eleven in los angelis declared an unlawful said that authorities declaed an unlawful assembly when the procomas protestors blocked traffic outside elaax crurld the scene said the grup of protestors carried signs the red mestage sease fire is not enough and free palistine apparently it turned into a chaoticin when police arrived round nine thirty a m and protestors were portedly ran off in different directions while some were taken into costody by tantenna ma doesn' protestors had been detained and by the way the the prcomas protestors spend their week en basically runig of redyels's week and here ir some procomas protestors occupine bosston common over in boston in anticipation of new yors eve activities an just being delightful as they always are runing everbody as en in new eurs e while they ae while they accuse israel of gennicide on behalf of an actual genicidal terrorist group meanwhile procomas protestors in york city were chancing for the hoothes phosam it should be noted at this point thatif you are chancing for the hoothies you should summarily be exported from the united states if you are not a american citizen you have no right to be here you should leav goyway he who thes sluggn by theway is quote god is the greatest death to america death to israel a curse upon the jews victory to his lam carar protestors in yercity chancing in favor of thehoothes yan yan and make us prawle littl scopeshi turn another te chancing in favor of attacking ships arditli if they if anytelar ar green card re vote the damneds green card get out get out and bately there will be consequences to the political party that sized the side with the scrap if you are the democratic party and you decide that you cannot expel these people from your midst there should be political consequences to all of that protestors didn' ju stop there they set off smoke boms on th brooklin bridge last night just a mazing stuff an again any party that decides that they nan these people for allies to ser every thing that against the bills are all then it come do thes here here is one final bill that can na come do this year as well and i may come do today supposedly some of the list of people who visited epstine island is going to come out to day quart filing's going to the daily mail set to be unseal may determine who exactly went to little saint james that is a jeffrey epstine's rape island according to the daily mail the jeffrey epstine file such to be unsealed this week may finally reveal exactly how close that petifile was would say bill clinton and whether ore not the former presen in visited his private carbian island little saint james the files part of the defamation case virginia roberts brought against jislan maxwell who is of course the procurer for jeffry epsin could give fresh insight ins privious claims by roberts that clinton was on pettil island a claim later repeated it by clinton's former aid dug mand roberts said she saw clinton go off intothe niht with a beautiful woman on each arm which hum would be wildly in character for bill clinton clin has adimantly denied over being on epstine's island roberts mad no allegations of wrong doing my clint nor is there any indication the sealed records contain evidence of legal conduct by the former president although of course there is a photo of clint enjoying a neck masadge from a jeuffrey epstine victim in photographs obtained exclusively by the daily mail he is sitting and laughing as a woman amed shante davies then twenty too and who acted as epstine's personal mas sus rubs his shoulders his why not man tat that is bill clinton all over solid stuff there from the former president of the united states who else will be in epstine's files i'l be fascinating to find out that is a bill that is going to come do and here is the thing if he will soc all the institutions are broken all of them the moral institutions the elet are supposed to lead us those people the're brokn as well in twenty twenty four on comes to the election somebody is going to lose that election all this is now being telescoped every bit of social disconnect every bit of social fracturing is being telescoped into the twenty twenty four election and some one is going win and some one is going to lose and when that happens all hell is likely to break loose no matter who wins or who loses things ire can to get really super ugly and that is a consequence of the lies thathave ben told for years those lies of ventually come du when you lie people eventually feel the consequences of that lie both sides in america right now promise the moon and neither side actually acknowledges reality here just some more realitie tht can cslapping us in the face over and over and over again america's enemies are not simply gan a stop because we decide withdraw from the world at wor sing on formn policy which one from the world is not a solution it just gets worse the world becomes a worst place tacnology is not going to stop developing just becaue a politicion promises you it will and redistributionism is not going to be and mechanism for fixing any of that government is not the solution to life's unfairness far more often it is the cause of life's onfairness we cannot keep spending endless amounts of money nevere distributionism is not an us alve for lack of productivity if you think the bills gun come doin twenty tonty for its can a keep coming to because bills always come do we have been living in the after math of the industrial era in which the united states had massive imbedded advantages over the rest of the world due to the rest ofthe world basely collapsing during the world wor to and th united states jetted far ahead of everybody else and then we live fat on the land and it turns out that we under cut our own moral credibility by getting rid of all the intermediate social institutions e got rid churches we got rid families an we decided we could be atomistic individuals who did notyou have to develope their own skills because we are fat and we are happy ndthen if all that was bad o borrow te'u have government fix all of our problems the bill comes du on that stuff americans have put our failure to recognize reality on the credicard for generations for generations do not wore t willalways beibl pay for later whell twenty twenty four might be te year that we pay for it it might be the year that we pay for it as we are always going to ay for to tumpoint now meanwhile it is fascinating to watch as the republican primaries play out right now if you look to polling data donal trump is well ahead in literally every state in iowa the latest results from the polling data have donal trump up over his opposition by a significant margin the real cor politics pulling average and iwa has donald trump leading his opponents by up to thirty points the new hampshire primaries trump is leading his opponents bi upwards of twenty points if trump win to iowa it may as well be all over but the crine now remember iwas caucas state the primaries taking place on the fifteenth of this month we now have about now a little under two weeks before the iwa caucasis it is quite possible that the pulling results from iwa ore not can be reflect of the actual results becuse again it is very weird system the way the iwa caucasis work is that if youre first choice does not make the run off then you can switch to your second choice let usa yo vote for nicky haley and nicky haliisns in the top to its trump for sisantis you get your second choice than flips into play if you voted for halian then to santus for example then your vote would move from one to the other in terms of top result there is there is alsuch weirdnesses to the coxes that do not really exist with regard to the other primaryes suffice it to say that if trump wins the eyewa coxes it is very difficult to see how exactly he does not win in new hampshire particularly because nickey haley has been making simbooboos and because cris christy is still in the race it is astonishing to me that chris christy continues to stick around christen new new who is the governor of new hampshire who is backing nickey haley he says whis christeven in this race i'm confused nickey haley is the first feball minority governor in the country's history she is one that stood up and insisted did not take compromises insisted that the confederate flag devery move for the state house lawn i do nothink any one's questioning a her credibility in credentials when it comes to race an equity in the quality in this country folks understand that they know it she is about it it is anon issu cris christy's a friend but his race is that an absolute and he is get to say anything in can this or two person race friht it is between trump and nickee haley everybody understands that he knows his voters who wantesty trunp defeated are all coming over to nickee haley a in fact the only person that wants chris christy to stay in the race is donal trup right i ma think about the irony of that the fact that he crises out their trying to attack or tryig to make ways that that is not surprising anagain theve these primaries by the polling get up and pulls an elections the're not particularly competitive at this plaint the fact the chris christy is staying in he has no shot of the nomination whatsoever is insane if he actually does not down trumplea he says he does not stangin in new hampshire makes no sense at all but cris christy is such a creature of ego it is absolye astonishing over the courso last week nickey hayley came in for some serious criticism while we are off the air tbecause shofs asked about the causes of the civil war and she gave this answer thank you maser ankky es what was the cause of the united states civil war well do not come with an easy cuestionan and te i think the cause of the civil war was fasically how government was goin a run the freedoms an what people couldni could not do what do you think the cause of the civil war was and now shofs racked up and down for this now cause the civil war was indeed slavery although at hebegining of e civil war wlincoln said was not slavery an lincoln did openly say tobeganing the civil war there was about the retaining the union of the country and that if he could retain the union of the country by retaining slavery he would do it slavery was the underlying issue that drove a wadge into the middle of the union obviously and that is why you had the confederate states that wer proslavery and the northern states that were not prot slavery and the civil war effectively ended with the abolition of slavery with that said when nickiy haley is saying is second darily correct that you did have an argument tha was taking place or rethe powers the federal government fors the power of state governments and in which abraham lincoln made the case that thes declaration of independence is guaranteeds of life liberty and the prursue of happiness ought to be extended to everyone who lived in the united states and should be a citizen of the united states including of course wh lack americans but this provided an opening for everybody to attack nicky haley whichwas a booboo that she could really not aford she did clarify her statement'sa little belater hers what shehad to say you kow i've done a hundred and fifty town halls more than that now and we sake every hand we answer every question and i stay until the last person laves and we take questhions from everybody republicans democrats an a pen it who ever shows up we do not scrain them we let them ast whatever they want and we had a question there and yes of course the first thing i should have said with slavery i completely agry with that an' when you grow up in the south flavery is a given when you think of the cevil wor it was about slavery that is not au o that is never been in question and au do not you look a fact i'm a southern governor who actually ast and got the confederte quige to come down in front of the state holf it again the fact that she had to defend herself on this thet desinnra believe that nikey halyes proe slaveryor does not understand the civilar of course not e sort of weird questions and the it does mean gin give bad answer there she would give bad answer there as she had a clarify but is any of this con a matter at all probably not other thingsthat do not matter anything donal trum cessor dos sy i's ben the entire dynamic o the primaries is that no matter what trump does and i think i's one of the reasons why for example to santos supporters are almost beside themselves because there saying we are more con servative than every thing donald trum says he is for and yet no one seems to care the big case of that over the course of the last week is that donald trump has been calling for the d funding of the fpibas the fpi of course has been militrized against him in a wide variety of ways well he then said that he wanted a new fp headquarters in washington d c he put out a statements and quat the fa headquarter should not be moved a faraway location but should say right where it is and a new spectacular buildin in the best location on are now crime wridten and filthy dirty grafet scarred capital they should be involved in bringing back you see not runing away from it especially the violent crime there wis talk about moving it outside of washington d c fellow republicans are what that hell ly are not you t one has ben railing against the f bii governor do sans is sep donal trump failed to drain the swamps or perhaps it is not surprising that he is seeking to deep in the swamp by building a mass wo no fbi building in d c actually draining the swamp requires taking power out of d ce not commencing power inside d c now what would that said as that can have any impact on trump of course not is son can have t any impact on trum this why say that one comes to the wenty twentys for election basically only exoginous circumstances are going to change how the election gos eon has ther opinion trump bases ther opinion bidin that ckan it is what it is o at i would be remiss if i did not comment at the beginning of this year on a couple of new laws to take effact in my old home state of california i got a say the dum e state in america truly in idiotic state or least governed by idiots california has now announced that they have gender neutral toy isles man dded in law son californ if you open the twoy shop you must have a gender neutral toy isle the law which w rent to into effect on monday sums from a twenty twenty one bill and the california legislature acquiring toy retailors with a physical location in the state and at least five hundred employese to maintain a genderor neutral section or area to be labelled at the discretion of the retailer california assembly member evonlows had who as inspired to introduce this bill by an eightyeral girl who asked why should a store tell me what a girls shirt or tois a first ovolu hould never be inspire by anything childs us just con tellinu not not to make political action anyway amd inspired by my children all the time their wonder at the world i am not inspired by their generalized wisdom because they are children that is stupid an my candest questions al the time the answer to why should istor tell me what a girls shirt or a toy is is the marketing people at the company are seeking to make a clear to parents where they can go for the quickest access to say a doll or a nerf gun that is why does at mean you cannot got a gift for your daughter from the boy toys and does not mean the opposite but by and large my son legs nerf guns and footballs and my daughters girly things because boys and girls are real things that exist in the world the fact that california is now man datin this nonsense is resdicules by the way of course ther just targening the begreed tailers if you are small toy store they understand that we look really bad s geft mom and pops toy shop because they have a girl isle with dolls and a boy al footballs her bill will hlp children express themselves freely in without bices we need to let kids be kidsaid low for it iswell these kis aren chopping for themselves they eight my kit is amocratic cart is yours if you are doing it wrong it is weird a'm with them stores failing to comply with the new law could be subjected to a two under fifty alipenalty for the first violation and up to five hundred bok for subsequent in fraction according to the bill text out one we shuld ll have compassion for individuals experiencing genderd is foria said califama a california family council present jonthan keller but actives and state legilators have no right to forcery tailers to aspouse government approve messages about sexuality in gender bythe one o the great things about supposed gender neutral districts an areas did they very often tend to exascor bate exactly the gender differentiation that is reality sif you go to the nortic countries for example an all sorts of social welfare programs tat are designe to alleviates the differences between men and women and women because of all those welfare programs tend to go into field that women to go into and men tend to go into engineering and sat as not the only stupid california law going into effect a new california law ill also crate emergency alert system called an ebony alert what exactlyes in abony alert it is a new kind of alert for an a black youth or young black woman is reported missing under unexplained or suspicious circumstances why exactly do you need an ebony alert as opposed to just an amber alert because apparently apparently nothing tere'sthat there the is no actual rationow other than the suggestion that black people are being treated in discriminatory fastion by the amberal lerts which is just insane california worlds dummast

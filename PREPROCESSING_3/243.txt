with liperty a just r and it penou i modown if tf a s been a long journey to this moment for obdi starting in twenty thirteen we your whole episode of our show years ago build around recordings that obdy made during that difficult journey to america and to day te commemorate his new statu says our fellow citizen he werethoght we would replay that story with some obdays ot the end is as he began when he one something called the diversity b sel later it y d latery if you never heard of this it sons lic kind ofthing that campy real but ht's been around since the nindies rembethe n isits government every year the original idea tit was to get a more varied group of emmigrants from a diversity of countries into our country the com ad ministration as cut some of the oligible countrysfrom the list but the lotery is still operating ever fourteen million people api for the twenty twenty latery with over eighty thousand winners i can twenty thirteen ob e found out he wan and a sibr cafe and canya i tey wis a smiling refu g back than living in canyo his next sum kaping than what you was from those days yo here obds american accent is not as good as it is now he remembers the moment that he won this way he set down in his computer i put m cal formissionomper i put my dinner bord i thin cle sommi there was a few sickens of silence but thin you hofbeing rand lomly selected eveready went nots wifted him up in the air in his chair but obd did not believe it he asked his friends to put him down e started entering his in formation into the computer again and again s the sem alzer the semperest bons a bud simpespos i realise that worn i wooked out with this friends all choke him behind me front of me'holding my hads shokin me my heart was bombi i i wilst not hold ing myself together wmoving to america seeming te dundeo but he idn't know the haf of it wenning the lottery was especially being deo for obdy because realy more than anybody he knew obdy had been obsessed with america sains he was little as a kad groing up in mogadishu sumalia hou'll go t the movies which in mogadisho just men a t v perched on ha table and a shack ndhe would bring a pen in paper to watch american films we could write down any words he did not now oring the language better he became known to people as the guy who could translate the movi for you would happen on screen and everybody would turn to obdy who shut out he says he is about to kill that guy he pronounce is english an american that is wyhis accent is amazing on herhim wich wlent to his nickname that all his friends called him obd american that is my name that is my nicne and has he got older he devoted himself to the goll of getting to america not only studying english bu al teaching it he dids't radio stories in english nd you can totally understand why it when we have his country right he gro it simalia for years there was no function in government ite was rival wor words and ishes and just anarchy dangerous and violen the we bobbings and attacks from the terrorist group il shup aab which is filiated without kita by says for him or really for any man in his twenties in simalia it is hard to stay out of the fight he cannot just be neutral and go about your life he tell stories about sh about members threatening him to join them or else a one check point on h way to his mams they told him basically nhat's time he come through here better be one of us as that or join the government forces who were fighting alchabab or he could flee the country an nother's boats full of people trying to cross the mediterranean to get to europe and sometimes they sink and hundredso people drown obty nost people whofav gone on those boats anda boats them to escape to yeman yes i've lost three very good friends im one of these friends had hes gild a les an youre alt with his wive he knew help tis we him but he could not swm because he is gild will he wasl trancs to to safys gil and hes wep and then they were called oup in to see a shoks they were not the only once who died there seven five ote miles wore killed in that journey on a that has gene nothing about our decision that dare not is carasa ou at all we know deat bes there several times ob dy pland to take one of those boats but he had trouble gtting the money together and eventually his mom talked amout of it instead he escaped across the boarder to canye small youn canyar an next to each other oby move to niroby and wrote an he university tri twice for student vies into america was the nied boath times if he had not gtn lucky that day in the sibr cafa he said he woad beenlooking again an getting on a boat ye if i had not lotle one to greink at lattery that was wo of tioms i will smot afraid to do that i'm looking forward alive i'm to get to ded i w'll keep try to the deat yo thing about the lattery though what ob dey learned is that it does not guarantee or life in america the fact is sests the first step after you wan you have to wait more than a year then you show up in an american embassy for an interview and you have to gather all kinds of people work to bring with you medical documents and school transcrapts and criminal background check everyting has to be perfect everhe ey doted the tiniest mistake means that you can be denied for good the fact most years of for half the people who win the lattery nd never get their veses they do not make it to america and right away after winning the lattery obty got a bad brag the police and ne ro be canya where he lived shut a rading houses wlooking to round up all the smalis him and kicke them out ofthe country we have a very unusual day by day record of what happened to obdy caus a bby sa reporter named we o hornac won is document this process and sturted

world we guessprgly trying to make it to america bo become one of us i get yo remember whre we are abd is abat to be tiken into castidy by the police here is theorhoinak here is why the police were raiding abtis neighbourhood in iropy aushebab the very group abty moved to keny to escape have been ramping up terrice tottacks inside kena you may remember one of the biggest ones the hasses crisis

way the kenyon government responded to these terrice attacks was the way governments often doing these situations with the huge crack down on the community their hold responsible aushebabs from

essentially going to hiding lock down in their building they stope going to school s the days go by food begins to run short atin hassn pull their supplies with another sumali family on the ground floor of their building two women one a single mother with two small boys but it is not much soon they down to just tea an sugar and a loaf of bread their able to get each day from a kenyan guy who delivers it on his bike tat's what they were living on tea and bread our eyes ar tonin read and o thea yous fon ou look alike but it is keeny abtyand hassan ar paying for the tea and bread with money they get from over seas years ago abty did some reports for an ameritcan public radio show called the story and a listener reached out wanting to help she sends the money not too different from lots of sumaly refuges who ar family members abroad supporting them but obviously that kind of help only goes far it is the challeng in begus you cannot even sud your eyes at night and sleep soundly this is abty's older brother hassan he tells me they are not sleeping he and abty sound the same by the way apparently even their father cannot tell them apart on the forn any minute you expect comes in breaking into your house grabin you it is sleeving will you pant an get you kno you are always ravyy you donno wi ar you not wa if yeulin hamis lik how you relax you wirke movy you something ten no

sudden family members a really nice to them ar cousins they have not spoken to in years start calling to say high asking for favours i wondered if this was the case with abdy here he was sitting in a

counting abty cautiously ventures out the apartment building for the first time in weeks he heads down town to central my roby when life is continuing us normal it is a stressful journey but he is able to buy couple of gallons of clean water and some cans of beings to bring home he says it is amazing how good these taste to him and has san he tells me he is getting more and more worried about the paper work he still has to get together for his interview his medical records and transcripts from his university and thre's one piece of paper that terrifies him whet of the yous ebassy requirements it is to get a police ifcy a something called there setifgate of good conduct what this paceically is is proof from cenyan lawe inforcement to abty is not a criminal abdy does not have a records this should not be a big deal except for the place he has to go to get the official certificates the head quarters of the cenyon police that is scarcely ala thousands of some milers are our being held as we speak and theyre waiting for a ther pretend some mate or some of them are wein for their reten to the camps otom thinking off camping into our bas on head to hed quatris stepping in ther insaying ha gas a any a police letter my hard is already banly for weeks ab deen been talking to me about this telling me how worried he was about having to go into the belly of the beast finally on a tuesday morning in may seventy seven days before heis interview he gets up early gets together every idea he has to prove he is a legal rrefug says good by to hassan and takes a buss to polics head quarters he walks in waits for his name to be called and walks up to the window when he face is a kenyon police officer and when he encounters is not brutal police tactics but burocrisy he was telling me theres lething that i can do but thak your baver of sa little younit are and the ave to waite for them to come back to me iven a cav tic more than five math as he tesl five months wai too long for abty to have it in time for his interview on july twenty second the guid there was not or friendly he was really real of fierce and i was frozen with fer i'll findall i tell him wai just lison me a gerome yous talking about five maths sir but that is not wan farkan bat if i do not get this policifky and the will not give me or esu af veaser for me ri poleice 's i possible and he was telling me het's letting the ecan for you its go thic more than fact months there is no possibility of you going into a late a position with the u s embasser i daesn't happen if you deler interviewed as thend of hich some other people will grap if hi sir we there is win be a doom it is cannt be a doom apt e says and i felt back too up to this point it seemd if abty coul just hold on long enough to get to his embassy interview he would make it to america now all bets were off now unless thi's changed there was no way we o horno abte decides to keep going back to pois headquarters every few weeks tespite the res despend our frightening it is tose if one time maybe get a diffrent answer what appens next in a minute from chicagobob a gredio when a program continues it isis american life from ire a glass to the an a programma repaying the story of abdy nor just three weeks after the ceremony where he finally became a you citizen abdy's a smaly refuge ee who escaped to kenyan in tany one what amounts to a golden ticket to move the united states become an american but only if he is able to make it to an interview with the u s embassy with all the ray paper work all done perfectly scin cash in that gorden ticket the nad nations has reported that the number of people around the world displaced from their homes because of conflict an persecution is at an odd time high it is over seventy million people the larges number of the uen has ever recorded abdy of course is one of thuse people he is maslen from a country with a proving history of terrisen the stray ol happend back in twenty thirteen but to day and the present en tramps travel ban a some maly abdy would not be allowed of hise at the emigratin to the a it stad an wey wearhoni continues ther story may twelve tree man as seventy one days to abtys embassy interview at te gets on the pass home from school and this time runs into another danger not the police not aushapout themselves but the fear of auchabab the bas is crowded with people and theyre at these two ladies watchin at the looks round and realizes he is the only surmarly people can telve simarlis look different and the simaley with the back pack on on a public bass he knows what people ar thinking theye watchin my hands they thinking lik when is this gar putting his head into their beg and stat blow up this ladies then started chori ano the driver av you made sure there is no bam in their bed i hade wiy began i say thissen lady womin it im not wet o thing i am now am now there is no bam here and not one of those people i stillin them oncaring my books it is quite embarrassin and tat sometime i feel here because if who went in there a a veryy cuat wat eyes on me in canion because people do not trust the police mops will take justice into their own hands for example if a shop keeper yells face on the street strangers might grab the person and beat them and it is not unheard of for people to die this way a man in the back of the past chimes in why s see there he shouts kick him out i tried as migcht as thi can cam them dow and they were ignirin me and then the driver turnis his head and tells me boy step out of maker are i call the police and we were not in the te modici we were int in downton we were in the middle and in the middle what i am in in the middle is exacgly the bangani police station this is the police station som marly terroris bom two weeks earlier will you think if they keep me out there with a bad standing there near the police station was then heaven they can shooe me to bed i said to the driver wa me you want a no whatsing here and then i had to and seep my beg bring everything out the boks the papers showed him the ben they idisly ady everything i brougt out and then i hang the bag upside down and show him you see anything in there nd they look the graver was tan satisfyen i thoi stray and he drove the ar w as te four days later may sixteen sixty seven days to the interview awshabab blows up two basses it is a big deal they were in a central markin at theast twelve deads more than seventy incit at thes sure the police will be out in forse and he hunkers down a a b hey av de what sor passi

everygy o is nother rifou dou that was madin from fortes we greo ssi there was one thing about the approval of abdys vesa that made is wonder the day abdes veazar was issued before he heard the news i had actually called the u s embassy an ny roby i said i was a reporter doing a story about abd and that was curious about how long their decision would take because of my deadline the woman i spoke wo said she did not know for nine days abdy had not heard anything two hours after my call he got the good news we asked the state department if my phone cal influence their decision about abdy's vezar and they told us quote the journalist call played no role in the timing of the vesa issuance any vees a process coinciding with a pressinquiry is merely a coincidence i cannot prove anything but that is at odds with what the woman on the phone told me back when i initially called the embassy she said that now that they knew i was doing a story about abd they would try an expedite the process even though i told her that was not why i was calling and that i was only asking for information we spoke with eight immigration lawyers all experience with the diversity viesa lottery and they all said my call probably bumped abdys applications to the top of the pile that day and with a lottery because they give out a finite number of vesers by a hard deadline that can be the difference betwen making

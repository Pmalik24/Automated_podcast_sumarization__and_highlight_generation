with the ues officials on the front lines hise job un to remain in mexico is to send people back thot's of them been resigning saing no thi's actually not my job as angos times re port ir malea tool tock to a mench of them before the remain in mexico policy began and up ended the asylmum system and completely change what it is to be in asylum officer here is all the job used to work when a sentral american showed up at the ues mexico border and said let me in i'm afraid of going back to my country that is where the asylum officer came in the officer did something called a credible fiere screening to check if the person was likely to face harm or death if the uest sent them back home if there is even a chance that they would the asylum officer would let them into the united states to wait for a quart dat were an emigration jadge would make the finum call dug stephen says people do not understand how hard the job is at the time all this started he was an asylum officer and sen vasisco it is i'd have people come to my offise and my job te central is tell me the worst thing that have happen to you have an hour go and that all the side if you telling me the truth and all the side if o us sti you are expected to be were wreally to do the job well need to be an expert in the political cultural sotural and economic situations in he nnumerabl countries around the world and your expected to be a human mydotector all at once present trom tock spot asylum itself as if it is frad he says it is a hoax a big fat conjob that people comem in with fake asylum claims that asylum officers just let every one throw and then asylum seekers never show up for their dane ort that it is a border wide two thousand mile looppole and it is true then most people do pass that first stop with an asylum officer and enter the united states but there is a good reason for that it is builtin do you us asylum law a common sense humanitarian idea we do not want to send people back to situations where they would get tortured or killed the legal term as non refalument and you es law set the bar law if there is basically any chance and asylum secret could get killed or harmed the officers was to let them into the uus and does not need a lot of proof or evidence at that point later when they get before an emigration judge and by the way the majority du shoa there they need proof and most of them get rejected even before president trum took office less than fifteen per cent per year got asylum that is because most people do not meet the specific criteria in the law or do not have enough evidence or it does not check out all the asylum officers i've ever spoken with see it as their job to wead out the fakers the people who do not really need protection the one whoere just tring to gain the system oh my god heres where i'm going to be real with you this is an asylum officer we are calling ersula this is not her voice she is afraid of getting fired we had an act or copy what she said as closely as possible the frad hap is happening on a skaled thats that is huge we are talking hundreds of people amonth i interviewed three asylum officers for this story and all three said the groups that have been the primary target of president trumps emigration policies they actually are not the main ones committing fraud it is not the central americans it is not the middaleastern people it is the indian people and the chinese people they all have the same bullshit is story about getting beaten with hockey sticks three times because their part of is seek party and the police told them they are going to jail them if they ever badmouth the ruling party ever again bullshit just hap they all just happened to do the same thing and suffer the same fate even though thereis absolutely no confirmation in any media that any of this persecution is happening and study's done by our our department of state a counter parts in the country are straight up this is not a real thing the chinese are running as similar scam with christian claims in the fall of twenty eighteen asylum officers started hearing about these big changes coming the policy that was first called remain in mexico and then later migan protection protocals m p p but the asylum officers who were going to have to implement this thing they did not know any of the details of how they were supposed to do it it was all shrouded and much secrecy this is another asylum officer we are calling her ann we used an actor here too to protect her identity over the next few weeks ann starts picking up around the office that some of her colleagues were been called in quietly and ask to go to the border in sandiago and instead of the credible fear screenings they would always done they seemd to be doing something entirely different under m p p a whole new kind of interview with different rules she knew she is going to have to start doing them too she pulled aside a co worker who would already been sent to the border i was asking her ay what is what is the training what is this and she was i'm not allowed to talk to about it another asylum of ja is thone who youd consider a friend ore ja sorter professional colleague good colleague good colleague some one that we had mutual trust for sure and then was told was brought in by a superviser for a special brief about about it before i was going to start doing these inte rviews and was told here is the skinny on it and do not tell any one why because i think they knew that it was legally dubios and suspect and they wanted to keep tthe the leak to minoum the leak being a major policy roll ut that was can a change asylum eh that is the l that is the leak yet two months go by before they do a formal training session with the full asylum corn nd it is just a power point here is our sola again hands were going up and being we how is this legal or how are we going to be doing this and how do we know how this works all three of the asylum officers i talk to said that the presentation left them with lots of questions including the biggest one how was this legal these officers knew better than almost any one how dangerous mexico is and as policy seemed designe to send tuns of people back to mexico it seemed to be in direct contradiction with you as asylum law which says that at the very least we cannot send people back to a situation where they would get harmed or killed we cannot violate the principle of non refalment and the response was i'm just the messenger bringing this down from h ke and this is the power point they gave us i was well if you do not even care about double checking that this is legal and you are just the messenger as you say you are a facanass hal all three officers say they raised s concerns and got roughly the same response just get out there and do your job but they found out soon enough was just how radical a change the new m p p interviews were from the old credible fier screenings for starters not everyone would get an interview only the people who volunteered that they were scared to go back to mexico would if they got an interview under m p p asylum sekers would have to prove that they would be harmed in mexico not their home country an not just any harm they cannot just be threatened by gangs or the police they have to be threatened by gangs or police or whoever be cause of some very specific reasons laid out in you as law because of their nationality race religion politics or being part of a particular social group i'll ge b d ku and they would have to show that the mexican government a cop or an official was unable or unwilling to protect them and the asylum seeker could not just say all this happen they could under credible fier screeings now they need to prove it it is as asylum seekers were travelling through mexico fleeing for their lives they should have been gathering evidence of all the screwed up things happening to them there making a paper trail and they shoud have had all of this evidence on them right then right after crossing the border which of course is next impossible especially because they had no idea any of this was required dugs awall this happening and wanted nothing to do with it s we tried to keep his head down to try and avoid having to do these interviews hoping the courts would kill m p p but they did not by june m p p returns hat sky rocketed and it was all hands on deck for the asylum cor dug could not dodge it anymore and i do not be now it said you are doing m p p interviews toy i heard u father and son sonithink was pretanes elevenr twelve the flng om underus bec cause o violunce another problems did not palk about thaut much cause it does not matter for the purpose of imputy an fokest only in why they'r afraid to go back to mexico of course the guy and his son do not understand why their even talking about mexico they do not understand any of is at all the interview continued she had tried to find a place to live there had tried to ge a work permiten mexico and was a sentually demied and as her cansings talking about youre encountering car tells and witness saying other mygrancs being murdered tortured in front of i son and fleeing and burlid enting away wall that ats er bing sht and ti him out his son having mihtners for weeks because of is and then be get stop by the polace and he please take all their money herselfans and because i cannot get them to save tese magic wordsiflak yet befretten me because i'm hunder but that is all they had o t been ono that a because i'm hunderan those would be the magic words that woeuld put them in a protected category they were targeted because of their nationality though even if the father had said because i'm hunder and they probably still woul have been sent back to mexico because odds are he did not have any evidence proving that any of this happened dug he did what the paus he told him to do he sent them back to mexico the old credible fier scranings usually took an hour or less these empy p interviews can last four five six hours when i ask these asylum officers to describe what these interviews are for them for the migents in front of them ersali gave the most fithed picture she told me about the very first enp p interview she did a family from als alvador two parents in two kids she had a script she had to stick to the family was exhausted and tromatized and totally unprepared your put into a cell you are separated from your kids and your wife you have no idea what is going on because you thought to day you were going to be interviewed about al salvador and you were going to get to enter the united states couple hours later they lead you into this freesing cold cell where they chan your hands to a table in handcuffs and some one is sitting across from you who does not speak your language and starts talking to some one in the phone who starts translating to you that you are going to talk about mexico you smell shit because you have been living in a shelter without any running water for a month and a half buss you have travelled all the way across central america to get there and you do not understand why someone is talking to you about mexico this interview goes on for an hour and a half and the person keeps pausing it they can talk to some one on the computer which they say is their superviser and nothergard leads your wife an that you have not seen in the last twelve hours into the interview room and you can brush her hand as she passes by your happy to see her because you have been separated you have no idea what is going on where are my children i do not know sir i'm sure they will be fine your wife goes through a similar intervieou om but she keeps being confronted about the answer she is giving because thei'r different from yours and the officer can understand why this story verys differently between two people who experienced id half an hour passes before her children are brought into the room and then the officer has to talk to a ten year old boy about whatever his parents said and then confront th he ten year old boy on inconsistencies between his story and his parents story and then the wife is when am i going to see my husband again nthe officers i have no idea let them know if you need to use the bathroo ursula made the case that the family should not get sent bacx to mexico and to her shock her supervisor agree in fact she happened to walk outside the moment the family got released they have got their back packs on their holding hands she thought maybe this will not be bad but that was the last time the very next interview a woman told her over and over she was afraid of being raped and killed in mexico ursula believed she was going back to a place her that was very possibl but because the woman could not name a specific person who would assault her ursula had to send her back since then it is essentially been kno after kno after kno asylum officers told me that even when they find one of those unicorn cases wer they check off all the boxes and recommend not returning to mexico their supervisors overrule them ann told me and mi producer nautya raymon about one asylum secre's case were their attacker even spelled out their motive and it still did not fly it was basically a situation where there was a really clear connection to the nationality the persecutor head really said i am harming you because of this nationality youre nationality and the harm was really really severe it was ly definitely torture and oh it was really clear that the police were not goingto do a thing about it did not care at all and the supervisor rejected it why lyde the say wy they said ah we cannot show that if this individual went back to mexico the persecutor would be able to locate them the standard to days upside down from what it used to be inecredible fear instead of let us ere on the side of letting people in because we do not want any one to be tortured or die under m p p the standard is almost impossibly high almost nobody gets in the department of only an security says only about nine hundred and sixty people interviewed have not been sent bck to mexico ultimately of a little more than forty seven thousand m p p cases registered as of october with about thirty seven thousand of those still pending of those only eleven people have been granted asylum or some other kind of relief according to syrks iniversity which tracks all this ies in government atistics eleven and that is hat the policy was meant to do the administration credits and p p for a sharp drop in the numbers coming to the border mark morgan the acting had of customs and border protection calls it a game changer and absolutely successful it only took dug two days and five interviews to go home after work and pull out the law books he is a lawyer he actually own to beat up copy of the emigration an naionality at the law hundreds of pages long that makes up the foundation of view as simmigration sisto he grabbed that off his bedroom shelf along with a few of his other books from losscul he printed out a bunch of court cases and supreme court decisions with more cases pulled up on is con petersgrane in the middle of all of this was his pen and white legal pad as an attorney he wanted to get his feelings about em p p how much worse it felt compared to everything else they did down in writing he worked for hours and he wrote down seven bullet points the main ways he thought m p p was a legal once he saw the list laid out there on the lined white paper dug knew what to do the next day he went to tell his supervisor he was not going to do any more im p p interviews his resplonce wes i know these interviews are horror ard were all required do them it is wor a turin spread it out it is you known realling basis it is cetera at cetera and an he not that pint there is this this moment whe i could it could have just said you are right and now the sax and gone back and a pas and i told him you would understand i'm not doing his enteries ou wan sly what e you are not doing his enermies as i now shiy i can ther legal to thatfully moral and i'm that ditg his bot's was done he did not really seem to know what to say eventually he told him he was probably going to have to write him up somehow to start disciplinary proceedings dug went home that night and decided to escalate he went back to his legal pat i a sentuly rat a legal memol explaining all of the reasons hat if thaugt it was legal and why is refusing to do it and that on that monday i he mal that to all of the administration and san francist gow and at the two supervisors that were involved in the dispi proseedings and then nothing nothing happened instead of sparking some kind of rebellion or at least forcing a confrortation it is crickets he took it a step further he sent his memer to a sentors office then he dropped tat his good by gemal detached his memmol and sents it out office why to all of san fracisco asylum about eighty people and to are representative of the union for asylum officers across the country and with that to shut down his where compierre and walked out he quet they make one change and everyone of the officers all this is terrible but we will figure it out and they make another change t yous is terrible but but i mean my job i'm in a do it even if i don' wantou an all complain about it it complain about the work and i't complain about the hours the end of the day i mean a do it and the more i do it the easier it is to do and that his terrified i mean that is how all the awful things in the world it happened that is how you get many good people doing really bad things and that is what is happening and it is terrifi you are literly sommin people back to e raped in cot that is what this is the three officers i spoke with ere not alone a union representing the asylum officers and u caas employs file debrief in a lofsut against the administration barguing that m p p was a legal and a ton of officers at quitting i've heard this from a bunch of people in the asylum corps and that citizenship an emigration services the parent agency several use the word accidess and if officers cannot quit they are calling in seck anything they can do to avoid an p p interviews we tried to get some numbers from the government they would not tell us how many people had left they did say that by the end of the year they hoped to have seven hundred seventy one asylum officers but as of a month ago they had something five fifty meaning theyare roughly two hundred people short i tried to get an interview with the acting head of c i s can cuchinalli to talk about all this he sense been named deputy homelandscurity secretary he did not give us one but i did get one question in it was oat a press breakfast this audio was recorded on my fot i thi molly or twofor nigt s ns yo haw you reto the concerns from some of tam you are asylum officers teyare concerns that many policies ben handed down by the trump idnitration partic early targeting asylum rin fact allegal that there be ordered to implement policies that are a direct contradiction with emeration lost their pass by comis oonr waswe makes o noople yos yous ore expected to ust we weagree or all this ah but it you expect that do you yet the professional loyes that you teresalstos place theyre wor they are part of the executive branch he said and long as we arein the position of putting in place but we believe to be legal policies that have not been found to be otherwise we have fully expect them to implement those faithfully and sincerely and vigorously now we are to shy an p pece first birthday after chaotic start it is thousands returned each week it is expanded all the way east a crosshe u esborder from california to texasis gulf coast and it is not just central americans being pushed back now it is cubans then aswilums pregnant woman i'll d b d cue asylum at least at the southern border has essentially ground to a halt here is anne i'll say this the administrations been successful what do you mean they want negative decisions they do not want asylum seekers in this country they do not want people to get positive decisions or determinations for asylum they umhave felt that the standards for screening interviews wer too low and they wanted those standards changed and those standards raised end they have succeeded what do you think the administrations end goal is no more people from chitholl countries anne throws up in ashower almost every day she has recurring nightmeres she says she cannot focus cannot sleep she thinks about the people she is returned to mexico all the time it is nearly a hundred but there is one family in particular that she cannot stop thinking about a father and son why do you think that case sticks with you kit was really young what happened to thit is gut get kidden aupt he gett murdered happening happening a lot what was santent what is my moral culpability in that i interviewed that case and my signatures on that paper work and that is something now that i live with ye i feel i feel in someway that this administrations made me humanrates opieser the irony of thes policies that under our asylum law to qualify for asylum you have to have been harmed because your part of a particular group a certain class of people and the way that the asylum officers have implemented m p p they have created exactly that a huge group of people in need of pratection about sixty thousand migrans forced by the uas back to mexico to be preyed upon there as they wait on their request for safety in the ess it is exactly the sort of situation that our law was supposed to prevent one asylum officer told me it is the first time that we have been asked to affirmatively do harm to people you are not just saying i do not think you are eligible youre literally saying i believe what you are saying i think you are in danger go back to that danger nalyo to covers in migration for the lost angeless times shore a print version of this story also is

mexico policy andother policies wut di cing about what happens to those people as they wait in mexico for months and before we get to the mext act there is another thing that the trump administration is put in place that makes it a lot harder to get asylum here something we haven' talked abat yet a new rule that went into effect this summer it says if you want asylum in the united states you first have to apply for asylum in at weast one of the countries that you passed through on your way here and if to get rejected by that country before we will give you asylum here in the united states many

bad for r in fact for everybody in the camp all twenty five hundred of who waiting from mants for the court dates hoping for asylum its easy to imagine that this one rule would kill all their applications jenny's attitude was i soon across my fingers hope for the best cause i one go back home in seem to dangerous thir and you dangerous in mexico too lots of people feel that way and the danger i mexico is is subject to back too which we hae arrived at now at too take the long way home if yo had to pick which border city in mexico is the most dangerous the wavellaredo right across the border from loredo texas would be a good contender the state department classifies it is a level four threat that is the same threat level as a rack and serio am lot of danger tere is kidnapping can ot bing is prevalent there that one of our producers met men in a migran shelter wo were terrified to go outside i young cupin gi told her just putting one foot outside the shelter makes om worried et trip pi just two minutes hi's looking all around nhe scared we are interested n these kidnappings cause are commont re porter emily green wenton weverlareder in augus jus this story about one

him that mont the us was sending back migrans from the uside to mexico under im p p that day there were a hundred of them they were easy to spot they all carried clear plassic bags with a couple of documents in them and none of them had shoe laces youest emigration take shoelaces from any one they detain most of them were men many of them with her heads down and on pare stands out to me a father and son in macching polo shirts both of them sweating in the heat their chabvi soft faces dat has his arm around son they seemed the talk to me the man i'l call him davide quickly tells me a story o o e te e te ta te o e te te a oa lave ta te te a a boi a bebos he says he is not a criminal he is a person who is always made a living tut he cannot live in his country any more they are from hunderes david was a business man he ran a little cloothing store the gangs there demand money they call it a war tax the tax ga putting higher and higher and told davide's family could not pay it any more one night the cartell broke into his house threatened to rap his daughter and they fa ive done lots of intervies with people davide my grincs and really difficult situations this one felt especially hard i think just seeing a father fall a part in front of his eleven year old son in we te me we ce e te e e e e e bet e in te on ls he tat pee yo on the bord davi says he wanted to ask for a sylum in the us but the agents did not listen to him they just gave him documents to come back to a court date and desember he cannot go back to hunderes he says o ten e ten e e te e o te oe to te oo te te te a e te o te o a e e e te e e e te a te e te te te i don' have anywhere to go i do not have anything i do not have money he says they say that here we were being sent a lot of people get ki nap and i do not know what to do we only talked for ten minutes i ainted up lending him my phone he called his sister new jersey and explained what happene then he made it to te united states only to be sent back to mexico it was getting dark out and i'd been told not to stay and nwav e lettelo past dusk i crossed back into the uss to go to dinner probably not a mile away from where i last seen davide and my phone rang it was davids sister i'll call her lauda she had my number because it was my phone he called her from earlier to day she was crying hard i struggle to understand what she was saying she tells me davde in i son of bin kidnap just hours after i left them she would got in a call from a cartell demanding ransom o a e e e e lauda says that the cartell told her the ransom was nine thousand dollars for davde and another nine thousand for has son eighteen thousand total they put davde on the phone briefly she knew he was alive and then the kinappers gat on e e o o do ey and i told them where in the wad are we gin to get this money the man on the other and told her she had to get the money he said he would call back to morrow i asked lauda to record the phone calls war en and she did when they called the next day she put them on speaker and used her relative's phone to shoot bido of it te can lookin on o le bin o e noton tin aentin ane te ton te ta moni tanon te they tell her i need you to depassit the money as soonast passible be a hepta the ahutha means old lady lauda is thirty eight she tells thm again tha she has no money that she is sick from anxiety in her conversations with me lauda is scared crying but when she talks to the kinnappers she holds it together she asked if daved in a son ar oqay they canneper tell her they have food that they can bathe for now each call and te last a few minutes o a o are aoby the third day the cartelle has lowered the price to five thousand dollars each for daved in his son lauda works the nightshift at a printing factory and new jersey hardly makes twenty thousand dollars in a year phus she is a single mam and all o these calls the canneppers talk superfast i'm guessing because they have other ransom calls to make cannepping's a big business a volume business with a whole in for structure cannepping migrant has been common an mexsico for a long time whut's different now is that the uess is making it as becially easy for the cartells to i dentify in snatched victums there sending asylum secres back in big groups all at once same time each day and they'r easy to identify with their plassic bags and missing sholaces homeland security did not respond to my request for comment on the kannapping situation but this week the acking head of customs an border protection the uess is quote sending a message to the criminal organizations to stop exploiting these migrants in nuevoladee the most dangerous part of these asylum secers journey is probably that hours rite after they been sent back to mexico after walking across the bridge their transported to the mexican emigration office by van outside the office men in fordor trucks monitor whose coming in going locals call them los malos the badguises one migrant told me about getting chase as he walked to a shelter from there but by far the most dangerous place as a best station it is a place they go to escape noavel lerel but it is a plac and of getting call cannepping is routine the cartells refer to it as passing through the office on the extortion cals yo can tell its a well oiled machine it is methodical they sound the negotiating the price of a car they do this all the time rs louda turns to everyone she can think of she goes to her local police department an tor her mayor's office to ask for help they reach out to the office of seneter cory booker but by the time tho get back to her about a week later it is too late lauda eventually scrapes together money from her mamman sister but just a fraction of what the cartell is asking for e catoi ti yo etin omi oi nati she tells them look i've already pulled together twelve hundred dollars tell me what were ging to do and give me time to get the rest the man says he'l con fer with his balse in the meantime he says she should wire the money lada asked to talk to her brother and they put him on taono l nona she asked avy how are you brother worried he says she tells them do not worry that she is pulled together some money the next day the cartells released taved in his son i talk to david on the phone three days after his release he is distressed it is hard for him to finish the sentence respia tesia tresida greed i tell him i wanted to help him that is not something a reporter spose to say but back when ther cinap their lives were an immediate danger and i helped in small ways i connected lauda with an ingio in mexico city that advocates for migrancs since david in hi son were released i've suggested safe bassoptions the family they always knew that i was a reporter during a story on them but they came to see me as one of the few people they could trust that they could rely on lada called me almost every day with at dates she stild us a few weeks ago i went to meet davite in his family in monthode in northern mexico whene theyre hold up they were staying with an acquaintance of laudas an exchange for grocery money and hoped with construction dave did not want us to interviewing him there he feels is welcome has run out we do the interview at our hotel it sdavide his eleven year old son and his ninetenural daughter he is also been sent back to mexico under mp p yet as is potitatic i'm here with my producer lina we figure well talked to davide in one room while the kids watched te ve in the other i but the kid sit by their dad on the bed they will not leave one another side i wanted to know what happened when i left him that day on the bridge and what he described were all these details of how the cartells kidnapping businthis actually works wonc yure victim on theanside details that were routine and also terrifying here is what happen he said he and the other hundred people who were sent back to mexico that day were taking from the bridge to the local emigration office for processing after that he says he man wearing a mexican emigration officer uniform agreed to take him in a sen to the best station they cun go to a safer city but as soon as they got to the station he got a bad feeling when tent thi me it o me me wen i winting wi my son this god grad me was a told gon strong foolof tetus he grot me when he said i want a thoughk to you wand i said id have nothing tork to your abot and he said you gon not giing to thet car reanas is come quessions and is id do not and he since you can cn to the car thes who were r e hard wore le ma let them wint them he says at least a dozen migrants also arrived at the best station that night and the cartell hustled them into different trucks all the trucks were bran knew he says he remembers that the one he got into was a gran ne son and there were four or five other migrants in theire with him he says the emigration officer who drove him to the best station sat in his car and watched them all being carted off we cannot confirm this but there is a long histery of long force ment in the cartells working hand in hand for example an two thousand eleven seven topfofficials that mexicofs emigration agency were fired amid alligations hat the agency was involved in the cinnapping of migrants and it squares with what his sister in new jersey told me she wired money to that emigration officer for davide's best ticket and when she got the ransom call they cannapfers told her to wire the money to that same account the wont the emigration officer used she said something is not that the emigration officers account and they hung up i asked the mexican emigration agency to respond they told me they have no knowledge of recent complaints of emigration officers turning migrante over to the cartells we r and the tru davide held on to a son the cannapers did not spee elonly ley o go ce omolakavithe gi jus told us to keep er hence then ha stop oking at the sides and the gat who was driving us wast keeping anig on us and he was making sure we were not chining they had the window orold at sa anso they talked over round for a while but davide suspects they were just going in circles that they did not actually travel very far they pulled up to a normal looking house with the big gate inside the cannot presuse our self fones to take pictures of david his son in the rest they interrogated davide about where hes from his line of work how he got to the uest and most importantly what family members he has there it was patient antake at a house clanec except for by cartell we talked about the cartellsas organice crime but i never imagine the book keeping they keep records an potoes of the migrants i kitnap and also who they release davde says there were more than twenty migrans at the house the men an women seppd in separate rooms during the day the cannappers hit any the men who tried to look at the women the room david in his son suptan had one mattress every one else lepptd on the floor at night david would lay on the ground holding his son logaasiis comagosagon in yorr and gono asala a asala a would lay don we him in a corner an at would hak my son tha yor anaor hey could not see you rying but my tes were almost folding out i in on bavi they ge what hurd we the most temly wose that when thes ty arrive the bos he would always tell me that my sons organs were good for selling that he was in a good age that he was only leven years old tey dit heea on o wu gu bate and my son once heard the guide te saying that he kidnes that he sagans were good for selling and he was almost crying and i told him ton crie but i was this ber i sid at havayon as davide tells me the story his two kids are sitting on the bed beside him neither of them is looking at anything in paticular there just sitting there blankly davide also seems devoid of emotion he does not at all resemble that davide from a few weeks ago the whone i talked to right af er his release now his affect is completely flat s on the fourth day of his kidnapping when the bosses woke davit up and told him they would reached ta deal with his sister they may be hol and he said to me get up with your son fadgy this to they an gono release you guis because youse he te already pad made a thepulsin solo socomocael the man told davide if he talked to anyone police reporters the cartell would come for him take his son and killed avide the same man who kid nap them in the first place drove them back to the bust station and bought them eecha tickit davie does not know what happene to the dozens of other people on the house most migrans were a kidnapped in released the cartell gives them a key word it is a pastcode that indicates the migrant has paid off the cartell they are not kidnapped again te david diesn't kiven one maybe because he has not paid a high in a fransom when we met davidin montaret he did not know what he was going to do ondey one of the kidnapping the cartell had taken davide in his sons emigration paper work and they did not give it back without that paper work he does not even know which day he supose just show up in court but even if he could figure it out he told us he is too scared to return to nowawe lavelo under im p p he would have to passure the same port of ventry to get to his hearing what if we get kinapped again he asked last week i get a ponecov from davide the family they been staying within wonteray wants them gone and he is lost hope in the asylum process he thinks they will not be listened to that the hearing processis alive and in fact he is rit about how es cases likely to come out under this ad ministration it is virtually impossible to gain asylum based on gaing violence diveeds decio to take his family back to hundr es the country they try escaping in the first place according to home man se curity his own statistics thousands of other families ire making the same choice

welcome to the huberman o sciyence science tayto e i may ndre hubermen and om a professor of nurbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor noland williams doctor williams is a medical doctor and professor of psychatrian behavioral sciences at stamford universitys school of medicine his laboratory and clinic focus on depression and other mood disorders they focus specifically on the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a brain stimulation technique that can either activate or quiet specific brain circuits as well as circuits within the body in order to treat depression and other mood disorders other laboratories in clinics use t ames what sets apart the work of noland williams in colleagues is that they combine t ames with other treatments and some of those treatments are among the more cutting edge tat you have probably heard about these days including eibogine syllisiben m d me kanibis d m t and other drugs that at this point in time are experimental in terms of clinical trials but that at least the preliminary data show hold great promise for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders in the courso my discussion with doctor williams we covered things such as the history of each of these drugs how they came to be in their current status in terms of their clinical use and legality we also talk about their safety profiles both in children and in adults and we talk about what the future of psychodelic research and clinical use really lookslike for instance we discuss how a number of laboratories in clinics are modifying psychadelics to remove some of their hallucinagenic properties while maintaining some of their anti depress int or anti troma properties you will also learn bout some fascinating research in doctor williams laboratory focason kenemie which is a drug that is increasingly being used to treat depression and contrary to common belief the effects of kedemine in terms of relieving depression may not actually arise from its dissociative effects one thing tht you will find extraordinary about doctor williams is that not only does he have vast knowledge of the various treatments for depression but that he and his laboratory are really combining these treatments in the most potent way that is combining psychodelic treatments with brain machine interface or combining brain machine interface with particular learning protocals that is neurow plasticity protocals which can directly change the brain an specific ways to day youre going to learn a tremendous amount about the neural circuitry underlying depression as well as positive moods you will also learn about all the various drugs that i described and you are really going to learn about the current status and future of the treatment of mood disorders today you will also learn about a number of ongoing studies in doctor williams's laboratory is shou mention that they are recruting subjects for these studies if you go to b sel which stands for brain stimulation laboratory that b s eld ot stamford d e d u you hav the opportunity to apply for one of these clinical trials for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders i confess that the conversation with doctor will leums was for me one of the more stimulating and informative conversations i've ever had about psychodelics which is simply to say that his breadth and depth of knowledge on that topic is incredible and his breadth and depth of knowledge in terms of the underlying brain science and how it can all be combined with clinical applications is also extraordinary i'am sure that by the end of to day's episode you are going to come away with a tremendous amount of knowledge about the clnical and nonclinical uses of those substances and youare going to understand a lot more about how the healthy and diseased brain work before we begin i emphasize of this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science rely t tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's potcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the caled electrolytes and no sugar nowsalt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactolectrolite ratio of one thousand miligrams that one graam of sodium two undermilegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kin of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elemente doccom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleement doccom slash hubermen and now for my discussion with doctor nolen williams thanks fore joining today iam really cited to have this conversation it is in a long time coming and i have a lot of questions about different compounds psychodelics in particular but before we get into that discussion when i ask you about depression broadly speaking intractable depression how common depression is or is not i heard you say in a wonderful talk that you gave that depression is perhaps demost debilitating condition world wide and yet in contrast to other medical conditions cancer we actually have a fairly limited number of tools to approach depression and yet number of tools in the potency of those tools is growing if si could educate us on depression i really appreciateed absolute depression is e a condition that am it has a lot of a lot of te manifestations you can have hand ave a a depression that is primarily loss of interest you can have foks who feel very anxious in the cond of overactive you can have people who do not hav any anxiety at all in their very underactive in they have low motivation to do anything you nes se you have this huge range of symptoms that are in that umbrella of depression and some of our work is tactually work with with folks he contorlists and in cornel and try to actually get a biotypes based off of ner imaging to see if we can conparsout the different depression can ov rea presentations in the in see that clinically and also see that in the brain depression is a the most disabling condition world wide a what is interesting about depression is it is both a risk factor a four other illnessies and it makes other medical and psychiatric illness hes worst right recently the american heart association added depression is the fourth a major risfactor for cornery ardery disease right it alongside the risfactors that we know high pretension hig blood pressure hyperlipidemia high colesteral and da in diabedes in high blood sugar those three have been on the list for a long time and depression ina yoow being added the list is the fourth one and a you really interesting rights an addition to taking medications to address as other three ristfactors we really have to be thinking about a how do you treat folks with depression to reduce their risk of having a heart attack in the future and you knothers some of that is being worked on now but we do not have a complete solution to thinking about that at this time and then the other thing thit is interesting is once you have our hart attack in t in the individuals in having a hart attac the risk of having depression after the hart attack is higher than the normal population rigt and a lot of what we are doing in the lab actually is a is measuring o brain heart connections and we can actualy with transcranial magnetic stimulation of form of brain stimulation we can actually discelerate the heart ratein capture that hertrate disceleration am over the mood regulatory regions and actually a direct probe of that connection soce it is it is interesting and as you said a second ago it is a it is a very disabling condition moderate depressions about is disabling is is having a heart attack acutely having a heart attack severe depressions is disabling is having cancer without treatment and in dying from from a cancer without treatment and it is a it is conunder appreciated just how disabling depression is in that way and i think a important as stigma is consistently con o being reduced over the years for minal illness a formental illnessies than the idea that we can start really putting more funding and puting more focus the federal level private foundation over whatever it is at a giving university to to thinking about a developing treatments we been very interested in a very particular a clenical set of problems around tha the most severe and the most hiocuity am settings that t a focs of depression in dup being in and that is in you kow emergency settings where they go in to impatient units and a you knw in the rest of medicine if it is tigamout hart attax if i start having chest pain right now and mand you bring me to a primary caredoctor's office r can i have a certain number of tests and treatments right but very limited cause it is an out patien a facility if you bring me to the emergency room after that thereare more tests and more treatments if you put me in the ice to you are in the catholab where they do am in vaseive procedures the heart there more tests and more treatments in sychietry as we elevate the acuity of an individual you go from being just depressed to being depressed now thinking about into your life the number of treatments actually go down on average in some sonarias thet go out but on average they go down and there are no tests right and we have been very focussed on that particular problem somebody that maybe was doing you fairly oce with a pretty moderate depression in an the depression gets worse and then they end up an emergency setting and there the field really has not developed a way of a you khave consistently being able to treat that problem in focsind up being the same standard oral anti depressence that they have been getting out patient and in i came to this because i you hav duel trained as ae neurologists and sychiatrists went back and forth between urology and sychiatry saw that ineurology we have all these ways of treating acute brain base problems and really wanted to emulate that in psychietry in fined ways to develop an engineer you ou k a brain base solutions there is a lot o unpack there one thing that you said on is i'd to focast on a bit more because i think we hear that the brain and the heart are connected but you described abelieve a a direct relationship between areas and the brain associated with emotion and heartright yes and that makes perfect logical sense to me but i think a at the same time youmany people out there what we think of the relationship between the the heart in the mind as cand of woo or kind of u a soft biology but hear your talking about an actual physical connection between a what arry of the brain is it the the the the first place where the stimulation goes as called the dor sylateral prefernal qartex its kind of the sense of control kind of governor of the brain and then i in then what we know is it when you use a magnet youse con of what we call far das law this idea of a using a magnetic pulse to induce aan electrical current in electrically conducting substances in this case brain tissue but not skull or got a scalper any of that or here you avoid all that just the brain tissue then you have a direct depolarization of qartical nurans the surface of the brains nurans in this dorcylateral prefrontal and if you do that in the actual scander which we can do you can see that that distributes down into the enter singulate and the insula and the emigdula and ultimately the tract goes into something call the nucleous track to solitarious and ultimately into the vaguest nerve and to the heart that the heart a very consistently seems to be the indorgan of the adorcylateral prefrontal quartex if you measure heart rate in standard ways that partiologist metis your hartrate and you stimulate over this left or cylateral you get a diceleration of the hartratents very time lock to the stimulation it is a two second train of stimulation at one second you see the diceleration it goes down about ten beats perminute and then yofll drift back up is af break for eight seconds on the stimulation drifs back up from the stimulation goes back ain and then the hart rate goes back down d you see the hart rate jus do this ten beats permit at everys train and we know if you do that over visual quartex you do not get that motor quartation get any of those findings its really specific to this kind of control region of the brain and yet seems to it is our work other other folks wort martinarnsan in a in in europe ba the netherlands work showing thi same connections thathing's been rereplicated for five times you mentioned left dorsylateral prefrontal quartex any time i hear about lateralization of function i get particularly curious om because obysy we have two a mere symmetric sides of the brain o ther rare exceptions to this the pinel and thing's of that sort ot at are only there is only one a pineal am what is special about the left dorslateral prefrontal quartex does this have anything to o with handedness right hand our left hand bes we no right hand and left hand idness has a lot to do with lateraization of function for language am a topic for another time but am why do you think the left dor cylateral prefrontal quartex would be connected to the heart a in this way ye yet i think left or cylateral a is is thought to be tha the side that when you excite it when you can av am do excitatory stimulation potentiating sort of stimulation that you can reduce depressive symptoms and i got by the mike fox at harvard is demonstrated if you have m strokes in the brain that a that cause deprestion you put them on the human connecttom hundred your a thousand patient map and you ask the question whather all functionally connected to left dorcylateral if you take leisions it caused mania in individuals you put those all the human connectiv map and asked what they are all the one commonarea thei're all connected to its the right dors the lateral and there seems to be a hemispheric a you balancing of mood a between these two brain regions and we know this from an experimental standpoint too becaus you can take individuals with depression and you can excite the left or you can inhibit the right and the they are both antitoprescent you can a excite the right and that antimanic and some studies and this idea hat there is this hemisteric balanceing of mood is is quite interesting thait is incredibly interesting and just aum people know if if you curries what the connectome is tat connectome as the term that was built out of this notion of genomes o being a large as collections of sequencing and mapping of genes theire proteomes of protenes of a connectomes as a call connectomics of connections between your owns of the human connecton project is on going am and i find that incredible that within the connectone project that can identify these regularities of right verses left or seladal prefrontal quartex especially since a ive looked at a fair number of brains u from humans not sernlinize many as you have a and if you lookd at the architecture of the layers the celtives and even the narrow chemicals of which cells are expressing sa dopomine or seratone and are receiving in put from areas that make dopaminor seirtonan olthat different on the right and left side and yet here we are talking about a a cont of an accelerator and a brak if you ow thi r on on depression and mania using what at least by my eye and ithink other people's i look to be basly the same set of bits the same parts lest nor less what gives that these properties to the right and left or seldal prefrontal quartexes at the inputs they receive is tit something that we learn during development or do you think that we come into the world with these am hemispheric by asis yence it is a great question ind it has not been worked out which your original question was around and i left handed individual which as twenty five per cent of those folks and up having a right brain dominance or one per cent of right handed people hav a right brain dominance if it is flit right and that you kow unfortunately that study still has not been done at the level caus that would be probably pretty helpful for teasing some of this out but it is it is a it is still you not still being sorted outright we we know enough to know this phenomenon exists because we can use teamass is a probe and do this sort of these sorts of manipulations but a to my knowledge there has not been anybody that is gottin interested in it that they have been able to get a mechanism of why that is buts a but it it is can av impuri ly true in the sense that you can push and pull on those systems or in this in the case of of strokes that fokes have in the kind of get their brains and and their brain images and look at were the strokes landed those con of cousal bits of information point to this this a a symetry interesting well in that case going with what we do know that stimulation of dor salato prefruntal quartex slows the heart rait down transiently but it slows it down and seems to alleviate at lea some symptoms of depression leads me to the quession of why would that be the case is it does it tell us anything fundamental about depression that a anxiety is inherent to depression i think of faster heart rate is partin parcel with a wit hat with a anxiety am in my laboratory we have studyed fear a bit in animals and in humans and we i'm often observe bracky cartia where somebody or in animal as afraid of something and rather than the heart rate speeding up it acually slows down something that most people do not i think about or recognize at but am give in that stimulation of dorsalatr prefontal quartex slows the heart rat down and can alleviate depressive symptoms and that there are other ways to slow the heart down i have two quessions what o you thinks this tells us about the basic architecture of depression wand its physiology at the little of the heart and does the circuit run in the opposite direction too if one were to have were find other ways to slow the heart rait down say with a batablocker am does that help alleviate depression et dontsagret quessions the a i it is the second quession first a we know that a n for i'm going trials of this a if you stimulate in the vaguest nerve a in an implaned vages nerve stimulator you can actually a you have this the a farent am parts of tha the vagest am you project ultimately up to the de el pi see through the singula through these anterinsoluce or that same that obviously the same tract right and you can a stimulate there and alleviate depression which seems very unusual right your stimulating a cramial nerve down on the neck but if you can get up into the brain you actually can improve depressive symptoms and your more evidence that this is ave a cound of a whole track and system and a if you stimulate in part of that system it appears that you can i improved mood nwould if i were somebody who did not have a stimulating electrode in my vaguest nerve and i a was dealing with minor depression and i decided i wanted to take some other approach to slow my heart rate vy the vagest for instance am exail emphasized breathing or deliberately slow cadence breathing im things of that sort is there any evidence that behavial interventions of the kinds am can alleviate depression or some symptoms of depression and is there any evidence that does indeed feed back to the door s ta dont prefontal quartex to achieve some of that olleviation absolutey yes there is hies number of studies a implicating to yel pet the dorcylateral and and say meditation a mindfulness that sort of thing and in ther small studies but but pretty well design studies suggesting that behavioural interventions in mild depression extually work quite well there seems to be a volitional threshold for depression where at some point you you start losing you you go from being completely in total volition to having o simi volition you have thoughts that you really have a hard time controlling ind that sort of thing and you go through that threshold at some point it gets harder and harder for those sorts of things to contikick in and work in the extreme form of that is catetonia rigt were peoplel in a very severe form of depression get constock motorcally it may obviously cannot they have no control and a or very limited control and i think there is a threshold in which these sorts of interventions will work exercise seems to really be a good treatment for for mild depression ind it may work thoug the mechanism you are describing right as is we all kno athletes hold a lower resting heartrate a then folks that that are not if your you were nathlete you had a lower resting heartrite you stopped exercising and a couple years later your resting heartrat in many cases goes up bigt and maybe that is a maybe that is part of the process i'm not aware of any studies specifically a looking at dorsylateral prefrontal a physiology preposed exercise but it would be a great study i think that would be really helpful to understanding that especially if you had a correlation of changes a can a lowering if say heartrite with mode improvements a ther there is been a lot of work with heartrate very ability and a in depression and studies or can a point towards it it is not not every studi is is is you kna a positive for this but a but quite a few studies say basically that lower heartwrate veryability is a associated with obeun a moderate ta severe depression aman that may be part of that mechanism of that heart brain a risk i'm both in tregue enelabit perplexed by this relationship between heartrat and depression on the face of it iwould think of depression as depressed a lower heartrate might make somebody more depressed even mention catetoni ore somebody that just does not seem motivated or excited to do anything when i think of mania's elevated heartrate and e being excited on the other hand i realize that anxiety which brings about ideas elevated heartrate is also built into depression which brings me back to what you said earlier which is that when we say depression are we really talking about four or five differ thet's roun disorders at to this for lack of a better word and for what percentage of people that have depression does some approach to reducing heart rate work whether not its stimulation of the dorsalat left dorsalato prefrontal quartacts a by way of transtranniung manic stimulation or by taking a beat of locker or by stimulating the vaguest at can we throw out a number a rough number does that holp thirty percent an per cent how perihow long lasting is that that relief end to be clear the a the disceleration the hurtrate is in the moment when the stimulation is happening but it is not something that is necessarily maintained chronically it is more of an indicator that you are in the righte nat work more than it is than it appears to be itself central the mechanism that hurri veryability piece may be in there is some studieis that link the to but the actual dicelerations seems to be much more of a marker that you are in the right system but very well could be that the heart rate system in the mood system to sit next to each other in the stimulation it is both if you look it how much to the variance and the mood is explained by the heart rate diceleration it is not it is not a huge it is not a huge amout right it only explains a a small percentage and it is it is unlikely that simply dicult simply reducing the heartrate and in fact for many years proprannel al in these sorts of drugsacts the were implicating causing depression and that that is been kind of debonked but it is it is unlikely it is simply dicelering the hart rates can improve depression but what it does tell you is that if you are in that area that is the mood regulatory area there is some parof sympathetic cortical kind of process that is going on that gets in and in causes is to happen in it is it is independent of mood you take a normal healthy a individual and you can do this and they are ging to dicelerate their hartrate i'm glad you mention the paris sympathetic nervous system which aqorses the must people thnk of its the rest and digest of the con of calming side of the autonomic nervous system as ofm hearing you say all this and in particular what you just told me which is that it is not as if having a lower heart rate protects you against depression or a higher heart rate i's associate with depression although at the extremes that might be true but rather it is something about the regulatory natwork the ability to control your own nervous system to some extent and when i think about the autonomic nervous system i to thing about as a see saw yet of you n alertness and calmness and when your sleep it is for aloticalmness when you panicing it is a lot of alertness to the but that and i do not think this has ever been defined and when it at teach met the medical studens tat stanfor nor anatomy i my wishis that some day i'll be able to explain what the hingeing that process would be rater not the ends of the seasill we know what the sympathetic nervous system as in what it is to wake us up and make us panic or make us feel nicely alert and calm we know what puts up some one into sleep or a coma or makes them feel relaxed but what shifs from one side of the seas out to the other and the tightness of that hinge seems to me what you are describing that that depression is sort of a lack of control over inner state that when i'm stress i cannot get myself out of it an when i'm feeling completely collapsed with exhaustion i cannot get out of bed and as are enotivated to do the very things that would help me get out of depression a a work out or social connection er thing eeet a equality meal these kinds of things this is perhaps the first time that i've ever am heard about a potential circuit for the hinge as i'm referring to it dis as it make yes tatis all absonl yet tis on make sure that i'm gerraing min this cirectly an beyond yes soen in some studies if you do the same i dentical stimulation on the right or slader yo get an exceleration you are just kind of further confirming this idea of lateralization i that that even it appears that even the prefernal cortic in a cortical i areas seem to be lateralized in this in this way and i it is am it is less a the right finding is is more variable depending upon the study the lefts very consistent a s weve talkh about turns crinio man that its stimulation for getting into these networks and and i also just want to take a brief tangent say i as have heard you say this before i think it is wid ol what you are saying that it is really not about stimulation of areas it is or any specific brain area or vaguest nerve being important per say it is really about a network a connection a series of connections ithink that is really important for people to understanding is a and of a new emerging theme really the other thing that to me seems extremely important frus to consider is what ex what are these latteral prefuntal corteses doing are they involved for instance insensation sensing the heart rate are they involved in thinking and planning and this gets down to a very simple question that i know a lot of people have which is can we talk ourselves out of deprestion if it is mild can we a talk ourselves into a manic state or an excited state a positively excidestate that does not qualifies mania y other airs the brain i i think of the is responsible for perception or for for motor control but here we are in this mysterious frontal cortexarea which people say executive function plan in et cetera are we talking about thoughts are we talking about structure thoughts or we talking about dream thoughts what in the world is going on in the prefonci ors ye ond here i'v spen my career you knowing nor sins and i still i i still cannot really understand what it is doing and made be its doing fifty things te outs agret its a great question you ti one of the other studies that that we w working on addition to the depression work is actually trying to change trait hypnotizabilities soiv itspeele and i have been working on this an da he is found and a publishus ten years ago that a different part of the left or cylateral amis functionally connected with the inter the dorsland tere singulat a with a lot of functional connectivity and high hypnotizables and not much in low hypnotizables and that is a different con of a different sub region within this bigger brain region we call left or cylateral prefennal quartex then the part that seems to be important for regulating mood and the left or cylateral seems to have connections that are location specific within the over all connamed brain region that connect to various parts of the singulat and seem to regulate it it in if you knock out the left or cylateral prefennal quartex and you have people do the strup task for instance which is a a task where you have it is a simple task or we know this you have people name the color of words and if i if i look at a wat you if i look at one of the cards that they will show you it will have the word red in red and that is very easy nd that is a called a congruent and then the incongruent is red in the color blue and you have to name you have to say the the word you do not am name the color yet o suppress a respond ye exactly and a s are you do you name the color and you and you see the word written am in a different way and basically a if you if you stimulate in a way that inhibits the left or clateral prefrnnal quarters are either one you can actually knock out the ability to do that well and it will take longer for people in the incongruent cards to wa to be able to name it and they have a they have a t cone of a time delay that is greater than they had before they got stimulated that is a art of the the prefenal quartex that is different in the part of the prefenal quartex that is involved an mood regulation the nice thing about tamass as that you can go through an you can fined these areas there functionally defined through brain imaging and you can perturbe them and answer the question you are talking about how do i understand this part of the prefernal quartex and its function this part and we were able to stimulate an in inhibitory way within the left dor scylateral prefernl quartex that is involved with you ave this sort of cognive control am area and we were able to knock that area out and da an increased trait hypnotizeability people had a greater am hypnotize ability after they got active stimulation verses when they got sham and it suggests that that brain circuit is involved in the a in the process of what hypnou a therapeuto hypnosis ins za being but it is a very different region within the left or cylateral than say we do when we do these very intensive our stimulation approaches the treat severe depression and we are able to get people out of depression nam you with the part of this o the dor cylteral it seems to be lower in the younoaccono more lateral am in dam and am infurir on the a dl pfc in connected with the subgenual anter singulate the party enter singulat the processes emotion i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens ithletic greens now called g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional neens i've been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast he reason i starty taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the immun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiatics enathletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptedins vitements and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastegript if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green s dok calm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vitemen d thre k too again that is thathletic greensdok calm slash hubermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitem ind three k to bey somewhat you told us about the strup task and the rule of the prefonte corotecson strup task to me the true task is a rule switching gan saying in one moment that the rule is you read whatever the word says and then then you switcion in you say the rule now is you tell me what color the word is written in and you suppress whatever is the word says cetitra ok a rule in some sense is a a that is a a transient le adopted belief system i could imagine that in depression which has all sorts of back story to int am that of course the psychoatristi psychologist or friend can pull on that thread for instance somebody might believe that they are bad am or that they do not deserve love im try to bring this into the typical language that tom or that they will never succeed or that even if they keep succeeding it is just goin to get harder and harder and it will never feel good these are sort of rules the strup tas tra some levellets at theye are rules that are more pervasive over time unfortunately but i could imagine that if the p c is also contains some sort of maps or alger thans related to rules of emotionality or self representation or things that we have heard at hink there must be date out there the saying that en whatever we heard in middle school when someone made fun of us we can remember that cause i can remember things that people said aom about a jacket i wore one day or something in the fourth grate a crazy i did not even the jacket om now i think you was kind to cool but anyway the point being that we have an intense memory for these things a set up a sort of rule or a question maybe i do not really know how to dress rnstence maybe that is why always wear the same lacture but in all seriousness it seems that the dorsalou prefrontal quartex is in this amazing position to access rules which our beliefs and beliefed our rules and then for moments or longer to switch those rules and for somebody who is depressed to just simply look themselves in the merror and say you are great you are fantastic that is it feels a lie if you feel garbage to say that it does not fit with the rule that is saying that card is not red that card is green when your eyes tell you that it is that it is red and tand it seems there is something about prefontal quartec that that in principle gives flexibility to rules based on what we know on is trup task given its conactivity can we assume that the talk therapy that occurs in a the psychatrous office or with a friend or through journalling out something om because we do know that reporting things about tromer difficult circumstances wore the rules that we contain and attend to hide inside of us about how we feel miserable about ourselves or anything really that in rescripting that that somehow it allows us to do a sort of strupe task on our beliefs is that is that a a e tremendousleep i'm just trying to proframe this in the contexts of what but what i and most will tink of its depression yeot ofam because the network components are vitally important but i guess what ive trifin gout is what er the what are the the algarythms that govern e prefruntal quartac eabsolutely an a in a kind of standard cognatif behavioural therapy session i what what ta the therapist is trying to do as identify those beliefs and ta and you con adetermine how how fix ther are you knave theireflexible as you are saying and thend a then help folks to find another explanation for them and to a into kint of re enigrate that potential other explanation in to ther their memory system ad a what were i think teamast' really interesting actually had a lot of patients who have told me mi my therapists told me that i was not trying hard enough in therapy and and a i i really am trying hard but these are in a moderate pretty severe depress patience and as soon as we get them well with with the teamass approaches ou con of rapid in aw five day approach in the next sweet wud comein and see them andthe will say i i did all we can as i looked at my therape books and now i can understand it in i actually see tamas is a way of having exogenousts sorts of cognitive functions that in milder forms of depression we can pull off with psychotherape you knowe this idea of being able to conturn that prefernal quartex on and have it govern these deeper regions in depression the deeper regions govern the prefernal quartex the the precede the prefernal quartex timinguise we have get some dat and in review now or were seeing that in depressed individuals tha re responsive to our rapid tames approach we call stamford excelerated intelligent or modulation therape or er escenter say if you look at the brain before people get this they will they will have a temporal delay where the singulate is in front of the deal p c and in people that are normal healthy controls no depression the dor cylateral prefenal quartex is temporally in front of the anter singulate with effective treatment we can flit the timing of things the dorcylateral is in front of the anter singulate just an enormal person do you not talkin about fit obviously physically moving these structures bri by in time tine or actidation in one case is the coach telling the player what to do anit aveis at lit a play or telling the coach what to do and you you restore order to the game you restore order to the game and in and in what it looks is to depression to your point is a buntive conspontaneous content that simivolitional its being congenerated out of this conflict o detection system the singula that seems to to a to sinse conflict and con of feed that information gets overactive and depression and do and then in depression it looks the left or cylateral does not sufficiently clamp down on it in what therape appears to do is to cond of restore that what we see with tams over that region is we just exogeneously do the same sort of thing we restore the governents of the left orcylateral over the singulate area and that is correlated with treatment improvement the degree in which you can re time reregulate in time the left or cylateral over the singulate the more of an antopress an effect you have can we therefore say in in trude terms that the dorcylateral prefrontal quartex really is the governor of how we interpret physiological signals and spontaneous thoughts it is it it places a lends that the rest of the brain sees things through and in you can you can do these experiments for you you can put a normal healthy control person in the in the sca nner and you can make them feel to have a loss of control and then you can see that region come off line writsing experimentally manipulate the system and can of buffing it up whe it is almost teamass is almost exercise for the brain reat your youre can of exercising this region over and over again with a physiologically relevant signal and con turning that system on and what is interesting i wei think really interesting for for this show is to youn we had a couple of folks a o priv five or six folks that have actually told me this where if they weremit early enough in the week we have this very dense stimulation approach for we can stimulate people really rapidly over a five day belock we do not discriminate when they get better to when they stop if they they get better on day won we still give them the other four days because it is in the protocall to do that we cannot we are were getting to appoin we can tell how long it it is gon to take ere not there yet and every time somebody gets better at day wanerd too at the beginning when we first arto do ing this we would say we are not sure you we think this a safe to keep going but what you want to do and everybody was now i wen to keep going and ther by widnesday ther totally zero down on the depression scales even better than most people walking around really no anxiety no no depression anything by thursday the first i that the told me thats it came in and he said i was driving back to my hotel and i decided to go to the beach and i just sat there and i was totally present in the present moment for an hour and he is i read about this in my mindfulness books but i experienced it last night i'm never experienced anything this before and i was that is interesting mc cu a was not surer then and then i did not tell any yoeu i obgustsany more patience about that than about five ever the last couple of years when they get they remit early in the week by the end of the week they are going to the beach and there totally having what people describes a pretty mindful present moment sort of experience itis really interesting what that is and man i do not have pfull on scientific data to tell you but it it is just it is a it is an interesting anecdote i that that folks when you push them through this point of of feeling con of clinically well that some people in to reporting the seditional said of features in you mention the ingula and the intersingulat in particular because now i feel for the first time in my career i have some sense of what prefentle cortacts somonnection to be doing ah besides providing a bumper for the fr the rest of the the brain is the singulate it seems is it is a more primitive structure in the sense that it is it is under the idealle it is under the regulation of this top down control from peoplente quartex n it what is mapped in the singula in ends for the nonner sciencis out there when i say mappeet i we were tat put's one in a scanner and focasin on singulate or put an electrot in there but what makes the nurons in their fire what what sorts of things in the bt dyan in the mine and out in the world a light up for lack of a better phrase the singulate what does the singulat ye yes that srup task those incongruent word color associations the the dorsal part of that a iffor obsessive compulsive disorterof patients certain certain con of triggers you will you will see some some of their imaging studiesll point to tenter singulate a in the con of very crude psycho sergery world fifty years ago the enter singulatomy was a way of treating a bsessive compulsive disorterat as that area seems to be overactive in people who are experiencing obsessive compulsive disorter you can cin of walk the singulat raps uround this white matter track bundles at raps round that anso thereis a part that is above that around that below that and depending upon how a mosti how much of the a the conflict task has an emotional component the more a ventral and subgenual that a that activation is the dorsal part of the anter singulate seems to be kind of more of a pure cognitive may be a obsessive compulsive dissorter sort of area whereas you stark getting into moode sorts of triggers facial expression a conflicts ore your sposed a that the nother's an emotional strup task for you show the word happy and then you have a face of of a person that looks mad than that is another way of having the same sort of stroup conflict that seems to be more perigenual subgenual areas rites you can cind of you can trigger the singulate based off the level of emotional veilance from none down to a lot and a in that seems to be how the how it is distributed there are heartrate cont components to it autonomic components in their too there is something called aconnectic mutism ou rudon ba a a bord certified nero socagris baver behavioral neurologist and have seen lot of these what we calls eber cases ind neurology where people have these unusual neurological presentations and one of em is a e a connectic mutism give a gleoma sitting in the inner himispheric fissure and at conhaving a pressure on the singulate people can get into an almost catatonic looking state where they con of get stock and they do not speak and and that tells you something about how the how the singulat works as well rigtts it is if it is a if it is not functioning than people have a hard time conconnecting with reality it seems to need to be constantly on on line to be able to interact to the exterior world is not involved in some of the dissociative states that sometimes people who are very strastor or depressed experience you said catatonia ben han extreme one but a m i know someone for instance at when they get really strast and it can even be of some one yells at them or someone is angry eveness ones angry with them ere they perceive some one's angry them there is a development al back story to why they they likely feel this way they or just i cannot this is a high high functioning individual normally and they they just sort of cannot function they cannot complete simple things emale or or groceries or things for for a short while it isay it is almost a catatonia and they refer to is a dissociative state do you see that in depression and i mean whereit were speculating here as to whetheror not that valvs a singular but whet ther saying it has holds a lot of salients for me in thinking about this example yet yet there is a you see you see catetonia is an extreme outcome of depression and of am in sometimes get sofrning another illnessies dissociation is an extreme outcome or even some cases ae less extreme outcome petiosty and intrama and a and it is also a phenomenon that happens naturally in some people that are highly hypnotizable and soif you ask david spel say that ta if some of the work that he is been working on us around post her singulat and in the a capacity to dissociate but yet with or stimulation approach to to the elpiicy dorslant er singulat one of the sub scales that moved the most as the dissociative sub scale for for hypnotize abilities even normal individual you see that that change ind in a in that kind of experience of dissociation i am highly hypnotizable e davids hypnotize me a number of times that i cllip of that on or hupern aachantl i i've always am will always it wa starting it my early teens i sart exploring hypnos i am extremely hypnotizable and i self hypnosis or assisted hypnosis am i do not now that ever gointo ssocie of states a i'll try and avoid am forcing you into running a clinical session right now but not to assassin anything that but this brings about something rely a interesting i think which is i 'm aware that some of the more popular emerging treatments for depression include things cademine which is a dissocyof an esthetic is not right and yet and my assumption is that as a dissoc of anesthetic that it leads to dissoci of states nob people can sort third person themselves and be sup feel somewhat distance from their emotions es i've also been hearing that there are emerging treatments sylicive in being one of them but some other treatments a m d ma et cetera that w pars each of these ind in detail that lead to the exact opposite state during the effect of the drug which is a highly engaged a emotionality and heart rade and sense of self and can also lead to relief of depra ction now whether or not this again reflects that depression as many conditions as uppose to just one or whether or not somehow tickling a er in some cases pushing really hard on the opposite ends of the the scale really matter i am absolutely fascinated and again also perplexed by this why would it be that it a drug that induces dessociive states and a drug takn separately that induces hyper ussociative states would lead to relief of the same condition e nosegret question yes ofer a for cedemine thet the level of dissociation appears to be correlated with the the therapeutic effect it appears to be a necessary but not sufficient to produce an antitopress an effect in a folks that that do not have any any psychological change a from the cedeminer or do not experience need dassociation tema typically tend to have less a less potent antitopress an effects from cedemine we did study a couple of years ago is really interesting s we we gave folks a nol trecxsone which is an opiate a antagonist a meu an capopiate receptor antagonists and we we we gave folk the same individuals a pill of that or pilloplosebo n they had no idea which hen they were getting was this lodos nal trecxo fifty melegrams with prety hig dose oyen sweet we gave a typical cedemy an therapeutic dose than we gave fifty melegrams of nol trecsone a orplosibo and then in the same individuals we we gave two in two infusions one with each of those conditions and and if they had n't antidoppress an effect we waited until they relapsed ten we gave him the other condition and then we look to see what a what effect of blocking the opioid receptor a what effect would you see on the antiopress an effect of blockin the opiar receptor with the idea that if ceemin works the way that a lot of researchers at the time thought that it in a completely worked and which is the gludimate system then you would have a no effect of nowtrecsen nol trecson just interacts the opiate system it does not do anything with any other systems cedemiane has a lot of effects over it has o clearopiate effects a in mice and various ways of looking at that a and enemdy a receptor antagonism and gludimate of fat effects and fits just that the gludimate part is a is the part driving the antitopress an effect you should not have any difference in the antitopress an effect between the two conditions if however the antitopress an effect is primarily is the the opioid properties of cedemiane are necessary for the antitopress an effect than you should have a loss of antitopress an effecturing the cedemi an pluss nal trecone condition that you observed in the cedemine plus plosebo condition an what we what we saw was that there was a dramatic blockade of te antitopress an effect when now trexon was present in e in the people that had a had an antitopress and a affect with cedemin plus a placibo alone and daand then some friends of mind that tot teeamos study with pain and they stimulated over the left or slateral prefruntal quartects and they gave nolocs ivenoloxen which work spasically the same way as now trecon and they were able to block the anti paineffects of tamass with a opiat blocker this idea that another con aconvergent pointright this idea that the opioid receptor may have a roll and mood regulation wat's also interesting as if you look at people eare geting a total neoperation very painful operation and a total need replacement and you you age sects everything match the individuals that are going to through that but you have a group of people it do not have depression in a group people it do have depression the presence of depression tripples the the orl a opioi dose by day fore that is required that is required to to cover the pain but what may be happening is it is not just treating physical pain may be treating emotional pain as well right at least transiently seems to have a pro and antito press in effect chronically it seems t have a very protopress an effect can make people treatment resistant but it is it is a interesting phenomenon but yet the opioid system seems to be pretty pretty involve but what is interesting there with tethe cedemine trial is tit we did not see any effect on the dissociation and the dissociation was the same each time the psychological effect of what we call the trip or the the kind of dissociate of effect for people ore having a psychological phenomenon from cedemine that was identical both times and it it kind of vait also challenge this idea that the psychological experience of the psychodelic effect may be all that is necessary to produce an effect in the pharmachology does not matter as long as you can achieve that state and we think we pretty clearly debunkd that idea that the underlying pharmochology and the state ayou know seem to be important we do not know for sure if you can in a lot of people are working on this if you can take out you kow essentially the psychological effect and still have a drug that works to to treat the the under the illness that you are trying to target and it a lot of there was a moutstudy out this week orever they had an eluss the analogue and they were able to see some some a animal level data a suggest that could be true but but until we fear that out humans its its kin of to be determined but it is it is curious right being able to kind of yuse experimental manipulations to tred a separate some of these phenomenon apart nearly understand what is what is doing what it is critical and its critical to the other conversation that we will surely get to which is the progression of psychodelics from elicity legal drugs to clinically validated and and presumably at some point either decriminalized were legal drugs which has not yet happened at least not in the us but jus to make sure that people are agetting this and how crucial this is what were really talking about here is the fact that somebody takes a multigramdos of siliceiban or somebody takes m diama or they take kedemine and they experience relief from their chalma their depression their ediction or any number of the other things that indeed those compounds to be shown to be useful for in certain contects clinically supported et cetera there is this gravitational pull to the idea that oh it was the hallucinations it was the dissociative state it was the feeling of connectedness and what were really saying is that while that certainly could be true it may be the case that a major source of the positive shift that occurs after the effect of the drug is some underlying biology shifts in the mule beoid receptor ala your experiments with neltrecsone or a change in the underlying romodulation that had anywhere from nothing to something to do with the real shift and i know there is a group up it you see davis that published a paper in nature about a year ago also looking at these are is a chemistry lab assentially modifying psychodelics to remove the the hallucinogenic properties remood altering properties and actually sing some pretty impressive effects in shifts in mood after the drug wars off and i know this this gets people upset when they hear it a lot of peop this gets a lot of people upseterbecause people think oht know it is the it is the intense experience that matters but in fact a that may not be the case at all it in fact it is powerful for people that sometimes i in it in my mind to yon'ce somebody is the birth of a new child and it is such an incredible experience and then people feel much connection and that they sort of connect the the experience of thof the actual birth of the connection when infect ther that is true it turns out but there are bunch of other things happening to that are simp that is simply the reflection of the fact tha you are holding a child and the permonal effects et cetera anyway i i think it is vary important that these different variables be a figured out thatalong those lines i i want to make sure that before we dive a bit deeper into cedemine and siliceiban m that we do touch on really important topic that has been in the press a lot lately which is escess orise select ive sir down a reup taken himiters cause we cannot really have a discussion about depression thout talking about escessorise men i want a circle back to a cedemine and siliceiban it seems that there are now data wthat essentially sate state that there is no direct link between serat ne in levels and depression although i my understanding is that the essessorize are powerfully effective for certain forms of obsession obsessive compulsise disorder and may also be effective for treatment of depression but it may again be through some effact unrelated to seratone in itself is that right and how shall we think about assessorise are the useful a the not useful am what is what is going on with assessorize inyour patients a and another other people's yet that they a bes tha the experiment that i described a bette go round the now trectonand and cetame in is the first time i'm aware of where we were able to essentially eliminate and an anterpressence effect by using a second drug is an kind of a blockade an in it hilights a bigger issue right the issue that we have not had a good way of really understanding how these drugs work and it is the difference i think a lot of the the controversy there is that a it is been difficult i think for folks a to see that something can in one hand work and in the other hand we do not know how it works right a in a escessorized clearly work a many many m amedanalysies kind of proving that outright that that in a sub population of individuals they achieve great benefit from depression a u nifor depression a for obsessive compulsive disorder for generalized anxiety sort of panic in all these things you can see a an improvement in those symptoms a with what we call ascessorize or selective seratonian reuptaken hibiters the issue there is that these selective craton and reuptaken hibiters in dupt a blocking that the reup take of seratonan leaving the the seratoneand in this a in this conin between a between twu nerons a for a while and allowing for more seratonian to kind be there the issue a is that they do not they do not work immediately right they do not work the same day you start taking them an that that' suggests that probably it is not exactly the seratonan being in there that is directly driving it that it is much more likely that it may have some say plass this brain plasticity effects right we know that things brain drived nortrophic factor get up regulated with chronic am oralanteto pressent use in in that is that is kind of the ideas that a is that these things work but what is powerful on i think what the authors of this paper was extremely controversial patien paper were were a in part trying to say was that there is not a there is not a deficit of seratone and you are not born with ah what people call a chemical and balance ince teciatry is known thas this is not actually new information anybody you kn ow it it is it is kind of a rehashing of a much of information we have known for a while now but in the lay press its kind of hit in a way that it did not seem to grab attention a before w previous publications but this idea that this chemical and balance ideas wrong ai really i really think that parts important because i think that ayou know for a whill i think psychiatry what i'll call psychiatry one point o it this kind of idea of froid inpsychotheropeanits in its origins a it was a lot around the your family in those experiences and psychotheropy kind of going in correcting or helping you to figure out or in shown't you being able to see or people here u that you can eventually come to the conclusion of certain cognicions that are not helping you right and there is a huge there is uge importance there but there is a history where things this gets o frenegenic mother and all that that was a concept at some point right and we have transition from that to to the you no for a long time the chemical and balance we shall call psychiatry two point out this idea that there is something chemically missing ind naa and i i think that the trouble there for a patient whose not a physicion whose not some one whose awhose who steeped in these sorts of ideas whose more of cand of a ii can of a person a can have average american out there right is that it is telling it is sending a message of there is something missing with me whether it be my experiences i had no control of over when i was a child or a a chemical in my brain what i thinks really powerful with with teamas a really powerful tamessan a level even powerful the psychodelic story is it saying something different teamasss works and there is no ceratonean coming in or out o the prain right and were it we are doing a rapid form of teamas that works in one to five days there is no there is it is very unlikely that there is some long term kind of upregulation of ceratone an tits driving that or work actually kind of pushes back on the ceratone and ie hypothesis is being kind of the center of depression because it says look we are not giving anybody any seratonan we are simply turning these brain regions on in we are focused on the circuitry and that psychiatry three point ofit is not just ner modulation or modulations are really nice use case for psychiatry three point out as it a way to focally and directly perturb brain regions and in whatever modality are using but ther're a lot of lot of groups that are actually doing youre imaging before and after and they are able to see circuit level changes for something syliciban or chedemene long after the drug is gone right suggesting in those same brain regions converge the psubgenual default modnet or connection that we see as changing with our or or standi'm stamphord or modulation therope technique at that same setabrain regions that tha cedemene and a sylicibon seem to act on act on these connections between brainnatworks that seem to shift and it refocuss the story on something that is highly correctable and it is it is basically electrophysiology and it is basically can ov re calebrating a circuit that it is recalebratable instead of i have something missing or have some phenomiy some set of experiences early in life that are a that are going forever or trap me in these these psychiatric diagnoseson it con a challenges that idea and i think that is what powerful about psychiatry three poin o i'm the psidea of focussing on the circuit because it gets us gets a sen to thinking about psychiatry in psychiatricaleeses is something that are recoverable people can get better people we have seen with our teamas techniques we seen it with h the some f the psychodelic work that we have done were people are actually in normal levels of mood for sustained periods of time or within five days within five or last days and in the case of of the psychodelics within a few days right we can get people aut of these states they are totally well there is no drug in teir system in that point in the case the psychodelics who as never a drug in their system in the case of of tamas and it and it just tells us that that it is it is it is fixible it that it is just the heart it is just you now't just sych an y writh me in the heart it is just tese these other illnessies that slike ave broken leg we can go in and do something and we can get somebody better then i think what is what is empowering and what a lot of patients have told me as they say you have got into some people will relapse and need more stimulation ore needen were thepsychodelics whatever it is but bill tell me i i've relapse in am depress the and but i never think about killing myself again because i know that if i go get stimulated again it it improves it gets better it it it will i will be able to reachieve it and i cannot ianit i do not fear that i'm cronically broke and i do not fear that the chemical imbalance is still in balance that ont fear that these things that i could not control of my childhood it are going at be there and drive this problem forever and i think thats that is what is powerful about this the sense of control the sense of control the sense of they are not doing the stimulation themselves theor not that ministering the drug in these trialves themselves thay probably never well these will probably e metical treatments but they are choosing to do it and in that since they are in control i've a a good frenda i will not out him for for reasons thiy'll become clear in moment who im was quite obeast and lost a lot of waight and was really proud of himself and then he swee could say he sort of relapsed in a senses not not not all the way but but far along but his tone around it was very different he knew heh'd accomplished what his goal once before he was disappointed in himself but he knew exactly why he had relapsed tot was very clear he had assentially relapsed to the previous said of eating behaviors and lack of exercise behavors and is now brought himself back again and it just resinates a with your story that one somebody understands they can do it because they would been there before this this idea again of of considering new rules that that e and and that brings me to this a question about psychodelics and and the frankly the altered thinking and perception that occurs in it is in hydos sylicide been a clinical a sessions it seems that the disorder thinking even though it could a be random write a hearing hearing colors and and seeing sounds as always the ou noconicleshae statement of the timothelery erea also you right there that is a strup task of sorts iit is a it is a cynistesia to combine on thes perceptions but it is it is sort of strue task ish in that it is a new set of rules for the same stuff e right and u people do many people do report improvements in a troma related symetomology and depression as i understand it fon i read of the clinical trials after taking sylicivon because during those sessions something comes to mind spontaneously as a you an i were tige mot earlier u they will report for instance a a new way of seeing the old problem the fron the old problem could be the voice that they are no good they will never nothing lever work out or to be even more subtle than that that raises two questions one is about the basic functioning of the human brain which is why do you think the brain would ever hold on to rules that u i do not serve us well that is one question and then the sicome question is what is it about sylicivan an related molecules what in terms of their ner chemistry in terms the ways they disrupt thinking and feeling at cetera juring the session that alow this a novel rule consideration phenomeno e the first question i think it sider itsn'n it is neveler evolutionary nerbiology answer iht i think that at the individual person level it does not make a whole lot of sense that when really stressed out some of us when it eat more ight t the individual person loeks that is not particularly that could for my health in the long term but if you think about it in som five hundred years ago a thousand years ago i'm highly strest out it is most likely that i'm about to not have food at some point and i should eat abounch of food it is high fat high sugar high carbed food to put on wait for tht you next fase weare in this stress i may be in battle and i do not have food and i have enough fuel on board right and we we ind up being a we end up being a result of of probably a lot of biology that is not that useful in the modern era and i think in the brain for forsay but say pitiesti writ a lot of a lot of veterans come back and they experience these ptastee symptoms they are not at all useful back home right that athey hear some loud noise and all of a sudden there behind a car orther behind a i heard a folxia jumpin run behind attrashcan or whatever in the mill of san francisco when they hear a loud noise but if you put them back in the battle field nelay dobted that is highly adaptive right and i think what what the what is interesting is that a we in the absence of using substances slike adelics ind up having these very persistent memories that are attached to negatively velance to motion predominantly aas you re sain earlier the jacket in in elmentaris we i various things that for me to writ you you you remember these things a and da and we we hold on to those things from it i think an evolutionary nora biology standpoint but what seems to for whatever reason con alleviate that are these a are these substanceis some new in do ma some therave been around for thousands of years sylisibon and used a in incosacramental and as a sacrament in no in traditions a seem to have theraputic effect that seems to be pretty long lasting for these phenominon and it is is just curious reat its curious that that in the absence of that these things will keep going on and on but in the presence of that exposure then all of a sudden you see a resolution of the problem and we have some work now retreating folks wit navy seals indata still being being analyzed but the anecdotes that were getting riter folks are coming back and theyre saying a finally the that is finally gone right this kind of these satapitiesti symptoms are finally gone and this s idea that for whatever reason going into what is probably a highly plastic state retoing about earlier up regulation of brainder of neretrophic factor in the case of i begain gleeld r im nor trophic factor this highly plastic state in a the ability to re con reexperienced memories and then is yu know we we we always reconsolidate a memory ah when we bring it back up we allwas reconsolt but reconsolidat ing it in that state for whatever reason i may drive i trive at their peutic of fact i and a you knon' that that the the jurys still out there is i'm a i would say that i'm i'm kind of a i'm an ignostic to what tool using kin ofgy i'm my business is to find treatments that help people and i'm much more alike pragmatic about it if if this sort of thing which a has a lot of cultural baggage a but if this sort of thing ultimatelyans of being their peutic of designed trials that convince me in others that it is than we should absoluse it and and if it does not then i then the clearly should not use it right and i think that is a big that is a big question the fields can have to work out we have a hard time blinding these trials because the plocibo condition is not easy to to pull off i may the a a plocibo for a silicivan journey is is hard to imagine we have got you we have been thinking about this and maybe that cedemean study that i was tying about earlie if we could give people now treckson an cedemin maybe that is a good ia good sort of plocibo condition rihts we know that we can block any of the actual antid to pressen effects a cademy they still have an experience o that is one way of doing a but thinking about ways to do that really con approving the sow and that is been a nithing that is been been concentral to the way i've been been thinging about this bea i think there is th the work that is been done far the fir siliciv an trial a the first imdia ma trial is publish in ateour medicine recently a and what do those generally say i mean that that that that they are effective for a of people after one session to session e but what is what is thov or the general contour lest it let us ad start with silicivan an m da ma e imdia may appears to and in a one to a few india may sessions have a an antipetiuste effect that seems to be im outside of the kind of a standard assumed levels of petiesty improvement that you can observe an individuals a with this level of petiesty rit what we call the effect size which is essentially a a a mege a coinscity effect size a measure that allowels freeta compare different treatments to each other for different conditions that are ignostic to what the actual illness is a the effect sizes there a approach effect sizes the e things tht are pretty effective antacids for heartburn right and you see that with with a with imdia ma treatment does that mean that a for people that have troma who do a and again ore ting about in a clinical setting they they take a one or twodos is of of emdyim i think the standard mapstos is a hunor and fifty tisonre honu o nulegrams again doing this with a physician at tate control clinical trial lea gul a exactly they kdo it once or twice and broadly speaking what percentage of people who had trama report feeling significant relief from their tromp trama afterward it' about two thirds of people had a had a a clinically significant a change their petiousty sonce impressive which is impressive it and how how long lasting was that i'min that these trials were ended pretty recently si it it appears the last for a while n the earlier trials for the followed people lout it seemed to last for kind of in the years range for some people and it is it is pretty it is pretty compelling a silcibon a yit that in contrast at cedeme in which only when i averages last about a week and have for a single infusion it is a much shorter sotift yo a repeated infusions a can mean every ten days or the ot wor wer ever for some people were they and up getting a bunch of doses for a couple of weeks and than for some people that seems the last a while a you that is where i think i think tha the solicide en story for depression and the a in the m d a ma story for petiustyeu seem more interesting to me for i syllicide in what is the a rut rough percenagism and this would be relief not from trama but from depression ye the exactly it is an open label studies it is closer to have to two thirds of people and up getting better to penting upon their level of treat men resistance and the in the a blinded trials it was more a third or of people experience to a relief in thin this is yes is a press reliase of of the dati jun it has not ta to my knowledge it has not been published yet and you'm looking for to say in the full paper on that one but but it separated from from plocibo and looks looks pretty pretty good as well it looks it is a the first of two trials it need to be done to get this thing a a proof for treatment resistant depression and a that stuff looks looks good in terms of m d ama a for many years it was reported in the popular press an there was a paper publish in science that m d ma was nauro toxic that it would kill ceratone in nerons this has what was always said then i saw another paper published in science that was not a retraction of the previous paper but rather was a second paper in the same group that essentially admitted that the first time around they had in in jected these monkeys cause the with not m d ma but with matham phedame twhich is known to be neratotiser e was kind of a public it admittance of oops or big really big screw up oops a but never ettraction and ther never really a a publicly knowledged am correction in the in the popular press it seems that in the appropriate dosage range and with these one or two sessions my assumption and is as gain is an assumption i'm tell me if i'm wright or wrong here is that md a ma is not n erotocsic for sare an urgent nerons that appropriate dosism with appropriate sourceing et cetera a whose an interesting study that ta i think i his name is halpern a last name halperin it a not casy helper not ci formo i think na i shopen i'm blng on his first mim but but a casy halperon was a guest on this bod gast a then is a former colleague of ours that stampord who unfortunately we lost to universily pennsylvania and a mabisome day will will bring him back e otzright this this individual a received som an age funding to actually nigta nationalist ute for drug abuse funding to a to explore a individuals a of the morman faith in ou ta who a who partaken only imdia ma a the way this works is that a imdia ma a happened kind of after a lot of the religious documents were were a developed in suim dia ma is not on the prohibited druglist the mand subs o boveis dan substanceless i've some good friends who are eld yes a great great yalitai do i do as well a you kow just a kind of set of facts and a these these folks a only use im da ma but they do not they are not you now the promos with some people using drugs to polly substance users rites you cannot you cannot say it is the imdama if they have also take another psychadelics an thy've take an opiats n thy've tain cocan and you have this picture where you cannot really tease out that problem but but with this trat it was just individuals that were part of the mormon faith and they they were a conopurest in the since they only used im d'ama and he confirmed all that and a and it was abrilliant study right because then he was able to go in and look at their cognative profiles verses individuals a you knw of the same geography the same faith all of that that happened to not take a imdia mand found they were no nericognitive a differences he it dis i mean that it o was not damaging it was not damaging it it it is hard to know because to really do the study well you would have to tract these folks down before they ever took im da ma and do a prepost and compare to people that did not but this is about as good of a study as you can do a ingiven th you knove given the situation to be able to check this out a additionally when i was back in charleston and working mout conversyo south carolina i one of my mentors a there doctor wagner a was a kner psychologist at i aseeingwas also that the ner psychologist for the early em da ma trials and he did all he nericognative batteries for individuals pre post an similarly did not see any changes in neuricognative profils in a negative way and there is yours data from experimental patience receiving this ers data from people tor chronic users who only take him de ama am and that that combination a a of data suggests that ta there is know there is certainly a no apparent risk in the canto one to two to three do strange am it is it is probably unlikely that it least as modest dose exposure over a lifetime does not appear to have a a profound orcognitive a damaging effect interesting ye i know that am sorcing is k and me were here ore timg a clinical trials wer purity is assured and youn years ago when a called raves who are really popular maybe the still popular never been beento one o kno am if there happening or not thats o a in the no i am but it was clear that testing for purity was inporting because that sometimes the drugs it are made such that there are contaminants mathemphedamin which we know is highly ner atoxic i think that one reason why people think that m d ama might be neratoxic is that the a reported am dropin energy or sor of feeling fatigue for a few days afterward i spoke to a physician colleague of ours who said that that a very likely has something to do with the surgen prolac in that arrive subsequent to the big dopomine surge that occurs in am nm di ma and i mention that because i know a number of people talk about seratonin depletion after taking m di ma yehe has in mind that while that could be true it is likely that any time in somebody takes something or does something where there is a huge lift in dopeming that there is very likely a huge compensitory increase in prolactin that follows ind prolacton has a kind of seditive effact numming effect on mood an libido et satera that eventually also wears off theres that make sense to you as a physician te make sense o min the difference between sa m di man in sulcivon is that m diamas conan infedamine of sort fr its o has it has effects in dopemen in de a in sulcivons in a pretty pretty neutral and maybe a little bit of dopomine effects but cind of much more of a sert anurgic focus drug and ye i think you aregingto s kind of a different profile after and and that makes i have not heard that sort of the mic sense to me to since you mention sylcide an succla about the nurve chemistry of silicibon as a seretonurgic agent my understanding is that operates on these a is it the five eh t ceretonin a two s recepto two aexcuse me ato a and and a receptors and that i've seen a bunch of different reports and trms of what its ashy doing to the brain while people are under the effects of the drug and this is important frus to seg meant out because there are the effects that happened while people are under the influence and then the more long lasting effects but some of the effects i have heard about our for instance and tell me again if these are right a wrong that therere is increased conic a activation of lateral connection sort a broader areas of the brain being coactive than would normally occur may be that explain some of the senesieges seem sounds in anhering colors and th as the trivial example but rule breaking am within the mind am but then iave also heard am that perhaps it is lack of gating of senseryin buto normally if i'm looking at something i'm not thinking about the sensation in my right to unless it is a relevant but if i'm thing about the sensation in my right tom generally not thinking about the tralk around the corner we have these attentional spotlights but it somehow it creates am wore am it add spotlights e gates the tha megates the tholmis riteae the riticular thoud the thylamic structure am what is the evidence that any of that is true and are ther other phenomena is there involvement of dor salad or profrontal quartecs that we are aware of where i'm really headed here for it in a few minutes is am you not is there a place for combining directed stimulation of the brain with psychodelic that the effects of seratonian could be am primarily within the structures that from your work to be relement a depression what but to simplify at first but what is going on when one takes sillaside and and am wisad interesting in liht of a depression defly a it a divid not in robin corrent herriss work around your emaging psychodelics or cound of the some of the first folks to do that work in a you do not to their great surprise thet thought there was going to be increase in activity on psychodelics mit they found as the opposite wrat thes kin of an over all decrease in the level of activity in the brain am with psychodelics but they they have also looked it conactivity and there is thi kind of small world large world conactivity that you think about and your small world meaning her's lot there is can have a much more confocus concortical function or you have some cuortical function whatever it is and a what you see is a difference in that am in that level of engagement f of brain regions o the conactivity conglobl conactivity to your point k of yincreases and yit is it is it is interesting i think to to con have a convergent theory on this it is stilld you ow tobbe determine there is still lot of work i think at needs to be done but ta but it is certainly im suggestive that there is pretty profound changes in a in brain activity in brain conactivity after n what we found to be really interesting is the the antidoppress an effects of sylicibon have a particular am conactivity change that we also see with our or tiames approachis rate and it is this conactivity between the subgenual ant your singulat and the default by network and when we do the effect ive stamford nor modulation ther be stimulation we see a down regulation the conactivity between them negatively valance mod statenmen case at doppressed individuals in the self representation of the brain and you see that same conactivity change occur post syiliciban setting of suggesting there is a convergent mechanism and it make sense right you have cannagot and over connected negatively vailanced system conflict system that is can you have com attached on to the self representation and people feel stock right and then when you when you do whatever you do that is effective it it unan unpairs those two systems i want to ask you about this phenomenonon heard about juring sylicide and journeys i heard about this from am doctor matthew johnson who is running alot of the clinical trials tat i john's hopkins and ihas been a guest on this podcast he said that there is something seems to be important about the patient whose depressed or whose and is under the the influence of scyliciban were the patient whose trying to get a ver smoking or an eating disorder whos taking sylicib an and is in the clinic that there is something important to this notion of letting go that people will feel as if theire thoughts and their feelings and made even their body are not under their control and that the clinitions job under those circumstances is of course to make sure that their physically safe that they do not jump out of window or trin im i she give an example of a patien who thought that i think it was a she could move into the painting in the wall and obviously that was not true in the real world although true in her mind they prevented her from doing that but that letting go that somehow untathering from the autonomic arousal that is occurring is important i'm which brings us back to this idea or me back to this idea of a case saw where u letting go ofr the hinge just you your heart rates going up let just go with it in trust your heart rates going down just go with it ind trust you are thinking about a something very powerful and depressing related to your childhood you' justsupose to go there without fear you are thinking about what is possible in terms of what could happen at and anyway the you get the et that the picture can we think of that as as just the willingness to do a million different variations on the the emotional strupe task not that you will entertain the full full array of rules within your head and consider them where is there is something more to it at and again were we are in the that the outer margins of what of understanding here but what are your thoughts on on this notion of letting go as such a key variable for relief from depression during the psychodolic journey yes ug ou e'll talk a little bit about some thing called exposure ind response on therapethe the the typical con a gold standard tre pof frcety and i'll help to cano hel help this alittle bit conceptinally and what that really is it is a letting go therabe and a expos yure response prevention the idea is that you have to expose the individual to something that some some thing that triggers in obsession that they then want to do whatever the compulsion israte and i'll give you tit you to my first expos yure in response for vench inpatient when i was a resident a he was very concerned about a leaving the light s on his car and da and what we did is we went out and we turnd the lights on in his car and locked his door as lightser on and he was superory that can kill us battery ah than we went and we spent an hour talking about things an we went back out to his car and his battery was fine and his lights were one and he cranked the car and we did it may be one other tne and then all of a sudden that was gone right and that is the idea is that you'r essentially exposing and you want to do it it levels that are from an anxiety standpoint tolerable but exposing the person to something and then letting them see that that exposure ins zup being fine read in ins zub not tausing the thing that ther that theynd ap being worried about ah and in some sense being in the psychadelic state and we are all all we are all taught at a level to to retain some level of control people have more or less of that but we are all effectively retaining some level control we all wake up in the morning and put closhes on to go into society we all try to say wou know most people try to say the right things they do not try to do things theire outside of cultural nenorms when their in conversation and or wore constantly at some level controlling the situation that werein and it is yu now it is not it makes a lot of sense that in that state part of the theoraputic effect that may be link to the nurral circuitry is this idea of letting go and essentially letting the system the network configuration may be whatever it is a assume a state that you'v essentially been fighting the whole time the same way that my osee de patient was fighting this a need to click the off button on the lights of his car fifty times before he would go and do whatever he needed to do and in some level letting go there meaning letting us just turn the lights on and him not do anything or letting go meaning in the psychadelic state your just letting go of whatever it is you are holding on to negatively valanced think thoughts about yourself and t in thea setting of having depression or re experiencing a trama a you na memory and allowing that to just happen and read seeing it again through a different li ite you not feels the same in the sense that that is allowing for whateveris going on these psychodelic states to do whatever they do fascinating am you saids exposure response therapiecse the tition ios our response prevention prevention er be done outside of the o the psychodelic journey s done outside the psychodelic journey but that idea of letting go as is you kno present in both of those psychother can av straight up totally sober non psychodelic non anything psychi manualize that psycho therapy tht we know works feally well for os d and then in that psychodlic statements or people ov done studies with with still side in another some studies o them to you may trying to look it im you treating os d im with this same sort of idea of letting go right and and how do you how o you have ano sedy patient con of lek i may be ven letting go of not washing your hands any more can o accepting the idea they'r knocking i get germs on their hands or whatever it is and it is kind of part of that partin parcel that same sort of thinking when i was in college i developed a compulsive superstition i'm not afraid to admit this i i'm somehow developed at a knock on wood superstition and i would i was acsthally kind of ashamed by it of it because it ratioally made no sense i'm i do not consider myself a superstitious person never was a supersitioust kid yi'd step on the pside walk cracts a cat i'd walk under latters i even try ti but walk under a latter in them know i do not suggest it m but somehow i pick this thing up and i use to smeak it at times i told my girl friend at the time i had it in hopes that that would prevent me from doing it and it is it is tricky sometimes that actually comes back i think i shi did not say knock on would any knock on wood i hope that does not actually happenand it is and it is quite n quat crazy right but i a crazying the sense that it makes no sense rationally why the events would be linked and yet i think a lot of people out there yo have in internal superstitions maybe by talking about it now it 'l it will go away i joust see ou clearly i just need to challenge it em it is a an when i mention i because i a might concern myself generally rational person a i i'm it is intereting ow these motor patterns get get activated and and this notion of letting go because i kdo not actually know what consequence i fear and the fear as i was hearing example you gave the onther fear of the car running battery running down as about say what if the battery actually did run out then the therapy would be under mine and yet that could also be interesting to because it is not that big of a deal you jump the card a sir but in my case i i neen to think about what the ultimate an fear is yen i think feel lot of peoples there is it is interesting if you look it say the osed scale or the depression scale or whatever we do not define normal as zero we define normal as sum number range above zero to in the case of the montgomery asper depression raiding scale one of the depression scales we use ten right that is the normal range and people can have some sadness and still be considered normal in the case the osee scales about the same ten right where we say it is kind of starts to be avn't you mildly ab normal or something and i always a you it always tell the medical students luck my friends that are serf instructors they are more a zero on the wibog people professionals you knowther her ther nonzero but you it still within the normal range and and especially th in the case you are talking about it does not sound it got in your way it does not saly y u obviously highly successful tenured professor at stand forit and do all the great things that you do ah and it is it is very much kind of within the normal range and exi think totally am totally assume that a lot of people have have these sorts of things and his lont i think something a psychiantric diagnosis when it severely emperas your ability to function and that is when we connot cross that threshold but yu know i think that i think that a lot of people and it is great that your bringing this op of its very anti stigmatizing that you bring it upright because i think a lot of people hold that stuff in and they do not want to talk about it because they are worried that somebody else may think something but ha the reality is a a psachietrist a talked a lot of patients lot of people that are family members i folks what are just going through it a death than the family whatever it is and which you figure out is everybody's got a little something here and there everybody has the knock in some way if that makes sense and it is just and we were just all we are all just cond of more predisposed not to talk about it but i thnk it is important to talk about it because i think that when we start all talking about it than we realize that we are all con it in this to gether ind a way and that were in then some folks that have have to knock a hundred times we call that os d n and they have all you germ the're worry about germs ndall these other things we call that os d and then in that circumstance they need treatment right but but it is really on just blood sugar just blood pressure it is on a range you knowhan it is not just these discreet diagnoses you have them ar you do not int's good to know actually feels some relief just sun a i amslightly i iwent tay ashamed as er embarrassed by but i i i offer it as at tat it it is what it is is this that ah and certainly does not seem to hinder hinder moam my life much nock on wood iso if a we could talk a bit about i begain an i do not know much about i begin although any time i hear that you kow a i an lit again i bagain i think of an anaesthetic i and going to the dentist which is an unpleasant experience for me generally am what is what is i begain am does this then have anything to do with a the called tod am people to about smoking frog skin tod skin a what is it used for clinically is it legal in the you as int as a clinical tool a who ise using it and for what purpose is if you could educate me and i begain i truly know nothing about it except i think i know how to spell it cretethat is frso ibogan is a a is one of the alkaloids that you can extract from a a ut iboga tree rutbark that is a typically growing in the compet of the in the country of gabon africa gabon is one of tha west african countries can middle a of africa an the when the west coast and a in gabon is a has a a a group of afolks a a called the buiti a it is a religious con o sacra mentale a group that a sacramentally uses a iboga rutbark is part of of that is is the sacrament a and they a they have been using iboga rutbark for a very long time a in it is it is beun a part of the tradition there is a whole a os he whole set of of kind of ceremony around it a if you are interested in this there is a book called a breaking open the head by idaniel pinchback that goes goes through and talks about this a this whole process but essentially a the gabanese hae ben using this for a long time and a it it is it it is a kind of eig typical psychidelic it is not it is not a psychadolic that we normally think about with silicivan and elusty where their visual perceptial changes right fou if you take slicide e silicibon or elusty what you whith you experiences you experience this kind of visual a perceptioal differences in the external world right in on enough elusto or siolicidan an individual can actually perceive something visually in the external world that is not there as we talked about earlier a i began does not do that i begin does something different it it is kind of if you reseem minority report with the moving wi tomcres af the en or twenty years tegoit some the a dates i litl of it but a it was this it was this movy were he would be able to go and see these knd of pre crimes and he had this big this big screene where he could look at scenes from from time and can i go through that scene and see it and what what a individuals thing i begam will say is it upen iyes they do not see anything but closed eyes they will go back through and re experience earlier life memories and they will be able to experience it from a place of impathy not only for themselves but from others and come to a detached impathy and being able to see this as almost a third party even though they were there but they are able to see it as a third parties claugdio noronto as sechiatris from mergentina described this relot of books that that he wrote thing the eighties and nineties around this and i begains been around for a long time howard lots off merican gy that brought it over from a from africa is a polly substance use er used every drug that he hat hands on took i began and including a lot of other psychodelics by the way took i again in the never d another drug again supposedly ecause he had such a profound ive again experience i began is in no way a recreational substance it is not a recreational substance if you want it to be a recreational substance because you are essentially having this what they call life review they also call it ten years of psychlitheropean a night these are the terminology that people talk about the inn does at last as it truly one night it is usually we can go depending upon if yet redosed tor anything go sometimes depending upon how fast you matabolize it sometimes twenty four sometimes thirty six hours sometimes it can be shorter but it is long time whils a very long time its it is definitely the longest acting psychodelic substance i know of and a and people people you will take this andwill have this reevaluation of the a given memory and then itis wore time early reconsolidate that memory again and then it seems to have an effective of that reconsolidation process and about five for five years ago i was tapped by rob robert malinca one of the a you a senior your a scientist we both know and the university says wi ther sa you other's anunnamed owner that is very interested in o in funding aa grup a scientific can i open lable study of a of these navy seals that have been going down to mexico and taking a i began and and also ona fivein meodimt which i'll talk about in a second ah to treat pitiesti teclaimed of tramatic bran injury a depression yu aw that whole constellation of symptoms and as as it was described to me a by various people it had done this by their spouses and and what not a john well just say john john cultin screw a light into a light a lipeball bit to a light fixture right that they just they were just debilitated they could not do in a simple tasks what we call activities of daily living and they were coming back and having these really dramatic improvements in a in yu know all aspects of life and we have over the last couple of years been able to a to do this first inhuman can a full neurobiological clenical neur acognativ a valuation f what i began is doing in this case and ina special operations special forces individuals former navy seals for me at army rangers tat that cand of crue foxs and look at the prepost changes that we a that their experience to be able to totally quantitate all of that and we have been able to capture all the clenical scales depression scales betastes scalesle that stander stuff neur cogna batterye haw is your executive function work specifically at as your verbal memory all of that and then ner emaging and eegy this will be the first human study of ibogain for those in the reason whise because i begains kind of the both seemingly the most potent and most a i an an mot seemingly to me at least most powerful a psychodelic but the the one that has the most risk to because it has a cardiaic effect it seems to be that you can screen people out that have risk offir their electrocardiagraman and reduce the risk quite a bit and that is what we we all did but a but but that is whyt people have not really studied it as much minit it is not is ah in addition kno rigt nobody goes to rave on ibogate there is no recreation at all but os not fun it is people say that it is relieving but it is hard work right because yet you rea your reexamining things and am you knw and then then we we we see these folks after and i'll tell you we have it fully analize tha datia but i'll tell you that from from what mit folks youre telinmets pretty dramatic you knw people come back and their doing am they are doing a lot better theyre doing not better and da not nobody i'll knock on what nbuty's had any sort of a cardiac issue it all a in and in the cohort that we have studied and am and they look a lot better an they feel op better too an a and they describe these experiences of being able to go back through and a soldiers experience something called moral injury right were they maybe they accidentally blue something up and had a kid in it or something that there af ganistand i rac may be youknow child died on accident or maybe maybe a civilian diet or whatever it was right and then they suffer these moral injuries as part of the job an it is almost one of the kind vocational risks they come back and say that they have they'v they have for given themselves which is which is huge right and i in part of that is being able to see themself and a different light in having empathy finally for themselfes from being able to con have that experience of of forgiving and very cool the the study a you knaw what was happening was they were taking abagain and then taking something callfivin miodim te people call the toad its the sonoran a a river toad i think it is at you you find these mexica findiman arizona a in in the back of the the the toad a produces something old five imeodm t which is a a your flavor of d mt that produces af particular psychodelic effect also use a as a sacrament is it at dimethal trip to me isit is it is a five a imeo dimethal trip to me and it is a kind o dimethal trip to me wi with a kond of addition to it the the deal there is a that it lasts longer than traditional dmt it in outs twenty minutes a five thre or whatever kind of think and da and then these gis were taken i began that they ud take the five imiodm t after we had to cond of divorce those two things people do the study and tu s undersanti igan was doing and they go back down a month later and they will do the e five imio dmt tue completely saparate sessions to two completely separate session and in one quick question by i began before a bit more unfien thodemt a is the i begain journey guided er the person just closes their eyes and they ju start falling into the back catalogue of memories they have a a bunch of preparatory sessions and t they have about ocsessions after that they kind of a they are able to kind of rehash things a during there is a sitter that psits there and cansits with them and in in helps them out but it is not it is pretty the phenomenon of the drug seems to drive a lot of this it amenso a lot of it ince a beingwhat we call support of psychother per tis cono being there and may beu hold the persons hand maybe ou're just stisaying am here maybe whatever it is but you are making sure they know youre round but you are not really there is not really an interaction per say and then the whole conogoal there is just to get to get folks to con to go back through and re examine these memories tan ultimately look look they re a re consolidate them in dom it is very interesting i me in there is a there is this kind of tempt as you said earlier temothylery con a social cultural construct that ins up being overlaid over psychodelics ind what i think is that if you rig yourself of all of those preconceived notions of what it is and isnit ind the counter culture movement all that stuff that neither of us forever involve in ther ofus or ever partaken as is cond of straight scientist looking at this raght if you can conto rig yourself of all those social cultural constructions and then re examine this these if we just discovered these to day we would say that these sorts of drugs or huge break through in sychietry because they allow for us to do a lot of the sorts of things we have been thinking about with a with uscesorise with psychotherape but c in combined right psychotherp plus plus drugs in in a substance that kind of allows you to re examine these things and it is thit is interesting at all there is a lot to do to tra a figure out of that is true and and i can say that as it stands right now we do not know if it is that statement is true where it there is a lot more work that needs to happen for that statement to be provingto be true but the hypothesis is if it is true then it is very likely that this will be seen as a break through because it allows you to do these sorts of things that you cannot do with normal waking consciousness but also why we have to really think about this and these drugs cannot be recreational drugs they really should not be recreational drugs right there really too powerful to be used in the context to recreation because they can put you into these states and in the this generation of psychodelic researchers are really clear about that you kow i think the sixties folks were not clear about that and they they felt those lthe whole cicultural thing that was going on there but i think this cohort of individuals really understands that in order really make this happen we have to understand that if you need a prescription for an essessor i which does not change your consciousness a whole lot and we were very worried about that and the doctor has to valuate you for that every week that the idea that some of these substances would would go outside of of very strict medical supervision is this kind of preposterous actually it is kind of it is kind of a adomom and i think for for all medicine to say look wev it we can t do this right we have got o do it such a way that protected that say that we make sure people know these things are not recreational and the're really for the pure purposes of of really powerfully changing a cognition for a while n letting people have these what is seem to be you kno relatively therapeutic states i thing it is great that your doing thi study and along the lines of the sort of the early iterations of psychodelics and the counter culture of the sixties in seventies some of which took place one flo of the cucu's ness i think as actually based on am the menlo park ve which isus real you knw in our neighborhood of stamford am and things are quite a b different now i know of you and i've spent some time with tha operators in former operators at at an event and last vetteran stay in fact on the soe call vetteran solutions group that is m pioneering a lot of these psychdelic treatments for former special operators and current special operators and what is interesting to me about that is in contrast to the counterculture movement o the suckscees in seventies that room was filled with people that are very much of a structure the military wight it is no longer am considered left wing right wing anti military pro military here this is just bout one group of people whose exploring psychodelics has a treatment for tromon ptesty and other other things and at of course you all have other doma nes of society looking at this and in fact they were but it was really interesting because they were both a far left and far right politicians at that event oone stage together talking about a in kind of a lighter turns heart medicine but also talking about nerobiology and talkg it was just fascinating from from the perspective of somebodys trying to learn about the stuff that psychadelic deropies no longer sit within the anti establishment realm its it is both it is it it is independent of all that am certainly when people in the military or adopting as a potential treatment again still under exploration but also under exploration that universities stamford and johns hopkins and you see us appen f a universi he callage london and on and on am along the lines of tree barks and toadskins am tell me about iwasa a an as a plant a it is intriguing am and is it a cerprocertonurgic am drug sylisiban am an is it a useful for the same sorts of conditions that we talked about thus far and if you could a perhaps tell me a little bit also about the umbrazilian prisoner study e thei waskais another psychodelicats used as a sacrament a in a in brazil an a in peru and ecuadore and columbia a lot of the south american countries and a and what they do is they combine two plants together wit where one plant of the two plant combination would effectivaly do nothing but the two plant combination together is capable of producing a producing this very profound psychodelic effect and whats really kind of curious is the hird as i understand it tend to twenty thousand plant species an the amason in somehow somebody tried of all come behind these two plants together and certain proportionality in cooked this for five ten hours to the point where you cook out the dimathal trip to me in out of ne of the plants and cook out the reversible monoominoxidas an hibiter out of the other plant it is such a way that the reversible monminoxidas an hiiter prevents the the g i break down of the dymethal trip to me an and such a way that it is then allowed to cross the blood brain barrier and get into the brain and if you did not add the reversible monomnoxidas an hibier plant derived into this combination then it would never cross the brain if you put people on a standard psychiatry proscribed monominoxdas an hibiter was not reversible you you throw them into seratonenson drum rits o this kind of lake sweet spot the somehow i waska p racticioners ave found being able to get dimtand the brain from an oral source with this combination of a monominoxidas and hibitor is curious a and that that substance has been explored as an antitoprecent agent in some studies have looked at that it also seems to be very safe that a those a i saciatrisdown at a you seel a harbour whose don a lot of work with this where a where he is looked at children even that have been exposed tust small doses of iawaska as as is a cont of sacrament within amazonian a tribes and found no nor acognate effects no nor acognaive effects and adults and a an appears to be save it is part of it is cont of part nd brought into various religions including kind of merged with catholicism in south americas kind of very interesting and in some sects of catholicism in brazil it is used as sacrament during religious a ceremonies and it became interesting to brazilian researchers is to whether or not they could effect recitivism rates for prisoners in brazilian prisons rite n they gave half o the prisoners a some sort of inert substance and half o the prisoners a a aawaska session and tha the a recitivism made of th return to prison rate in the iawaska exposed individuals was statistically significantly lower than the recitivism rate in the in the control group suggesting that ta yen whatever is going on there seems to have an effect on whatever drives criminal behavior whatever criminal behavior that happened to be i do not have the the details on the exact nature of the crime a yu do not knot i am also in no way saying that we shus be giving psychadelics to to to fox in prison and all that i think that that that that is a very edgy thing to do and probably not something that anybody should try but whut it does it does kind of bring up this this curious question of of what is it about that that would drive people to a to change those behaviors and when why why of people make those behavioural decisions in in a lot of times if you look it prisons in the united states you set people say this what is the biggest mental health facility in th in the united states its prison yeh there is a a lota unpack there for sure a dehomeless issue the prison issue a it does lead to something that i heard recently and which is related to all this which is a canabus i do notyou know we hear lot now days about a people say what safer than alcohol nd we did an episod on alcall that at least by my read or the literature a indeed ot the alcal does seem to be a quite bad for our health beon o be i think id it' pretty clear that not drinking is better for your health than drinking at all and here i'm not trying telp yo what to do but hat those are what the day to say and forget the studies on red wine you would have to drink much red wine to get enough for uts very chals ni even clear ats rer tral doesn'anything usefun anyway et cetera et cetera none the last canibus is now available in a lot of very high potentsy form thet people are vaping canabus aum people are smoking canabus i certainly am not saying that canabus is bad for people necessarily although i think children i would i hope that their brain development would be be completed first you get age twenty five i know that sounds late am for a lot of people but eam it the t c obviously taps in to some a indoginous systems of of of and canabinoid systems and is powerful and i've seen this a this report that was in a lanceit psychitry this last year that said that early use of potent canabus meaning age fourteen to twenty or can potentially lea to in exascerbation of psychosus later in life and i i tually put this out on social media and a sort of exploded u i did not expected too people saying well that is not causal and obvious its not casal am because people say will may be people with a psychotic tendencies are seeking out canabus although that sort of a weak argument and in the sense that there is a a at least of four times am a four ax increase in these a psychotic episodes ther people later in life but what ar your thoughts about canabus because i do want acknowledge that it does have medical benefits foresern thins a pain kemotherapy am by no means trying to to knock on canabus and its appropriate met medicinal use but what what twe think about canaibus in terms of this finding that a kindi exascerbate a psychosis in certain individuals yes i think there is us e couple things rates or canabus is is multiple canibino its red c c b d c b and cee evas and indicas it that is the othere is a lot there tun pac the othere is al there is a lot of there is but therre too therre too man you have con chemicals you think about how things are er r a or sincily bread right and there is a lot of canibus it is really bread to be very high gre potent c there is a lot an there is canibus wer the t is bred completely out there stories am you now from from colorado i ithi a strain of of canibus thats t c freethers no t s it all and it is all c b d and they a it is called charlott's web a and aa bunch of a kid's parents one kir to tand can have a string of parents after that moved to colorado and canibus was legal be c legalized because c b d is antiapoleptic c b d is also anti psyconic there'v been a number of studies if you give c b d t hi doses it is anti cycotic in skitsophrenic established kitsophrenic patients the issue is that we have bread b d out of meroana selectively over time of gott very good at figuri ohow to do that right conversely t s is procycotic and proepoleptic ri and when you talk about its canibas cause cychosis or jus canabas treat pcsycosis it appears to be more related to the proportions af s b d to t c than it does to the idea of canabas for me there is a there is a kind i av no stoktis or anything that but othere is a company called y dv farmar suitacles and i have not looked into them in a while but they a they they have a aloticlynical trials for some called drava cindram which is a seizure o disorder or kit ss whole ot lenixgasto cindron which is a seizure disorderor kiser seizing threehundred times a day both of these are lik kizers seizing much they they are basically in a ceizure or in the postictal pase constantly and and they have failed everything they failed barbituats they faild bromides which we we we sdo not use any more except into these cases because of the sideeffects and theyll give kid s b d and i think s bds pretty save drug comparedtive bromide right and this idea that that s b d in a kid is actually safe it is it is it is a canibidoid but it c b d s ri and that to me is totally fine also giving c b d is a adjunct of treatment for for skits ifor any other been e positive trials and negative trials nd atput there seems to be no negative scideffects it seems to reduce some of the metabolic cindrum issues and in dafoxs with y skits ofrania who are having sideeffects from the primary anticycotic the the converse is there is clearly cases where people that ar taken very hidoses of t c become psyclotic they get put into the pcsyciatric unit nothing happens o tn the the kind of get the t c out of their system and then they resolved their psychosis riht and that that and a handful of people have had uno seizure's related to hidoses of t c cinkop in all sorts of thing and this idea that t c hidoses of t c can be procycotic is also not taking a shot at people that think that canabas over all is a good thing it just it itius is what it is and the conopure if you i thinki you zume backn you say youar true naturalist you think about natural medicines in the world you should think well probably maroana was balanced t c c b d at some point inthan we just we humans mest with it right and in that most likally that was probably o ka it is some level and then we pushed it one w are another and and what i mean by okes in a forty five year old it is o k kind of thing now what i think is going on with the wthe kids with it teen agers as you have got prefernal maturation right and then youre exposing them to a whole lot of hi teate sea load and a while it is unclear effits if it is cause or effect it certainly in the picture and if i were apparent i would not want my sixteen year old smoking mariwana if i were apparent in my thirty year old otherwise healthy a totally fined whatever banker lawyer kid decided to try mariwana for the first time i wouldtn't scold them about it right i think it is this kind of a different thing right i would never want my up to twenty five year ld just your saying before prefernal maturation of never want my kid to be exposed at all but it looks except in susceptible individuals ator susceptible to drug in to sychosis it looks it is o it is a relatively safe thing past prefernal maturation again i cannot i'm nok in a comment of cause and effect but i but i would say that it does not if you are apparent it does not make much sense right it mugt you want it you never know what is ultimately can o hurt your kid ma now my wife's prigtury ting out sterling my wife's pregnant now can ove avoids everything right rightfully right this idea that we just we want to be careful when our children's brains are developing and i think that is really what you were saying and i think actually important the bigger question you asked which is relative risks of drugs is an interesting one david nut published in think it was in the lance that i'll have to look at up i think in the lanceit an article about relative drug risks for the person and for society and this was he was on the the the ukas british a drug a policy group where essentially what he showed was if you took if you look at sucital risk plus personal risk and you combined those two it drug is the most dangerous drug in the world an a guess its alcalls alcohol right behind heroine and cokane and did it it dod somewhere in the middles mariwana and right on the tail end on the other on the exact other end of this silicibon its cathena did usually does not i teliss ii i may have been on the list as priveae it was it was probably pretty close to silicibon but somewhere in the middle was cedeme and somewhere in the middle was was was a emfed o being somewher in the a little closer to siliciban thit was in dea may but but if it is it is this combined personal can ave world risk of these things and alcohol makes it because there is a huge amount of personal risk and thes huge omen of socital risk right drunk drivers kill excimoun of kit yu kow people in the world by sexual asasall that all that ye and then all the cancer and all that sto and i it beats out cocane it beats out heroine it beats out all these things and and yet i'm and yet we do not we do not as a culture for whatever reason we do not as a culture see it is a drug and that is the part that really baffles me and i mean they serve it i mean this is no knock on stamford at all course i would do that thies at every institution i've been to they serve alcohol at they graduetes don events us riht but they sir alcohol that we would tey do a happy hour i've never been a drinker i can take it tor leave it id i realize that some people they really enjoy alcol a my former partoneri mean cheejus wu in that youn ten per centerr people who have a glass oine and just feel great and side one feel grat i i just want to take an ap after i i have beet of alchal never does much for me i always feel poisoned i feel lucky in that sense but it is it is unbelievable that it is prevalent and it is it' just it is baked into the medical even medical incitution that they will pop a bottle of champagne to celebrate the opening of a hosbit et trigt tha r youo know at's ready grazy yet ow you are absoluty right you kow i think i think what is going to happen but this is me look in the crystal ball a little bit but i think what is going to happen is what happened with doctors and smoking f you look athe fifties and sixties right the're all these pixtures of doctors smoking a cigarettes in with patiencs er sa cietes to encychlotherape and smoke a cigarette with the patient sitting on the cowch you surgeon smoking a cigarette and between cases they are all these pictures that right and now f the sudden smokings totally band i think it is totally band from most of standford campus my suspicion is as your suggesting right this is everywhere and it is all ce you biquit us at some critical point some tipping point everybody's going a realize that just with smoking we have get a rid hospital systems in universities of alcohol and it is some point in fifty years it is my view that we will look it back these these cenareas youre talking about and and be what we a we were foolish about this we i cannot believe that we we gave people alcohol on the wet when they graduated from whatever and i think we will have a different take on it but it is going to take it is conthink a longer time i think i think people did a really good job tying smoking o one cancer and it is very very simplistic story smoking lung cancer now you as alcohol increases the risk of a lot of different cancers not clear which whime and there is i unof the kind of orl the throat tongue cancer that is one as cancer youav brest cancer and it is bit is can ave just it is a harder story to tell and i think that is why i in everybody and then there is this whole it is an my mam says is i drink my glass of wine because my doctor told me it was heart healthy an weretir ofothers and i try to non but bu doctor soan sa said it is heart healtin soit in up being this thing we are she is drink an alll because she thinks that its it is good for heart in a you knowand it is it is hard ave had those conversations that hurt's hearte unti that ni think that to a yet some point were in it it is some some threshold moment it will be interesting if we really look at the data and we really look at what is safe and not safe from purely from this analysis it cun have it cave points to the right direction through the interesting and also i say nothing poor judgment under the influence of alcall i man i i it would venture that if we are to remove alcall from university canpases what shou watch the students are gin a lobby against me if i sayss if you were to remove alcal from canvasism ming just think about the the what i suspect would be the improvement in good decision making and that would occur or you not id have got stories from graduate school and put in it it it was very different a ten years ago there was a lot more alcall consumption yen that was never my thing but i know people make really bad decisions in any case a ers ha whole landscape there emergan i thing you got your finger right on the pulse of it i i want a touch on something slightly different than what we' been talking about but definilly related to depression and this is again is one of these intriguing but perplexing things which is that sleep deprobation can improve symptoms of depression and yet i'm in personally very familiar with the fact that if i do not sleep well for one night ere do not sleep at all in fact i do have an ability to function pretty well the next day i'll do this non sleep deep reast practice that i blabble ot about on the puberman laud pod cassarchfor me is tremendously restorative but i a good night sleep i think everybody understands now thanks to the great work of mathew walker and others thatve really gotten out into the world saying look the foundation of mental health physical health and high performance if that is your thing being a functional human being is to tryand get enough quality deep sleep at least eighty percent of the nights of your life if you can' that is that' something to folk is on just good nutrition just exercise and social connection et cetera sleep deprivation we know can imin particular i think rapid i movement components of sleep deprobation can improve the symptoms of depression and yet being sleep deprived can also really disregulate our control of the autonomic sisto my notice on night too or night three of poor sleep if on going through istrustful phase and that is happening all a sudden my heart rate is cronically elevateit my thought patterns become really destrupted i cannot than exercise you i can my decision making is thrown off my emotionality is more lay about the hinge as we referring to it earlier feels lasting control ah under my control and maby i wonder sometimes if i enter that staty refer to earlier were the dor laden't pefuntal quartsac is no longer leading the singulat but the singulatis now in charge that players are in charge of the coach e an not again situation i know you have done some work on sleep deprovation and lighten effects a please tell us about that and a please tell us about this triple therapy yeh yes a frend of mined no great salum by one another o one of the professors standford a is very interested and sleep heated a much of much af trainingan sleep before you into medical school and a and got very interest in this idea that is your saying if you sleep deprive somebody a one night in just kind of an isolated single night if the at the end of that sleep deprivation they will have an antidepress and effect but as soon as they fall asleep they lose it if it is a depressed individual you get them to be less depressed acutely soon as they falls sleep they wake up eight hours later than they come they come back into the same level depression and the idea is that you needed to do some sort of circadian reset and it parted what part of what depression is is that it is a disregulated circadian system and mentors of mind say if you just get the sleep better that is half the battle of dealing with depression to many people have in somnia around depression and have e whole host of types of insomnia faunt having our time falling asleep waking up in the middle a night and waking up earlier all symptoms of depression and what this does is it sleep deprives the individual and then there is a certain calculation of shifting their phase and simultaneous sly exposing them tebright light that is the triple the pase shift the sleep deprovation in thebright light to tret it get their circadian rhythm essentially the the therios rein trained and a know it in t in the trials that we have done an other trials a prior to ours and and and after you look those a pretty pretty profound anti depress an effect from this triple their this triple theropy that seem to be durable meaning durability is this term we use to say that not only can you get con apoint relief but that the relief ans up you kno lasting what is important to know about this is you should not do the t hom for sure this you would need to do this for the professional cause it is complicated it is not just one thing and it in sleep deprovation while it seems to be antidpress in its pro anxiety you take a highly anxious person that is not depression you sleep deprive them they get profoundly anxious and that is the other thing that that you have to really realizes that this is everything else ot to day all things that you you have to do under medical supervision but but curious right and and i think that the questionthat always comes up as why as an this used more and i think the reason is that there is not really a mechanism for ultimately and in medicine as sad as it is you have tohave a code to do a thing there is to be a code associate with a treatment and it is hard to figure out how to make a code for this and i think that is part of it and if if there is a way and somebody is got a con to take that baton on that but if there is a way to make a code for this a you i think you could you could actually turn in into something was more widely widely utilize and yeu a pray dream up ways have had a had a in agrat a ay passive sense sing all that stuff to really make that work am but i think that would be that would be the the idea thatu be the trojectory i see si ye having a billable to insurance code is nce fundamental and a lot of listeners in this podcassite i think have a background in engineering science and wwe wil put a link to that a manuscriptot that talks about the triple therapy because youe were talking about one nights sleek deprovations and taught time to let a light exposure to the eyes and and then shifting in the circadian clock things sentral to the themes of this pot tha podcast to come apoften am i think for the typical person can we say a that trying to get a regular dark cycle at sleep rhythm would be beneficial for over all mood regulation ye i think for for the typical perse and a really really kind of reregulating your sleep and in trying to get a good nights sleep in which you fall sleep stay asleep wake up in a set time every morning as going to be pretty crucial a in mild depression i think that one has a lot of control over that is wer tying about early i think when you u hit some threshold in depression where things become ckon of simivolitional lots harder to kind of will yourself an to that a there are therapies a there there is a seeb tee for in somnia for instance for you cognat behavoural therape to help with in somnia sometimes people ut i'm not i'm no sleep expert that cn a pass us to greg to fully talk about this but but a but some of what goes on that people w cone a milder and somnia experiences blue light out of their computer and things that that they you used blue light blockers to to it tricks your your brain is better than me a trickshire brain to think that it is still light outside and people will they will have in somnia because their brain still thinks that it is light outside and then people well am that the kind of strict see b t for sleep a i therapists will say there only two things that you should do in your bed and if you are under a certain age and in what not it is really one thing that you should do in your bed which is to sleep and a an in be with your partner a right an those ore there is our kind of the two a the two things that you should do in a bedroom and that is really the only things that yu should do n a bedroom if your having sleep problems you should not watch teev e in a bedroomshon eating bedroom ships euno hang ou phone out of the bedroom keep the phone out of the bedroom now a we should get great salem on the pot cast we the i'll just mention repeople that want to regulate their sleep we have a a sleep tool kit that is available as a down loadable pedia that hubernn la dot com just go to the manuine a lot of the things in that tool kit ar based on work from stamford sleep laboratories including jamiy's isers and others a lad i'm not aimed at depression specifically a thisten i noone doctor williams a this has been an amazing a voyage through the circuitry of autonomic control this landscape of the prefontal quartaxes a i find incredibly fascinating and i i just been to start off by saying please do come back again om just more about that and youre tamas work i before we rap however i do wane to give you the opportunity to talk about the saint study e is it saint or saints plorel yat saint a saint or what were we are calling at us in t now a saint has the intent was not ta to have to count of connect it to religion but a but we may av a accidentally done and we we abbreviated it to san t for the for the subsequent trials which was initially stanford accelerated intelligent or modulation therapy or now re calling standfor nor modulation therape but its sa the idea there which is a cool ideas that tamas a is a device that deliverers a the deliverus of treatment an the treatment is the protocal in the protocall is the stimulation perameter set in a specific brain region for a specific condition and what is cool about normodulation whe ther it be transcraning magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulationor deep brain stimulation what casy halpern talked about a on another podcast is this idea that in all those cases the device itself is a physical layer conduet a a stimulation protocall the stheraputic for givin condition in a given brain region and in the case of depression which we know the most about for wit tamas we have been doing tamas studies for depression for yer since nineteen ninety five rigt in a clearance in two thousand a two thousand eight two thousand nine and in that a in that time frame we were able to go from really knowing very little at all about how to do something this to getting an af t clearance in in the way that it went down was that there were two groups studying a different componence it and ih the first group we studying mood neranatomy on functional imaging that was kind of the first generation of functional ameging back then pet scans a which er conmetabolic scans a and then spect scans and the idea there was looking at activity and metabolism in prefernal quartex and what they found in these bcome were crude scans is a general hypo activity hypometabolism the other rered upstairs at the national institute for nerological diseases ind strote in i an yes they were looking at using teamess which had been around for ten years and rerepetitidly stimulating in moter quartec what they found was gosh we can get a read out in thumb a muscle a movement amplitu that is really reproducible across people it slike universally reproducible ndif we do certain stimulation approaches they are biologically active to either increase excitability i e the thumb motion an a set intensity goes up the amount of amplitu goes up or in hibitory depotentiating it goes down with other biological stimulation approaches than a third outcome which is important that it is inert it does not do either you canhave stimulation approaches tot do one increase activity decrease activity or you or ar inert and what they found was oh we can excite certain brain regions tand my men to r mar george had had this conahamoment where he said wow there is under activity and prefernal quartex in depression and we can increase activity using this thing that we know we can increase activity motor quartex we just need to put it in the left or cylateral prefinal quartect and then they combined the two and started stimulating once a day in this kind of very abbreviated fashion in lone behold some of those depression patients resolved their depression in bac then and still to day you can go and as a psychiantropatient stay it the nationalistitudimal health and go through clenical trials to try to get treated and there repeatient patients whave bee there for months and they were able to be discharghed he got a mood was better yet and i very crude approach for their using ruler measurements or a deal p s was and ther stimulating with devices that you need to physically dunk the coil and an ice bath and with that is still were able to the congenius of this f mark and others or still be able to to create a a purely engineer stimulationd approach whats which cool about that is that that they they could have found two things right they found this one stimulation protocal it does have some antie to press and effect its it is limited it does not treat everybody does have some antie topress and effect and this bigger concept that a nermodulation device is conalice a parmasutical company for you right that in the given individual a teamass device or whatever normodulation device is able to generate to to uncreate a stimulation approach that is specific to a given condition and specific to an individual and the physical layer is just how you exert that similarly to how we make fharmasutical drugs and at pharmosutical company but the actual therope itself is what you do where you do it and what we learned from another twenty thirty years of this is that you can modify the stimulation proto call in such a way we can create a whole new treatment and put it through the same tamest ofice or thank od i volve version of it wer y do not have to donget nice basts and yand take an actually really handl much more aggressive stimulation approaches and in two thousand in five of a group published a nuron a paper demonstrating that if you if you stimulate with the hipocampel rhythms through a tamescoil you can excite the brain with mimory rhythms and it will last an hour you can change cortical excitability in the thumb twitch for an hour sending three minutes of excitatory or forty seconds the case of in hippotory stimulation that mimics thyppicampel rhythms much more efficient the original tames approaches and after that group try to do it in this kinof six week schedul and after that and while they were doing that we decided gosh this probm i talked about the beginning of to show where you have these ou know this problem we weu do not have a treatment for people who are in these hi acuity psychiatric emergency states right this idea that we are an engineer a treatment where we can re organize the stimulation approach in time to be much more efficient by utilizing something called space learning theory and you you praying about the space learning theories the idea for the for t years is it is the simple psychological thing we have al seen it in hippocampal slice sort of physiology too where if i'm cramming for a test what i do as i write out sixty note cards and i read each one for a minute until i get to the first note crarden again and that is about an hour or later right and we just we just intuitively do this we all we allyou know automatically do that and we we we into it that because we know that what does not work is writing out one note card and looking at it over and over again nobody ever does that right yu we we have all been ingradschool medical school we have these big stacks and note cards that space learning theory it is this idea that you need to see it about every hour to an hour and a half and that optimizes learning if you take the same stimulation approach than im talkg about the state of or stimulation approaching you take a hippocampal slice of a mouse and you stimulate you you enlarge som dindritic spines and you prime sum and then if you stimulate right after that you do not get any change is called in mastimulation but if you wait about an hour or to an hour and a half you get more dindredecpines enlarged and more primed which by the way also is what cedemy does t it does that it causes this indredict pine enlargement and what we f ound wase is that the old way of doing t amass this idea of just doing at once a day every day five days a week for six weeks did not utilize the space learning theory it is studying for a month or two just a little bit once to day leke you remember some of that stuff but it is not as potent is that wek where your kind of cramming right in what we realize is that if we could reorganize the stimulation and times that we took the whole six week course an we actually figured out away to do it in day an then what we also figured out is that people were underdosing t amass because if you just keep going after six weeks out to month three for five more more people got better we figured out it is not just one day whereng gou five times the normal dosering of sevengand a half months worth than five days using space learning theory every hour every hour for ten hours for five days or five days suce he fifty our blockets ninety minutes of actual stimulation but spread out through the day in the same way of learning which is perfect for an impatient psychiantric initrat five days is managible yet it get stimulation nobody's ever dropped out by the schedule o thet they their nea folks wet want to do this want to do it they will do their nine minutes tho ou get breakfast w'll do their nine minutes the go seither therapist or whatever it is and what we found a with this reorganization and in time of the stimulation dose and then the third component is we do resting state functional conactivity scans on everybody and we have ways now in the last five ten years of picking out that spe sific subgenual deel p f s sub circuit that i was talking about earlier that singula deal p v s we can pick that out in every single one if you you won to come to lad we can we can find your deal pf c subgenual its even more roboss than we nond and rela to just ouwere and the yet you ougt to we can we can move rout your hypnotizability of an we can we can find that spot in each person instead of finding the same spot on the skull we find the same spot on the brain and we can stimulate we do that every hour in the hour andwhat we found wiwhat weve found is that folks will a will within one five days and in more cases than not ind depending upon if you'r ooking it is opan label or in trials somewhere between sixty and ninety per cent of the time they will go into full on remission in the since ther totally normal from a mood stampoint at the end of this and it said with variable dur durability that is the part we have to forgot now about dosing and ho to keep people well but for some people yeet we have had four years of remission year of remission and it is it is really that cramming of the test that is really that idea that your laying in that information o the texact righte spot in the in the signal is a simple signal but it is a profound one which is turn on stay on remembered a stay on that idea that your it your sending this memory signal into the brain and your doing it in such a way that you'r telling the system you con o taking out of the hypicampusis hant your own hippicampas's hand is youre sending the same signal the hippecampus normally signals out now you are sending that signal into the prefernal qartac an kind oe utilizing the brains own communication stial to get it to get out of the state and what is very cool about this is that ta is that people when they when they con exit out of that theyndaam theyand up saying they do not have any any side effects from it and they feel bacts o normal some people not everybody but there is a subsecto of people with with us asarise wer they will say a kind of feel nom where i have te iyside effects are i cannot i cannot i do not have the sexual interest that i used to have in that sort of thing not ething encesersorises the seter arlyor life saving unifer a subsection of people these things really work but with this what you see is that people do not talk about any that stuff and i think it is it is likely because you are tapping into that course sircuitry ind your reversing it and yu're doing it with a with a magnet that because it is a very profound electromagnets the same field strength is an emorize scanner it is able to induce a current in the brain in this vocal targeted way without getting into the rest of the brain without getting into the rest of the body at all and just really con acting only on that circuitry that is involved incredible it is the same study steal on going in if people are interesting in potentially being am a patients or subjects in the study a can we provide them aportal link absolutely as we have a now the the treatment a my summi students whenever to company called magnes medical o and they have been working on this they have got en augto a clearance now and dam and now folks can get it through trials over the next couple of years because it is gon to take some time for that company to to kind of get up in running and and get a am get a get a device and get the whole thing set up a nationally but while that is all going on they are still about a thousand patients that need to be recruited to cross a buncho different trials all over the country we will take people from anywhere in the country we ell shave

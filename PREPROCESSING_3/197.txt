a quick warning there are curse words that er unbeeped intodays at pesod of the show if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our whibsli this american life dotwork from dw be easy chicago it is this american life i'm on the baker sitting in for iric lass kids have a stage where they learn to be embarrassed it begins when theyre todlers but some of us do not seem to take the lesson to heart my friend jane marie i'vm known jane for years she is to work at the radio show and her shamelessness was the quality i most admired about her especially is a woman she did not care what people thought am i acting nice am i dress chu sexy and mi being loud she did not ask tose questions she was totally opinionated and scrappy jane was never embarrassed and for a pretty specific reason the way she grew up she was methodised she was taught you are not the center of the universed which made her feel free no one was wuatcion tod be embarrasse would to be would would be to assume that any one in this room or any one who witnessed this actually spends more than five seconds thinking about me and they do not why would you think any one but god gives us shud about anything you are doing ever they do not you aret nothing you mean nothing in the world lit is obnoxious basically ink ha any of your actions that any one actually looking in your direction this world view that others were not judging her helped her not judge herself those thoughts just did not occur to her did you have an inner critic what do you mean by in er critic way i come again i was surprise when she tekes to me and said she would heard i was looking for embarrassing stories to put on to day's radio show and that she had one a big one that she would never told anyone but her therapissed something that changed two she was and i'll get to that story in about a minute the first let me just say i love embarrassing stories i always asked for them at parties if i hear a good when i'll retell it for years some of them funnye but that is not the only reason i them i think the best one say much about us reveal sides of ourselves maybe we would rather not see and to prove the point that embarassing stories have a lot to teach us i decided to harness the power of the radio program and we asked you for your embarrassing stories people send in over a thousand of them dto day will hear some of those and talk about what they rebeal butl we are gin to kick things off with janes stori because honestly of the hundreds of embarrassing stories that i've heard i've never heard another one janes were it changed some one deeply her story is our first act let us call it bell of the gall jane's story starts at a big charity event at a booty hotel in beverly hills the night as the fund raiser for children with at pelepsy it is held in a grand ball room witfine chinine excessive centr pieces and some of the most powerful producers and executives and holliwid this is not jane seene she is there because she is interviewing for a job a job with a big studio a job that would be a mader leaped for her and thay a ton more money than shed ever ma they would met with her several times for interviews and they would invited her to night and pay'd for takit as at cannan you fun looser let us go to something more social and see how we all hit it off knowing where it is howled and knowing it is a galla shane weres a ball gow a two p dark green dress that shows off her middrift with a giant billouis skirt she walks into the event and to her surprise people were wearing business casual instead of it was not black tie and i'm overdressed they are passing around champagne fluts i grab one but promise myself on only get a half half of this one glass of champagne before we sit down at the table i am going into this with full control of myself i am you are there to make a good impression i am there to make a great impression on these people i want o work with them and i want them to think i'm respectable and it is a weard thing i hate that i still have to talk about the world this way but when you are the only omen at the table or one of two women at a table and they are all old older white dud seeo tipes who have in a certain way have your future in their hands it does not feel great in the ball room of maybe five hundred guests theyre seated at the main table front in center during dinner jane's looking for opportunity to shine a moment when theyll get to know her better but it is not coming the se o guiser all talking over her there is no moment to jumping in the conversation no one seems curious about her at all the're they they get to th auction portion or the funderies are pertion of the evening and thereis a you kow person up on stage is calling the the auction and they say all right let us get things kicked off here jane has an idea one time the only other time she is been to a gallat they would had an auction too and to surprise her table as a joke when they started the bidding before any of the celebrities that night lady gogaor angela bascet or higdy glum could get in a bid jane raised her paddle it was for an item that was tens of thousands of dollars jane was brow her friends at the table knew she could not afford it but she figured i'm surrounded by rich people some one will absolutely out bid me and they did the item went for hundreds of thousands of dollars everyone thought it was hilarious she looked at this table of c os and thinks i know how to spice up the evening cause i've done it before i'm get a throw my paddle up again i' men to throw my paddle up again get things crank and have a funny story for our table to laugh about and they opend the bidding and what i here is we'rkin a start the bidding out at twenty five thousand dollars and i shoot my paddle up in the air wit the same confidence that it will get outbid immediately and then we are movin on and then we are cookin with gas and everybody's you are a blast jane feels a rash hah i wa fun she waits to be out bid and i had somehow not herd that this round of bidding was really just it was not something that any one else could bid on it was not an auction at all it was a pledge it was a twenty five thousand dollar pledge from the eight people sitting at my table it all happened really quickly after i raised the paddle they were lke yea and they put the name of our table and everyone at our table up on this board there was a teevy screen a large teevy screen hanging from the ceiling and the name of the company i was with and our table number and the mount of mi pledge and i look over and the one person i know best at the table it looks he is having a a hives an attack every one else is just slack jod oh my god jane what did you just do what did you just do what did you just do and i'm and thers mouthingness or even just saying et out loud depending on how close they are to me they all just stared at me and we are how ar you going to fix this for our table sometimes when something embarrassing happens to you you exaggerated in yer head think it' ha bigger deal than it was but in this case no i wish i could take this away from jane and tell her her memory's wrong her memory's not cause i here to tell you yes it was that tat it really was it was that that you are not makin that up that is adam davidson jane's only friend at the tale he is the gi who broke out into ives as i'm remembering it i just that feeling a wa wam wm wam wam wa the universe is different now the universeis fix it fix it were off course a that i ki ges om mrchency mait is i part of the panic is if if i do not stop this i'm goin to have to pay twenty five thousand dollars a yah cause i thought i would it what if what if there is no way out of this and i have to macks out all my crowdit cards no i really was can you look i cause i do not have a auction experience also my can you take it back she decides to try at the other end of this jiant ball room there is an exit jane thinks there will be people in charged there they can help me she bolts ut aut of her chair and heads there fast as she can through dozens oftables full of people i may i really was havving to be excusme partme parting excusing xcusing part me part me susin just ci at here i get through the double doors of the back of the room as quickly as i can and its slams shot behind me who is running the auction she ells a volunteer points or to a woman with a lap top jane rushes over and explains its all a mistake i do not have money the woman is surprisingly understanding she says what would you to di romete yo i was why just neen to i take it back i cannot spend that money and she is boket and then bleeply blark she is in her computer and but what i and i think you oket and then i walk back in to the ball room and i'm looking up at that the leader board as centually of all the pledges and were at the top and than it disappears right as i walk back in the room it felt a spot was turned on the whole room turned e n whole roomis e rackards scratch and every one knows that i just took twenty five thousand dollars away from this charity but of course it was not jane's name that was on the screen it was the companies the one she is hoping to work for very quickly it was not o jane did it was our table did this again jane's friend adam and it was not we went from first to second er first to third we went from number one to the bottom ye i i was embarrassed i think everyone at the table was embrrassed yes we were be wouln't you be ebees and i get back to the table and i sit down and have kind of ap was not that a nervous laugh am no one is enjoying that and i just start focussing on and anything but the people around my table a i'm just really intently listening to the auctionear aguy and and and and we have to watch is really sat vidio that is a many dacumentary about the children in that worse was to be there to help am and they dim the lights the movy is about fifteen minutes long the music is emotional it is parents in their children at that belepsy talking about hou scared and sad they feel how much they need treatment sitting there in the dark watching this this is the moment they hitch jane the hardest it is not when everyone looks at her it is when she realises what she is actually done she would only thought of this evening is an opportunity for her to make an impression that was grows what i did it was grose and wrong and watching these children with his illness ot a big screen i was just i am the worst person on the earth that i bid and then i took it back and then i said now e as a part of me that was ocud i just take out a humor cretic curtsly at then its a title wave of what just happened and what i did and how mortifying it is just the layers of the reasons i should be embarrassed and criticizing my that euno why would you even do that why would you do that then when you did do it why would you try to get out of it the answers to those questions are uncomfortable because they force jane to see things about herself she does not embarrassment can do that it can show you your blind spot it exposed a fatal flaw that i half too pay a lot of attention to now what is that fatal fa hubrous something about that made me feel my confidence had bad consequences that there was something bad about it the night ends she does not get the job and she has that i'm pretty good authority that the decision boil down to her big mistake that night this stings but that is not the crux of what that night did to her it has actually changed a lot about how i i act on public i'm just much more self conscious after that really i used to get superpomped about going to a party and now that is kind of fraut i know this is gon a sound counter intuitive but i've started leaving the house sometimes without make up because it is i don' want people thinking that i'm thinking about what they are thinking i that make sense i do not want any one to think i put make up on for them this is is the weirdest stuff that nowpops into my head about what other people are thinking where i'd wish i did not care i've always been that way worrying what other people are thinking about me and i cannot imagine what it would be to discover this is a full on adolt jane says everything feels different turn now i feel completely newtered a lot of the time nealy yet i do i feel am it made me second guess myself a lot i guess i yve writ i used to write essays about parenting and sex and im i would give advice and i wuld i o on radio shows and now i'm just shot up jane shut up jane shut up jane shut up jane shut up no one is asking and no one wants to hear it it is crazy to me theycan it do something embarrassing once and suddenly you have that inner policemen for the rest of your life is there anything h can make it go away you think i do not know im what could change it i do not now i jus ony have the desire it does not it is why would i want a change it that i could put another ball gon on and go in barrass myself in font of abouch people no thats does not sound fun it does not sound fun any more ike i do not think that the lesson i learned was necessarily all bad i nos honestly when i think about the old version of me it is kind of gross in a way tats just kind of a noxious it is a that is a baby i'd honestly never thought of embarrassment as being helpful to anyone it pummels us humiliates us but jane's glad this happened to her she i's glad for her new awful self consciousness she says her ego a smaller now which means that with everyone in her life she is quicker to a ment when she is wrong and apologize and over all she says it is calmed her down she observes mar hangs back never wants to be the centere of attention which she says is a lot las hackack jane marry is the host of thepyecast the dream o atto judgment day part of the ison in ma interested embarrassment is because of this realisation i had resmintly i am embarrassed of myself all the time at least once a day i break out into a rash from embarrassment a couple of days ago when i learned from a coberker that all my life i've been mispronouncing the word incongruouse se i get embarrass when i think people are looking at my eyebrows or when other people see my dog poup embarrassment is on me all the time and i want to get it off and one o ways my obsession with embarrassment has played out in the last few months is i'm in a group chat dedicated to it there are four of us in it one of the people k s e layman i only met when we started this group any time we feel embarrassed er ducein the embarrassing we write to each other it is how i know we have both worns banks for deccades or that he is self conscious of his hairoline or how he walks these little secrets you would never know about some one otherwise sometimes we swop stories of past embarrassments the time ksay was teaching a class at vass or college on hyppapa's literature and the elemni magazine wanted to to a story on him this was back when he was in his twenties they did the interview and then a photographer comes to take his picture when a

er a ota poins at oall i o poke usely yor o case of that is people cut in alive a te me another gegood i guess i especially love the category of embarrassing stories where people tried to avoid embarrassment and in doing that they embarrass themself to get com me here one that i gets this happene to this lady mary gray from murls inlet south carolina she is a bride's maid whose dress arrives and its way too small day the wedding she gvinces another brides mad one sises up to swap dresses with her oca this dress fits but it is its tight and she startes to get this a rasional fear that if she' bulging out of her dress she is gen upstage to the briding groom oh if people look at her instead of exactly this cannot happen and then this idea hits her sir ran rap i go into the kitchen i found the ser ran rap i get it out and i just start wrappin when i i round and around and round an i am sinched and the dress seps up beautifully and i think yo this is gona workis aia genius and out the door agap she is standing in a hundred and five degree heat at the alter s out calona next to the briding ground and there is a big crowd watching and she just stirts getting hotter and hotter and honor i can the old the sweat starting to kind of roll down my back an i'm looking down at the floor an i'm seen spots and i'm a fainter i know i know what that means am i it is subtly if possible i turn round to my gransman partner and i ask him to uns up my dress and of course he has no idea what i'm talking about hislike what is said i nean se uns up my dress he does it the ands eps my dress now every one knows that i'm wrapped up and sran rat and are you just mortifi i am just really focuststene ill not passing ow ti decid that i am going to take off she ducks away dresses open she misses the ress of the ceremony gets im water it is unny greatest fearis that she as can upstage the bride groom and she does srun ap and thand that leads her to do exs at tat she upstages the bride agan iat she is the thing that everyone remembers about that wedding from start to finish i am my own worst enemy in this story ug said the must haunting story that came in try in box tha was this one and it is embarrassing that the woman who sented does not one us tuse her own lame oca mirging a call er mya my as taking the gari this this last year she get a pi to grad school eman because of coved she had to take it on line in her home office but it is a very regimented process just o they know ther not cheating there is a proctory sign to watch her through a wet camp before the test i have to get them a little tor of myy testing space ant it under the desk over the desk the walls just everything that they know i'm not cheating we do that everything's get to go i start the test barway through te test she has this pain in her stomach and she is o now she is got a go and she is got a go now she manages to hold it in till the break but then to ourhora the next brig in just one minute long right wo she your messages the proctranches tit can i lea even come back in a minute anhy tells her if you leave the frame you will forfeit the test ah and i'm sitting there and i do not know what to do either i leave now i give up i go to the bathroom and do not take the jury give up gradscool or i do what i actually did what she actually does as she does the do on the floor we will staying on camera nothing is happening at a ala she she poit positions er arms on the chair stoppe with this mental imman tet ont gs i get teep gone with the story which s a this is surprisingly a category unto itself we heard from four other people ho had to make this same call during he sandrdise test what i made the same decision ya al they tried to hold it in it did not work for thew what happens she asseems the worst of it is over she makes it all the way to the next brak its teme in a brak she is allad to leave the room o join the break ya but quickly i realized then at the end of the ten minute brak i had to once again give them this web camp tor o my testing aria including under my de oh my god now i realize o ket the ten minute break means cleaning this up keep it min ian the proctor is still watching her through her web camps she has to army crawl across the room on the floor oh to stay out of the camera s ilagly exactly but you got away with it right the proctor whele never saw had no idea here is the thing i was telling this story to some friends oversom and i'm sitting at the same dest where i took the jury and i told this story and augiously relll laughing whanever and then one of my friends tinpli quietly waits for everything to die down and then says is thot imure behind you and it whas i have in fool sides standing mearer behind me and i i went back to the door of the room and crawled all thein and reenected everything and all i could here was them laughing i was not even sure i was i could you see it or not could you see t or not but tey warrant breathing and eventually on sad yat you coan see everything for shthe thing that sixs out to her about this story is it it showed her new information about herself the new on from mation bing it what lovs she is willing to stup the ich think as i think tat in much more positive way of how far shell go to get what she fe siction is to getr that is not her take on it at all that is one of the big things with these embarrassing stories is li people never take it the positive way for the most part thouh they always take it the way where they are i knew all my life somethng was wrong with me and

i want to share one last tonbarrassing story act for putting the bare ass in embarrassing of all the kinds of embarrassing stor as you sent in one of the most common one's wise a situation where you were a little bit naked or all the way naked in public this is a common fear one of the most frequent nightmares is the dream where you looke down in realize your naked in front of other people froit even wrote about it in the interpretation of dreams he called it the embarrassment dream of nakedness and said quote i believe that the great majority of my readers will at some time hav found themselves in this situation in a dream when we feel embarrassed in our waking life we often hav this dream the person in this next story who wrote in from nash fell as definilly had this dream her name is carryad she personally has no interest in being naked in public in fact even bathing suit sar stretch for her i think people whou have poolposies a tital psychapaths i do not understand why you would do that i have susside to git luckily there ont alot in england but i used to come here to visit my grandmother and tpeople would throw pool posings in my b why yotin about whan i still feel that wa i are you doing this to all a las i do not ago to the pockin beach for your got down be day the story you are about to hear or happened years ago when carry ot was living in new york city she had just started seeing this guyes she liked a lot an emergency room doctor they personality always smiling reliable he told a lot of funny stories about the are we are calling em dout the way she remembers it they been seeing each other for about a month they slept over her place and it is the first night she stays over it his as carriet is drifting off to sleep i just remember being really really tired and really needing to go to the ba threem and that was kond of my lost as i was fooling to sleep was ah i reallyde to pee but i call beobleh to get up finebawthream and then i had this dream that i really need to go to the ba threum and i was looking for one nd i could not find one anywhar and i was pushing this big metal do in my search for the ba threum and it was locked on i could not get threuh when i was really really frustrated and then i wo cap and i was naked standing in a stairwell pushing against a big door that wen from the stairwell into the rest of the apartment building all my god it was my mind melted just the logic of the situation just it made no sense carriette had sleep backed out of dug's apartment apparently she done this as a small child just a few times though she had no memory of it at all and she never sleep backed as in a dult it did not occur to her that that is what is happened i felt i'd completely lost my mind hat just how am i here how is this a thing that is happening how on my away pcarried pushes open the metal starwell door and sees to her relief dug's apartment at the end of the hall she runs towards it and then i realize i' enough this is is apartment and i turn around and looked and it was just one of those new york buildings i' just a bunch of apartments to each floor that all kind of look e same and i realize i soils a nightmare it was was fill ake afly i funting night ma carritte approaches the door she thinks his dug's apartmend though she is not sure what i deside to do is an nock on the door and then i run away from the door back into the stairwell before they answer and put my ear to the door i crack the door to the stairwhelsto i can hear them but i cannot see them they cannot see me this way if it is a voice i recognize i can run around the corner and into the partment and if it is a voice i do not recognize they will not see me and hofullee they will just close the door wus her pretty brilliant plan thank you thank you i do that and it is not a voice i recognize and i stot to realiyes the depth of the horror of the situation i'm in people can a stap getting up and going to work and i can not be there when that happens by the way i still really need to pee i me apey badly that it will not be oppen may me sleep wark she decides the least conspicuous place to pea while naked is at the bottom of the starwell leaning against the door to the lobby if some one tries to open the door she can push back and if some one's coming down the stairs she will hear them she swallows her pride and does it i horrified i was horrified i remember very clearly just sitting down on the stairwell and just crying this is just such a ridiculous situation that i could not get myself out of and if only i had been more aware of my surroundings i would have known that he was in apartment to be whatever it was how could i have not paid attention in the liv and i remember drying my eyes and could even lite my nose on my sleeve u fring my nose on my arm and just thinking or right buck up you have to take control thi situation and fix it you do not have an option just have to fix it and i started very gently trying all of the doors in the apoe building her help is whatevery door she came out of will still be unlocked and i went systematically floor to floor and i tried every door and on the top floor that was one upom e that i could hear voices in and theyw having a great time is sounded some one was having a poty if she cannot find another solution she thinks i'm in a knock on this door but first she tries all the dors again and then they answer occurs to her mal boxes his name will be on his mail box she runs to the ground floor and sees through the door th the lobby is all glass windows there is no way to get to the mail boxes without everyone in the street seeing her naked she heads back up to that party on the top floor rings the bell and then runs and hides behind the door e woman comes out she is clearly tipsy carryd calls to her asking if she come over to the starewell which the woman does how are you even able till i cover or hide yourself i mean there really is not o is just that catone one om across your bobes your little hand is a figlef i mean that is all you can do in that situation carriat explains her predicament and asks if she can borrow some clothes the woman shems totally an face of course its happens all the time she gestures for carryhad to come on in and walks back into the party carriads weiht no no no but the doors closing she reluctantly follows five people are there they see her naked carryad dives behind a couch the woman brings her a track suit the whole party rallyes to try and help carry ad salve this situation she describes dug to them the woman thinks she knows where he lives they knock on one or two doors waking up neighbours who were not hin they call carryad cell no answer eventually the woman tells carry d to just sleep on the couch carried wakes up at seven the next morning tries her fun again and gets an answer and the person on the fun is not the guy tha i had been with somebody else and they really angry and he capt saying what is your name what is your name and i kept saying i want to speak to the skuy and they would not hand the fun ota and i's geting really pist because ies wall he we i e just given the fune and they said what is your name what is your name i's a carriat andthen said whats you are lost name and i said hamen and then this guy gets on the fon she means dug and he is just what duf fok where ought he is really angry it turns out while carriett had been running round the hallways naked he would woken up in the middle of the night to find carry ad's clothes whill it fone but no cary at it was she would vanished i talk to dug he did not want to be on the radio but here is what he said he looked for her everywhere he peeked into his room mates room to see if maybe she would accidentally crawled in their bed then he open the fridge then the oven before catching himself and thinking why would she be in the oven next he searched the building outside the building eventually he called one of her friends they did't know what to do he thought she is been gone long enough with no clothes on this could be serious by now it was almost morning he called the police they shut up twenty minutes later he explained to them i was out with this girl she came back here she appears to be lost one of the officers started questioning him aggressively he is not certain if they were disturbs but he remember thinking they were probably more suspicious of him because he was black it went from the rode to a hundred fast as dug put it i remember feeling this is the most screwed up situation i've ever been in this dou does not believe i'm telling the truth maybehe thinks i killed her just as things were escolating carried finally got through on the phoune carie takes elevator down to dugs for when she steps out the police greet her she realizes this is who wouldto answered the phowne once she explains her side of the story they leave and its just carry out in dug i think it took me a minute to recognize the gravity of what had happened to him but i think once i really realized that at one point in the evening he was a suspect oh thet they were not on your she is found that is such a white person thing to think yeh ye of course of course is ye i felt the gap i felt how much we did not really know each other in that moment am but i just remember saying i'm sorry i'm sorry because he was genuinely very shaken up and dam and he being the largely guy that he was if he was just hind just i'm glad that you are o kay but i have to get on with my day they never went out again thouh mostly because he moved across the country a few days later this state had been planed as kind of a last night together but they stayed in touch a year later when he came back to visit he an carry had went to dinner with his friends the gentlemen t that he is i remember we were sof chatting he said i have not told them about the story and i said oh it is fine if you wanet to tell them you could tell me said no o no no no i think he was worried about embarrassing me and then i went to he bathu when i came back and everybody was cracking up then he looked to me n he said i told him i told him y i could not help it and we all laughed about it he he also left that pa out in order for it to be funny since things came out of kay in the end they each tell it this wa at partiis they leave out the fear most of the embarrassing stories have heard an collected for this week show the person does something that results in their embarrassment mate lake we have this lady she sirranraps herself for a wedding eh there is someone who reasos of paddle in an auction in goes arie and i i get why they feel embarrasse but you did not do anything you did not over step you did not make mistake but you still feeling harrassed yeh i suppose if you take blame off the table it takes may be a set in flavor of that embarrassment ou but i does not take the embarrassment away there is something inherently embarrassing about running into a room full of people you do not know naked they could still happened to you i still happend to me yeh i suppose i should feel pretty bullet pref now should not i they think once something really embarrassing happens i do think you shood across that that threshold somehow and if i fum if that kay lik then why be embarrassed and for a long time i would

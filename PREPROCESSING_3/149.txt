marms it is an exert of a short story bynefesa thompson's spires rat first by actor's esdavas nerica alexandera tuesday october first nineteen ninety one hello monica i'm sure you remember me from the class field trip to the getty in september it has been brought to my attention that your daughter fatima may have started a nasty rumor about my christinia i hope to clar this up as we both know how ugly these things can get it is true that christinia's hampster died recently but it is absolutely not true that it died at chricy's hand at no time has chrissi ever put hambone or any of her previous hampsters in the micro wave drier or dish washer what kind of child would make up something that it sounds and i say this respectfully i hope you will not be offended fatima has had a very hard time getting acklenlaed here and that is understandable but i do hope you will deal with her before any such incidents become frequent children who start lying young often and up with long time patterns of dishonesti all best doctor licinda johnston cid lifesence therabis welcome wagon westwod primary sevents cordinator jack in jill clermont branch monday october seven nineteen ninety one dearlicinda i apologized for my late reply but i only found your letter at the bottom of fatima's backpack when i did my weekly cleaning thank you for writing to me fatima says she only repeat it what christinia herself told her many of fatima's stories about christinia this year and last which i will not recount here have been disturbing to say the least but none is disturbing as christinia's enjoyment of torturing wroteds fatima has a strong imagination and writes beautiful lyric poetry which she started reading at e for but she does not have a history of lyine or telling gruesome stories and i'mlike christinia she has no history of running off with other girl's shoes while their feet dangle from the monkey bars i appreciate your concerns about fatima and even though christinia has made it much more difficult for her to find friends at westwood ffatima will acclamate soon she is going to a sleep over at emily's this weeken is christinia going if i hope you will encourage her to play nice best monica williss p h t p s it is true that liars who start young often indup with psycho logical in social problems of the sort that christinia has timistrateed over the past year how lucky for you and christinia that she has access to csychotherapy through your practice no an dear monica i never expected much defensiveness when i wrote my original letter perhaps you miss read it all i wanted to emphasize is that i understand why a girl and fatima's pysici n and one with her background would make up such stories it is hard to get attention in a new place there is probably some petty jealousy going on but i think we can resolve this i do not know how you did things at fatima's old school in fhresna was it but here we try to help the children work through their problems without getting too involved i suppose you already know and have known all along that christinia will not attend emily's party there is no need for me to encourage her to play nice you have probably heard that history already i will not rehashit but i will say that it was not chricy's fault that emily broke her nose when she felt finally and i say this respectfully but maybe it would be wise to go through fatima's backpack every night instead of once in a blue moon i have heard from more than one parent that it smells eggs my best doctor lucinda johnston license therapist author of train up a child dear lucinda or should i say doctor johnston i'd to resolve this as much as you would but that will not happen if all your letters begin in end with back biting i'm not of the mind that the only two black children in the clash should be inemies nor do i the attention it draws to them or their parents when they are already in a difficult position i would think that a black woman of your stature and success would understand how isolating work in school environments westwood can be for people us i hoped christinia an fatima could be frinds and could support each other in this space but it is been clear since second grat that you and christinia are not willing to make that work i'm sure fatima would let christinia into her growing inner circle even her after school reading club if christinia would only apologize and behave jealousy can become a lifelong problem on that note i hate to bring this up now but we were surprise by how poorly christinia behaved when far tima's poen one over hers last year i to make sure that we do not in t wuth a repeat performance of that tantrum when the poetry competition rols around this year asked with a hard boiled egg we resolve that last bring and bought fatima on new back pack atd i believe you knew that already jears doctor monica willis ph d author of every voice counts helping children of color succeedd an predominantly white schools monica excuse the informal note i think you are doing both yourself and fatima a great injustice by continually emphasizing her brilliance over other children lots of people sgip grates and skipping kindergarden is not something to brag about i doubt that the standards at her old school were as rigorous as those at westwood whut exactly was she advanced at naptime if you will recall moreover i was there at the recital where fatima read her a word winning poem and while my doctorits yes plorel may not be in literature i'm pretty sure hardly any one would call butterfly pie a work of poetic genius you cannot rime pie with pie multiple times and call that poetry you just cannot even if you have the excuse of only being in forth grate is not your degree by the way and e d d lucinda lucinda i'm not surprised if fatima's subtle word play was lost on you since it is clear reading problems run in the family not everyone is suited for literary work i'm sure that from your own writing struggles in the extr effort you had to put behind your research in order for any one to take it seriously is not there still some kind of issue with your last project and the i r b or is the issue wit doctor partale's ex wife my very best monica monica i'm not going to dignify most of your comments with a response this will be my last letter because i can see i'm not going to get anywhere with you there is some kind of blockage there that i really think you should explore with a license to professional especially if you call yourself a professor it one time i wondered if we were too harsh and recommending that you an your family wait another year before joining our jack in child chapter but i can see now that we were right i'm afraid i can never recommend you for our club you display a volatil combination of residual getto and upaty ne gress and that will be your undoing if fatima isn''t sincerely doctor lucinda m johnston license therpest author of train up a child welcome wagon west wit primary school events cordinator jackan jo er my chapter lucinda i'm not even going to respond to that but i will say that if some one here is up aty it is the one of us with two little brats who have run off three o pairs who even uses that time if they are not french and i'm pretty sure your cousinshir quana is not ther nanns nannes and if there your old relative than they are just baby sitters or bumbs who need a hook up this bushiness and the way o keeps you from connecting with your kids is half of your problem the other half you probably cannot fix without medication good thing you can write prescriptions await you are not that kind of doctor how can i be up ity when i've never had any help and started out as a single parent befoore marrying jordan if putting myself through school and becoming the highest educated person in my family with no help but gods makes me up aty and be it we are humble people in spite of our education in finances and we have more class and our extriment than you havin your whole hampster murdering family and yes there is a bit of getto still left in me enough to tell you who can finish the fight if it gets to that point whenever too far from opan or the southside tet's keep it real monica monica i do believe that was a threat the clare mot police department will not take this lightly and tell fatima to stop penning notes to the inside of chricy's book bag when she is not looking chrisy could injure herself on a dirty safety pen knowing you people and and up with happatitus a b or see or worse i've tried to resolve our differences by working directly and exclusively with you and their teacher missus wason but i will have no choice but to contact principal lee in addition to the police if this persists lucinda lucinda only you would suggest something disgusting as intentionally injuring a child with a dirty safety pin wat then again it was cristinia who put that tack on rene pots's chair last year and caused her to need a tetnas shot perverse minds think alike apparently lose my number and address and stop making your kid do your dirty work em monica turn blue turn blue turn blue blue blue look i've written a poem perhaps i should send it to lady bud magazine love lucinda lucinda you need jesus do not write me again or i will contact my lawyer i have asked missus watson ta jack fatimas back back for correspondence from you and i have made it clear that i do not want further cottak from you or christinia you are not to speak to fatima either i requesting a meeting with the school and you and your husband that we can nip dis crazy mess in the bud once in for all monica jack and jo claremont chapter october twenty first nineteen ninety one dear missus johnson and missu schoillis it is come to my attention that your

welcome to the ubermen lapodscuss science science pay li man your hubermen and on a professor of nerbiology and optomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to discuss light and the many powerful uses of light to optimize our health we are going to discuss the use of light for optimizing skin health appearance and longevity for wound healing for optimizing hormone balance and for regulating sleep alertness mood and even for offsetting to mensia one of the reasons why light has such powerful effects on many different aspects of our biology is that it can beat translated into electrical signals in our brain and body into hormon signals in our brain and body and indeed into what we call cascades of biological pathways meaning light can actually change the genes that the cells of your bodies express and that is true throughout the life span today i will discuss the mechanisms by which all of that occurs a promise to make it clear for those of you that do not have a biology background and if you do have abiology background i'll try and provides sufficient depth that its still of interest to you and i promise to give you tools very specific protocals that are extracted from the pureovieu literature that will allow you to use different called wave lengths which most of ust think of his colors of light in order to modulate your health in the ways that are most important to you for those of you there are thinking that the use of light to modulate health falls under the category of woo science pseudo science or biohacking well nothing could be further from the truth in fact in nineteen o three the nobell prize was given to neel phinson he was icelandic he lived in denmark for the use of phototherapy for the treatment of lupus there is more than a hundred years of quality science emphasizing the use of light and as you will soon see the use of particular wave lengths or colors of liht in order to modulate the activity of cells in the brain and body while it is the case that many places and companies are selling therapies and products related to the use of flashing lights in colored lights promising specific outcomes from everything from stemisel renewal to improvement of brain function and some of those do not have any basis in science there are phototherapies that do have a strong foundation in quality science and those are the studies and the protocals that we are going to discuss to day but i thought that people might appreciate knowing that over a hundred years ago people were thinking about the use of light for the treatment of various diseases in for improving health and indeed many of those therapies are use to day in high quality hospitals and research institutions and of course clinics and homes around the world one of the more exciting examples of phototherapy in the last few years is the beautiful work of doctor glengeffrey universiy college london the jeffrey lav is known for doing pi and eering and very rigorous for search in the realm of visual narrw science and in the last decate or they turn their attention to exploring the roll of red light therabe for offsetting age related vision lost what they discovered is that just brief exposures to red light early in the day can offset much of the vision losts that occurs in people forty years or older and what is remarkable about these studies is that the entire duration of the therapy is just one to three minutes done just a few times per week what is even more exciting is that they understand the mechanism by which this occurred the cells in the back of the eye that convert light information into e lectrical signals that the rest of the brain can understand and create visual images from will those cells are extremely metabolically active they need a lot of a t p or energy and as we age those cells get less ufficient at creating that a t p and energy exposure to red light early in the day and it does have to be early in the day allowed those cells to replenish the mechanisms by which they create a t p i'll talk about these experiments in more detail later in the episode and the protocols that you could apply those protocols should you choose but i use this as an example of oure growing understanding of not just that phototherape's work but how they work and it is through the linking of protocalls an mechanism that we meaning all of us can start to apply phototherapies in a rational safe and powerful way before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls stamford it is however part of my desiren effort to bring zerocos to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their

ove talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodiu magnesium and potassium present in the proparatioes all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and ief hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolytes if you would to try element

elementy dok com slash hubermen oka let us talk about light first i want to talk about the physics of light and i promise to make that very clear even if you do not have a background ind physics and then i want to talk about the biology of light meaning how light is converted into signals that your brain and body can use to impact things organ health or disease or how you can use light in order to repair particular organs your skin your eyes your brain et cetera the physics of light con be made very simple by just illustrating a few key bullet points the first bullet point is that light is electromagnetic energy if the word electromagnetic feels daunting to you will then just discard that in just think of light as energy and think of energy as something that can impact other things in its environment now the way to imagine light or to conceptirolize light as energy is that all around you light is traveling in these little wavelings and the reason for those yeither watching hm making a little wavy motion with my hand is that is actually the way that light energy moves in little waves just sound waves are coming at you and impinging on your ears if you can hear me talking right now that is happening those are sound wves meaning the movement of air particles out there impacting yur ear drum will light energy is just little bits of electromagnetic energy traveling through your environment all the time in these little waves and in pinging on your brain and body and eyes et cetera and as i mention befor energy can change the way that other things behave it can cause reactions in cells of your body it can cause reactions in fruit for instance right you see piece of fruit and it is not right but it gets a lot of sunlight and it ripens that is because the electro magnetic energy of sunlight had an impact on that plant or that tree or even on the fruit directly as a parallel example of energy and its ability to impact other things we are all familiar with food and the fact that food has calories calory is a measure of energy it has teverything to do with how much heat is generated when you burn a particular article of food believe it or not and it turns out that how hot a given article of food burns gives you a sense of how much energy can provide your body in terms of your bodi's ability to store or use that energy again think of light as a lectromagnetic energy but really put that word energy into capital letters in bed that in your mind going forward and you will under stand most of the first bullet point of what light is in terms of the physics of light now the second thing that yu need understand about te physics of light is that light has many different wave lengths and the simplest way to conceptiralize this is to imagine that cover of that pinkfloid albon wher tere's a prism you have a white beam of light going into that prism and then the prism splits that beam of light into what looks a rainbow you got your red your ang your greens your blue as your purples at cetera any time we have light in our environment that is called white light it includes all those wavelings but sunlight and other forms of light also have other wavelingths of light that we cannot see when we think about the rainbow that is just the visible spectrum of light there are are also wavelingths of light that are not visible to us but that are visible to some other animals and that can still impact your brain and body because there is still energy at those wave lengths give a few examples of this humans are not a species that can see into the impher red realm of the spectro a pit viper meaning a snake that has inpor red censers however can sense in the imphered if you were to walk through a jungle and there is a pit viper there it sees you as a cloud of heat emission because your body is emitting impher red energy all the time you'r casting off imphered energy the snake can see it you cannot if you were to put on a particular set of goggles that were imfra red goggles well then you would be able to see the heatomissions of any organism human or otherwise that could emit impher red energy let us take the opposite end of the spectro we are familiar with seeing things that are blue or green or very pale blue but as we say below that meaning even shorter wavelingth light is out there ultra violet light is a really good example of light energy that is coming from the sun and is in our environment is being reflected off surfaces all the time we do not see it and yet if it is very bright outside that ultra violet light can burn our skin as you will learn to day's episode ultra violet light and also positively impact us in fact i will describe a particular set of new results that show that ultra violet light viewed for just a few minutes each day or landing on the skin for just a few minutes each day can actually offset a lot of pain it actually has the ability to reduce the amount of pain sensed by your body and we now understand the specific circuits in the brain and body that allow that to happen i'll talk about that and the related protocalls a littlebit later the importanthing to understand about the physics of light is that there is energy at all these diferent wave lengths we only see some of those wave lengths which basically is to sayht that light impacts us at many different levels and the call levels that i'm referring to are the different wave lengths of light and youre welcome to think of the different wave lengths of light as different colors but do understand that there are truly colors of light that you and i cannot see and yet that have powerful impact on your brain and body now the third bullet point to understand about the physics of light is that different wave lengths of light because of the wave that their wave travels can penetrate tissues to different depths this is very e very important to day we are gong to talk a lot about red light therapies and near impor red light pharapies those are call longer wave lengths longer wayling just think of a bigger longer wave right a bigger curve as of us a short wavelength light which is going to be shorter iht a short wave lengt light would be something blue or green light or ultra violet light blue green and ultra violet light because it short wave length light does not tend to penetrate tissues very easily it has to do with the way that the physics of light inner acts with the physical properties of your skin and other tissues of your body but basically if you were to shine you v light on to your arm for instance it could impact the skin on the surface of the arm and maybe some of the cells just beneath the top layer of skin but it would not penetrate much deeper long wave length light red light and near imfor red light has this amazing ability to penetrate through tissues including your skin and if we were to shine red light or near imfor red light on to your arm it would pass through that top layer of skin it might impactit a little bit but it could pentrat deeper into your skin not just to the skin layers but made even down to the bone made it in down to the bone marrow and for many people this would be hard to conceptiollize it you think a waiht i gat the skin there does not the light just balnce off and the answer is know because of the wave that long wave length light interacts with the absorbance properties of your skin absorb ince properties iss just the way that the skin takes light energy and converts it into a different form of energy and your skin is not able to take long wave length light red light and near im for red light and absorb it but the tissues deeper in your body can if you shine red light or near and for red light on to the surface of your skin you will see a red glow there as ha reflectance on the surface of your skin but a lot of the photon energy the light energy in those longer wavelings is indeed passing through those top layers of skin into the deeper layers of skin and can even make it into the deep layers of your arm and as we start to transition from the physics of light to the biological impacts of light just understanding that the different wavelingths of light impact ar tissues at different levels literally at different depths will help you better understand how light of different colors of different intensities and how long you are exposed to those colors and intensies of light can change the way that the cells and the organs of your body work and if it did not sound weard enough that you can pass light through particular tissues and have them land and be absorbed at tissues deeper in your body well it turns out that different wavelingths of light are also best absorbed by particular called organ nells with in your cells what are organells organlls are the different compartments and different functions within a given cell for instance your mitocondrea which are responsible for generating a t p and energy in your cells those exist at a particular depth that a paticul location within a cell they are not all at the cell surface they sit somewhat deeper in the cell the nucleous of your individual cells contains deana and that is its at a particular depth or location within your cell different wavelinghs of light not only can penetrate down into different tissues and into different cells of your body but they can also penertrate and access particular organells meaning meticondria or the nucleas or the different aspects of yourecells that a responsible for different functions this is exquisitely important and it is exquisitely powerful because as you will learn to day particular wavelinths of light can be used to stimulate the function of particular organells within particular cells within particular organs of your body i can think of no other form of energy not sound not chemical energy not drugs not food not touch no form of energy that can target the particular locations in our cells in our organells in our organs and in our body to the extent that light can in other words if you had to imagin a real world surgical tool by which to modulate are biology light would be the sharpest and the most precise of those tools now let us talk about how light is converted into biological signals there several ways in which that is accomplished but the fundamental thing to understand is this notion of absorbtion of light energy certain pigments or colors in the thing that is receiving the light energy meaning the thing that the light energy lan es on are going to absorb particular wave lengths of light now i promise you that you already intuitively know how this works for instance if you were to sit outside on a very bright sunny day and you had a table in front of you that was metal you might find it hard to look down at that metal table because it is reflecting a lot of light of particular wavelengths if that table were pitch black however it would not reflect quite as much and you would be able to comfortably look at it if that table were red it might be somewhere in between if that table were green it would be also somewhere in between but let say it were very light blue well then it might reflect almost as much as a able that were just metal or a whight table surface the absorbance properties of a given surface will determine whether not light energy goes and stays at that location and has an impact on that location or whether not it bounces off every biological function of light has to do with the absorbance or the reflectance of light or light passing through that particular thing meaning that particular cell or compartment within a cell i to make it clear how this works by using the three primary examples of how you take light in your environment and convert it into biological events we have photo receptors in the back of our eyes these photorceptors come in two major types the called rods and the cones the rods are very elongated they look rods and the cones look little triangles rods and cones have within them photo pigment they have dark stuff that stacked up in little layers rods absorb light of essentially any wave length theyr'e some variation to that but lets you say it rods do not care about the different colors of light they will absorb light energy photon energy if it is red if it is green if it is blue if its yellow does not matter as long as that light is bright enough and iteturns out that rods are very very sensitive they can detect very very small numbers of photons and rods are simpally what you use to see in very lowlight conditions will return more to vision later the cones come in three major varieties at least for most people who are not color blind you have called red cones green cones and blue cones but they are not really red green and blue in the back your eye they are cones that either absorb long wave length light red that absorb medium wavelength light green or short wave length light blue the reason that they can absorb different wave lengths of light as they have different photo pigments much as the example i gave before where you have different tables outside and the sunny environment and some are reflecting light more than others others are absorbing more than others well too the photorecepters meaning the cones are absorbing light of different wave lengths to different extents and in it absole incredible way your brain is actually able to take that information and create this perception that we have of color but that is another story altogether that will just touch on a little bit were later but that if you want to learn all about you can go to are episode on vision that is photoreceptors in the back of your eye absorbing light of different wavelingts rodsin cones the other place of course where light can impactd our body is on our surface on our skin and skin has pigment too we call that pigmen melonen we have within our skin multiple cell tytes but in the top layer skin which is called the epidermis we have corratino cites and we have malanacites and the malanicites are the cells that create pigmentation of the skin and of course there is wide variation in the degree to which there is pigmentation of the skin which has to do with genetics also has to do with where you were born and raised how much light exposure you have throughout the year rights o people toward the equater tond have more malanicde activity than people who are located at the north pole and of course people live at different locations throughout the earth regardless of their genetic background or where they were born and as you all know with light exposure those malanicites will turn on genetic programms and other biological programs that lead to inhancepigmentation of the skin which we call panning the way they do that is by absorbing you v light specifically with malanicites we have a very specific example of how a pigment absorbs light of a particular length in this case ultra violet short wavelength light which in turn creates a set of biological signals within those cells that in turn creates changes in our skin pigmentation we have photoreceptors we have malanicites and the third example i to provide is that of every cell of your body what i mean by that is that every cell of your body meaning a cell that is part of your bone tissue or your bone marrow or heart tissue or liver or spleen if light can access those cells it will change the way that those cells function for better or for worse for many organs within our body that reside deep to our skin light never arrives at those cells a really good example this that will touch on later is the splen unless you have massive damage to your body surface unless you literally have a whole in your body light will never land directly on your spleen but the spleen still responds to light information through indirect pathways and those indirect pathways arise through light arriving on the skin and light arriving on the eyes a key principle that i am going to return to again and again to day is that the we asin which light can impact the biology of your organels your cells your organs and the tissues and indeed your whole body can either be direct for instance light on to your skin impacting skin or light on your photoreceptors impactingte photereceptors of your boye or it can be indirect it can be light ariving on your photereceptors the photereceptors than in forming anothercell type which informs another cell type which then relays a signal and kind of a bucket brigade manner off to the spleen and says to the spleen hey there is a lody youve light out here we are actually under stress in fact there much youve light that yunion to activate in immune program to protect the skin and in response to that the spleen can deploy certain signals and certain cell types to go out and start repairing skin that is being damage by youvi lid we have direct signals and we have indirect signals but in every case it starts with light of particular wave linghs being absorbed by particular pigments or properties of the surfaces that those light waves land on and as you recall from our discussion about the physics of light remember it is notjoust about light in pinging on the surface of your body light can actually penetrate deep to the skin and access at least sertain tissues and cells of your body even though you cannot see those wavelings of light they are getting into you all the time perhaps the best way to rapp this discussion about the physics and the bilgy of light with a bit of a bow is to think about light as a transducer meaning a communicator of what is going on in the enbironment ar round you and that some of those signals are arriving at the surface and impacting the surface of your body but many of those signals are being taken by cells at the surface of of your body meaning your malanicites in your skin and the photoreceptors of your beyes and then being passed off as a set of instructions to the other organs and tissues of your body lighten impactor biology in it very fast moderately fast and slow ways but even the slow ways in which light can impactor biology can be very powerful and very long lasting just as it quick example of the rapid effects of light on our biology if you were to go from a room that is dimly lit or dark into a very brightly lit room you would immediately feel very alert heu might say no that is not true sometimes i wake up and its dark and a kind of stumble out and its lighter out in the next room and it takes me wild awake up ah but if we were to move you from a room that was very dark to very bright a signal conveyed from your eyes to an air of your brain stem call the locust serulius would cause the release of a drenoline similar to the release of a drenaline if you were to be dropped into very very cold water all of a sudden ouis immediate wake up signal to your brain and body s that is an example of a rapid effect of light on your biology nt a very typical one but none the less one that has a hard wired biological mechanism at the other end of the spectrum are what we call slow integrating effects of light on our biology what i mean by that are ways in which your body is taking information about light in it the environment not in the sort of snap shot acute cense but averaging the amount of light in your environment and that average light information is changing the way that your biology works but even though this is a slow process as i mention before it is a very powerful one the primary example of this are called circanual rhythms circanual rhythms are literally a calender that exists within your body tha uses not numbers but a mounts of hormone that are released into your brain enbody each day and each night as a way of knowing where you are in the three hundred and sixty five day calender year that might seem kind of crazy but it is not crazy the earth travels around the sun once every three hundred and sixty five days and depending on where you are on the earth where you live you are going to get more or less light each day on average depending on the time of year ifyour in the northern hemisphere in the winter months days are shorter nights are longer in the summer months days are longer nights are shorter and of course things change whether not your in the northern hemisphere of the southern hemisphere but none the less in short days you have more darkness that is obvious and if you understand that light ar riving on the eyes is absorbed by a particular cell type calld the intrinsically photosensitive ganglian cells just a name you do not need to know the name but if you want as the called intrinsically photocens ive ganglians all also clled the melon obsin cell because it contains an obsin a photopigment that absorbs short wave length light that arrives through sunlight those cells communicate to particular stations in the brain that in turn can neck to your calle pineal gland which is as little pecized land in the middle of your brain that releases a hormone called melatonent and the only thing you need to know is that light activates these particular cells the intrinsicaly photocensitive melonopsen cells which in turn shuts down the production of melatonan from the pineo glant if you think about this interms of the travel of the earth around the sun across the year what it means is that in short days because there is very little light on average landing on the cells the duration of melatonan release will be much longer because as i mention before light inhibits it shuts down melatonent whereas in the summer months much more light on average will land on your eyes because days are longer even if youre spending more time in doors on average you are going to get more light to activate these cells and because light shut's down melatone and production what you will find is that the duration of melaton and release for the pineal is much shorter melatonan is a transducer it is a communicator of how much light on average is in your physical environment what this means is for people living in the northern hemisphere your getting more melatone and release in the winter months than you are in the summer months you have a calender system that is based in a hormone and that hormone is using light in order to determine where you are in that journey around the sun now this is beautiful at least to me its beautiful because what it means is that the environment around us is converted into a signal that changes the environment within us that signal is melatonan and melatonan is well known for its roll in making us sleepy each night in allowing us to fall asleep many of you have probly heard before i am not a big fan of melatone and supplementation for a number reasons but just as a quick aside the levels of melatonan that are in most supplements are far too high to really be considered physiological they are indeed superphysiological in most cases and melatonan can have a number of different effects not just related to sleep but that is supplemented melatonan here i am talking about our natural production and release of melatonan according to where we are in the three hundred sixty five day calender year indogenous melatonan meaning the melatonan that we make within our bodies naturally not melatonin supplemented has too generalcategories of of effects the first set of effects are called regulatory effects and the others are protective effects the regulatory effects are for instance that melatonan can positively impact bone mass melatonan can for instance turn on the production of ostial blasts which are ssentially stemselves that make more bone for us that make our bone stronger and that can replace damage aspects of our bone melaton is also involved in maturation of the gonads during puberity the overies and the testies although there the effects of melaton intend to be suppressive on maturation of the overesin testies meaning high levels of melatonantend to reduce testical volume and reduce certain functions within the testis including spirn production and to stocerum production and within the overies melatonan can suppress the maturation of eggs et cetera now i do not want any one to get scared if you' been taking melatonan mosthe effects of mlatonan on those functions are reversible but i should point out that one of the reasons why children do not go into pubrity until particular age is that young children tend to have chronically high and doginists melatonan and that is healthy to keep them out of pubrty until it is the right time for pubrity to happen melatonan can increase bone mass but reduces gonad mass to speak ah it is going to have varying effects depending on the ratios and levels of other hormones and other biological events in the body but as you can see melatone has these powerful regulatory effects on other tissues i should also mention that melatonan is a powerful modulator of placental development for any one that is pregnant four considering melatonan supplementation please please please taught your obguian toctier other doctor as well you want to be very very cautious because of the powerful effects that melatonan can have on the developing feedus and plecenta for people that are not pragnant in fact all people melatonan has a powerful effect on the central nervous system as a whole your brain and final corder of the major components of your central nervous system and melatonan because its associated with darkness which is just another way of saying that light suppresses melatonan melatonan is thereby associated with the dark phase of each twenty for our cycle it can have a number of different effects in terms of waking up or making our body feel more sleepy and it does that by way of impacting cells within our nervous system literally turning on certain brain areas turning off other brain areas and it does that through a whole cascade of biological mechanisms a bit too detail to get into today melatonan is regulating how waker asleep we are intends to make us more asleep incidentally it is regulating are timing of puberty and its regulating how our gonads the testisand overeas function even in adulthood to some extent and it is regulating bone mass as a mentineformelatonian also has protective effects it can activate our mune system it is among themost potent antioxidents it is known to have certain anticancer properties and things of that sort which is not to say that you simply want more melatonan i think a lot of people get misled when they hear something melatonan has anticancer properties that does not mean that just cranking up the levels ond melatonand by supplementing it whereby spending time in darkness and noccanani light which would of course in hibit mlatonan is going to be beneficial for combating cancer that is not the way it works it is actually the rise and fall of melatonian every twenty for our cycle and the changes in the duration of that melatonents signal through out the seasons that has these anticancer and antioxiden effects when we think about light impacting our biology the reason i bring up melatonan as the primary example of that is e because melatonan impact many important functions within our brain and body but also because hormones in general not always but in general are responsible for the slow modulatory effects on our biology and amusing thes is an example of how light throughout the year is changing the way that your the different cells and tissues and organs of your body or working and that melatonan is the transducer of that signal at this point we can say light powerfully modulates melatone and meaning it shuts down melatonan mlatonan is both beneficial for certain tissues and suppressive for other tissues in functions which we do wit this information well it is very well establish now that one of the best things that we can all do is to get the proper amount of sunlight each day and by proper i mean appropriate for that time of year in the summer months where the days are longer and nights are shorter we would all do well to get more sunlight in our eyes and again it is going to be to our eyes because as you recall the pinel sits deep in the brain and light cannot access the pineal directly at least not in humanths in order to get light information to the pineal and thereby get the proper levels of melatona according to the time of year we should all trying get outside as much as possible during the long days of summer and spring and in the winter months it make sense to spend more time and doors for those of you that suffer from seasonable effective disorder which is a seasonable depression or feel lo during the fall and winter months ther ways t offset this we did entire episode on mood incircating rhythms where we describe this it does make sense for some people to get more bright light in their eyes early in the morning and throughout the day during the winter months as well but none the less changes in melatone and meaning changes in the duration of melatone and release across the year are normal and healthy provided that youare not suffering from depression it is going to be healthy to somewhat modulate your amount of indooran out door time across the year the o thing understand is this very firmly established fact which is light powerfully inhibits mlatona if you wake up in te middle of the night and you go into the bath room and you flip on the lights and those are very bright overhead florescent lights your melatoneand levels which would ordinarily be quite high in the middle of the night because you have been eyes closed in the dark presumably will immediately plumet to near zero or zero we would all do well regardless of time of year to not destroy our melatoneand in the middle of the night in this way if you need to get up in te middleof the night and use the restarum which is a perfectly normal behaviour for many people youse the minimumamount of light required in order to safely move through the environment that you need to move through melatonan needs to come on early in the night it actually starts rising in the evening and towards sleep but then as you close your eyes when you go to sleep melatonan levels are going to continue to rise at least for several hours into the night again if you get up in the middle of the night really try hard not to flip on a lot of bright lights if you do that every once in a while ats not going to be a problem but if you are doing that night after night you are really disrrupting this fundamental signal that occurs every night regardless of winter spring summer et cetera and that is communicating information about weary your brain and body should be in time and i know that is a lowle bit of a tricky concept but really our body is not meant to function in the same way during the winter months as the summer months there are functions that are specifically optumol for the shorter days of winter and there of functions that are specifically optimal for the longer days of summer again try to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night and for those of either are doing shift work what i can say is try and avoid getting bright light in your eyes in the middle of your sleep cycles even if your sleeping inthe mille the day begus have to work at night if you wake up during that bout of sleep really try hard to limit the amount of light which is goin to be harder for shift workers right because theire generally lotmore lights on and bright lights outside to you would want o close the blinds and limit artificial light inside one way to buy past some of the in hibatory effects of light on meletonan is to change your physical environment by for instance dimming the lights that is one simple way very low costwayinfact you will save money by doming the lights are turning them off the other is if you are going to use light using long wave lenth light because as you recall these intrinsically photosensitive melonops and cells within your retna that convey the signal about bright light in your environment to impact meletonan to shut down meletonan respond a short wavelengths of light red light is long wave length light you now understand that from our discussion about the physics of light and if you were to use amber colored light or red light and even better dim amber or dim red light in the middle of the night will then you would probably not reduce meletonan at all unless those red lights in amberlights are very very bright any light provided its bright enough will shut down meletone and production one final point about mletonan and this relates to meletonand supplementation as well is that now that you understand how potently meletonan can impact things carivascular function an mun function anticantsor properties bone mass gonad function et cetera ou can understand why it would make sense to be cautious about meloetonand supplementation because supplementation tends to be pretty static it is ex number of melograms per night whereas normally in dogenously the amount of meletonean that your releasing each night is changing according to time of year or if you happen to live in an area where there is not much change in daylength across the year frincsance if you live near the equater well then your body is a custom to having regular amounts of meletonan each night when you start supplementing meletonan you start changing the total amount of meletonan obviously but your also changing the normal rhythms in how much meletonan its being released into your brain and body across the three hundred sixty five day calender year well i'm somebody who readily embrace a supplementation in various forms for things sleep and fokus et cetera when it comes to meletonan i'm extremely cautious and i think it is also one of the few examples where a hormone is available without prescription ov r the countiy i ust goingto a farmesseor drugstore order on line this hormone which is known to have all these powerful effects i get very very concerned when i hear about people taking melatone especially at the levels that are present in most supplements it is been recognized for a very long time and effect there are now data to support the fact that animals of all kinds including humans will seek out mates and engage in mating behavior more frequently during the long days of spring and summer that is right in seasonly breeding animals of course this is the case but in humans as well there is more seeking out of mates and mating behavior in longer day times of year now you could imagine at least to mechanisms by which this occurs the first mechanism we could easily map to melatonan and the fact that melatonan is suppressive to various aspects of the called gonatel axis which is basely a fancyway of saying that melatonan inhibits testostrone and estrogen output from the testes and from the overies i just one o remind people that both males and females make teststrone and estrogen although in different ratios typically in males versus females and that both testostrone and estrogen are critical for the desire tomate and formating behavior e's broad misconception that testosterone is involved in mating behavior and estrogen's involved another behaviors but having enough estrogen is critical for both males and females in order to maintain the desire to mate and indeed the ability to mate i discuss this on the episode on optimizing testostrone and estrogen f you more details on that plesee that episode of the hubermanladpotcast o ketso if melatonan is suppressive to the called gonatelaxis and reduces over all levels of testostrone and estrogen in males and females and a light inhibits melatonan than when there is moreallight than there is less melatonan and more hormone output from the gonats and indeed that is how the system works but that is not the entire story it turns out that there is a second called parallel pathway meaning a different biological pathway that operates in parallel to the light suppression of melatonan pathway that provides a basis for longer days inspiring more desire to mate and mor mating behavior if we think of the first pathway involving melatonan as sort of a brate on these reproductive hormones the second mechanism is more an accelerator on those hormones and yet it still involves light as i'm about to tell you in animals such as mice but also in humans exposure to light in particular uv blue lights short wavelengths of light can trigger increases in testostrone and estrogen and the desire to mate now what is especially important about this accelerator on the desire to mate and mating behavior and h rmons is that it is driven by exposure to light but it is not the exposure of light to the ize it turns out that it is the exposure of your skin to particular wave lengths of light that its triggering increases in the hormon's testastrone and esterogen leading to increase desire to mate as it turns out your skin which most of us just think of as a way to protect the organs of our body or something to hang close on or ornaments on if you re somebody who has earrings and forth your skin is actually an endecrin organ meaning it is a hormone producing and hormon influencing organ i promise what i am about to tell you next will for ever change the way that you think about your skin and light and the desire to mate and indeed even mading behavior i think the results are best understood by simply going through the primary data meaning the actual research on this topic and to do i am going to review a recent paper that was published in the journal sell reports sell press journal excellent journal this is a paper that came out in twenty twenty one entitled skin exposure to u v b light induces a skin brain gonad axis and sexual behavior and i want to emphasize tat this was a paper that focused on mice in order to address specific mechanisms because in mice you can calle knock out particular genes you can remove particular genes to understand mechanism you discant do that in humans in any kind of controlled way least not at this point in time and this study also explorers humans and looked at human subjects both men and women the basic finding of this study was that when mice or humans were ix posed to u v b meaning ultra violet blue lights a short wave length light of the sort that comes through in sunshine but is also available through various artificial sources if they received enough exposure of that light to their skin there were increases in testasterone that were observed within a very brief period of time also increases in the hormon estrogen and i shall point out that the proper ratios of estergen and testastrone were maintained in both males and females at least as far as these data indicate and mice tended to seek out mading more and mate more there were also increases in gonatel weight literally increases in testy size and in o verian size when mice were exposed to this u v b light passed a certain threshold now as i mention before the study also lookd at humans they did not look at testy size or ovarian size in the human subjects however because they are humans they did address the psychology of these human beings and address whether or not they had increases in for instance aggressiveness or in passionate feelings and how their pers eption of other people changed when they were getting a lot of u v b light exposure to the skin before i get into some of the more important details of the study and how it was done and how you can leverage this information for yourself if yu desire i just wone a high light some of the basic findings over all u v v exposure increased these called sex steroid levels in mice and humans the sexstoryed hormones when we say steroids we do not mean anabolic steroids take n exogenously i think when pe will hear the word steroids they always think steroid abuse or use rather sterid hormons such as testasteron and esterogen went up when micer humans had a lot of u v b exposure to their skin second of all u v v light exposure to the skin enhanced female attractiveness o the perceived attractiveness of females by males and increased the receptiveness or the desire to mate in both sexes u v v light exposure also changed various aspects of female biology related to fertility in particular folical growth folical and eg maturation are well known indicese of fertility and of course correlate with the menstrual cycle in adul humans and is related over all to the propensity to b come pregnant u v v light exposure enhanced maturation of the pholical which just meant that more healthy egs were being produced these are impressive effects first of all they looked at a large number of variables in the study and the fact that they looked at mice and humans is terrific i think that oftentimes we find it hard to translate data from mice to humans to the fact that they looked at both in parallel is wonderful in the mice and in the humans they established a protocal that essentially involved exposing the skin to u v light that was equivalent to about twenty to thirty minutes of midday sun exposure now of course where you live in the world will dictate whether not that midday sun is very very bright and intens or is less brights maybe there is cloud cover at cetera but since imagine that most people are interested in ways to increase testasteron and or estrogen in humans and are not much interested in increasing tesastron in mice i 'm going to just re view what they did in the human population or the human subjects whut they did is they had people first of all establish a baselineand the way they establish a baseline was eloveid unusual but will make perfect sense to you they had people wear long sleeves and essentially cover up and avoid sunlight for a few days they could measure their baseline hormones in the absence of getting a lot of u v b light exposure from the sun or from other sources now of course these people had access to artificial lights but as i've pointed o on this podcast before it is pretty unusual that you will get enough u v b exposure from artificial lights throughout the day and in the morning you need a lot of u v b exposure or we should be getting a lot of u v b exposure to our eyes and to our face into our skin throughout the day provided were not getting sunburnt this is actually a healthy thing for mood and for energy throughout the day it is only at night thay stialy betwen the hours of about ten p m and for a m that even a tiny bit of u v b exposure from artificial sources can mess us up in terms of oure sleep in our energy levels and on and that is because of the potent effect of u v b on suppressing melatonan the point here is that they establish a baseline whereby people were getting some artificial light exposure troughout the day but they were not getting outside a lot they were not getting a lot of sunlight and then they had people receive a dose of u v b light exposure that was about twenty to thirty minutes outdoors they had people weare short sleeves no hat no sunglasses some peple wore sleeveless shirts they encourage people to wear shorts they were indeed wearing clothing they were not naked and they were wearing clothing that was culturally and situationally appropriate at least for the part of the world where the study was done nd they had people do that two or three times a week in terms of a protocall that you might export from the study basely getting outside for about thirty minutes two or three times a week in a minimum of clothing and yet still a wearing enough clothing that is culturally appropriate they were outside they were not sun bathing flipping over on their back in front they we just moving about doing things they could read they could talk they could go about other activities but they were not wearing a broad brim hat or a hat of any kind just getting a lot of sun exposure to their skin they did this for a total of ten to twelve u v b treatments thas took several weeks it took about a month if you think about it two or three times for week for total often to twelve u v b treatments these treatments gors are just being outside in the sun and then they measured hormones and they measured the psychology of these male and female adult subjects let us first look at the psychological changes that these human subjects experience after getting ten to twelve of these u v v light exposure outdoor ind sunlight typt treatments they did this by collecting blood samples throughout the study and they saw significant increases in the hormones bata estradial which is one of the major forms of estergen porgesteron another important stirwad hormon and testasteron in both men and women now an important point is that the testostron increases were significantly higher in men that happened to originate from countries that had low u v exposure compared to individuals from contries with high u v exposure now this ought to make sense if we understand a little bit about how the skin functions as an endercron organ many of you have probably heard of vitem in d three which is a videmen that we all make many people supplemented as well if they need additional vitemen d three we all require sunlight in order to a low vitem in d three to be symthesized and perform its rolls in the body and it turns out that people who have darker skin actually need more vitem in d thre and or more sunlight exposure in order to activate that d three pathway then do people with paler skin and this should make sense to all of you given what you now understand about milanicites that seltite that we discast earlier because milaniites have pigment within them and if you hve darker skin it means thet you have more malanicites or that you have milanicites that er more efficient at creating pigment and as a consequence the light that lands on your skin will be absorbed by those milanicites and less of it is able to impact the d three pathway whreas if you have pale skin more of the light that lands on your skin can trigger the synthesis and assist the actions of itemen d three similarly in this study they found that people who had paler skin and or who originated from countries where they had less u v b light exposure across the year had greater meaning more significant increases in testostrne over all than did people who already were getting a lot of u b b exposure this led them to explorer called seasonal changes in testostrone that occurred normally in the absence of any light exposure treatment up until now i've been talking bout the aspects of thes study involving people getting outside for about twenty to thirty minutes per day in sunlight in a minimum of clothing there was an increase in testostrone observed in both men and women the increases in teststrone were greater for people that had paler skin than darker skin the data i'm about to describe also come from this same paper but do not involve twenty to thirty minute daily sun exposure protocals it simply addressing wheather not testosterone levels change as a function of time of year they measure testostrone across the twelvemonth calender this study was done on subjects living in the northern hemisphere for the entire year and in the months of january febrary march of course the length of days is shortest and the length of nights is longest and of course in the spring and summer months june july august september and on the days are much longer n the nightes are shorter and what they observed was very obvious they observed that testostrone levels were lowest in the winter months and were highest in the months of june july august in september now these are very important data lease to my knologis are the first data systematically exploring the levels of sextroid hormones in humans as a function of time of year and thereby as a function of how much sunlight exposure their getting and what is remarkable about these data is that they map very well to the data and mice and the other data in this paper on humans which illustrate that if you'r getting more u v b exposure your testostron levels are higher this study when a step further and explored whether not the amount of sunlight exposure that one is getting to their skin influences their psychology in terms of whether not they have increased desire to mate and on it is well known that sunlight exposure to the eyes can increase mood and i talked about this in the podcas episode with my gues doctor samer hotar whose the director of the cronobilgy unit of the natiunal institutes a mental health and sammer's recommendation is that people get as much bright light exposure as they safely can in the morning and throughout the day for sake of both sleep and energy but also for inhancing mood and regulating appetite in this study it was found that both males and females had higher levels of romantic passion after getting the u v treatment in fact some of them reported increases in romantic passion from just one or two of these u v treatments they did not have to go through all ten or twelve in order to get a statistically significant increase in passion now when we tulk about passion as the authors of this paper acknowledge there is really two forms there is emotional and sexual and they parcs this pretty finely i do not ant to go into all the details and we can provide a reference in linkto the study if you to look at those detailts but what they found was that women receiving this u v v light exposure fokcassed more on increases in physical arousal and psexual passion whereas the men actually scored higher on the cognitive dimensions of passion such as obsessive thoughts about their partner and on regardless both males and females experienced and reported a increase in psecual passion and desire to mant and we now know there were increases in testastrone and estrogen which of course could be driving the psychological changes although i'm sure that those interact in both directions meaning the hormons no doubt affect psychology and no doubt the psychology these changes in passionate feelings no doubt also increased or change the hormon levels as well and i want a re emphasize that there was a component of the study that had no deliberate daylight sunlight exposure for twenty or thirty minutes but rather just looked at hormon levels throughout the year and found that the increase in daylength correlated with ncreases in testastrone and sexual passion now my opinion this is a very noteworthy study because itreally illustrates that sunlight and daylength can impact the melatonan pathway and thereby take the foot off the break to speak on testostron estrogen and the desire to mate it also emphasizes that sunlight u v v light can directly trigger hormon pathways and desire to mate and mading behavior now the study when a step further indefining the precise mechanism by which light can impact all these hormones and this desire to mate and here understanding the mechanism is key if you want to export a particular protocol or tool that you might apply we talked earlier about how u v v light exposure to the eyes trigger's activation of these particular nurons within the eye and then with centers deeper in the brain and eventually the pineo gland to suppress the output on melotonan and thereby to allow testastrone and estrogen to exist at higher levels because melatonan can inhibit testastrone and estrogen in this study they were able to very clearly established that it is sunlight exposure to our skin that is causing these harmone increases that they observed in mice in humans the way they did that was to use these called knockout technology the ability to remove specific genes within specific tissues of the body and what they found is that u v b light meaning sunlight exposed skin upregulated meaning increase the activity of something called p fifty three which is involved in the maturation of cells and various aspects of cellar function and the cells they were focused on were the coratinosites which you are now familiar with from our earlier discussion about the fact that the epidermus of your skin contains mainly corratnosites and milanosites sunlight exposure increased p fifty three activity in the skin and p fifty three activity was required for the down stream increases in ovarian size in testicular size ind testastrone increases in the esterogen increases and the various other changes that they observed at the physiological level when animals are humans were exposed to sunlight these day are important because what they mean is that not only is it important that we get sunlight exposure early in the day and throughout the day to our eyes at least as much as is safely possible but that we also need to get u v b sunlight exposure on to our skin if we want to activate this p ft three pathway in corratnosites and the testosterone and estrogen increases that are downstream of that p fifty three pathway even though the ge knockout studies were done on mice they clearly show that if you remove p fifty three from the skin that these effects simply do not occur in terms of thinking about a protocall to increase testastrone and estrogen mood and feelings of passion the idea is that you would want to get the two to three exposures per week minimum of twenty to thirty minutes of sunlight exposure on to as much of your body as you can reasonably expose it to n i say reasonably i mean of course you have to obey cultural constraints decency constraints a and of course you have to also obey the fact that sunlight can burn your skin many people are probably going to ask what happens if you wear sunscreen but in theory because sunscreen has u v protection it would block some of these effacts now not suggesting that people do away with sunscreen entirely i do hope to do an episode all about sunscreen in the future because sunscreen is a bit of a controversial topic skin cancers are a real thing and many people are especially prone to skin cancers o un ng to take that seriously some people are not very prone to skin cansers and can tolerate much more sun exposure youe probably familiar with the simple fact that if you gone outside on the beach with friends some people get burned very easily others do not you really should prioritize the health and the avoidance of sunburn on your skin however these data and other data point to the fact that we should all probably be striving to get more sunlight exposure on to our skin during the winter months end still getting sunlight exposure on to our skin in the summer months provided we can do that without damaging our skin another set of very impressive effacts of u v v light whether not comes from sunlight or from an artificial source is the effect of u v b light on our tolerance for pain it turns out that our tolerance for pain varies across the year end that are pain tolerance is increased in longer day conditions end as we saw with the effects of u v b on hormons and mading again this is occurring via u v b exposure to the skin n u v b exposure to the eyes one just described two studies that really capture the essence of these results i'm going to discuss these in kind of a top contour fashion i will not gonto it is quite as much depth as i did the last study but i will provide links to these studies as well the first study is entitled skin exposure to ultra violet b rapidly act ofa systemic nura endercran and a munisuppressive responses you might hear that an think oh munisuppress of that is bad but basically what they observed is that even one exposure to u v b light change the output of particular hormons and naurow chemicals in the body such as corticatropenhormon and bata in dorphans which are these indogenous opioids we have all heard of the opioid crisis which is people getting addicted to opioids that they are taking in drug form farmasuticles but here i'm referring to indorphans that our body naturally manufactures and releases in order to counter pain and act as a somewhat of a psychological soother also because of course physical pain and emotional pain are intimately linked in the brain and body but they found was that exposure to u v b light increased the release of these bata and dorphans it cause essentially the release of an indogenis pain killer now a second study that came out very recently just this last week in fact publishin the journal nuron sell press journal excellent journal is entitled a visual circuit related to the periaqueductal grey area for the anti nocosceptive effects ofe bright light treatment i'll translate a lowbit of that for you the periaqueductal gray is a region of the mid brain that contains a lot of nurons that can release indogenius opioits things bata and kephelin things and kephelin things mu opioi these are all names of chemicals that your body can manufacture the act as indogenous pain killers and increase your tolerance for pain the actually make you feel less pain over all by shutting down some of the nurons that perceive pain or by reducing their activity not to a dangerous level night the're not in a block the pain response that you burn yourself unnecessarily or harm yourself unnecessarily but they act as a bit of a pain killer from the inside if you heard the word antinosusceptive noseception is basically the perception or the way in which nuron's respond to painful stimuli you can think of nosusceptive events in your nervous system as painful events and there a musing abroad brush i realize that the experts and pain will say oh it is not of really a pain circuit et ceter et cetera but for sake of to day's discussion it is fair to say that nosusception is the perception of pain if this title is avisual circuit related to the pariocuoductal grey which is this area that releases these indoges opiois for the antinosuseptive the anti pain effects of bright light treatment the key finding of this study is that it is light landing on the eyes and captured by the specific cells i was talking bout earlier those intrinsically photosensive melonopsand ganglean cells is he long name for them but these particular nods in your eye end in my eye incidentally that communicate with particular brain areas these brainairs have names if you wantonow them for you ifphysionatos are for you ultrocurious folks they have names the ventural lateral geniculate nucleous ind the introgeniculate leflet the names do not matter the point is that light landing on the eyes is captured by these melonopsin cells they absorbed that light translate that light into electrical signals that are handed off to areas of the brain such as the ventural geniculate and then the ventual geniculat communicates with this pariociductal grey area to evoke the reliese of these indogenous opioids that soothe you and lead to less perception of pain this is a really important study because it is long been known that in longer days or in bright light environments we tolerate emotional and physical pain better previous studies had shown that it is light landing on our skin that mediates that effect but only in part it could not explain the entire effect this very recent study indicates that it is also light arriving at the eyes an in this case again ou v b light ultraviolet boulight of the sort that come from sunlight that is triggering these anti pain or pain relieving pathways once again we have two parallel pathways is is he theme you are going here over and over and over again not just in this episode but in all episodes of the huburman lapatcas because this is the way that your brain and body are built nature rarely relies on one mechanism in order to create an important phenomenon and pain relief is an important phenomenon we now have at least to examples of the potent effects of yu b b light exposure to the skin and to the eyes one involving activation of tostastrone and estrgen pathways as it relates to mating and another that relates to reducing the total amount of pain that we experience in response to any painful stimulae for those of you there thinking tools and protocols if you are somebody whose experiencing chronic pain provided you can do it safely try to get some you v b exposure i dly from sunlight i think the twenty of thirty minute protocol two or three times per week is an excellent one seems a fairly low dose of yu v b light exposure it is hard to imagine getting much damage to the skin of course of you have very sensitive skin or if you live in an area of the world that is very very bright en has intens sunlight particular times of year you will want to be cautious he the warnings in considerations about sunscream that i talked about earlier or about wearing a hat but the point is very clear most of us should be getting more u v b exposure from sunlight i can already hear the screams within the comments or the rather the questions within the comment sayingle wold if i live in a part of the world where i do not get much u v b exposure and i want to emphasize something that i've also emphasize in the many discussions on this potcast related to sleep and circadian rhythms an alertness which is even on a cloud covered day you are going to get far more light energy photons through cloud cover then you are going to get from an indoor light source an artificial light source i cannot emphasize this enough i you look outside in the morning and you see some sunlight if you see some sunlight throughout the day you would do yourself a great favor to trying chase some of that sunlight and get into that sunlight to expose your eyes and your skin to that sunlight as much as you safely can an when i say as much as you safely can never ever look at any light artificial sunlight or otherwise that bright that its painful to look at it is fine to get that light arriving on your eyes indirectly it is fine to wear eye glasses or contact lendses in fact if you think about the biology of the eye and the way that those lendss work that will just served to focus that light on to the very cells that you want those light beams to b delivered to whereas sunglasses that are highly reflective or trying to get your sunlight exposure through a win shield of a car or through a window simply will not work i'm sorry to tell you but most windows are desing to filter out the u v b light and if you'r somebody whose really keen on blue blockers and your wearing your blue blockers all day well do not wear them outside and in fact you are probably doing yourself a disservice by wearing them in the morning and in the daytime there certainly as a place for blue blockers in the evening and night time if your having issues with falling in staying asleep but if you think about it blue blockers whith thee really doing is blocking those short wave length u v b wavelengths of light that you desperately need to arrive at your ret in a and of course also on to your skin in order to get these powerful biological effects on hormones and on pain reduction and in terms of skin exposure these data also might make you think a little bit about whether or not you shold where short sleeves or longsleeves whether not you want to wear shorts ar a skirit or pants it is all going to depend on the contects of your life and the social and other variables that are important of course i do not know each in every one of your circumstances i cannot tell you to do ex or why or s a nor would i but you might take into consideration that it is the total amount of skin exposure that is going to allow you to capture more or fewer fotanths depending on for instance if your completely cloaked in clothing in your just you now exposed in the hands o neck and face such as i am now or whether not your outside in short sin a teshirt you are going to get very very different patterns of biological signaling activation in those two circumstances many of you i'm guessing are wondering whether or not you should seek out yu v b exposure throughout the entire year only in the summer months and that sort of going to depend on whether or not you experience depression in the winter months calld seasonal effective disorder some people have milds some people have severe forms of seasonal effect ive disorder some people love the fall in winter and the shorter days they love bundling oup they love the leaves they love the snow they love the coald than they do not experience of psychological lot it veryes tremendously and there are gunetic differences and a birthplace origin differences that relates all this but really it has to be considered on a case by case basis i personally believe and this was reinforced by the director of the chondr chronobilogy unit the national institutes a mental health samrtar that we would all do well to get more u v exposure from sunlight throughout the entire year provided we are not burning our skin or damaging our eyes in some way in addition to that during the winter months if you do experience some drop in energy or increase in depression or psychological loads it can be very beneficial to access a sad lamp or if you do not want to by a sad lamp cas oftentimes that can be very expensive you might do well to simply get a elly d lighting panel iave described one before and i want emphasize that i have no a filiation whatsoever to these commercial sources but ihave described one before andall describe it again and we conpride a a link to a couple examples of these in the show no an the show note caption cuse me this is a nine hundred and thirty to thousand locks elux light source that is design for drawing it is at liry a drawing box as a thin panels about the size of a lap top very inexpensive compared to the typical sad lamp i shuld have when i position on my desk all day long i also have at hve skylights above my desk i'm pfairly sensitive to the effects of light in longer days i feel much better than i do in shorter days i've never suffered from full blown seasonal effective disorder but i keep th hat light source on throughout the day throughout the year but i also make it appoint to get outside and get sunlight early in the morning at several times throughout the day and if it is particularly overcast outside or there just does not seem to be a lot of sunlight coming through those clouds i will try to look at that light source a little bit more each day in order to trigger these mechanisms now some people may desire to get u v b exposure to their skin and they want to do that through sources other than sunlight and there it is a litebate more complicated there are of course canning selons which basically are beds of u v b light that is really all they are a never been to one i know people do frequent them in certain parts of the world there of course people are covering their eyes they are only getting u v b exposure to their skin typically because the u v b exposure or intensities rather tens to be very very high and you can nachly damage your eyes if your looking at a very very bright artificial u v b source up close you really have to explore these options for yourself sonlight of course being the original and a still the best way to get u v b exposure without knowing your particular circumstances finances genetics or place of origin et scetera i cannot know whether not you need to use artificial sources you are going to have to gage that meanwhile getting outside looking at and getting some exposure of u v b on to your skin is going to beneficial for the vast majority of people out there and in fact it is even going to beneficial for people that are blind people that are blind provided they still have eyes often maintain these melonops and sells even if your low vision or no vision getting u v b exposure to your eyes can be very beneficial for sake of mood hormon pathways pain reduction and forth a cautionary note people who have retnight is pigmentosa macular degeneration or glaucoma as well as people who are especially prone to skin cancers should definilly consult with your opthemologists and dermatologists before you start increasing the total amount of u v b exposure that you are getting from any source sunlight or otherwise there are additional very interesting and powerful effects of u v b light in particular on a mun function all the organs of our body are inside our skin and information about external conditions meaning the environment that were in need to be communicated to the various organs of our body some of them have more direct access to what is going on outside for instance the sells in your brain that reside right over the roof of your mouth your hypothalmas that contral hormonout put and then control the biological functions that we call circadian functions the one that change every twenty four hours well those are just one or to connections meaning scynaps is away from those sells in your eye that perce vu v u v v light scuse me other organs of your bodyes such as your spleen which is involved in the creation of molecules and cells that combat infection well those are a long ways away from those cells in your eynd in fact there long ways away from your skin there are beautiful studies showing that if we get more u v b exposure from sunlight or from appropriate artificial sources that splen and ammune function are enhanced and there is a very logical well established circuit as to how that happens your brain actially connects to your spleen now it is not the case you cans simply think o case spleen turn on release killer cells go out in combat infection however yu v b light arriving on the eyes is known to trigger activation of the nurons within the called sympathetic nervous system these nurons are part of the larger thing that we call the autonomic nervous system meaning its below or not accessible by conscious control s the thing that controls your heart beat controls your breathing and that also activates are flips on the s switch of your immune system when we get a lot of u v b light in our eyes or i shoulds a sufficient yu v b light in our eyes a particular channel a particular set of connections within the sympathetic nervous system is activated and our spleen deploys immune cells and molecules that scavange for and combat infection if youv notice that you get fewer colds and flues and other forms of illness in the summer months part of that could b because of the increase in temperature in your environment because typically longer days are associated with more warmth in your environment suppose tof winter days which are short whenthend to be colder out well that is true but it is also the case the people around you have fewer colds in flues and that you will get infected with fewer colds and flues and other infections because if those infections whether not their bacterial or viral arrive in your body right if you inhal them or they get in your mouth or on your skin your spleen meets those infections with a greater output in other words the soldiers of your mune system the chemicals and cell tipes of yourmune system that combat infection are in a more ready deployed stance if you will ifyou anet to no more about the immune system and immune function i did not entire episode about the imune system and the brain in a you can find that at huberman labed ot colme talk about sight of kinds we talk about killer cells becells decells et cetera a lot of detail there we often thing about the summer months and the spring months ays fewer infections floating around but in fact there are not fewer infections floating around we are simply better at combating those infections and therefore there is less infection floating around we are still confronted with a lot of infections were just able to combat them better what does this mean in terms of a tool what it means is that during the winter months we should be especially conscious of accessing u v b light to enhance or spleen function to make sure that our sympathetic nervous system is activated to a sufficient level to keep our immune system deploying all those killer teacells and b cells an side of kinds that when we encounter the infections as we inevitably will right were constantly being bombarded with potential infections that we can combat those infections well and as just a brief acide but i should mention a brief acide that is related to tens of thousands of quality studies it is well known that wound healing is faster when we are getting sufficient u v b exposure typically that is associated with the longer days of spring in summer it is known that turn over of hair cells the very cells that give riyes to hairscells are called stemcells they live in little calld niches in our skin with these hair stemcells and your hair grows faster in longer days that too is triggered by u v b exposure not just as the skin but to the eyes that is right thereras a study polish in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences couple of years ago that showe that the exposure of those melenops and ganglancells in your eyes is absolutely critical for triggering the turn over of stemcells in both the skin and hair and also turns out in nails if you have noticed that your skin your hair and your nails look better and turn over more meaning grow faster in longer days that is not a coincidence that is not jus your perception in fact hair grows more skin turns over more meaning it is going to look more youthful your senches remove older skinsells are replace thm with nuwse sells and all the renewing sells and tissues of our body are going to proliferate are going to recreate themsells more when we are getting sufficient u v b liht to our eyes and also to our skin and well some of you may think of light therapes such as red light therapes are u v b therapes as kind of new ag or just biohacking again a phrase i do not particularly this notion of biohacking cause it implies using one thing for a purpose that it was never intended to have well it turns out that u v b exposure an red light as we will soon see is a very potent form of increasing things wound healing in skin health for very logical mechanistically backe reasons while i cannot account for everything that is being promoted out there an terms of this light source will hep your skin look more youthful or help omhealior scars the mechanistic basis for light having those effects makes total sense but what you should consider however is that if the particular light therape that youre considering involves very local application rather than illuminating broad swaths of skin and if it has no involvement with the eyes meaning there is no delivery of u v b or red light or the other light therapy to the eyes it is probably not going to be as potent a treatment as would and more systemic activation of larger areas of skind and the eyes now again a cautionary note i do not want people taking technologies that were designe for local application and beaming those into the eyes that could be very very bad in damaging to your retinal and other tissues certainly when one you taking bright light of very high intensity of any kind and getting cavalier about that typically the local illumination of say a wound or particular patch of acny or some other of form of skin treatment involves very high intensity light and if the intensity is too high you can atually damage that skin and as will talk about in a few moments most of those therapies for modifying skin involve actually burning off a small very thin layer at the top of the epidermis in efforts to trigger the renewal or the activation fe stemcells that will replenish that with new cells there is a fine line to be had between light therapies that are very localized and intense which are designed to damage skin and cause reactivation of new stemcells e there not taircells or skin cells et cetera verses systemic activation across broad swaths of skin in the eyes really have to consider this on a case by case basis but at least for now just consider that increases in hormones reduction in pain by way of increases in and kefflin annother indogionous opioids improving immune status by activating the spleen and on and on really are all the downstrom consequence of illuminating large swaths of skin and making sure that those nurons and within the eyet get their adequate u v b exposure or other light wave length exposure not simply beaming a particular wave length of light at a particular location on the body and hoping that that particular illumination at a particular location on the body is going to somehow change the biology at that location our biologies just really does not work that way it is possible but in general systemic effects through broadscale llumination and illumination to the eye combined with local treatments are very likely to be the ones that have the most success now i to shift our attention to the effects of light on mood more specifically we talked about this interms of seasonal effective disorder but many of us do not suffer from seasonl effect of disorder i to drill ill deeper into how light impacts mood and here i want to again peraphrase the statements of doctor samerhitar at the natiunal institutes a mental health i shuld mention the director of the chronobile junit at the natuonal institutes a mental health and perhaps one of the top one to two to three world experts and how light can impact mood appetit circatiang rhythms and forth samer stated on the podcas and he said in various other ven us as well thet getting as much u v v light in our eyes and on our skin in the early day in throughout the day as a safely possible is going to be beneficial for mood there is also another time of day or rather i should say a time of night in which u v v can be leveraged in order to improve mood but it is actually the inverse of everything weve ben talking about up until now we have a particular noral circuit that originates with those melenops and cells in our eye that by paths all thet areas the brain associate with circadian clocks everything relate to sleep in wakefulness thats specifically dedicated to the pathways involving the release of molecules dopomi the nuromagulator that is associate with motivation with feeling good with feeling there is possibility in the world and on and forth another molecules as well including ceretonan and some of those in dogens opioids that we talked about before that particular pathway involves a brain structure called the perry hobenular nuclius the peryhobenular nuclius gets in put from the cells in the eye that respond to u v v light and frankly to bright light of other wavelings as well as as you recall if a light is bright enough even if its not u v or blue light it can activate those sells in the eye those sells in the eye communicate to the pery hobenular nuclius and as it turns out if this pathway is activated at the wrong time of each twenty four hours pcycle mood gets worse doomine output gets worse molecules that are there specifically to make us feel good actually are reduced in their output while u v v exposure in the morning and throughout the day is going to be very important for it elevating and maintaining elevated mood avoiding u v v light at night is actually a way in which we can prevent activation of this i to peryhobenular pathway that can actually turn on depression to be very direct and sussinct about this avoid exposure to u v v light from artificial sources between the hours of ten p m and four a m and if your somebody who suffers from low mood and over all has a n of mild depression or even severe depression of course please see a psychotrist see a trained psychologist get that treated but you would do especially well to avoid u v v exposure from artificial sources not just from ten p m defor a m but really be careful about getting too much exposure to u v v even in the late evening eight p m perhaps to four a m i cannot emphasize this enough that if you vu u v v light you activate those nurons in your eye very potently and if those cells communicate to the peryhobenular nucles which they do you will truncate or reduce the amount of dopoming that you release if you want to keep your mood elevated get a lot of light yu v b light throughout the day and at night really be cautious about getting yu v b exposure from artificial sources now let say your somebody who has no issues with mood you are just the happiest person all year long or maybe you just have subtle a variations in your mood you feel great about that turns out that you still want to be very careful about light exposure be tween the hours of ten piamrso and for a m in fact even during sleep there is a recent study that just came out in the prosceeds in the national academy of sciences and it is entitled light exposure juering sleep in pairs cardio metabolic function this is a very interesting study where they took human subjects young adults and having them sleep in rooms that had different lighting conditions either dim light or slightly bright light now many people cannot fall asleep in brightly lit rooms they acknowledge this these were not very brightly lit rooms these were rooms that had just a little bit of overhead room lighting a hundred lucks which is not very bright at all or they had them sleep in a room that had very dim light which is less than three lucks if you want to get a sense of how bright three lucks is versees a hundred lucks i would encourage you to download the free ap light meater i have no relationship to the ap it is a pretty cool lap however i've used it for a long time where you can basely point your phone ad a particular light source sun or otherwise and you just press the buttony will give you an approximate read out of lucks which is the light intensity that the phone happens to be staring out at at that location it is not exact but it is a pretty good back of the envelope measure of light ntensity these subjects were either sleeping in a very dim room three lucks is very very dim or a somewhat dim room a hundred lucks in this study they measured things melatone an levels they looked at heart rate they looked at measures of insolent and glucos management now in previous episodes i've talked about how glucos blood sugar is regulated by insolen because you do not want your glucos levels to be too high hyperoglicemia or too low hypoglicemia and the harmon insolent is involved in sequestering and shudtling glucos in the blood stream thesically how well you manage glucos in the blood stream can be indirectly measured by your insolent levels and it is well known that sleep deprovation can disrupt glucos regulation by insolent however in this study subjects were sleeping the whole night through it just happens that some of the subjects were sleeping in this very dimly lit room three lucks and other subjects were sleeping in a somewhat dimly lit room a hundred lucks what is incredible about this study is that both rooms were sufficiently dim that melitone levels were not altered in either case this is really key it is not as if one group experienced a lot of bright light through their eyelids and others did not melatone levels were not destrupted and given ow potently light can inhibit melotonan this speaks to the fact that this very dim condition of three lucks and the somewhat dim condition of a hundred lucks was not actually perceived by the subjects nor was it distrupting these hormone pathways they also looked at glucos's response as they had people essentually take a fasting glucos test in different conditions i will not go into all the details but heare's what they found in healthy adults even just one night of sleeping in a moderately lit environment this hundred lucks environment caused changes increases in night time heart rate which means that the sympathetic nervous system was overly active as compared to people thit slept in a completely dark or in a very very dimly lit room decreases n heart rate variability and here i should point out that heartrate variability or each our v is a good thing we want heartrate veriability they saw increases in heart rate decreases in heart rate variability and increases in next morning insolent resistance which is an indication that glucos management is suffering this is powerful the results of this study essentially indicate that even just one night of sleeping the whole night through in a dimly lit environment is desrrupting the way that our autonomic nervous system is functioning altering called autonomic tone making us less relaxed is probably the best way to describe it even though we are sleep disrrupting the way that are cardio metabolic function operates such that we have lower heartrate variability and increased insolent resistance this is not a good thing for any of us to experience while we have mainly been talgking bout the possive effects of u v v light and other forms of light now we have two examples one from the work of hotar and collye showing that u v b exposure viathe parihobenula can diminish the output of dopomine and other molecules that make us feel good if that u v b exposures in the middle of the night or late evening and now we have yet another study performed in this case inhumans indicating that even if we fall asleep and sleep the whole night through if the room that were sleeping in has too many lucks too much light energy that light energy is no doubt going through the eyelids which it can activating the particular cells in the eye that trigger in increase in sympathetic nervous system activation and desrrupting our metabolism and this study rests on a number of other recent studies published in cell which is a superb journal and other journ showing that during the course of a healthy deep night sleep our body actually transitions through various forms of metabolic function we actually experience keetosist's states we experience gluconeogenesis we experience different forms of metabolism associate with different stages of sleep not something that were going into indepth in this potcast we will in a future potcast what this study shows is that light exposure even in sleep is diserupting or autonomic in this case the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system in ways that are diserrupting metabolism probably in sleep but certainly outsiht of sleep we wake up and have our first meal of the day or even if your intrmentin fasting you eat that first meal of the day if your sleep is taking place in an environment that is overly illuminated well that is desrrupting your cardiac function and your metabolism i've been talking a lot about u v b light which is short wave length light uvy light blue light may beven some blue green light that is can be short wavelength light now i to shift our attention to the other end of the spectra meaning the light spectrum to talk about red light and impher red light which is a long wave length light many called low level light therapies the acranym is l l l t low level light therapies involve the use of red light and imfered light sometimes low level light therabes involve the use of u v b but more often than not these days when we hear ele lelty low level light therapy it is referring to red light and near imfor red light therapies low levl light therabes have been shown to be effective for a huge number of biological phenomenon and medical treatments i cannot summerize all of those now it would take me many many hours be an effective episode for curing insomnia but it would not inform you properly about the use of light for your health rather i to jist emphisize some of the top contour of those studies and point out that for instance low level light thereabe with impred light has been shown to be effective for the treatment of acney and other sorts of skin lesions been some really nice studies actually where they use subjects as their own internal control people who believe it are not agree to have half of their face illuminated with red light or near infored light and the other half of their face serve as a control and to do that for several weeks at a time and you can see pretty impressive reductions in skin lesions reductions in scars from acney and reduction in acney leisions themselves meaning the accumulation of new acne sis with low level lght therabe using red light and imfored light sometimes however there is a resistance of that acney to the low level light there be such that people will get an initial improvement and then it will go away despite continuing the treatment your probably asking or at least you should be asking how is it that shining red light on our skin can impact things acney in wound healing et cetera well do understand that we have to think back to the beginning of the episode where i described how long wave length light such as red light and near im fored light which is even longer than red light can pass through scertain surfaces including our skin our skin has an epidermis which is on the outside and the dermis which is in the deeper layers red light and impered light can pass down into the deeper layers of our skin where it can change the metabolic function of particular cells let jus take acney is an example within th e dermis the deep layers of our skin we have what are called sabaceous glands that actully make the oil that is present in our skin those sabaceous glans are often near by herfolicals is you have ever had infected herfolical that is not a coincidence that herfolicals ten to get infected part of it is because there is actally a pordal down and around the herfolical but the sabaceous gland is where the oil is created that is ging to give rise to ferenceis acney lesions also in the dermis in the deep layers of the skin ar the malanacites there nochous in the epidermis that also in the deeper layers of the skin and you have the stem cells that give rise to additional skim cells if the top layers of the epidermis or damage those stem cells can become activated and you also have the stemcells that give rise to herfolicals by shining red light or near imfor red light on a localized patch of skin provided that red light is not of such high intensity that it burns the skin but is of sufficient intensity that provides just a little bit of damage to the upper layers of the skin the epidermis and that it triggers certain biological pathways within the cells of the sabaceous glan and the stem cells within the haircell niche and the stem cells in skin what happens is the top layers of the skin are basicarly burned off by a very low level of burn and or the cells in the deeper layer start to churn out new cells which go and rescue the lesion essentially clear out the lesion and replace that legsion with healthy skin cells this does work in the contexts of wound heeling getting scars to disappear it also works to remove certain patches of pigmentation there sometimes cases where people will get a red blotchiness o due to certain skin conditions or some darker pigmentation that they will not remover that they need removed becaus its appotential a skin cancer threat now how is red light actally doing it within the cells of the sabaceous gland the stem cells et cetera well long wave length light can actually get deepen to the skin i mention that before but can also get into individual cells and can access the called organells which are described to the beginningof the episode in particular they can accsus the mitocondria which are responsible for producing a t p now the simple way to think about this forsake of this discussion is that as cells age and in particular in very metabolically active cells they accumulate what are called are oessas reactive oxygen species and as reactive oxygen species go up e t p energy production tho cells tends to go dow the general statement but its general statemen that in most cases is true there are some minor exceptions that do not concern us that have to do with seltypes different than the ones untalking about now the way to think about this is that red light passes in to the deeper layers of the skin activates mitochondrea which increases a tp and directly or indirectly reduces these reactive oxygen species these reactive oxygen species are not good we do not want them they cause cellar damage cellar death and for the most part just inhimit the a that our cells work if youve heard of red light or nerim fred light therapes design to heal skin or improve skin quality or remove lesions or get rid of scars or unwanted pigmentation that is not seudo science that is not wou science that is grounded in the very biology of how light interacts with mitocondra and reactive oxygen species some of you may also find it interesting to note that some of the cream base treatments for acne for instance retinoic acid reton a is actually a dirivitive of vitemina and the pathway involving retinoic acid ind vitemina believe it or not is very similar to the natural biological pathway by which photo pigments in the eye convert light information in to biological changes within those cells the key point here is that light is activating particular pathways in sells that can either drive death of cells or can make those cells essentially younger by increasing a t p by way of improving mytocondreal function and in recent ears their been some just beautiful examples that exist not only in the realm of skin biology but in the realm of neuro biology whereby red light and nerim fred light can actually be used to enhance the function of the cells that for instance allow us to see better and indeed sells that allow us to think better now i to review those data because not only are they interesting in their own right but they also point to some very interesting and powerful application of low costers zero cost tools that we can use to improve our vision if you are somebody who is interested in the use of red light or nearim fored light called ellelelty low level light therapies for treatment of dermatologic issues anything relate to skin i will include a lenkth to a excellent set of reviews the first one is lightimating diods in dermatology a systematic review of randomize control trials that one includes review of a very large number of studies came out just a few years ago in twenty eighteen and i think is very clearly and cleanly laid out for any one to access you can see the degree of effects of red light for insince on treatment of actne or scarring et cetera and i'll also provide a link to another review which is low level light therape in skin stimulating healing and restoring for those you that are interested again in dermcologic issues in the kind of of restoring yusefulness and the kound of a general themes of of antiaging in longevity and how red light terapies can be use for that i will encourage you to take a look at those reviews what you are going to find is that rarely if ever is there a study looking at whole body red light illumination forsake of treating and improving skin and i mention this because i get a lot of questions about infor red sauna and global illumination with red lights will talk more about cases where global illumination of your whole body or wh whole face with red lights might be useful but in terms of inferred sana i've mentione on this podcast before and i will certainly go deeper on this in an upcoming episode all about the use of heat and temperature for augmenting our biology but in general infor red sanas do not get hot enough temperature wise in order to trigger some of the important effects on growth harmon and heatshock protines and some of the other things that sana has been shown to be excellent for that is a general statement i realize theire are some inforedsonas that do get hot enough there are very few data on the use of whole body illumination with infor red sanas that really point to any specific mechanistically supported effects almost all the pasive effects that you are going to see of red light and low level light therapiece certainly the one's discussed in the reviews that i just mention are going to be the consequence of very directed illumination of particular patches of skin that our seeking repair that people our seeing the repair of againd i do not wan to desparage infred sanas but in general they do not get hot enough to trigger most of the positive effects that sauna have been demonstrated to have and it is unclear at all as to whether not they can enhanc skin quality youthfulness restore a top layers of skin that are damaged a repair acne et cetera more on heat sanas and imferedsanas in their comparison in an up coming episode let us talk about a clear set of examples where red light and near him fored light have been shown to have posive effects on our health and these are the data that i refer to at the beginning of the episode from doctor glenjeffrey at university college london who againd is a long standing member of the neroscience community working on visual noroscience and who over the last decade or has really emphasize the exploration of red light and near him fred light for restoration of noronal function as we age this is absolutely critical we know that we do not accumulate many new brain sells as we get older and in some areas of our nervous system such as our norl ratina which is the part of our eye that is responsible for translating light information to electrical signal that we can see we do not get any new sells after the time in which we are born the ability to keep our nerans healthy is extremely important for our visual system extremely important for our hippocampus and every the brain if aldon memory and should just mention that even if people do not get alsheimers there is always going to be some degree of age related to mensia sadly nobody is as cognively sharp in the ye ars before they die as they are twenty years before that is just never the case where all getting worse at thinking feeling perceiving et cetera the question is how quickly we are getting worse any mechanism by which we can preserve or reverse noronal function turns out to be immensely beneficial the jeffrey lab has published two studies in recent years on humans that looked directly no pon intended at how red light and near him fored light can improve visual function i'm going to describe the perameters of those studies and then i'm going to describe what they found exactly the mechanistic motivation for these studies again traces back to this effect of light on mitocondria to go a lobit deeper into that mechanism just briefly that you can frame any potential protocol that you would develop when light arrives on cells including nurons that light can penetrate into the cells of its of the appropriate wavelength red light can do that can get into cells it can acess the mito condra it can increase t p in general any time t p is doing its thing tat increase energy and cells it is involving this thing called cydachrome c which is an oxydates any time you hear c a s in biology it is going to be an enzim ints involved in some process of degrading a moleculan creating another molecule typically e t p an cytocrom c is going to give you t p now that is a great thing but it creates a by product a breaks things down such that you get these arosses these reactive oxygen species and those reactive oxygen species for those who youthey want to know are involved in things redoc signaling and reactive oxygen species actually change which genes are made in a cell the goal of any treatment to keep nurons or other cells youthful and functioning well and t o preto prevent or reverse aging is going to be to increase a t p and to reduce reactive oxygen species and in doing to disrupt some of the normal pathways associated with agen the jeffrey lab approach these studies with that understanding of how mitacondrea and reactive oxygen species in a t p work and what they did was exquisitely simple to the point of being elegant and what they found was really really exciting what they did is they had people subjects that were either younger in their twenties or forty years old or older view red light of about six hundred and seventy nanameter six hundred seventy nanameters would appear red to you and me they had they have them do that scuse me at a distance that was safe for their eyes at about a foot away now a foot away from a very intense red light could ictsual be damaging to the eye they hade them do this at about a foot away from a re light that was of low enough intensy that did not damage the eyes and they had them do that anywhere from two to three minutes per day and in one study they had them do that for a long period of time of about twelve weeks and in the other study they have them do that just for a couple of weeks what is remarkable is that when you collapse the results across these two studies what they found is that when looking at these subjects ranging from twenty eight years old to about seven t two years old the major findings were that in indivisuals forty years old or older in the forty to seventy to year old bracket but not in the subjects younger than forty years old they saw an improvement in visual function that improvement invisual function was an improvement in visual acuity meaning the ability to resolve fine detail and using a particular measure of visual function which is called the triten exam t are i t a n tritan examp which specifically addresses the function of the called short wave length cones the ones that respondte green and blue light they saw a twenty two per cent improvement in visual acuity which in the landscape of visual testing is and extremely exciting res ult ay i think in most studies of improvements of vision you would be very excited to see in improvement of five per cent or ten per cent a twenty two per cent improvement in visual acuity even though it is in this very specific form of visual testing this triten examp or this triten score well that turns out to be very significant and translates to the real world in an important way in particular as we age we tend to lose certain nurons within our retna but we do not tend to lose cones we tend to lose rods we tend to lose other cells within the retin including the cells that connect the eye to the brain the called gangling cells cones for whatever reason are pretty resilient to age related loss however because rods en cones both are not just among the most metabolically active cells in your entire body but the most mantebolically active cells in your entire body that is right your rods and cones of the cells the demand and that use the most energy of all the cells in your body not your skin cells not your splean cells not your stomach cells even if your tocalat not that cells thet responsible for moving your mouth it is the rods and cones of your nurl retna that are responsible for using the most amount of a t p and energy in yor entire body and because of that those cells tend to accumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species as we age red light of the sort used in these studies was able to reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species in the rods and cones and to rescue the function of this particular cone type the short wave length o medium wavelangth cones which if you think abou the study is a little but surprising because it was red light and near him for red light not short wave length light that was used in order to create this improvement in cellar function but if you step back a lo bit further it makes perfect sense because there is nothing specific about the red light in the sense that it is not that it gets delivered only to red cones that red light and near him for red light is being absorbed by all the photoreceptors within the eye the rods and the blue cones and the green cones and the red cones is just that the red cones absorbe that light best the important take away here is that viewing red light and near him fored light at a distance at which it is safe for just a couple of minutes each day aloud a reversal of the aging process of these nurans which some people have heard mou say before and all just say it again the retna including your photoreceptors are not just connected to your brain there not just near your brain they are actual central nervous system tissue they are the only two pieces of your brain man your noretnas are the only two pieces of your brain that reside outside your scullar at least outside the cranial voult here were seing a reversal of the aging process in nurons by shining red light on those nurans now of course the jeffrey lab is primarily interested in vision and humans are most dependent on vision as the sense to navigate the world and survive this is really wonderful here were looking at a therape that can reverse ad related vision loss at least in some individuals but as you can imagine the study was also done on these sells because they reside outside the skull and you can shine light directly on them right i'm sure that there are many people out there who are interested in how they can improve the function say of the nurons in the brain responsible for memory and in a few minutes i'll describe that non in vasive applications of light to try and restore the function of those cells as well a little bit more about the studies from the jeffrey lap one of the things that they observed was a reduction in called druson d r u s and druson or little fatty deposits little collesteral deposits that accumulat in the eye as we age we have all heard about collesterall within our veins and arteries and how that can clagarveins and auteries and how of course clonging of veins and arteries is not a good thing well our nurl retina being metabolically active requires a lot of bloodflow its heavily vascularize and druson are a special form of collesterall that accumulate in the eye as it turns out these red light and near him fored light therapies explored by the jeffrey lab were able to actually reduce or reverse some of the accumulation of druson and in addition to reducing reactive oxygen species the idea in mind now is that red light may actually reduce collesterall deposits and reactive oxygen species in order to improve nuronal function what should you and i do with these results or shuld we do anything with these results but firstofall i want it emphasize that even though these studies are very exciting they are fairly recent and more data as always are needed there some additional features of these studies that i think are also important to consider first of all the exposure to red light needed to happen early in the day at least within the first three hours of waking how would one do that well nowadays there are a number of different red light panels and different red light sources that certainly fall within the range of red light and near im for red light that one could use i do not have any affiliation to any companies or products that promote or make those red light therapies a do own a red light panel i confess i have started using this protocal i am older than forty years old i also have been experimenting with these red light panels as a way of addressing other changes in biological tissues for which i'm doing blood work et cetera and i'm going to talk about that in a future episode but that of course is what i call anecdata it only relates to my experience sode to day and certainly on all episodes ofthe human lapod cast we emphasize pureviewed studies almost exclusively talking about anecdata only when high lighting it as anecdata if you are somebody who wants to explore red light therapy here is what you need to do you ned to make sure that that red light source wherever source you happen nonews whether not you purchasid or make one in fact these red light sources are very very easy to make you could essentially take a bright flash light and cover it with a film or of filter that would only alow particular long wave lingts to pass through this would be very easy to look up on line and figure out how to do this you pratly do this for just a few dollars or you could purchase a red light unit if that was i'm within your budget ind something thay yare interested in you want to make sure that it is not bright that your damaging your eye a good rule of thumb is that something is not painful to look at and in fact i should just emphasize that any time you look at any light source sunlight or otherwise that painful it makes you want to squinch or close your eyes that means it is too bright to look at without closing your eyes i have that sort of a da but i would loth to think that any one would harm themselves with bright light in any way i do not you say that to protect us i say that to protect you of course because you are responsible for your health and again retinal naurans do not regenerate once they are gone and dead they do not come back there is no technology to replace them at this current state in time please do not damage your retinas is a red light source safe to look at if it is not painful to look at chances are it is and yet i would still encourage you to talk to your optomatrist or opthemologist before getting into any extensive protocols but if you are still determined to pursue the sorts of protocals that are in the jeffrey studies certainly will provide a link to those studies again it involved looking at these red light panels blinking aloud for two minutes to three minutes every morning for a period of two weeks or more and if youre older than forty that could very well have an effect if you longer younger than forty excuse me that is unlikely to have an effect at least that was what was observed in these particular studies the lights were not flashing it was continuous illumination again you are llowed to blink it does not after even be direct illumination can be somewhat indirect illumination much as we described for the use of u v b light before the wavelength of light is important it is red light and near im for red light that is going to be affective in this senario the authors of this study emphasize that it was red light of six hundred and seventy nanameter in wavelength and near in for red light of seven hundred and ninety nanto meters in wavelength that were effective and that those wavelengs could be complimentary that is probably wide or maybe it is just coincidental but it is a fortunate coincidence that a lot of the commercially available red light panels that you will find out there combine both red light and near in for red light however i wont emphasize that most of the panels that are commercially available are going to be two bright to safely look at very close up and iffact that is why most of those red light panels are designed for illumination of the skin and oftentimes arrive in their packaging with i protectors that her actually design to shield out all the red light take the potential dangers of excessive illumination of the eyes with any wave length of light seriously but if you are going to explore six seventy and seven ninety nanimeter light for sake of in inhancing neuronal function set it at a distance that is comfortable to look at and that does not force you to squint or does not make you feel uncomfortable physically as if you need to turn away during the period of that two to three minate illumination each day in terms of turning away from light i'll just briefly mention that that is not and accident or a coineidence that you have that response to very bright light there is a called photic avoidancs pathway that involves sells within your retna these ganglin tells that communicate with yet another brain station of certain area of your thalimus that communicate to areas of your brain that areassociate with pain literally that can trigger headache and that can triggerate the squint reflex biology is just beautiful in this way too much light is bad for us and that it can damage our eyes and other aspects of our body if we look at a light that is too bright our eyes send a signal to the brain that gives us a sort of a headache and a desired to squint and turn awayt that can be a useful guide in terms engaging how bright a light should be or at least how far away you should be from a bright source in order to safely engage with that light source the studies i just described once again involve the use of red light early in the day within three hours of waking and are for the sake of improving neuronal function red light has also been shown to be beneficial l te in the day and even in the middle of the night and when i say middle of the night i'm referring to studies that explored the use of red light for shift workers i know that most people are not working in the middle the night at least i hope they are not but some of you may do that from time to time all nighters for studying i confess i still pull all nighters every once and while to prepare things podcasts and other ded lines really try not to happens less and less as i get older because they think i get more disciplined and or less good at a pulling all nighters but i realize that many people are doing shift work or they have to work certainly past ten pimo may be there taking care of young children in the middle of the night and they have to be up in that case red light can actuall be very beneficial and now days therere a lot of sources of red light available just as red light bulbs you do not need a panel what am basely saying is that it can be beneficial to use red light at night the study id to emphasize in this context is entitled red light a novel non phormicological intervention to promote alertness in shift workers beautiful study they explored the use of different wavelangs of light blue light of four hundred sixty nanimaters or red light or dim whiht light of different brightness is at cetera and looked at things light melatonan how much does light of a given color and intensity suppress melatonan they looed at cortis all a stress hormone they looked at wakefulness how much or to what degree could a given color of light increase wakefulness at different hours of the day the take away from this study is very clear if you need to be awake late at night for sake of shift work or studying or taking care of children et cetera red light is going to be your best choice because if the red light is sufficiently dim it is not going to inhibit melatonan production and it is not going to increase corts all at night cortes all should be high early in the day or at least to be elevated relative to other times to day if you are healthy a late shifted increasin cortis all however nine pim cort is all ten pim corisall is well known to be associated with depression and other aspects of mental helthresh is a mental illness if you do need to be awake at night or even all night red light is going to be the prerferred light source and in terms of how bright to make it well as dim as you can while still being able to perform the activities that you need to perform that is going to be your best guide i'll provide a link to this study is well agim it is a really important study because it emphasize that there are forms of light red light provided its dim that can allow you to stimulate the alertness that light landing on the eyes can provide the laws you stay awakan to do whatever work that you need to do it does not seem to alter melatonan production that is good it does not seem to alter levels or tim of cortus all production yet another case where red light use correctly can be beneficial up in till now we'e been talking about the effects of shining different wavelings of light on the skin or on our eyes and the downstream health consequences of that illumination however one of the most important goals of science and medicine is to figure out how to change the health of our brain and of course our brain is contained within our skull and therefore we cannot yo shine light on to the outside of our head and expected to change the activity of nurons deep within the brain unless those nurons are linked ulp with our eyes or with our skin and as it turns out even though there are lot of brain areas that are connected through nurl circuits and hormone circuits to our eye and believe are not also to our skin many brain areas are not brain areas such as the hippocampus which is involved in learning ind memory brainareas such as ore neo cartecs well some areas of our neoqortic such as our visual cortecs our indirectly linked to our eyes if we shine light in our eyes we can change the activity of nurons in ourneo quartecs but there are other brain areas that are not directly or even indirectly connected to our visual system not at least in any immediate way that raises the quession of how do you change the activity of nurons in the brain well there is pharmocology you can take pills you can inject drugs that will change the pharmocology of nurons in the way they operate in fire course and to the pressents are one such instants a opioi drugs are another a there is a huge array of psychoactive compounds meaning compoundsthat will change the levels of chemicals in your brain some of those work many of them also carry side effects it is all rather indirect meaning you have lots of different cells and differentaries your brain that utilize thes and chemicals a drug for instance to increase ceretone and forsake of improving depression will also often have the effect of reducing certain nurons output of ceretonan in the hippocampus and cause changes an appetiter changes in libido and on and forth you could imagine using electrical stimulation putting wires into the brain and stimulating specific brain areas in order to activate the nurons in those brain areas and certainly that works and has been done experimentally and is done during nuro surgery examines et cetera but involves removing a piece of skull o that is not very practical in principle light would be a wonderful way to modulate the activity of nurons deep within the brain but again the skull is in the way recent studies however have figured out ways that light can be delivered to the eyes to change global patterns of firing in the brain in ways that can be beneficial to the brain and the work that on referring to now is mainly the work of leway size at emity massachusetts institute of technology and her colleagues and what theyve discovered is that there is a particular pattern of br rain activity called gama activity gam activity is one caled wave length of electrical activty in the brain not wavelinghs of light but wave lengths of electrical activity in the brain that can be restorative for certain aspects of learning and memory and can actually help create molecular changes in nurons that lead to clearance of debris and even reductions in age related cognive tecline the way to think about brain waves and brain oscillations is that nurons are electrically active that involves chemicals et cetera and they can be active in very slow big wave forms as you can think of yon delta waves meaning you can imagine a wave of electricelectivity that come o long very infrequently a given nuron fires and then some period of time later fires and then some period of time even later fires or you can imagine that that same cell is very active fires fires fires fres fires you can imaginof its firing very often its goingto be short wave length right shorter gaps between firing or if its firing very seldom ous going to think about that as longer wavelang firing turns out that gama waves are one pattern of firing that lead to downstream metabolic functions and biological functions that and up clearing away debris that s associated with aging in cells and that also lead to malecular changes that inhants the kind of youthfulness of nurans to speak how do we induce gama oscillations within the brain well what leeway sig and calligs have beautifully shown is that by delivering certain patterns of light flicker lights going on and off at a particular frequency the brain as a whole starts ot in train meaning it matches to those particular patterns of light flicker even though many of the brain aireas that do this are not directly within the visual system are visual pathway the studies that im referred to are several but the one that i to high light is entitled gama in trainment binds higher order brain regions and offers nurrow protection what they essentially did was to expose subjects to forty hurts which is a particular frequency of illumination to the eyes its goes on goes off goes on goes off at a frequency of forty hurts and when they did that and they recorded the activity of nurons within the brain not just within the visual areas of the brain but within other airs as well they observed increased gama oscillations meaning that the electrical activity of the brain at large started to match to the patterns of light that were delivered to the eyes this is really exciting and very unique from the different types of phototherapies that wev been talking about up until now all the patterns of phototherapy that wee been talking about up in till now involved constant illuination with a given wave length here it is wave length generating patterns of illumination light on light off liy on ligh off at a particular frequency what they found for instance using this pattern of stimulation and by the way the stimulation was called genus gama in trainment using censory stimulation g e and u sgama in trainment using censry stimulation had a number of really interesting effects first of all it reduced called ameloid placks and phosphorelated tow emiloid placxs and phosphoralated tow are associate with alcimers and normal age related cognave decline this is incredible right a pattern of flashing light delivered to the eyes creates a pattern of naronal firing nocious in the visual areas of the brain but in other airs of the brain as well that in turn trigger molecular pathways that reduce some of the markers and the cause of age related cognaof decline and alcimers and in parallel to that they observed an upregulation of some of the biological pathways that lead to enhancement of nauronal function maintenance of synapses which are the connections between nurons and on and on they have discovered and lists out a huge number of these bouht biological effects both the reduction in bad things to speak and the improvement in good biological pathways and i find these studies exciting because first of all their non invasive right there is no drilling through the skull they are very tractable in the experimental sense meaning that you can imagine that if forty hurt stimulation turns out to be the very best stimulation protocalld to induce these gama oscillations well great but because it is non invasive its fairly easy to explore fif the hurt stimulation hundred hurt stimulation twenty hurt stimulation and to do that with different wave lengths of light and that is what is happening now the scilab and other labs are really starting to explore the full range of variables that can impact oscillations within the brain and their downstream consequences again this is phototherapy but phototherapy bu very different sort that we ben talking about up until now its phototherapy designe to trigger activation of biological pathways far away from the very tissue thats being illuminated and it calls to mind the same sorts of mechanisms that we were talking about earlier where illumination of the skin with u v v light is setting off an enormous number of different cascades in different organs and tissues including the spleen the testies the overies and on again light has these powerful effects both locally on the cells that the light is delivered to but also systemically in terms of the cells that are changing their electrical and chemical outputs are modifying lots and lots of biological programs is there an actionable tool related to these studies yet well that sorter depends on how adventures you are right now these studies are being explored in the contects of clinical trials in people with alchimers dem encha and other forms of noronly generation is it dangerous to look at a forty hurts flickering light well in general the answer is going to be no however if your prone to epilepsy for instance staring at a flickering light of a given continuous frequency can induce seizure right that might surprise some of you but it should not because as this study illustrates and is anyone who is ever been out at night to a club or something illustrates when you look at a strobe light for instance your whole world of visual perception changes but actually the rhythm at which you perceive music at which you perceed conversation at which you perceive the movement of your body actually changes according to the patterns of visual flicker in most cases strobe if were using the sort of club dancing example your brain is in training to its outside environment given the power of flickering lights to in train brain rhythms i think at this stage its probably two preliminary to really suggest a specific protocol but i would dely keep an eye out for these sorts of studies they are coming out all the time and i think in a very short period we are going to see specific protocalls that one could potentially use even at home and of course these are non invasive protocols in order to place the brain into a particular state notjust forsake of offsetting nur degeneration but also for enhancing focus for inhancing the transition into sleep and other brain states as well to day i covered what i would say is a lot of information my goal was to give you an understanding of how light can be used to change the activities of cells organels within tho cells intire organs and how that can happen locally and sestemically you talked about the power of light to impact are biology at the endocrin level nurona level a mun level mood et cetera through both illumination of the eyes and the skin and other tissues as well i realize that even though this was a lot of information theirre many aspects of phototherape that i did not cover i know there is a lot of interests nowadays for instance in the use of red light and other wavelength light therapes for overian health and testicular health in fact i get a lot of questions such as can red light be used to improve testostrone output and if is that best accomplish by shining red light on the skin or directly on the gonats on the testicles i'm going to cover those data at a future time right now the studies that hve been done in rodens i do not think are easily enough translated to humans and the studies that are happening in humans now are exciting in the sense that they hold a lot of potential but the data are not clear yet however the data using uv be on the skin of men and women in order to increase hormon in particular test stron an estrigen ow put those data i think are very exciting and very actionable we talked about those earlier if you want more information on how phototherape can be used certainly we will do another episode

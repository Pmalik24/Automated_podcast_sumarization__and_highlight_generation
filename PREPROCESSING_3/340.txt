welcome to the hubermanladguest series where i and an expert gest is gust science n science as too er in i manddeu hubermen and om professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day's episode markhs the second episode in our four episode series with doctor paullconty about mental health the first episoe in the series dealt with how to understand and access your level of mental health to day's episode is about how to improve your mental health i do want to episize that you do not need to have heard or seen the first episode in order to understand or glean important imformation from to day's episode about how to improve your mental health but i do encourage you to go and listen to the first episode at some point if you have not already to day's episode deals with several topics important to all of us as well as protocalls to improve one's mental health for instance you will learn how to guide yourself through a process of self inquiry in which you address certain key questions about your drives your level of aggressive drive pleasure drive and the called generative drive these are essential things to understand about onesealth if you want to guide yourself toward your aspirations and if you want to understand how your subconscious processing is influencing your thoughts and your behaviors in your feelings in ways that sometimes serve your aspirations and in other ways that can hinder your aspirations doctor conty shares with us a way of assessing our internal narratives as well as a way of creating a constructive self awareness and an understanding of ware those narratives and that self awarein a stem from in our childhoode that we can navigate forward with the greatest sense of agency we also talk about how to move past common hindrances to improving one's mental health such as overcoming intrusive thouglhts and perhaps most importantly to day's episode provides information in protocalls that any one can use to cultivate their generative drive which is a hulmark of mental health just a remind er that doctor palconty has generously provided a feu diagrams that we include as ped fs in the shownote captions they are completely zero costs to access and they can help you understand some of the material that was discussed in the first episode of this series as wele as the current episode about how to improve your mental health and while those simple pedif diagrams are certainly not necessary in order to understand the material in to day's discussion or in the other discussions of this series many people find them useful i encourage you to check out those links in the shonerote captions before we begin i'd t emphasize at this potcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's potcast our first sponsor is better help better help offers professional therapy with the license therapists carried out on line i personally have been doing weekly therapy for more than thirty years and while that weekly therapy was initiated not by my own request it was in fact a requirement for me to a remain in high school overtime i really came to appreciate just how valuable doing quality therapy is in fact i look at doing quality therapy much in the same way that i look at going to the gim or doing cardivascular training such as running as ways to enhance my physical health i see therapy as a vital way to enhance one's mental health the beauty of better help is that they make it very easy to find and excellent therapist an excellent therapists can be defined as somebody who is going to be very supportive of you in an objective way with whom you have excellent report with an who can help you arrive at key insites that you would not have otherwise been able to find and because better help therapy is conducted entirely on line it is extremely convenient and easy to incorporate into the rest of your life if you are interested in better help go to better help doc calm slash hubermen to get ten per cent off your first month that is better help spelled h e l p dokcom slash uberman to day's episode is also brought to us by waking up waking up is a meditation at that offers dozens of guided meditation sessions mindfulness trainings yoganed rocessions and more by now there is an abundance of data showing that even short daily meditations can greatly improve our mood reduce anxiety improve our ability to focus and can improve our memory and while there are many different forms of meditation most people find it difficult to find and stick to a meditation practicse in a way that is most beneficial for them the waking up ap makes it extremely easy to learn how to meditate and to carry out your daily meditation practise in a way that is going to be most effective and efficient for you it includes a variety of different types of meditations of different duration as well as things yoganedra which place the brain anbody into a sort of pseudo sleep that allows you to emerge feeling incredibly mentally refreshiin fact the science around yogenedra is really impressive showing that after a yoganedra session levels of dopomin in certain areas of the brain are enhanced by up to sixty per cent which places the brain embody into a state of enhanced readiness for mental work and for physical work another thing i really about the waking up ap is that it provides a thirty day introduction course for those of you that have not meditated before or getting back to a meditation practise that is fantastic or if you are somebody who is already a skilled and regular meditator waking up has more advanced meditations and yoganedr sessions for you as well if you to try the waking up ap you can go to waking up doc cam slash huberman and actus a free thirty day trial again that is waking up doc calm slash hubermen and now for my discussion about mental health with doctor paul canty doctor canty welcome back thank you in the first episode of this series you laid out for us in very structured way what true mental health looks esentially what we should all be aspiring to and touched on these themes of agency and gratitude as verb states really ways of being in the world if that allow everybody to have some sense of well being to have some sense of themselves in a way that is kind to themselves and to others and really to feel good and do good n their life and without question this is what people want i you also spelled out for us these two pillars the structure of self and the function of self that consist of a number of different things that from which geiser up orand of it you do not give rise to these feelings of empowerment humility agency and gratitude and reminded us several times that when we are challenged when we are not doing as well as we would that we need to look back to the structure of self and the function of self and ask specific questions in order to arrive or re arrive at the sense of agency and gratitude think it would be wonderful for us if you could just recap the over all model and because it has the components that i just mention but some subtlety and some really key aspects of these pillars structure of self and function of self i think if people keep in mind for to day's episode which is about challenges the people commonly face and even a if you will fena types that we see commonly out there for people to have not heard of fena types pna types are a the typical appearance of something there is the foena type of the anxious person the na type of the person who just cannot seem to get out of a rut there is the foena type of the trimtromatized person and and these things play out differently in indifferent individuals men and women boys and girls but we are going to visit a many of the most common pena types out there and think about how to do better be better feel better through the lends of the model that a we spelled out in episode one and of course if people have not seen or heard episode one today's discussion will still be entirely accessible to them in keeping with that if you could just a give us a nover of view of of what this a structure of the healthy self looks as a road map for a wewerl headed to day thank you thanks very much we visiting the pillars is as i think the best place to start because there really are routs to understanding and if we understand thand we can stratagize we can make change why we can make things better that that the first pillar the structure of self starts with the unconscious mind by this incredibly complicated biological supercomputer that firing a mild minute right underneath the surface in us and is throwing up to the surface all sorts of thoughts and ideas and states that then the conscious mind apprehends than our wareness comes into play and then we have defense mechanisms that is would rise up from the unconscious mind and they they circle insted of gird themselves around the conscious mind which they can do in an unhealthy way or in healthy way or any anything in between and then the the character structure ssot of the nest around all of that and its from the character strcture that we that we are engaging in the world in the ways that were engaging whet its our active engagement with the world around us and the ideas that the self grows out of that it grows out of that nest sitting on top of the unconscious mind to the conscious mind rising above the defense mechanisms in the character structure and and if we go back to that when we are trying to understand ourselves ouf we trying to understand states of health as well as states of unhappiness or or states that are not healthy right by by going back and looking at the structure we can learn a tremendous amount and the other side that the the other pillar is the the function of self and it really starts with the self awareness right the werness it a there is an eye right i am in the world right is twenty four hours in the day are gan pass to day and i can be doing one thing or another im im i'm to some very significant extent deciding how mygana engage in the world around me during that time on top of that are the defense mechanisms and actions a defense mechanisms remember unconscious there is a lot then going on inside of us that is determining sort of the field set of options right there may be a lot of automaticity that narrows down the set of options of what we my entertain what we may be aware of what we may decide and that could happen for better or for worse depending upon the health of the defense mechanisms but on top of that lies salient the idea then we would next visit oka what we pang attention to rit what what is coming from inside what is coming from outside and we have to not pay attention to many many many many things in order to pay attention to whatever our attention is alighted on at the moment it is a complex process iand it is worth looking at very closely if we want to understand ourselves after thinking about the the defence mechanisms in action ake the unconscious aspects of how we are engaging with the world then next to consider is slients which is sort of where does the mind arrive at at rest or where does the mind trend touris is it something internal is it something external what are all the things were not paying attention to in order to pay attention to something and is that thing healthy is it not healthy is it serving us welve there is much to understand about salients and then the next step beyond that is understanding behavior how are we engaging with the world around us what are our behavior al choices what arour automatic behaviors and then sitting on top of all of that or our strivings we we have a sense of wanting something in the world around us lk what is that and how we trying to get to it and how does it make us feel if we look at the ten elements rit the five under the structure ofselves and the five under the function ofselves then what we are really looking at is is sort of looking at ten cabinets t and if we are trying to understand ourselves whether we are trying to just generally understand ourselves or we are trying to get at a problem gt then looking in all ten of those cabinets make sentense right some of them will be bare meaning that they may seem to have very little to do with the problem we are bringing and we can maintain an open mind right we may be led back to that cabinet there may be something there but what usually happens as if we loo k in all ten places we find a couple where there is there some rich material to explore to the exmarks the spy n than we go and we we dig there at a to mix metaphors we we dig in the cabinet where we can find something right and then it leads forward a process of understanding and if were bringing those things into line where we have a healthy structure of self and healthy function of self and were aware of all this and were working on it were self aware and were paying attention to everything built on top of that then what we end up with is a sense of humility because one cannot be anything but respectful compassion and understanding the complexity of of all of this and understanding how does it manifest itself in us and in just the very fact that we can wake our ways in the world it is just impressive and in a way i think it brings to us a respect ist a respect for being here navigating the world and i think of that respect is born humility the complexity of us the fact that millions of things are going on underneath the surface millions of of a ner transmission and and a chinological function all this is going on undto thi sirs ome not even aware of it and then it kicks up to the surface generates a tremendous amount of respect for the complexity and also the diligence and perseverance it takes us to navigate through the world and i think built upon that understanding is a sense of humility and a sense of empowerment and the humility and empowerment inaction right express right become agency and gratitude and agency and gratitude as you said of the beginning werth seeing as verbs wright thats how we are living life its its through the lend to speak of agency and gratitude that were actively living and again i would put forth that when we look at measures of human happiness i a cross disciplines in a cross time this is always what we say is is some way of describing how agency and gratitude together as verbs manifest and then create hap iness it is the state that we are seeking to be it t because from that state of active agency and active gratitude we achieve what it is that i think we are really searching for it and there are by infinite words throughout human history to describe what that is we might choose to use words peacefulness a sense of peace a sense of contentment a being delighted bi things i just being amazed and impressed by things in the world around us this is a state that we are striving for an i think when people talk about happiness and what we are really trying to get to it is this t but it is not that these things are passive t these things are coming from the active agency the active gratitude and there then interacting with a generative drive within us we have an aggressive drive we have a pleasure drive this has been thought about now for a long long time with in mental health and validated in a lot of ways but what has not been validated as at they are the only things t we see human beings striving we see human beings wanting better for themselves and for the world around them we see acts of kindness that that seem to be rooted to nothing other than the actofe kindness we have within us a drive to know to understand to learn to make better and that is been described as many many things across human history but i think the words we might choose are generative drive a drive to create and to make better and it is thet the generative drive as something active with in us t that is then a lying with agency and gratitude t the active ways in which we express ourselves and then that all together brings us the peace the contentment the sense of delight sometimes that may exist in us in a state of rest but very often it is in it is existing in us in a state of activity and that is why people find o know the qotiqote happiness af what people are seeking not just in i do not meditation sometimes we can find it there but people also find it in in action right they find it in doing that thing that they love to do or a d takin care of some one in learning something when we look at all this wwe can then we can then have a route of understanding what is going on inside of us and how we can make the changes that let us be in this state which is really the state that we are seeking i really appreciate that you highlight the agency and gratitude are verb states from which piece contentment and delight emerge and also the way that you explain the generative drive that is distinct from aggressive drives and pleasure drives that exist in all of us i you not i smiling because a number of examples of a pece contentment and delight while in action come to mine to me for me podcasting and in particular preparing for a podcast and mind the literature and figure out yo where the gems reside and where the confusion could could emerge and all of that brings about such piece contentment and delight for me but is it is anything but passive et's i likewise a yesterday i had the experience of running into a a puppy i hat's been wall since ive bon a dog and dogs are delightful puppies ser pretirely ti experience of seeing you let ot when we man i and ah you did and am and i'm still buzzing from that short interaction with the puppy downstairs e wamer and her puppy it just the i do not know why what i just delight in in animals of of most all kinds not ofin of reptile sorry reptilephands a much but i just drive much energy from it and felt life energy in the the way the animal is sort attentionally scattered is amusing to me as compared to the dog that he will eventually be which is going to be more linearn is thinking it in capsolate much of the other things i love brain development et cetera anyway i hi those examples because u there is nothing passive about it its pure delight and joy for me i'm and it intersects with other delights and joys and i think that i'm as you describe agency and gratitude peace contentment and delight in these generative forces i'm as well as other forces that exist in us i think it is really a critical that a people understand that yet these are not states that you sit down and and place yourself into although perhaps one could through a reflection in or meditation or waking up from a really great night sleep things of that sort but that i'm these are things that we can find ourselves a wash in if we are doing the right things and those things can oftentimes be very challenging i'm assuming i understand the way the model is spelled out correctly im i'm more and more delighted aat the fact that this is not just successible in one domain but is successible in many many different domains for everybody yet this is not something yunique to my experience even though i give examples for my own life but i' that we really all do have access to this if we are looking in those cupboards those ten cupboards an asking the right questions nd and to commening a little further on the experienceof of you and the dog i it was a at experience of delight and and you enjoyed it and brought asance of peace and contentment all that happens i think about what that is linked to that i believe there is a strong sense of agency in you that you are enacting there is a strong gratitude in you that youare enacting youre youare handling your life in a way and nd also for all of us good things always come with good fortune but but it comes with our strivings in our achievements that you are in a place to delight in that right if you are unhappy lig i do not what i'm doing i'm i'm angry i'm frustrated then there is no room in you to to find the delight and the delight that you find is also very much linked to the generative drive that it makes me think of how you you loved and nurtured casello you have it in you to love and nurture a dog and you have done that in a really wonderful way and that generative drive is part and parcel of the delight you feel when you see a dog because you love dogs and you think about nurturing and it all comes together the the the agency and the gratitude expressed as verbs put you in a position to have that sense of delight which is intertwined with your generative drive with a sense of caretaking a sense of creating the the beyond self because although you enjoyed and loved casello you enjoyed and loved his happiness it all comes together and i think it is interesting because in some ways it is a simple example but that is life life has its it is big moments but but much of our lives are the smaller moments that link together and i think that smaller moment it becomes a big example i appreciate that you mention costello for listeners of this podcast that if 'mturned into early episodes a costello was the source of the the background snoring for those of you th avenue can go chakisa was a niny pound english bll dog mastive who a who had many skills a the best of which was a snoring a in addition to the generative drive which is something that we certainly wanted a talk more about to day a you mention these other drives aggressive drives and pleasure drives and much of what we are talking about to day it is going to be where people can go wrong wer were people struggle we are also of course going to go deeply into where people succeed and in particular where people can ask questions of themselves on in particular what is working for them and why as if rout to understanding how to sift through those cupboards and understand what is not working and why and come up with real actionable answers and and then the abilityto move forward a if if you would could you tell us o lit but more about drives generally te when i hear drives i i cannot help as a nerrol scientise but defaul to okay the dopamen circuit or the the adogenis opiord circuit or the a certain urgic circuit but yet how do you conceptionalize drives within us and and then perhaps you could tell us what the nature of aggressive drives and pleasure drives and generative drives that the concept of a drive the definition of a drive is is something that is intrinsic to humans we could look at it as e motivation i mean we do not just lie on the ground and do nothing until we passively die right something is going on inside of us that is driving us to do something other than that and historically the thinking in the field derising from early secodidamic principles of te he the the theory in the field that as really dominated the field either directly or indirectly in many ways has been that there are two drives within us that there there is aggression and pleasure and again these are just words rihti we sa we could put put apply many many words which is life crose we wanted to find what that means right aggression even though we are using that word for it because the word for it is commonly used ight but it means it means o fullword active engagemen dright a good healthy amount of aggression using that word for the drive would be a strong sense of agency too little aggression can be a problem i then the person is not bringing themselves to bear right there is too little in the way of self determination a furward movement itempowerment agency right and and in the same way too much of this drive becomes actual aggression the i the idea that i want more and if i cannot get it in in certain ways a'll just take right then it starts to become in what we more map to the word aggression which wer should be something negative in most cases a desire or a tendency to harm zhyets surely as aggressive drives get higher which you see why they are in us because it las they were defending ourselves o or or you defending a family member right or or an entire family right than it make sense to have high levels of aggression if your family is threatened riht those drives are in us with with eppotentially those high levels for a reason but we we certainly acts ess very high levels of aggression with out ththe indication of preservation of life or preservation of safety ttthe thought is that' a drive in us and that gets us up and off the ground to speak right and that the other dri then is pleasure which again does not just mean that wwe all want to be headenists right pleasure could be even the pleasure of relief and safety rigtlicer we do not we are all back in the cave together and whend we roll the stone in front of the door ah we are safe you knows we throughout human development yopleasure comes in a lot of ways it can come to the pleasure of food or other people friendship romance sexts that their lot of ways we can achieve pleasure can be relief of things that are unpleasant ou kna relief of pain but that there is a drive towards this inhumans which agan really does make sense and and too little of it again can be problematic as the person then is not motive ated to seek things because ther they are not anticipating or do not receive gratification and too much of a drive for pleasure can also create problems we cinnest see how these two drives aocay they get us up and off the ground to speak but the question is do they explain everything and it is a very important question because if they explain everything then there is not really there is not room for behaviours and choices that are beyond theself wi there is not an explanation for the person who i'll give you an an example of i a person i've taken care of whose i's a very strong swimmer knows how to swim as swam throughout his life who was in a place i saw vidio of it where there would been a hurricane and the waves wereo frightening there just hue this huge surf and there were people who who had got n dragged out and me just see him he runs into the water right he runs in and he goes and and he was really at risk heing to be saved himself but he saved them and i do not believe you can explain that through these drives i do not think hen say well that was who 's aggressive he he wanted to go and do something that was imposing himself on the world or he got pleasure ind thinking i'm strong enough to go do this a mean i think we are really dyrating we are contorting ourselves right in order i've to explain it that way if we think there is a goodness in that man's heart i know thes he goodness in that man's art i know him right and and and that goodness sees his in the moment and he knows that maybe he can save them maybe cannot i's not sure but maybe can next sing he is in the water and i think things the love and nurturing of of other people of children love a nurtring of animals of plants i likethere things inside of us tha we cannot explain with those two drives and and i think they have led to a very sot a darker way of just conceiving of humans i think it is a reason why now you look at us in in the modern day an age we comade humans through the lends of bythology rightmean as it the is a very very thick book that if if a person is assessing another person is thinking about cookin wat numbers in that book apply right which is that is not the way to go about understanding humans and i think if we just think there are those two drives were not doing justice to to humans right one i think it is not true i think it is evident that it is not true and then for framing it in a way that is not true we are not appropriately respectful of humans and if we come from what i believe to be the truth that there is a generative driven is a drive for the beyond self a drive to make things better whether it has anything really directly to do with me or not and as with the other drives nof there can be more or less in people a combination of nature and nurture what what genetically is in us a predisposition ou knobase upon the genetic lineage that comes down to us and the recombination and our unique person with he uniques tat a drives but they are impacted by the genetics and then their impacted by life experience an more strongly formative life experience right the younger the person thet di suited deeper the impact of events of nurturing verses abuse right on the the array on the relative wating of drives within people but ultimately we get to these three drives and how theare functioning in a person being away of understanding an a sessing how healthy or not healthy the person is and then we look back tothose ten cupboards right for the answers if were finding things that we do not these jus drives are out a balance and ther and her the problems there causing very very concrete issues right of problems in people's lives we can look and see where is that out of balance and if it is out of balance there is something in those pillars that are not in the right place we then go back and look in all those cupboards for o where do we dig to find the answer right we learn things we we bring things more into balance right the pillars are in a healthier place and then what sits on top of it as you use or at guyser wright the guyser that then comes up and floats everything on top of it can do that in a in a healthy way and during episode one we touched on some of the similarities between understanding the selth and om building towards a health e or healthiest version of self were angency and gratitude are the states that are being expressed and one of the themes there was this idea people perhaps want to be healthy that they live along time but presumably they also want to be healthy that they can walk up flights of stairs pick up the kids move objects not get injured perhaps even to sport or i and of course some people want to be healthy for aesthetic reasons as well and if we were having a discussion about physical health we could dress the major pillars there which or were a items within the coverd im most people want a some ability to have endurance or stamina to walk some distance or may beven run some distance a muchon before walk up a flight ofseairs have some strength some degree of flectibility certainly some mobility a maybe even dynamic mobility et cetera and in order to address those or improve upon those they could look in those covers and say well how much yow running swimming in on long form cardyovascular exercise of my doing per week how many steps of my taking per day ahow many times a week do i lift objects that are a slightly heavier than is comfortable for me to lift et cetera thit it is very tangible very concrete on hure yiour making the the psyche an the and an the self and mental health a very much concrete in some of the same way saying their ten cupboards that one can look in and these drives as you refer to them as a generaive drive aggressive drive and pleasure drive im youl probably tell us in a few minutes a can be express to varying degrees on different people and how that shows up and what that looks and i just want a frame this and people's minds as very similar to addressing whether not ok if somebody can run very long distances but they are always a i having akes and pains or they they they feel weak or they are weak mon there are good reasons for that there over emphasizing one form of i exercise the expression is more along the lines of endurance and stammin and not strength am ore vice versa the the power lifter who can lift seven hudrd fifty pounds from the floor in a ded lift but walks up two flights of stairs and as belly breathing and has to stop at the top of the stairs a it is it is obvious in the physical realm it is slightly a more cryptic or more cryptic in the psychological realm but here it is becoming concrete for us i think it is it is very interesting and very ironic right s o the field that i'm in the field of psychiatry has historically wanted to be sort of part of the rest of medicine or the rest of medicine and and what i believe it is ended up doing is glorifying attaxonomy ight glorifying a category a mechanism of understanding human beings in the way that that if ok if i'm a a practicing general medicine and you come in in your congested and and i determine oh you have you have bacterial sinucide is right now i i've made a diagnosis and now th i i know what i'm going to do about that ri the ocam gan to prescribe in anabiotic now the thought comes in of what antibiotic right but the identify sin usite is naginat and antibotic is i canahal medicine works right the thought was psychietry is canacategorize everything right we would sail ave listened to you a i know your number or your numbers right and thend once i've given you the numbers now i know what to do i prescribe this medicine that medicine these many sessions of a certain kind of psychotherapy and that does not work right it does not work in mental health it may emases it is not i never works but if yoven o try and understand people it is different a problem of self if i have a lack of confidence in one area of life and not in others right that is a significant issue it is not bacterial psinu secti where then o k arrow goes to prescribe antibiotic and i think what is ironic is that this rout of approch riht actually does bring psychiitr mental health into line with the rest ofh medicine t which is why you can make that parallel and you on't fits well right when youare making the parallel to physical health and to i want to be healthy ofll ca what os the components of that what am i doing to achieve that if something is not the way i want let me go back and look at those components it may be because it is more tangible a sort of it is not yo easier to comprehend dri musics more it is more concrete but but i do not innocense see it is cryptic just less obvious rig but if we go and we look at it and we say all ek that really makes sense right and and it innocense it makes sense that it makes sense right if there is a mechanism of understanding that applies to lots and lots of things that are more concrete why what a similar kind of mechanism understand what the components are understand what is built on top of them this i believe is hou psychietryte actuul fits with the rest of medicine not by glorifying a taxonomy but by coming through the lends of understanding i could not agree more and i i think that what reassuring is that both in terms of creating physical health across the various domains of heart health long health enduranc strength et cetera cognative health as well as mental health is verbs you noit comes back to action items that we each and all should engage in in order to arrive at the states tand ways of being that we all want to be right we want to feel healthy look healthy it yu know et cetera we want to on be happy id i know very few people who do not want to be happy imin certainles thater people wo give up bhat i will talk about that to day and en routs out of that but at the end of the day it is all about looking in those bins asking specific questions and then moving forward in specific actions to get to the place of empowerment humility agency gratitude pece contentment delight et cetera 'm as opposed to im simply using words and understanding to arrive at insight and then stopping there and expecting everything to change and i think that is where a lot of people are confused about psychology therapean psychietry and m and as you mention psychatri has its own im i shadows if you will within it where the the use of of drugs which certai certainly can be very useful even life saving oftentimes is is seen as a i'm a fix all that im somehow could reorder everything within the coverds and and make the recipe just right when in fact swel talk about to day that that is i'm generally not the best route but again with the understanding that drugs can be very powerful tools say a rule ye i bise point we understand what rols appropriate for them and that is where we often go astray i' to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors ag one ag one is a vitemin mineral probotic drink that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs i started taking a g one way back in two thousand in twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast the reason i started taking ag one and the reason i still take a g one once or generally twice per day is that it is the easiest way for me to insure that i'm getting all of the vitamens minerals probiotics and fibre that i need in my diet now of course it is essential to get proper nutrition from whole foods but most people including myself find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day and especially to get enough prebiotics and probiotics to ensure got health as you may know your got contains trillians of little microbioda the called got microbiom which establishes critical connections with other organs of your body to enhance brain health as well as to support your immune system and other aspects that relate to mental and physical h alth one of the most common questions i get is if you were to take just one supplement whit supplement would that be and my answer is always g one because by taking g one i'm able to ensure that i'm getting all of the vitemens minerals and probiotics that i need to enhance my mental health physical health and performance if you would to try g one go to drink g one dot calm slash hubermen to claim a special offer hey'l give you five fre travel packs and they will give you a year supply of viteman d three k to again that is drink g one dot alm slash hubermen to claim the special offer s we move forward here ind defining and and helping people gain a for lack of a better word agency over their own mental health and and self understanding and defining for them what what action i dems to take i'd to ask you about some of the he things that i absorve in the world and here a lot about in particular from the audience of this podcast oh it is obvious to me that people vary in terms of their level of aggressive drive pleasure drive and presumaly generative drive as well one common question is how do i become more motivated ight im and of course that opens up a bunch of other questions our people afraid of failure and that is why they are not motivated people afraid of success whe they are not motivated is there some underlying child o trama or unconscious process a that is driving that fear im and on but if we were to take the psychitros perspective your perspective if some one comes tudences i ound i just do not really feel trying it is a uno schools hard a school loans are iu kno are excessive which is true by the way ah 's not hiam clear that with a degree i can do much or i'd a series of failures and in te work domain or in the relationship domain and and they are just feeling weig down as if it is not worth trying om what does that tell you in terms of where to look and and what oesthat tell you in terms of their drives and do we conclude something about their innate level of aggressive drive on were theire pleasure driver thei're generative drive mi think thereare many such people out there and then we will consider some other i'm can a phoenatipic examples those a great example because soany good clination it could could hear that story and then and have thoughts about it t that that coulden would hopefully be helpful without necessarily referring to drives i i think you can ancer any set of assassens any evaluation any attempt at understanding to drives but but it does not have to be that way for example you might ask that person more questions about what they are doing how they spend their time because you are telling me about some one who is not engetting enjoyment or gratification out of anything right and and that then becomes of interest to me i is is there is there something this person does enjoy reyr something they would rather be doing did they did they go to college and take on a bunch of lons because they thought that was better because they thought they were going to do something that now they actually do not want to do right or that opportunity is not there another frustrate what is inside this person that might seem different than that and and again the answers could be complicated it could be maybe that person enjoys what they are doing but the cost of living where they are is high that they still feel miserable there is a sense of privation and then that gets back map to i do not not get any pleasure out of anything i the answer could be as simple as you strategized with ha person of for example does a person that move you are move to a different area h there is many ways of looking at this in many ways of understanding this but you are describing some one to me who who it is c at really complaining that nothing is feeling good right nothing's providing a sense of aof enjoyment or pleasure right i would probably be interested in that first and think maybe thethe pleasure drive is higher than what is being fulfilled rigt maybe the pleasure drive is is low and that is an issue in n of itself alwe stood a learn those things right maybe the aggressive drive is low and that person just put a little more energy into it right they could be in a different place right you try and to hop the person understand themselves that you can make change and again that understanding does not have to be anchored to to the drives but i do believe the drives are at the root of all understanding because if yu sit with that person and you talk to that person then you are going to be able to understand what is out of balance ri either in thethe actual array of the drives or in how there being being experience because again feel a high pleasure drive for example and it is not gratified right that represents a problem iknow what what about people who can experience some pleasure or can keep busy say for instance on social medear plaing vidio games and i should also say perhaps it is bringing them to a place of peace contentment and delight but in some sense it is not really generative right i'm not going to cast judgment and say that vidio games and social meder are all waste of time i mean i'm on social media trying to provide value to people and learnings and a man i drive value in learnings from other accounts as well but you there are these a milestones if you will in life i mean not that everyone has to go to college and an get married a familymen there allowd different paths through life that i would consider successful but in some sense we there are milestones we want to move forward there is as phenomeno nowadays of a lot of a young people caled failure to launch mi that they are not leaving home or they are nt finding a vocation and they are not they are not feeling as if they are good anything i o where they have the sense that unless you are going to be a pyou know top one persent in something it is not worth trying but they can still find a what most people describe as pleasures they might hey enjoy food i maybe little too much a they enjoy a i'll call maybe a little too much they enjoy chremedia or viyou games maybe little too much i say a little too much because it it is providing more or less a ai sink or or a reservoir for their aggressive and pleasure drives that is not moving them forward in that the standard milestones of live i i i hear about that a lot i i see that or lot it it is as slightly more i'm complex a finatype than describe iong for is just simply the amotivated or non motivated person but what does one yet what do you think of of that aof the fiantype ie just described because were unique rit each person is unique or the weefit categories rit their categories a person there could fit that could be different for what i'm saying but i think most people to sat on balance rig what is what is most prominent i i think what is most prominent in that situation is there is something out of balance in the generative drive and what o you see a lot of times is the person is a generative drive in the that is higher than their ability to to realize that drive the generatve drive then is frustrated i gve an example in o real true story of a person who worked very very hard gone to school for a long time and it achieved a very high paing job and that was the goald rigt is a prestidious job is a high pang job and the person for a while wat was doing quite well added and ito things whet o relatively rapidly and n egative directions may be for a little while the persons doing oqet then the person becomes very negligent of themselves and their environment when they are not at the job then other the houseis of mass things or dirty the person is wasting time with things this is a person who enjoys it was not exactly vidiogame ter las ilet us say it could have been right well enjoys them to a certain degree and can really gain pleasure and feel good about the time spent right beside spending too much time right now what was pleasurable saas becoming a distraction mechanism right and than what that transition to was overuse of alcohol rght now you have either something that is actually destructive and was negative to job performance right towards the person this was not a person who as drinking a lot before and this is a person who is miserable when they were drinking or they were sert of wasting their time right and were aware of all this well it was a very clear problem which is that person had no interest in what they were doing none whatsoever it felt the majority of waking hours were spent in an automaton way but being awake and aware of the tedium of it the frostration of it an national side that they such as had very little a intrinsic curiosity yor desire to do the job that they were sexiicagly doing right which comes out only after exploration because it seems what is going on with this person an tersonasic a job and ther life was going really really well and and they are doing well financially and is this person trying to now overly indulge themselves whielit as out why they'r drinking what is going on right and what youfeels that this person of strong generative drive and was it met one little bit by what he was doing which was creating such frustration inside that the person was either taking himself on line or doing something that was punitive and self injurious and this is a reals ury the the person exchange that job for a job that paid a tenth of what the job they had paid and the change in the person's life was amazing i did not know the sky could smile ight he became happy he loved what he was doing he sold a larger house bought a smaller house it beautifully he was happy ight that is what he needed to be happy because then the generative driving him he loved what he was doing at gets enacted it gets express and then other other things can come than into line right he is not being over aggressive towards himself and drinking too much because hes sang or to help with you to the world around him and to himself right he is not taking something that serves a purpose in his life again if the example had been vidio games it would be a great enjoy doing that ex amount of time and lite go do that and get gratification from it as opposed to then over relying on it and then it is not providing gratification becomes a distraction those things came back into balance in his life but there had to be the understanding and i think there is a lot of that in people who have a generative drive in them that they feel is frustrated by a world around them that is not co operating now do i think we can understand that in change that in the vast majority of people who are in that place yes but it has to be looked at first right cause when it is not always that its just that a lot of the time right it has to be understood what is it in that person and then how do you go back to those pillars and look at what is going on that the person is in that place because the world can bring us a lot of difficulties right and that person who now is saddled with a lot more loans then they expect lik i've tremendous compassion for that sympathy for that lik that is real right people can be up against a lot of things and that is just one of them right but it does not mean that life cannot be okey it does not mean that but the person has to feel that there is some way tef to understand enough about themselves idocate this is wha t this is and i cant see what this is and why and how i'm here and from there i can start to plot arol to something that is better because yes we have our difficulties and we can have a lot of them i but isn for the vast majority of us is not their not surmountable we have to just understand them and let us say f that person goes and i'm gong to get some help and they go and some one tos o ker you you get ten sessions of cogna to behaverolfara being trying halgin that persine think differently then they will feel differently look cogni to behavri fherapy has its place ight but it is not going to solve that rightly that person ees understand something about themselves not redirect their thoughts to better place right if the persine gets a reflex because that reflext works well for the system right it reflext works well for this system that is treating that person for the medical system te insurance system that person isni't helped one bit i and may be a medicine can help right maybe a medicine help suggest take down the anxiety in the tension in the person and the person can sot a think more about it and and truly medicine did help this person because the idea of leaving the job an leaving the prestige and leaving the money is that ocated do i could generate a lot of anxiety and it help the kind of bring the temperature down a little bit of that that he could think about it engage in thera be ultimately navigate to whre he wanted to be then we get back away from the medicine medicine has a roll but it if he just got medicine i mean what are the possibility what the ods of that helping zero right is is it is not going to make the answers unless somehow the person feels a little bit better and figures it out on their own it is not how it works rights o medicine has its place but a kind of therapy that recognizes te limitations of medicine in most situations and is designd to really help the person understandlike that is what we need the example you gave is a spectacular one because syou mention medication had its place perhaps even redirection of thought in some sines hadens place because as i recall it under the the pillar of function of self iin one of the the the key f items a issalience what we pay attention to internally or externally what our internal narratives are but a in staying with te example of this individual again as a as a phenatypic a example for everybody to to learn something from the asking of better questions about oneself as really what leads to the understanding that better forms of inquiry rike the to me the these are the these better forms of inquiry a btter questions are really the a carty of oscular exercise the strength training the flexibility training the mobility training cordination training of physical health just translate to to mental health right it is interesting ripieg as think about it in the example i gave both the the theripe part from through the system right that the sb t has a place right and the medicine part also haw to place both of those things have the role but if we build the whole story a this is what this isiness is higher can be helped around those things we do not help that person at all in fact we ultimately if you take on balance you take all comers we end of doing harm but in some ways ifvi we stay with the a the analogy of physical ealthou be the person who wants to get in shape and than they get aa m not picking on pelaton a as a brand but yous a stationary bike and they they peddle every morning and they lose weight their bloodpressure goes down they are doing better but then at some point if we we know for with certainty that if you just do the same form of exercise over and over again liy sooner or later you gan to get over use injuries thats the lower back piece and another piece and anu become out of balance i there is just but i guess this is stealing from the lanc's armstrong book a but it is not about the bike very deven it is not about the bike it is about the elevation of heartwright it is about the a whatever other healthy activities go along with exercising for sing in the morning and the all the things tha you are not doing as a consequence of ercising in the morning it seems to me that these these a better lines of inquiry is the path to a better mental health a better life a that sit under these pillars of structure orself function orself are really the key in this example right the parallel that you made is even more dramatic it would not be h a the stationary bag right because the stationary bike is achieving a lot of tends right it would be more telling the person you should walk more briskly when you are going upstairs riling that is a good idea but that is not going to make the change right the idea that some s b t some medicine make sense it is more that right is not that walking where briskly up the stairs is not a good thing it is that wwe cannot build the story around your whole health is going to change base upon that aand then that is thit is a problem than if the person thinks just walk more briskly up the stairs and you will be healthier because when it does not work now they have failed right and this gets use a lot in mental that person failed the sthere be failed that medicine right and and gets also ironic because that is often what the person internalises well they failed because we set them up one hundred per cent for failure right because we took things that have their role at least potentially have the role and we build the whole story around them because that story is convenient for the systems that are providing the care ifs pit is convenient for the health care systems is convenient for the insures se b teep packages very nicely and you could see how if you start changing thoughts and how they make you feel even you can get some movement on the surface even if there is no movement underneath right and again i'm not saying s b t is bad but to see it as the whole answer guarantee's failure in many situations same thing with the medicine if you build the whole story just cause it is convenient and and by enlarge medicines are cheaper than people right you can prescribe medicines very reflectively psychaterous with fifteen minutes with ta patient that they cannot then see back for a couple of months how does that go well the answer is it only goes well the way of broken clock is riht a couple of times twice it twice a day right i mean som look sometimes it goes well where just somehow it works out in the that person can do a littlebit of therapein fifteen minutes and choose the right medicines but by enlarge we do those things because theyr convenient for the systems even though that is why he people do not get better likht we think they would that is why they stay in system that is why they come in and out of emergency rooms that is why they are not able to stop the drugs that end up in only being stop it when the person dies this happens all the time and we do not stop it because we are coming from a perspective that is limitd that is not saying let us take a step back and look can we really help some one can we really help that person understand can we help that person make change which ultimately would be of course much better for the person and much better for society but is also better if we just look at bottom line dollars an sense ight because the short term view of it is cheaper to day to ave a psychatris at a fifteen menute appointment reflectively prescribe an medicine that is cheaper to day is that cheaper a cross time when that person is utilizing more resources of their in and out of emergency rooms it is short sighted with which fits with many ways and howr society works right that we want gratification we want gratification rapidly that is why a person would accept at their problems could be changed by medicine bi bek ond a condition that way well of course ther's the the cost we do not see which is that person does not get the opportunity to express their generative drive and the and the the consequence of that is incalculable right yes and if we take a step back and we look at that i think that what we will see is that we have it is not quite that painted ourselves into a corner bust the idea that if is a beautiful tapestry that is the size of the wall i that you can see that only standing back from it riminess goes back i think itcouple thousand years tit this is suit of thought an idea but if you come up too close to it and you keep cannot see what it means any more and we are up close to it that we are thinking well h could how could one perameter change and can can this person get at fifteen minute visit sooner rather than later rabit this medicine instead of that and than slike our noses are right up against the tapestry and we do not see that we are not doing right by individual people a lot of the time and we are not doing right by society which then if you stop and think about it we are not doing right by us is any one of us could be in that position and many of us have been in that position being on the other side of things and really needing help and needing to understand any of us can be there if we are failing a lot of individual people and we are failing the society it is the matter who we are listening to this ultimately we are failing ourselves i'd to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ate sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity i'e spoken many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the fact that getting a quallity night's sleep on a regular basis is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well everything goes better and when we are not sleeping well or enough everything in terms of mental health physical health and performance gets far worse very quickly one of the keythings to getting a great night's sleep as to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep you need your coor body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed you need your coor body temperature to increase by about one to three degrees that all becomes very easy when using and ate sleep mattress cover because it allows you to programm the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning m it will end towards the end of your night when you wake up i started sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover over two years ago and it immediately and persistently improve the quality and depth of my sleep and as a consequence i wake up feeling far more refreshed i have enhanced mood focuss an alertness throughout the day if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dock calm slash hubermen to save up to a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u ssa canada u k select countries in the eu and australia again that is eight sleep dock calm slash hubermen let us therefore talk about what does work yu and again placing on the shelf the the fact that medications can help and se b t cogno behaviour there we cannot help but it' they are just but to components of a much larger picture the map that we describe briefly at the beginning of to day's episode and that is by the way available as a donlotable p d f in the shownote captions if people on to look at it visually and that was described in a lot of detail and episode one which i hope people will take the time to listen to because it is rich with depth of understanding and i'm certain everyone will learn a ton about themselves and others simply by listening to your words it im absolutely certain of that that map provides essentially description of the bins the cupboards to look in o to arrive at better answers and and even the sorts of questions that one might ask if we could just talk about that in the contects of the example that you gave of this person who made this really incredible choice to move away from this hierpane job im they were over indulging in in certain a maladapted behaviors and again we will use this example but im this example is but one of an infinite number of examples that we could use of the person who ise in a struggle iht they are doing something that is not working for them and the'r also not doing things that they know they ought to be doing mok im this is important for eople to to understand because there goan t be people out ther ther thin he ought this poor guy he is making tons of money poor him but he was experiencing deep e's mother lack of satisfaction it could it could have been the reverse example the person is not in a job that that brings about enough wealth for them at a to thrive ri cause the're financial realities to life hes just one example right rght ut it is a good one i think because the prison left the money right 's i wot would make you leave that rightan is what wl would make you leve at as if you were miserable in the situation with that and you are happy in the situation without it riht it is about leaving misery and and finding happiness that is if you would be willing to share with us a little bit of your mind set during those sessions meaning the sorts of questions you askd him about the structure of his self or to reveal the structure of his self and the function of his self that alowd th both of you to eventually set him down this a far better course what is better than moving away from frustration and over indulgence in maladaptive behavior to deep satisfaction pieace contentment and delight an to become a generative human being right we can look in each of those ten cabinets right las that we look in the unconscious mind cabinet there is not much there rht when the person was growing up it was very clear that having more money and having a job that impressed people was was an important thing he internalize is some of it some of it is unconscious but by in lor she is aware of it and an ta was reveal to you how hyou know you would ask him a question about u you'nly tell me about your out bringing and he would say yet money was import in my family but we i always felt we had enough what he was not super wealth hy would had enough and when you say there was not a lot there do you mean that there was no kind of exmarks the spot or it blinking red light wo there is something really in his unconscious mind that is in his way is it to have that right it wo more because it was conscious right he was aware that it was very much beat into him right this is the only way to be o cat right it is s to have a precidous job that makes a lot of money right but he is aware of it if he were not aware of it we have to bring that to light right but he was awares that gook t has a big impact on me it makes it hard to step away i know i do not really care that much about the money but i also can do surely money he must i rus say money cannot buy happiness but it certainly can buffer certain stressers in life runny nobody we canhe sometimes he hear people have a lot of moneysthing money cannot buy happiness caus he non a lot of miserable rich people but lik yo it is very different to have a a two night nurses to take care of a baby than to be the person who has to stay up all my taking care of a tid especial were a single mother verses or a mother that has a partner who is 's willing to pitch in oi e just cannot co bear and why that is that is absolutely true in this case we are just looking at money as money as an endpoint right the idea that no matter no matter what how ow secure and safe is more money better right and he ad an intrinsic overvalue of that right it made it harder to step away from it because he he was overvaluing it he knew he was over valuing it just in enough itself liting for what it gets you right but for the psychological meaning of it right then we look at his defensive structures if we look in that cupboard yeu see that the they have really shifted right they shifted from healthy places now there sort of twisted and distorted and he is doing a lot of denial a lot of avoidance a lot of rationalization right tha he is enacting a lot of aggression towards himself and he is progret he is he is doing a lot of projecting ladies he is harming himself with the aucal is punishing himself ik his defensive structure it can be healthy we know that because it was healthier right but witthen we see that it is twisted we learn a lot from that right a lot is conscious in this person the defensive structure can be healthy because it was healthy but it is eventually it was healthy what was healthy before i see it was healthy before that it can be healthy again right he has it in him to have healthy to fense is tageous sight of getting away from him as he felt less and less satisfied with his job and more and more angry with hemself and more more miserabl this is a really kee point for me and everyone else to understand throughout the years of high school and college and friends and things of that sort i would hear this i used to be really good it fitness or i used to now if i had a dollar for every time one said you should avesee me in high school the person who lets themselv go an an argubly is very busy with with professional duties and family duties and ouu can understand why their time is more compressed im than it was when they were in high school but none the less you hear these sorts of tings all the time i used to have this sense i could do things or that things could work out or that and that it is as if there was a previous version of themselv that is completely atrophied and the new version of themselve for the the later version of themselves rather it just simply does not have access to that any more li lat is act of trama ye right o rig whether it is big trama or it is o a big ethant or its multible things oh tha the worldis is not rewarding me i'm trying the worlds not rewarding i'm trying the worlds not rewarding me than people become dispirited it i demoralized it is the trama of that that takes away ththe sense ifself the sense of agency i thought i could do things before now i do not think i can do things right but but nothing is really changed in me i mean that that is that is a problem right than it is a problem the vast majority of times it is born of trama it is that the surly mean early child hod trama or this was it could be later life trama i been one o the thing's that i i about what you are saying much is that you the psychiatrist is hears i used to be able to do something well or feel well and and that is it sounds is a a signal it is really a beacon of health that still exists in the person but that they are out of t otch with i think for for most people when they thbut themselves are people who talk about how they used to be functional an some domain and theyre no longer functional in that domain any longer it sounds as if things are fundamentally broken is is as of a piece of them that was that was functioning drifted out of their body and left right but i love the optimism a right because i think much of what were interested covering today is not just what is not working and why but also what is working and why and what used to work and why and and the idea that within these cupboards there can be the discovery of a problems a clearly that is why one goes to the cupboards right as we are defining it but that am there are a lot of answers there are the're rest the ingredients for success already exists within us right right especially if we know we have had that ability before right was we know that we had it was a thing about in this man he he felt that he could not make change now he is stock right iii i got a lot of things done i was able to to get myself into the school and achieve this and and then get this job he could do all those things but now he feels he cannot do anything to make himself happy ike we know he could do that he had a strong sense of agency he does not now right and and people often do that they feel a sense of loss natural i 've had this happen in myself it feels somethings cut out of yow and if something hollow i had that thing and now i do not right hence the unbroken unhopeless the things that we heare over and over and over again think about the shift in this person what is actually going on which is not that hard to discern we just pay attention to it that if we run up the structure of self we say look i not a lot of it is ruded in the unconscious mind right that thereare are problems of over valuing certain things but they are in the conscious mind he knows in his household over dinner it was dadermom a o being proud of of some dollar amount that i new i chieves oit o that narrative t exists in anhes yily money was a big gdeal in my family kind of thing by he wy i'm not seing ambout my family but rarely reather discussions about money ther are discussions an other things of course but in in this hypothetical he knows not gret a real patient sorry g he knows he overvalues it right he he knows it independent of what money buys and what he needs and all thike he just puts too much importance in money and he knows that right soka their conscious mind issues he is pretty aware of them and the pretty conofset in him those ore the issues and there there oke we learnd that then we go look at his defensive structure boy that is very very helpful to talk but whi youad a very healthy defenseof structure what were doing before lot of sublimation right hed you islain sumblimition it take anxiety tention something something negative in theself or ther could be negative any channel towards something positive ready channel that energy towards learning righty channel some of the aggressive drive right into sense of agency that ha got achievements o you look in said right those that a'm net work right of of defense mechanism comes up out of it unconscious mine was looking pretty good right it was pretty clear light was coming through it and a in a way thit was not distorted and now we coan look a while that things are pretty different now right is as he sang now it is ocalic what it would he mean a i spent ten hours of my week and utterly wasting time and what what is wrong with that right or yo no he is rationalizing even that he likes to drink when he does not because he mattered himself the defensive structure now is twisted right e he say oke we that is a big observation right and then the character structure when we look at that we find a person who is pretty good t figuring out and understanding things and coming right up to the precipice of change but is a long history of than difficulty making the change right i know it and amon the verge of it by i cannot bring myself to do it that is in his character structure by the wayis such a common th him i made people that no better know they know better sometimes yeu almost have to wonder whether not it is it is a medication in the pocket they could take it if they wanted to that that might even give them some comfort but they just do not do it they just do not engage in the proper actions to move their life from one place to the next right and if we look then at the level of strivings he does know what he wants he he wants a feeling of content mit is really what he wanted was a feeling of contentment a feeling of it i'm taking good care of myself i'm doing something that is a value i'm enjoing doing it a he wanted those things and even when we talked more he had ideas of what jobs would do that in the beginning he said he had no ideas what he really meant that he said to me but was also saying to himself as i've no ideas of jobs that would meet these requirements for me that pay as much as the one i have right but but within him which we got to were were he knew that there were jobs it would make him happy he just had to get over that they were lower pang think of what we learn about that is nothing lost in this man there is nothing caugt out of him that he is not damage he is not hopeless and now he can understand that and that he understand iself actualy pretty well right and and his conscious mine is is apprehending pretty well what is going on and where he wants to go but boy as he has not taken good care of himself the defensive structure gets ort of ward and that it makes it a lot harder to take care of yourself its uch making other problems in life and he starts feeling lousy about himself maybe i cannot do much of anything right why because work is not going as well because he is drinking too much and if woll performance goes down right we can see that an thand what is of most interest there is that there is a character struct u that can come right up to the precipice but not but not pull te triggers o to speak on what the thint the thing the prerson wants to do because now we start getting oh heh and understanding of what is actually going on right and then if we look at function of self its look in those cabinets too right to help can be mre aware of there is an eye here which he was pretty well aware of but not enough lie there is a person here om shepherding through twenty four hours in the day right i am and i and i'm aware of what is going on inside of me and i can make me happy we can make me miserable it let us let us let us be more aware of that how did ye go about doing that because i find this this first step within addressing the function of self self awareness and really understand that there is a there is an there is an eye there is a me and am moving myself through life i find this to be interesting and on the one hand kind of obvious ay there is iters me tangible thing you look in the marry you see yourself but at the same time it is a bit abstract i think to me in to many people oufilin how does one go about building up a sense of self in a way that provides positive agency in the world is it to tell week here all the time at these affirmations and i'm sure there are people look at themselves in the mirror and say you are enough in these and i'm not making fun of these people righti shall have my own internal amlist that i i tell myself on waking every morning which has nothing to do with positive affirmation is just ashlly defining the different rolls that i play i do not know why this is useful to me but i find it incredibly useful to me u it reminds me who i am it also reminds or it least reassures me that i do not have aany dimensor yet ah o iyou know we will see going forward but am hopely not but yet let us talk about this this line of inquiry within the the category of self awareness that people can do regardless of whatever challenges at they they might be having or not having what does that look him what you think that accomplishes at the level of self understanding and an agency in the world to one way of looking at that is in this out the words i would use butliwhat is pervading a person and to set set e setin stang i which you can discern by inquiry sos for example in this case the person there is a person right who would really not think this is oquet right this person taking a job at ten per cent of the previous pay in the job as has less prestige right was a erson who would be very unhappy about that and very faulting of that and and talk to this person my patient through the lens of it he should feel shame for that that person's not alive the person is not alive one way of look as what master are you serving right and a lot the given sike the automaticity in him was as if that person was s of alive inside of him really istelling him hollus was in oucetic whis fighting that he was not aware that hay that some other person's voice it was ik esa gom very very conflicted about this actually he was not very conflicted about this way when he starts focusing on the eye i what i actually think wutol actullyu thnk i do not i do not care if i make niney per cent less i do not care my neiter met i put some money away i want to be happy i'm not conflicted but in order to get there we have to look at at the eye how much is that i at senter stage right iin all that i do not mean to tet in some way paying too much attention to this out wer we are all acting through the lens of the eye no matter what we are choosing riht to be aware of that and do i want to be impacted by the opinions of this other person cause i can let some one else's opinions very much and we all do right very much impact my thoughts but i want a kind decide that do i really value that person's opinions i do not want them automatically inside my head telling me how i feel about myself i cannot tell you how many people i know come to me in a place of struggle even o not a clinicion and as i listen to what they are struggling with its clear that they know the best answer in rout forward but that their dealing with some internal oppressive voice about whether not they are a good person or a bad person whether not the choice they want to make is really a good choi ce at all i sometimes those voices are the voices of parents ibe in these particular examples it were the voices of ampeers am and i think o understand correctly what you what you are talking about is getting really firmly ruted in who a person is for themselves and what they really value and what they what they really know to be true for themselves and really trying to not a surely quiet those voices but see those voices truly as other even though they come from with within their head yes at right yes yes to to stop and think what voices do i want inside maybe i want the voice of a kind mentor who still held me to account eno for a very high standar i se good voice to have inside of me io feuros em i my uc i not be a good voice is i say a not kind men tor for whom you can never do anything good enough that is nalso but maybe you take part of that new leaf part of that but t the earlier and more formidive the voices are the more ther in our head automatically li think that that man thought that he was deeply conflicted absolutely hundred per cent e telnt and in as he was right his experience was to be deeply conflicted but when you go in and dig the jac if hou just dig and you and you get to oky the eye is in o assess this these hes not conflicted at all i which is why thif you are coming up the function ofself latter tatin you look at defence mechanisms an action right and what is on top of that sailin i nows when you i creates an immediacy rigt defensce mechanisms and action sort of informe the process and say hay the defences are shifting to denial acting out right and that is what sorter gives us a time horize and this things this is not going to be oque right that if he kept down this path what was very clearly going a happin you will have to roll to take forward that much to see that he is in the losist job right he is can feel very shamed of that a bunch of negative things or ging to happen i helps the person apprehend that there is something going on herelike i'm changing right because ike in someway i'm thinking now that it is okay that i'm wasting ten hours on something that i could really enjoy if i spend ninety minutes on it i bat well i'm kind of losing a little bit a perspective that right it it adds a sence a frames a situation right and the sailients o could you elaborate a little bit on on this defense mechanism in action of acting out now i think a recovered an episode one and i'm sure will come up several times more during to day's discussion about things denial projection displacement et cetera th those defense mechanisms am seem at their own intrinsic definition but acting out is something that we hear more and more about these days their acting out a ut what is acting out is it is it acting out of some conflict am is it trying to a demolish a a struggle by by going an doing something else we can think of it as buy an large an unhealthy manifestation of a lot of aggression which could be a very high aggressive drive or an aggressive drive that is not too high but is then further i its powers further by a negative situation i say this one right because of the the acting out what was going on here inside of this person is he was very very mad right and this is not a person who to express a lot of anger right say or had outlets for rigty he was not going an running ten miles or rght this was all insiht of him he was not getting it out in one way or another what he sirt's doing is he starts acting out the anger now he is angry at the world around him because he is unhappy in it and it is not giving him more choices now of course this is about him and not the world around him right but but he is feeling an anger towards the world that will not co operate right and he is angry towards himself right because ik he cannot make himself happy look look at all this look at all that he did and look how miserable he is riht a way of acting out then wwas is te drinking right becaus a drink is to help with the world right you think i should not be drinking at night and coming to work hong over i i'll do it anyway right to help with the world i ave snubbing his nose at the world right he is also snubbing his nose at him right to help with me right the guy who now does not come across the way he did before because i'm showing up at work not in the responsible way i showed up before ban wets a little dishevelled function is lower to help with me right' for m self denigration let people think worse of me rightcause whyt because im mad at myself that i think it is justified right and then there is also the inviting of if i if i really have eddiction promem here i lose my job is find i deserve that to right becu tht there is an acting out against the self that if the person does not stop and look at that that can become true right cause that person did not really was not built to say to hel with the world and with me or do not even understand it what is to help the with the world meand it also means to help with me and it is nothing for the world or me right but he was able to understand that because we wed look t what what is shifted in you this a person did a lot of supblemation before who now all that is going into acting out they are not taking negative energy and doing something good with it ther the taking negative energy in doing things it are bad with it why because there is too much is a lot of negative energy it is overwhelming everything else and then it is going down these pathways where the the unhealthy defenses are always beckoning us send the energy down here it is easier to avoid than it is toface something and figure it out right it is easier to just act out than it is to hold what is inside of us and then think about why it is there the unhealthy defences are beckoning us and for him to see eyou you have had a healthy defenseiv structure you can be healthy again you are not broken right but to also see the way these defences are going is bringing real risk to you tour to your ability obe happier you get further down the shame and lost path that can be hard sometimes impossible for the person to get back it sets the stage alike this is very very important what these defenses are how they are being enacted and for him to beebeisita a this could be healthy but it is not now yet thes sum slow ayou know degrading forms of acting out and self sabatage an sabatage of others i i think are a pthe particularly dangerous ones because because they are slow and they the sometimes te the change is imperceptibly slow and then one day somebody arrives at a place fore as he set yeou known the for she cannot get back or that it requires you 're going into residential treatment ore things that really big departure yes egealers in order to get back into life and u yen i would never wish for somebody to choose to act out by driving off a cliff instead but but there are other forms of acting out that immediately wake people up but it seems people do not often select those they select these more subtle forms of acting out where they do not get caught and they were they were no one's calling them out on on it because you kow that plenty of people have five or six drinks at happy hour right as appost of fifty u it is itself slow self sabatage i supposed to immediate self destruction and again we are telig about alcohol but we tik about food vidio games social media aarguing with spous somming all f these kinds of things that build up over time to eventually deliver people to a place of of real real problems u i'curious for this particular individual you worked with sounds that is not what happened they they started this process of of self inquiry around self awareness and u did you see that the a saliente that is what they paid attention to internally in externally immediately shifted in the defense mechanism of acting out imimmediately dissolved am in what was the kind of comtour in time and time course it this the as less soso we are looking in the cabinets there is a lot in the defense mechanisms and action cabinet there is not as much in the salient's cabinet because this is the major thing on his mind i above all else an an he is having intrusive thoughts about i and his self talk was about it but we kind of ardy knew that just we knew whit was in the conscious mind you think wores the money at i is not as much in that realm because he is aware of it if he thought i'm not this is not bothering me very much an anything while all his internal dialogue is about it right they oka there is a wat there is a lot to achieve there but just as he brought a lot that was unconscious into the conscious mind was aware of it im it was salit there is less to do there i because the things to understand and change are not residing much there for people that er no doubt everyone as eeng bout their own internal processes and 'm and where they could ask better questions and and arrive at better answers to help themselves along im perhaps he could a elaborate lo it more on this salients cupboard under function of self yo it to me salients is what is most apparent im an and o as you talked about yesterday and again to day yo there is this internal narrative what is on my mind oftener what kind of jumps to mind i'm i've started doing this recently based on our discussions here im and i've noticed that under different states of arousal and here i'm talking specifically about sleepiness verses alertness type arousal ik when i wake up in the morning or when i'm tired in the evening where my mind is that where it defaults to im and what i'm paying attention to throughout the day im is that you just asking myself to notice and i've certainly notice om some a some patterns im i forince as i've noticed at any time im my over all state is elevated more alertness or in the iddle vex i my mind goes to ome i'm not pleasant thoughts im and it is interesting to me it is whil this is strongly correlated wis st tes of internal arousal that are healthy exercise you a within limited frame as is or exercises i in general if done in a healthy way is healthy im and when i'm sleepy those thoughts never come about a when i wake up in the morning certain thoughts tend to leap to mind other thouhts nows the sort of categarization of different types of thoughts depending on my internal state is that the sort of line of incry that you are that you are suggesting or describing here yes as etiges wed half the picture ricaus half the picture would be what is going on in your mind when your mind is tood of at rest right what what is then starts playing itself right in your mind the other side of it is what comes to the for when ther's a lot o competition for attention right i'msemaking this up but but the idea that if he stubbed his toe really badly heed still be thinking about this right caus it is much power now agen maybe if cobity is a badly broken bone is a lot of pain but he sin't think of that firsi but it takes a lot of other stimulus to to be more salient than this right you you can a what is coming in your mind when your mind is hood of free and open that is very very important and relevant and then what is winning out when there is hih rousal state in a lot of competition for attention that is very helpful im again i think a long with this self awareness piece im the asking of oneself on but what is happening in my mind when i'm indifferent dates or throughout the day im and as you are describing now also including when m there other things available to think about does that include how often i'm distracted by a particular thought my comming chimes throughout the day my mind goes from the conversation i might be in to something else oris yes does it high jack your attention tis one way putting in a lot of people im mention to me challenges with intrusive houghts m what can be done about those intrusive thoughts or is it simply a matter of paying attention to the fact that there there and and then thinking about that the origins of those thoughts absolutely one ex that we could have intrusive thoughts because there is trama in your background may be very clear trama that you are not facing an regret and addressing then ov intrusive thoughts a say i'm not safe looki go look for what is still an unconscious morander when it comes out a little bit you put back into the unconscious mind that would be it is a very different ccenaria than in this case this man was having intrusive thoughts about his jop situation is over all situation and it made sense that he was having those intrusive they were markers of the acuity of it i i luky you ive to do something about this or something very bad is can hap and the intrusive thoughts theren his made sense i this is not going well and an your mind is ive forcing you to pay attention to this because time really av is of the essence your real risk now intrusive thoughts can be anything from as they often are they thenkme markers of something this tramatic something is onding neath the surface something that is really bothering us that we shove down that is making guilt shame distress of onability that is that is very often the case but sometimes intrusive thoughts are marke ublike all right that is a thing to pay attention to and once we identify the intrusive thought ment how do we eradicate it i mean how do we i work with it i mean a wtalking about trama now in o of course e might map back to a childhood experience i'm some internal narrative but u is there some rod map for moving intrusive thoughts from a place of intrusive in disturbing to simply theran kind of meh i mean to be wonderful to it a deleate switch but obviously we do not work that wil it lus tak if we could this example it which is little bi different if we if we run through this example of the person in the job because then wwe should talk about from a driven in trusive thoughts which as i in many ways the biggest topic about intrusive thoughts but think of that this person here if we go up from salients we look at behavioris right and behaviour actually now is very very important right this person is drinking theire still going to that job they do not want theyt have not gone an interview for the jobs they want right we start looking at the behaviors that are making problems the changes in behaviors that could make things better right and then on top of that we arrive at strivings and i think when i's talking about structure of self i think at least one time i miss spokans ad said striving instead of self at the top of these pyramids self and striving have a lot of overlap right because if you are growing a healthy self right out of the suitof top of the structure of self pyramid then that self as going to be aware of strivings and and is can be better able to enack them in o his his sensi self was shaken here but he was aware of the strivings for a better life riht now let us the road map its interesting make aus the road map is his road map right if we look in those ten cupbords we come up with a road map and and a road map does not have a spending very much time in unconscious land right because it he is not really need that right if we look at what makes the difference for him what did we do right we really cultivated the self awareness the eye that is making decisions for him we looked at how his defensive structure had changed an the things he did not want to be there now and the good things that were there before and how could he get back some of that how could he tran back towards what was working beforce we start to really look at that and then we go from there really to changing behaviors o it requires a behavioral change which is not to walk up to the precipice of doing this each day but to actually do it right because it was very clear all the vec er to speak inside of who were pointing towards doing it and that that was consistent with this self being healthier that garden growing on top of the structure and the strivings than being realized for him that was the road map and the inthe inthe salients foit was not really part of it because the intrusiveness the salience bias inside of him made sense and that of course it went away once he made the decisions right because hthe intrusive thoughts of youive to figure this out ous to figure this out r iit were not there any more along with the intrusive thoughts of you will never figure this our leg it goes away because he made the change but he made the change cause we looked at self awareness we strength an self awareness we looked at defence mechanisms how they could be verses how they are we looked at the behavioral change which was really necessary and then also referencing a character structure that had has difficulty right coming coming across the precipice right we we sell get us ta baselone characteristic of him we cann't understand that but how do we help him change the behaviors anyway when he does that the self was in a better happier healthier place the strivings are realized this person that stops drinking in the way they were they start doing the the enjoyment aspects of their life they start doing them within reasonable bounds again they are taking care of themselves person smiling that the an now think the generative drive is much more fulfilled what comes on top of those pillars rit is that person is a sense of humility right en nough humility to sound and walk away from this job i do not is okay that the people in the jobbles thank come crazy how could you leave that and and e triggur something in me in some way it is oka relic i do not i do not have to i'm not out there for that i'm not out there for the big thing that everybody is is guiding i can o the humility to go to the job that i no makes he difference and feels good to me ight he is impower to make change he is wern't moving away from dis the disempowerment to the alcohol and the avoid ince ight there is empowerment in humility and an abs ly if he talked to that person on the other side of it looked shortly ase was enacting it right getting just to the other side of it who was much empowerment and much humility which were then brought to bear through a sense of agency that made the changes right that change the job that stopped drinking the dealt with the people who thought negatively of it right through a sense of gratitude of it is not awful that i i on ga to go make less money a lot of people said that to him how could you do it was terrible it i's not terrible right i'm grateful if you ar gon dogan go makein aman of money that that is all that i need right it was that is what helps a person do that thing and that is aturally true right that is what what matter to him enactivated and active a verb sense of agency and gratitud then leads him to the place where there was at peace contentment delight he was delighting in the job that he chose and his generative dribe was in accord with it then an should we we stopped somepone working together he did not need me any more he could lways come back but would not need me any more and he look at hower those last sessions a lot of the last sessions were him lik in an excited way telling me what he was doing rightly gone an we did this an ii did this i figured this atlic he was happy bad in you could see that man's generative drive which naturally naturally is quite high in him but was being squelched right that brings him out of balance now the generative jrib was in quite a good place and he had enough of grassion or assertion right to to go and do that job and to do that well and and even enough to counter anybody who would still kind a rise up and say that was not a good idea he could counter all that he was getting pleasure from it he did not meed to see pleasure by what not even pleasure because alcohol was pleasurable no pleasure because harming himself and saying to help with you to the world and to him was pleasurable right s getting pleasure that way he is getting pleasure and healthier ways taking care of himself doing the job he loves doing his leisure activity the man comes into balance and then life is good and we say e ke come back in to couple of mnths and comes back in to couple of months and mayme in six months comes ack l more time i won'l see him again that is great he told he does not need me again and i atrophed rank from his lie great that is that is the success nata eventually arrived at being truly wealthy with all t with all the components of mental health and pece contentment delight the as you describe his story which is a remarkable one it occurs to me that the narratives that we hear as children and a being powerful yes and i'm sure there are people out there that receive such direct messages from their mother and our father you have to do this you cannot do that but often we get messages through observing and overhearing right the way that our mother talks about our father when he is out of the room the way that our father talks about or mother when she is out of the room and some of this could be non verbal a rolling of the eyes or a somebody saying yes yes a greeing and then they walk out on thes and come blowing in them off reat him an kids ir we are all aware and integrating all of that all the time and i i do think those messages get woven into us at a very deep level and then of course there the unconscious narratives that we build up as we go through in particular i think elementary and middle school in high school and i can still remember i a negative comment somebody made about a jacket that i was wearing the third of the fourth grade i forget everything else tat happen that year remember that yend i'm not i'm not insecure about the clothing that i pick i'man obviously it is it is the black a button down shirt i've had similar shirt since the first grate just kidting but that but we the fact that that is imbedded in my memory systems is jishit speaks to the salients of of negative e of insults basely was 'n itsult a and i'm sure i've insult ted plenty kids an coming up as at to nature and and back and forth and am and but these narratives get deeply imbeded and the idea that one could pick a different path of vocation or your miss the opportunity be truly happy at a deep level based on these narratives i mean on one hand it is obvious on the other hand you just go wo this it this is not good this is that this is a flaw in the in the design it a and yet you are giving us a road map to to understanding and and to a'm overcoming it right las that we take you at your examples we we the great examples hand we we look at that right the the person making fun of the cote in third grate right weresuming it has not harmed you it has not change a course of your life right what is it tell us it shows that negative simuli are very salient right i'm sure you got ot a compliments and third great too right but it is the negative that stands out we just shows that there is a sailients bis in us towards the negative and that is probably about survival and threat sensing in some ways i make sense and around human survival but it does not make sense around human trama right then you woulde given the example of what get's communicate to the child when say mother says something negative about father when father's out of the room father says something a negat about mother when mother's out oft rom just to give an example right children because the the complex cognitive mechanisms have not been formed yet right then the natural way that the brain functions is in a self reparential way right the child generally does not have the capacity to say oh maman dat are not will you getting along well in in this certain way when dasnot here mam vents a little bit about something about him by say he child is not thinking about that right then what the child will often internal ises is okay there is me and there is mamandad and mom says dad as bad and dads as mam is bad and i must be bad too right because in general if your parents are bad then then the child takes that on themselves now again on giving as simple example at i'm very much extrapilating get i mean to imag if that were very very aggressive where the mother as happens right jos tells to child how awful the father is and the father does the same you you not at some ones lok con to come out the other side of that being whamaybe they are both awful but i'm not that is not how that goes right the lessons the the tramatic lessons of childhood get internalise right and they do not even always have a solution stay you think about the man who knew gook you hive to go get this job and all those things he internalise you might say well i mean he got to a good place for him right for better or for worse at least it was a place to go right to to go go workcart go succeed go check this box you have been told your suppose to check but oftentimes there is no solution stay how many children means is terrible that this is such a high percentage of the work ado not practitioners do is is helping people who has children we are told one way or another that they were worthless incapable bad right that gets that gets put into the child unfortunately far far ifiming one time on the planet is too frequent lettle and how lon often this happens that example makes really good sense could we han this is a question could could we add to that the example whereby the child over hears a an examples of what say men should be or women should be the you things t it is not much a you did wrong andrew or you did wrong paul wor or telling a the dar it you screwed up but but it is more a again narratives that we over here or even apparent a showing a delight or excitement about a certain finatype in the world a wile look at that person or look at them t is not she beautiful right that the young child thinks ocable than that is the epidomy of beauty through the lends of the parent or gosh this person iyou know then that that child internalizes that this is the epidomy of disgust with another human being and i think children are savy i without realizing it as ty ok will then i guess you you move toward that and yet and you aspire to that and you deflect from that and you can see how these trajectories can be set very early on i mean that these are the these are the forelane highways that we are talking about it an episode one weare just routs of nurral processing that can bring us to put choices in life and places in lifes that oftentimes yeel i do not want to go down this path any more and and that the exploration of of early narratives both direct and indirecting a first person and third person seem critical how how does one go about that i mean clearly with a trainclination you i you would guide somebody through the process but if somewady word to try and do this and some sort of structured way for themselves an what o those lines of inquiry look because we have vast number of experiences from childhood but some messages are going to be more salient than asur hy that reflect it self scrutiny you can help us i think its is a great idea it is a great concept and and we we do a lot of different things to ty inside and were guided to do a lot of things inside but this i think should overshadow many if not most of all those other things of ike what is really going on inside of me becaus if you think about it a lot of people will come through that and do not learn rihts wh person is told this is what beautiful is this is what successful is this is what good enough looks riht and and that person may through all sorts of experiences ther may be other people in their lives who are more balance be elbo arrive on the other side an that even still sometimes going through the midst of it depending upon age and situation and knowing ka that is what mih my father mother thinks this what beauty is this is what successes but it is one set of opinions and es not a set of opinions that are goin to to fine may somethimes people get to that place but a lot of times they do not and they carry that lesson forward and they are not aware of it right they think that they are very unattractive even though other people re giving them different signals they think that they are very dumb even though other people are giving them different signals in their own grads and their own success maybe giving them different signals right but they are not putting the two things together and that is gin a generate tension right that might be why that person does not follow up on petential relationships right they just do not think they are good enough in the persons venturican reject them because what they look right they taking that with them in this in this example from i old do right ordther they are not satisfied with the job that in other ways is really great right they they enjoy the work then gur thy but does not pay enough right why because they have some false idea inside of what it is supposed to pay right because it is what the parents said was by self screwtiny what are the givens and i always think they co goes back to the mathminer right if you cannot solve the problem go back and look at the givents right what are you taking for granted al i know that every time i see and nact tatex equals for really maybe in it may be wrote down for somehow because you are thinking of for at the time and exactly is a three rihcely just go back and look at what you are taking for for granted right in a lot than tis is what we are doing in the terapby process and han that is when the person can realized o i'm simplifying but for the person to realize oh there is a voice in my head to speak is a natural voice that is the voice of this person right who who may not even be around any more whose opinion does not mean as to me what it did before but that voice is saying you are unattractive you are not making enough money youre not good enough right and it i do not believe that right i do not think it identify that and then you can thet does not happen all at once but you can get it out of you be generally do not get it out of you unless you realize that it is there what is the proce ss of getting it out im because i think that we all have the capacity to remember certain things and and to arrive at a place where we can i'm understand o kay i'm i'm taking for granted the fact that there is a voice in my head that says blank i sey i have a brief anito to say about this in this is not that the cont i have a friend thing that i literally have a a a a female friend wo the other day calle me laughing and crying because im she is beeng avicted from her her apartment and she told her mother about this over the phone and her mother's response was well at least you are thin whi t lekeit nd and and she was laughing and crying about it because it reflected much of her childhood right right they live no other accomplishment of having a job having apartment et cetera you do not mattered it was it was it was about one thing it was about as aa certain form of aecetic beauty that i'm not even sure she subscribes to she happens to be thin right the facke their mother would would lift that from that the conversation there is such a a deprivation of of of many things in that in that interaction but but it really was not about that interaction it was that she was calling me because it was really about her entire childhood right and obviously i'm not equipped to dissolve the problem that it was not a request for money or anything on that sort it was just was almost the the hilarity and the i'm and that the sadness of the whole picture right but again it is peaks to t these narratives that we internalizing that sometimes show up in in very glaring ways in the real worlds to hear that i think was shocking to her i thnk she needed to tell me to it as this real but then it was clear that that message it existed in her head for a long time anyway im that coan be very pivital if she realizes that right and even the power of the humor of a this is absurd right that coan be very powerful in in creating change there some vestige of that inside of her right were she still b leavues gofm not good enough because i achieved aby and see but i do not look act shatever it can avery much out as ere's a lot of power behind realizing that absurdity if i go my that is bazarr but but wat is any that inside of me am i carrying some of that with me i'm is not incentive for self scrutiny and it you threw what you are describing cause what what is the ideal amount of that to still be in her zero is as one comes to realize the messages they have heard or perhaps in this case that they are still hearing is the process of overcoming those messages ane really arriving at the self it sounds to me its a two part process at least two part process its to look in the ben of what are the givens whatae what are what am i taking for granted about the internal narratives and think about their origins in childhood or elsewhere but then also cultivating the self awareiness piece that is under the function of self wai what is really true for me at the level of me th's that that is not the and this is really i think about separating out the voices in ones had these internalized narratives from the person that we really truly are because the ideas that those two pillars and encompass everything we need to look at right that those those ten cupboards in compass everything it is all that right the person whose going and looking t the givens they are try to understand what might be in my unconscious mind that i'm not aware of right and well the the last time i got this big of word at work i this reflects of thought but you are not thin enough well wo right there could be a process that is going on inside of me i do not want that going on inside of me right the procof try what is unconscious in us that may be causing us harm which is often where the that is where the troma goes right it is way is where the childhood troma seats itself which brings us back around to the intrusive thoughts right intrusive negative thoughts and negative self dialogue usually does not mean what it meant to the man who need to change jobs right because ecause there they were there for good reason right then yo needed to make change more often there the the the vestiges the hang over the lingering badness of some prior trama often times when you think we talked a little bit yesterday about the person who was driving in the car an just tolling themselves over and over that they were that theyre loser right and then they they cannot achieve the things that they achieved when they stopped to doing that i'm simplifying a little but that is the basics of it rigt because the the intrusive thought's the self narative all the negativity in us is often coming from places that are in the unconscious mind right not always but this idea that i do not think i'm good enough iom saying to myself over and over again while let us go back and look at wi because the answer to that and lies in a different place as just a different road map right the men who needed to change jobs had a road map that spend a little bit of time in the i self awareness ind than a kind of than it went through self to a defence mechanisms an action land and it spend a lot of time with behavior and then it got up to the strivings that is his that is his road map where as for some one whose laboring under the intrusive thoughts the negative self talk the automaticity the givens of thildhood trama than needs to go to a different place when ow we are spending time with in the unconscious mind thinking about what is there figering out what is their bringing things to consciousness right that person say realizing maybe your friend you had this realization of all my goodness we s a wot to that bring something to the conscious mind in her if great let us look at that and let us look a lot at it and let us look a their other things there too right are ther other givens right let us bring them the conscious to consciousness what we can talk about them we can identify them and then look at how does that how dos that relate to defense mechanism in character structure and now what are we doing a a process of of interested inquiry this is really interesting a me should be interesting to the person doing it it is them right and it should be interesting to the person doing it with them right as if you are atherapist it is not interesting to you need another job right ' yore talking to a friend that if its a friend is going to be interested there is an interested honest open inquiry with the idea of homic ween let us learn things that we can make change for the better and even those we talked about yesterday the intrusive thoughts and the self dialogue that is gone on over and over and over again it does not go away easily but that doesnit mean it does not atrophy over time and go away or that the person can have that reflective thought oh there is the thought again that i'm a loser or that i should cut myself for i should drink or whatever it is i know that thought appears in me automatically at times because it was in my head for long but it does not telling me anything it is an automatic thought that thing i should drings at to me anything right other than the fact that o that is what happens in human beings that is how the self understanding brings change in us and gets us over the barriers if i've been trying this for an what modern mental health a ot them tos think i i took the selects that i did the ten sessions of sevy teelik i'm a failure nothing will ever get better a different framing that is a day this can get better over time in my understanding in my efforts my thought redirection my behavioural changes all makes it better than those things i do not want in my head they are going away it is taken time but they are going away i'm relieved to hear you say that one can have intrusive thoughts and that one approach to dealing with those is to acknowledge them and look at them and not try and push them back deeper you do not not trying to radicate them i'm i'm familiar with having intrusive thoughts not all the time but it verys perts throughout my life and i'm the idea that one can just extinguish them as is a great idea but thats simply not the way it is worked at least not for me but i have found that if i you will just okat this is spontaneously coming up through the norl circuits of my subconscience and ind they are intrusive and i do not them but i eventually arrive at exactly the place that you describe which is that there is nothing actionable here it is just they go from being u intrusive and and troubling to intrusive and just kind of mildly irritating to intrusive and ok ynow ii just om a you kow an yess i i go through some redirect trying redirect my attention from time to time when they are happening but i ventually just get to a place where it o case just a boring story or or or boring imatery there' there is nothing there there is othing there and then an the they eventually break up clouds ve not ant progis tating a while but right oms you took the energy out of them r you made them go away which happened over time and than the energy that was powab toms less and less nless and what happens they dissipate e atrophy ay that is how they go away because here is no more power there is no more power an thet and and that really is the way that we make change and i think your emphasis upon the fact that it takes time the fact that it takes effort the fact that it only goes away slowly over twenty years of of at times being a therapist what i've seen be the most daunting the thing that makes people just give up and go away and go back to the things at very bad you have up on themselves or that it takes time and if you think it is supposed to take two weeks and the world around you'se kind of leading you to think that and then you go for help and the help kind of leads you to think that whether it is two weeks or its ten weeks if it is going to take two years you'eging to go away disheartened ry ormay be more angry at yourself may be demoralize we we have to look at the truth of all this i ti parallel to your story in my own life for for years and years and years i carried a negative voice inside there is always waiting for me to do something wrong if i say something that is a little bit offer not exactly what i want to say now it would say that was not good oaus ss something negative inside to me ore it is waiting for m to drop something and say thi'm stupid and clumsy i with me all the time but over time through self reflection through theripy through a lot of hard work but a desire for things to be better and a desire to understand it i it is not there any more i mad every now and then it will raise its head right i'll i'll do something really i drop to cup of coffee have not done in ten years and it made a medice and now people of coming to clean it up and mand the voice came back right but i could recognize it i i really feel bad about this and now it gives that voice a chance to come out but it does not come out much any more weretway i lived with it for years it does not come out wite much any more and when it came out not that long ago i i could recognize i'm not happy i did this of me hope clean it up but it does not mean i'm an idiot right the voice in my head con just go aways it is as as iv been helping it to do for wunch a years now yet i think also important for people to understands that it takes time but that we can all potentially engage in right actions moving towards strivings and hopefulness as we cope with those and trying timinish those internal narratives those intrusive thoughts it is not as if during the entire process you cannot function i man i think that the a it is a cognively and sometimes even physically demanding to do but we can still engage in healthy ways and in the world and we can i'm still trying a avoid acting out and an avoid forms of denial and and as i say this i'm realizing that that the wish for or the impulse to really just suppress intrusive thought born of trama or whatever else it i's really futile it does not con y wites is not in a work we have to embrace these narratives and and not expect them to disappear in a finger snap but but embrace them and see them and look at them and and and be unafraid to look at them and discount where they are absolutly not true i wuld say unafraid to understand right because we nust understand means we must look at what is going on inside of us when i did not that voice but was afraid of it what is going on inside me what is to say about me and i and i'm directing away from it while that is why it was with me fike several decades right but when i start to go look at it i can find an answer to it and it iyou have to look at what is going on in that person because one might presume and maybe people listening are presuming this or mayme not but but e but a reasonable presumption that myt is reflectively happend in a person would be to think that oh when i was younger the messaging i was getting was it you are not good enough right you are not good enough wrighte that is why i carry with me that you are not good enough right but's not that sometimes it is the opposite that i was rewarded a lot when i was younger for doing things in away everyone thought was great right getting great grades and being well behaved new doing all to things that brought a lot a positive reinforcement to me but i never handled well things it fell even a little bit short of that and then it would evoke a lot of shame the oppression inside is not coming from denegration is coming from something different rght which is which is also why this is not a search to blame some one right because sometimes the people who are giving the message their doing the best they can mean some one who saying to a child you are loser that is not oqt right no matter what that is not oqt but but that is ofted not how it happens i can that the parentlyus is communicating they do not realize that tthat every time they are admiring a certain lovel of wealth for a certain kind of beauty thour giving that message that the child that that does not meat that or isnit ends up not meating that is not good enough but they do not know that or id my my parents tri to nurture me and the did a good job of it in many ways and teachers did a good jobut they theyd realizing this persons can end up a bunch of years for now not thinking anythings get a good enough and ev they do not know that it is not a search for blame and i think that is very very important very important because often people do not want a look inside because they think either i'm going o fine something dramatically wrong with me and the answer i would give is there is almost surely not something dramatically long with you if you are having that thought and if somehow there is you are better off looking at it now than later right and that is part of it the other part is that that people become worry that they are going to ruin something you known an i my parents and if i go look at this i'm gooted i'm goo i'm going to hate them an people say sathing to think things that and the idea that we may get down to something that really involve someone being responsible for something bad now that is if that is the truth the personalrity knows that inside the vast majority of times they know that they are just not facing that but most of the time also it is not that is just cookgat that is how life evoved and what is a predisposition i was smart enough to get good grades and i have a low threshold for shame and people reenforce me and and aik i can cannot understand that then i can get control over it it is not a search for angr fustration blame of self or others ye an oftentimes i i hear that people are afraid of dealing with these deeper issues ore addressing these deeper issues for fear that they will lose say theyre they are drive right that the thing that makes them successful in the first place and that allows them a perhaps even to afford therapeor afford the time to think about these sorts of questions it seems to me that the drives that you refer to earlier the generative drive the aggressive drive in the pleasure drive are such critical nodes er airy us to look for all of us in terms of f you are not whetheror not we are doing well or less well according to some features that are pretty much universal in people s i' sualy what i'm saying is i'm at least by my understanding we all hae ve drives to some extent or another and to e extent that our aggressive drive is very high and pleasure drive is very high and buthe not it is pointed in the right direction it can be generative if it is not perhaps it can undermine our generator drive i very curious to know how you have observed the different o ranges of these drives and people and how that predicts weather or not people will do om more or less well in different areas of life sonctually how the diffen drives play out think that the first thing to say is where the drives are at to speak in in any of us is a combination of nature and nurture n the nature part tells us the range that the drive is going to be but because nurture means much to humans as as we understandi from epigenetics from from the advancement of science we see more and more and more how much nurture matters the range that is denoted by nature is probably pretty broad when we we see the manifestation of that and that the nurture lets us then move that drive now sometimes nurture that is not gone in the right place can move the drive in the wrong direction i but as as adults as people who cand take care of ourselves who can learn about ourselves we can change where the drives are seated it is not an easy thing to do because it requires a lot of changes of self of self knowledge and hard work and but we can do it we can change the the sort of array of how those drives are manifesting themselves within us and we see that and tat's part of the hopefulness of mental health treatment mit that we see not just surface changes but we can see changes on a deeper level anin it is important that these things are not fixed although there are some natural element ou knof some one who may have a natural of low aggression or low self assertion a case can be in the lower range but it does not mean that it is locked in it any one particular point and that the place that we want to be what is the place that is consistent with the th ngs that we want the the agency and gratitude as verbs and the a the sense of well being and all that the the idea is the state of health as the generative drive as as prominent thats its the dominant drive and then aggression and pleasure which is still active in us but their subserving the generative drive and that is the state that we wish to be in when we are asessing looka why why s er something that does not feel o caor something that is not going oqu t than one way to start it is to look at ocate what is going on in the person what may be off in the drives that gives us a very strong idea of oka what is going on away of understanding what is going on as we then go and look in the ten cupboards to figure out the specific lookat what is actually going on here that we can then change but the framing of what is going on can come through the lens of looking at the drives and how their manifest in us what does it look when the aggressive drive is very high and the pleasure drive is also very high if these drives are running too high where we end up at is in a place of envy an an envy i amoys or on the soap box about envy because i think envy is just wildly destructive and if the aggressive drive is very high the person say in in one way of a one ways can manifest itself is wance more and more and more a dor not getting satisfaction from anything but they want more that may be because of a strong vunerability inside of them something that might map to to narcicism for example there is there could be a strong aggressive drive to get more and that leads to something thit is very unhealthy the idea that i want more i need more i do not have enough i cannot get enough than foster is envy itwhich is the the not the desire to be better or to have more but it is just the desire to feel better a ol the self whether that involves raising the self up or bringing someone else down as why envy is destructive very high levels of aggression that are not tempered for example by a generative drive that that would also be hive than creati circumstance of envy and the envy is destructive and the same happens if the pleasure drive is very very strong if one continues to want more pleasure i cannot find any satisfaction i do not feel good about myself i feel berift ind side right and and i see that a pleasure can make me feel better but just for a little bit right than it fades away and i want more of it i want more of it that also can lead to the place of envy that is the outcome if the aggressive drive is running very high or the pleasure drive is running very high or if both are rinning very high but it only takes wane it in order to end up in a place of envy if the generative drive is not high enough to overcome how high the aggressive drive is which would mean than the aggressive drive would be sublimated towards good productive things who take the energy and put it towards something that is goodness but if the aggressive drive is was way out their head of the generative drive that ends up in a place of envy as does the pleasure drive if i want more and more and more but i never get satisfaction from from anything it never brings me any sense of goodness that where it ends is in a place of of vonability and resentment rigtas envy involves wanting more right and and envy if we look at what is really going on envy under the surface involves wanting everything right if if a person is at the outer limits of envy right which is why envy is destructive because if i cannot get enough pleasure and there is much aggression in me thand i'm not going to make myself feel better but what i cendo is make other people feel worse i wan't ask you more about envy but first i want to ask is one way to characterize the generative drive and to distinguish it from the other drives is to say that generative drives are pro social meaning they tend to bring about benevolent interactions between people in the sense that procia social a as constructive right as as ins is building goodness than yes because it is the drive in us that makes us ane to love and nurture things right that makes us one a learn and and sometimes learn to make better in the world or learn for learning's sake that ther that the drive is a drive of goodness if the drive is then god itcan enact itself in the world around us it is going to be pro social wthwwe exist as social unit is right o mean if we decide why want to be an island off somewhereli that is not healthy right we exist in social units from small a newclear family right to a neighborhood right all the way up to nations and toto the planet if we if we perceive the truth of that that hay there is an interdependence but between me and others and and i see that then the drive will leave to choices and behaviors that are socially constructive earlier you talked about aggression and you are clear to make sure that we all understood that aggression does not nesarily mean violent aggression a that there different forms of aggression mcurious if you could give us some examples of how you have observed am people with high levels of aggression and high levels of pleasure drive as well both male and female and hear without on defaulting disteriotypes i think lot of you ust despite the fact that you have clarified what aggression is an is not iness in the contects of this conversation we hear the word aggression and we think a verbal attack physical attack however the way your describing aggression and the aggressive drive i have a feeling that your referring to other expressions of agression as well if the aggressive drive is running too high and that culd have fac tors of nature factors of nurture by factors of the situation the person is in factors of their whole life but it ends up at the moment in a place that is too high then what that person is doing in one way or another is to try and exert an unhealthy level of control and that can be done in many different ways it can be done in that over way of af jist intimidating people right of of using harsh language for its people can be done by manipulating people thit can be done through passive aggression thart there all sorts of ways that the person can try an exert unhealthy control but that is where we end up if there is too much expression of the aggressive drive in us that make sense and it reminds me of an example for my own life where i for some i should say i've had almost exclusively positive collaborations among my colleagues at stamford and elsewhere i every one of those collaborations as ended in a paper that we were all happy with but more importantly the relationships grew and a were not diminished ight im but i had one collaboration was some one not to be named where it was going very well but i had the need to reschedul an appointment a i sent ahad a note about the fact that my carnea dealing with i had some other things i explained why i need to rescadual the appointment im and did not receive a reply which was a unusual but then eventually received a reply that said well it is clear that you do not want to pursue this collaboration reslict the furthest thing from the truth right and ikes u and i expressed that and then the colaboration was reinstated but it brought to mind some concern for me am because of sort of extreme reaction to in o something a happens amon academics a or any one we get busy with things come up it was important attend to a the car that is and then at some point later they were late to a number of meetings oqe no bideal r academics we thend to run late that is typical of many academics ut then i was late once to a meeting and the essentially left and wrote anymel that said something of the sort i've got my own great ideas i'm no longer interested in pursuing the collaborate and i was pretty shocked right because uam there was nothing really outside the ordinary in terms of business and prefassorial schesules and nd therewere other people involve postocs and things that nd there was a great project to be you not to be worked out i remember being disappointed but also really can surprise but then when i mapped it back to the earlier example of the rak hards and i thought well li that there is a real umor lack of ability thi's person to handle disappointment and yet they are exerting or demonstrating rather some o the same behaviour of casionally running tardy in these kinds of things am and i remember feeling thos pretty gressive ike's a retty aggrassive reaction to something that el coud havebeen handled with a conversation now i must say i'm very grateful that the colaboration did not proceed and it went elsewhere and worked out great and they are doing great and we are doing great and a no hard feelings but am it stands out to me as it as a pretty salient example of a gression but not played out at the level of yelling or anything there is a hostivity in there but then there is also kind of a a kind of entitlement and here of course i'm only looking at the other person's behaviour and i should acknowledge i realize cancelling not good being late not good but listen i'm a human being and i you cannot at once you were late as is this is adit this is inhabitual this is human stuff right right and and a lot of am a lot of good work had gone into the project i and there was a cost where a a most most importantly the post oks offered because they were not involved in these inter actions at all and and yet that the project halted at that point am to me that seems an example of am somebody who has a well trong aggressive drive and that is clear from the theyare incredibly successful in in the academic domain i'm an when disappointed you kdo not lashes back or as passive one or one or the other is that is is that one we are getting out here t i'm not surprisingly perhaps that the person rarely publishes with other people rigt obin that does not make a very good collaborative partner right and it is tolly make sensiment ifthink about what your describing here twhich is some volnrability in the person there is some way in which te person does not feel good enough no matter what this person is achieved then there is a sense of of the need and the right to over control when you agree to work together you knowt you did not agree that i'll never have to cancel anything right ut but but the thought was different the framing is different on the on the other hand hat now we we have were in a work together right i'm exerting significant control over you rigtnigan you are not aware of it right and may be he is not aware of it in this casor was ache oh t that was thinking some one different but she has to have some deficite himself that that results and in the reflective need to over control and and think about the first response is a non response right which is that s aggression which jus is just passive aggression right the thought would be whet you your worry something tosn't feel good in you because i did not respond which was true right your expecting a response may be do not know did you get the emale what is happening is he mad as sort of effective to create some consternation and some dissetence in you gt then on top of that the person is willing to potentially at that point sacrifice the relationship right to think about aggression now is not good right this access aggression is not good for you it it also is clearly eclipsing the generative drive right is is not good for this person and the research is not good for this person and the post ox in their lag rght but but the person is willing to accept that in the service of gratifying the access in aggression now then you said something that then to o made at oquet right for the short term o kat thn the person feels gratified whether you apologized or not they took it as you'v to some degree bowed down before me now it will be oq for at least for the short term right but then the next thing that happens actually does end the collaboration iht that is not good right and and you sey even from a self serving perspective that person was collaborating with you for reason right she saw a benefit to the science that she is very very interested in through the collaboration with you but then let that all go right in the service of what in in the service of of the ego right of it might ye i do not feel good enough about myself right the response to that then is it is a responsive envy that i do not that you have the freedom to behave differently then i want you to right do not any that i do not that i do not control you as much as i would to and ultimately it is that envy that becomes destructive it is a set back for that person it is destructive of the science that person was doing it is destructive of the science that you were doing envy is destructive and here the the the high level of aggression the aggressive drives at a very high place it is exceeding the generative drive the pleasure drive is't high enough either itis not enough pleasure coming from the great science that is being done right then the person is approaching the world through the lends of envy right they do not feel good enough they want it exert that aggression through over control and what they end up doing is destructive right and it is very clearly distructs a great example because it is destructive of the science which is a ostensibly the reason that you are there right it is the reason you were there but some one who needs to exert over control is there not just for that reason and then the other reasons can trunk the generative reas and that they are there and that is how envy when when it is the product of aggression or pleasure seeking being too high always unfailingly creates destruction and how different is that from agency and gratitude as active verbs t there is there is a sense of agency but the agency is not being exactly enacted cause if th agencies being enacted in the service of science or career or whatever it may be thit is not that is not going well right and in the gratitude part is not active my goodness i'm i'm here ie hat this great career i've discovering things i get to spend my life and science i get to collaborate with you there many things to feel good about ie postox in my lab right i get to nurture them because i know more and i can guide that that is not leading right envy is not those things which is why people who are doing that at least in this realm of life although this often now this bleeds into other realms of life what you the vast majority of times you see is someone who does not have happiness right in the way that were the happiness with the quotetfay that happiness is tou know the sense of peace ight the sense of of a well being right his this at being able to delight in things contentment right the person does not have that riht and here it is interesting right this person gets to the highest levels of academia and their very successful and they have a lab of their own and their collaborating you think that is all great right but not inside of them it is not bring them those things is evidence by how this person is behaving and and i would bed almost a hundred percent if yous it was that person in other aspects of life at least in the professional realm probably in others too no ones can describe a happy person much of what you just said captures this individual om extremely well and dom it also reminds me that much of the way that you are describing this agr essive drive can also be observed perhaps in the way that people show up to social interactions not nesarily big interactions may be interest interactions between two people what im i'm thinking of here is that the person male or female who shows up and and just kind of takes over ike talks the whole time and tells stories i went to a meale wt the when i a graduate university and some one showed up for the first time t this meal a meaning we 'd never met them before and just sat down and just started telling stories flickand hower and it was interesting portions of it were captivating and then at some who i realize this this is either total pathology this person as is crazy but they were not crazy or they have no recognition that they are absorbing all the oygen in the room as it sometimes describe but it seemed they had this need to just control thewhole environment by way of speech just firehose stories and i've seen this detlyng in the academic realm i've seen this in the nonacademic realm in social settings and and what is interesting is perhaps why this person does this over these people do this but what is also interesting as how people react to it thet on the one hand it i think most people find that kind of obnoxious but there also seem to be people who see this as oh that person as a lot of agency t at the're a leader they they actually grab a lot of the antention that they are seaking and we tend to view those people as kind of empowered i do not actually think that they are necessarily empower but that perhaps i stems from the feeling that the rest of us i to think have which is some sense of a social atiquette where there some given take you walk into room you kind of assess what is the context here i there some listening as well as some speaking ah and on and and when some one shows up in kind of violates all those rules on the one hand it it can be obnoxious an overtake eve ything but s sa before i other's also this the sense a olike that must be nice to just be able to bi be as one one feels am and i get i'm describing this not because i i think people should mmake this type of behavior either way you do not be really me cannot say anything that is on their mind or or just overtake but because i feel it might be an exploration of the suggressive drive and if some one i's doing that or are they trying to lie masks something else u and why do people react to o these seemingly powerful people in this way these things happened in the world around us there independent of the spectrum of gender the spectrum of intelligence achievement right the the the'r human problems a person you are describing whether that person has character structure problems that that are present with them across time or whether the're in a certain place whether it is in life or to day we do not know for sure what the under pinnings but but what you are describing is it is a presentation of narcicism i aner narcicism is rooted not in confidence not in arrogance right it is rooted in vonerbility it is rooted and i do not feel good enough and narccism then then engages with the world through the lens of envy no one else gets to have any time no one else gets to say anything funny no one else may begets to say anything at all right the there is there is a dominance of the room right there is a dominance of the room that comes through an inability to tolerate the back and forth of human interractions right human engagement then that person becomes very dominant and why is that because when they tell a story and they get a laugh or even it is not that funniniss te fifteen story but somebody smiles a little bit or nobody smiles they can perceive in side that i just did that i said that and maybe somebody re pondedpositively feel good about that for a split second now that is gone and they then that the next thing comes and the next thing comes because bpeople who are coming at the world through the lends of narcicism whether it is just in that particular event right or it is a cross life right are never satisfied and nothing ever brings enough goodness nothing ever brings enough feeling of pleasure the person then wants more and that is how the person dominates the room now that can be very seductive right narsisistic people not always but are often very seductive because of that appearance of mastery right of control that person did have wwe could look at it in the short term an say that person had mastery over the room rght no one said anything for an hour but them right they had mastery over the rim tit control over the room but what they are doing is exerting over control right in the surts your penny wise and pound foolish right that but borrow a dollar to day to pay back a hundred to morrow right beause they got to control that room but a lot of people not every one right some people is seduced by it right but a lot of people will take away from that something it is not a good feeling something that was not mutual that does not make the person wantes to collaborate with that person even be in the same space as that person right it is it is counter productive right because the people who might come under the spell to speak rigt they are the people who are brought under the spell right that they'r less observing dynamic you intuitive introspective that th the'r the'r not the people that you want in a sense on your side right the people that would be most valuable to collaborate with even as fault partners have conversations with right those people are going to be put off because even if they do not know exactly what is wrong they know it that did not feel good and they map do i want that feeling more in my life no right that is ththe counter productive aspects wot that is why narsism is destructive be you mights l los nothing destructive in that in tha t interaction but can you have to be standing up close to it that you do not see the bigger picture is when you stand back from that that is not a person whos by and large you see that is not a prisonews interconnected in the world around them has a group of good supported friends has a bunch of colleagues where they cans ofe exchange information and and yokcause all that social dynamic has to happen in the rest of life you seen is situation that is that is counter productive that is destructive and you always see that when people are enacting narcisism whether it is oke but much about things have happened and for whatever reason i'm an an unhealthy place and i'm enacting it right now or if i'm enacting it every day of my life because it is in my characterstructure and i have not recognize and and change it it is always destructive the narcises that i've known and observed almost always seem to have a partner who im clearly supports their narcicism earleast does not speak up very much against it aleast not publicly and not much else except a professional rule im in fact there is one scientists who i did not work with who comes to mind an and the joke about him was always that im this person would talk about themselves endlessly for the first half hour that you run into them and say o ka well enough about me why do not you tell me about me ium this person moved to a different country with their partner comes back every once in a while has assentially done nothing over the last im the decador can left the field and im its conther that secretly the laughing stock of the field a there was a one other anecdote about this person i'm just ii'm not picking on them i'm just trying to explore that th these dimensions of aggression and and an low pleasure a drive an envy im at lad meetings whose it was well known that they they would host a basketball game im but it was well known that you im did not want a score on this person iim because you would i be asked to leave th a lab and indeed several people were asked to leave the laboratory for having made embarrass that the lab had at one of these lab events i by participating in exactly the event that was described in the way it was described and doing something competent right i that the game was essentially way for the person to build themselves up and they were a mediocre at best basketball players it here is this game where everyone is expected to pretend right and i have to imagite that pretend that the person is actually better at what they do than they are and and and in some ways lis it feels a a replicofs of hownor system shows up in many other airs of lifely you said these people are rarely surrounded by people who are actually very bright itself a self effacing et cetera who they tend to gather people that just support them were no one at all because because no reasonably healthy person would we choose to be round that right you c because that that game is a metaphor for all of life for that person it is sending that message see this message and extrapolated out to everything else i wi wi and what is what is the metar for what to communicateg is communicating that you do not do anything better than i do y you do not rise above me interestingly tat you do not arise above me in any why you do not get to know things i do not know you do not coun do anything better than than thn i than i do right or i will be destructive towards you right it is it is fascinating makes i's not about the game right thethe the game is a way of of of communicating that message ri angn the person that even that good at the game why not choose something you are really good at riht cause in the the message is not communicated as clearly right the watis this com itg is unconscious let us choose something on kind of fair to middling at right ay they make it very clear that no one gets to be better or i do something destructive to them man that is exactly what that is and and imagini someone is thrown out of of the lab right mean that this is in many ways o the biggest thing in your life or one of the biggest h as antingenerative i'm an ready the cost of that in the larger world is one less potentially fantastic scientists right and that is the broader that is always the broader picture because the narssist is standing very very close to the tapestry right and as the interaction there is i'm you have squared a basket when i have not right you do not understand the message that you are not supposed to exceed me and now i will get rid of you because you are dangerous to have around right because you do not get the message and and you may exceed me and other ways and also i gean t feel better because i've the power to be punative right even though it is wantonly punative right and uncompletely unjustify but i've the power to do that and it will make me feel good than to push you away and i notice i can be good for you and i'll feel good about that right but that does not last of course thit is why the person continues to do it and it also does not understand at all that that is not good for science right or most importantly that is not good for me right is a graduate studen n that lab as you did not say fire the graduates to make the graduatesoon a leave if the person was not good no it is make the graduate soon leave no matter what the person is doing things that are injurious to the society around us obviously to the specific person they'r targeting and also to themselves and that is where if you follow if you follow envy and youn you see i levels of it in situations that are unbounded s this situation is unbounded in the sense of the person can do that there is no higher authority right raht labs no this is changing and by the way i should back up a second and say that i do believe an it is been my experience the most scientists and labheads are it not naraisas are quite kind our benevolent en they real old quork you were scientists after all but i'm but not narsisis i'm at the same time it is tr ue that for a long time less now laboratories were sort little fieftums there 's very little oversight from the universities and the lab you joined became your entire world and landscape right and there was some exploitation by narsisistic labheads for sure yas you said it was unbounded right tere was no oversight whereas this would be much harder to recreate to day if some one e wanted to and i think that is why by almost everyone listening to this well it will resinate with them wey'll find some familiarity because you see this you can see this in situations where there is a bounded group of people wrights us just a certain group of people in a certain situation and that is who they are but the authority of the person leading the group is unbounded there is a situation where if that person has narcistic tendencis aggressive drive is too high pleasure drive is high but not being met if all those things are happening that is when you see this come to light which is why the destruction varies based upon the destruction that is permissible with in the frame work right here that this person was not in fire everyone in their lab right in a sense they could only damage their labs much although maybe if you damage your labs much you do not get funding you anadvertanly sink yourself right even there that person could bring about their own destruction but when you see the other end where it is truly unbounded ike in the sense of war riht if someone who had who can control a machine of war who who then has everything right ok what they need right well they need something they do not have never will get now they start in acting war and war is destructive rightn you think all that person want something and how many times tos to someone startle wor right that is this clearly an unjustified watrights o war because they they want something then they get something in they are satisfied that that is not how it goes right then they get something at they are not satisfied and they want more in indiscussions at times about narcicism and envy and and how that can play out on the the world stage sometimes youll huge events in human history will come up and people for example will wll bring up at off hitler and and they do that he itlere wanted things wanted things kno that thethe unbound nrcicism the unbound envy wanted destruction right this is a person who if things it continued to go as this person intended right there would hae been no one left on earth but him because the process is nothing but destructive which is why after the fact is incalculable human carnage right and he himself was among the incalculable human carnage because that is the endpoint of narcicism that is the of narcesism on a broad stage rate that is the enpoint of envy at its highest magnitude hen we see tat as examples whether we see on the smaller stage of the lab right right ahead that you are describing or on the larger stage of of unbounded war we end up with destruction one hundred percent time that is the final common pathway for all that are there is some consistent themes of childhood that lead somebody to become a narsisis and in addition to that i'm curious whether not narcisis ever have insight whether not if offered the opportunity to explore the ten cupboards under the structure of self and function of self whether or not they eventually see inside those cupboards ango on my goodness i've got this a self that is clearly over inflated and i've got these defense mechanisms and i'm envious in the and and modify their behavior or whether not the narsis are immuned from a constructive self reflection with the dano that the first part is is the vast majority of narcicism it may be all f it we do not know for sure is is rooted in the childhood trama of not feeling good enough right which is not an excuse for people doing doing awful things it is not what we are saying were trying of an explanatory mechanism right witwhich which goes back to formity of life experiences and not feeling good enough whether it was because that person was directly denigrated or that person was not denigrated but could never work hard enough never could could be enough to to to get a approval right a get it is not a hundred percent if human beings are complicated but if you go and look you see that that thet was never a state all i feel good enough about myself riht and if there is never a state of i feel good enough about myself because some one as told me that and given me the padde on the head or given me depositive comet you can see how in a certain such a natural lay of the lan genetically and an inconcent with it with other experiences that person can get to adulthood with with a lot of aggression in them and never having experienced i'm good enough at still running along inside of them and then the're enacting that aggression in the world around them that is most commonly what we see and because there is such deep vonerability and such deep insecurity then people is a people who suffer from full blown naricism narcicistic personality disorder inaction of envy on on the highest levels that is there is defend there is trongly defended in an unhealthy manner from seeing their own bone rability that it is extremely difficult to get that person to come around and say cay let let us look in those ten cubers within the field people often talk about treating narsicistic people they talk about it asin a nihilistic way and and hom justly very experienced people say oh that is impossible right that never gets better now i'm not a believer in fair pute nihilism i think that yes it is it is the norm that that person just cannot get it together to go look at that thing they are defended against it they are afraid of it right they will not look anywhere near it they are looking in the other direction ind teir furthering all that unhealth it is not the case that that it is always that way and on a couple of occasions i have worked with singg in a witness narsecistic people who can make changes now it is usually in the contact of something very extreme that causes them to do that someone who will no longer have access to family members they want to see or to financial resources that they need to keep themselves afloot is things that often are that dramatic is not always that but we can see that in those kind of extenuating situations where the the problem is big the envy is high im but the motivation for changes very very high because sense un the carridan stick model the stick here is very very strong that if a person then goes and does that you you can see change inside of them were never in a place of a farapeutic nitalism but thebut the the barriers to that are very very high because the self is wounded that the person is protecting that selves strongly that is why the narcesism and envy are full blown and it is hard to get that person to go back and look but not impossible they some what you are telling me it seems that it is a very low probability that a nonclinition could change a narsessis in other words if one is engaging in the world with ta narsesis am because they have to presume lear they just find themselves in that place am would you say to that person there is very little if anything that you can do to change the narsessis behaviour at work am psychological frame work if they for because of course if the narsis cannot often do it for themselves with the help of a skillclinition what why would an why would any one else be able to achieve the were coming at what we are doing here from a perspective of truth about human beings right and that truth brings with it hopefulness i it brings with it hopefulness that people can change and how people can change and and and i am a hundred percentit all for that it is the way to look at ourselves right but it is also true that there are aspects of pathology that that require clinical treatment in order to improve now we are looking from the other side and saying it there is a problem here and there is a deep problem here and that we have to come out from a different perspective of how can you help that problem nd there is a science behind this too of what level of clinical care for example it is most likely to be helpful to some one this and it is not an individual clinition even right it is a team of people who work through different modalities you consider wrap around that person it is not just a level of clinical care is needed but it is a relatively high level of clinical care and that in general is is the only way that we get at narcisis n as not a hundred percent but that is the vasmajority of time what can then the person do right a person cannot be a team of clinistions right what that person can do one choices to disengage iht but disengagement can come with the promise of re engagement right many many times i've worked with people and practised in rehearse with them ooking what might you say to someone along the lines of i've known you for a long time where i care about you or i love you but whatever they may say to lead in but i i cannot be with you i cannot be around you a there is there is there is something going on that that makes it not o cay for me does not feel o kay impreson may be says thing looking a regressive or demeaning or whatever it is wer may be they just say just does not feel o k cannot have it and and then t the the need to step away from the person but look if you if you got some help right if you took better care of yourself in ways it would will be better for you and for the people around you than of course i'd want to be in your life something that is a disengagement can come with that is am encouragement right to the person but but one way or another you have to set boundaries which is a ca i have to deal with this person deal with them a little bit or i do not have to deal with this person i will not right or i cannot get away from this person o have to take with a grain of salt what they are saying to me but ultimately some form of strong boundaries or disengagement is that is the response that that that that is the self care response right for the person wise whose with the narcisis what are some other ways that the aggressive drive and pleasure drive engenerative drive for that matter play out for instance we talked about the former patient of yours to eventually switch dibs clearly how to generative drive within him but was being blocked by a number of choices rooted and narratives that originated in childhood et cetera we talked about individuals with high aggressive drive hig degree of pleasure drive but a very diminished capacity to experience pleasure and therefore a lot of envy and the destruction that comes with envy s what are some of the other variations on these drives and as you observe them in your clinical practice over all framing is we want the generative drive to be the one that is determinist ight it is the one with the strongest influence we wanted d we want a nurture the generative drive in us and in others and and it make sen trust a to talk about that but we have looked at how do things get out of balance right and from the perspective of what if the aggressive drive or the pleasure drive what if they are too high right and it makes sense that often not always what can be driving them to be high or things that are not healthy in us the an the higher they get the harder it is to gratify them we end up with that problem of envy but we can be out of balance in the other direction too right where where the person does not does not experience adability to i'm engaged with the world around them right they they do not think they can do anything to change anything for the better inside or outside of themselves and if they are not doing much an feel that they can do much and en and also not receiving pleasure from things there is no gratification from the things at person is doing we see situations this too with the aggressive drive the pleasure drive or both and then we nd up not at envy because envy is the side of excess but we end up at demoralization on the lower side demoralization it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis who can predisposed to psychiatric problems the biochemical abnormality of depression but what we are talking about here is not a psychiatric diagnosis riht envy is not a psychiatric diagnos is it is it is a thing thaght they can be experience that can lead to diagnoses the same thing with demoralization if you do not feel that you can make a difference to anything right an you are not enjoying anything or feeling gratification from anything than that pool is gan went out that is going to be a demoralized person the same way of course we know an experiments when no the the if we have a a rat going for food if if you do it enough when the rat goes for the food you take the food away the rat stops trying and i earnet helpless rigt and now right that exists in us too and it comes along with all sorts of other things as being not rats right we have a hold much of thoughts about that of mi gi'm not good enough of nothing will ever be okay and now demoralization then is is it can be very very strong in taking a person aw ay from the other things we are trying to see i either because that person has the essentially learnet helplessness ray and all the things the complicated things inside of us that can come along with that wor the person is not gaining pleasure from anything when when we are considering the ways in which we can be out of balance we think ok a aggression and pleasure drive if if one or the other or both is too high we end up at envy and if one or the other or both are too low we end up with demoralization and you can take almost any scenario it could be a scenario something that is not really not going well for a person not a clinical scenario it is a thing in a person's life or we can take clinical scenarios and the vast majority ou know outside of outliers a head injry for example we can take those scenarios and we can look at it in that way and we can understand what is going on at least we can understand and not that when we go back and look in the ten cupboards of the two pillars we can then have some understanding of oke what is going on we know the basic picture and how things are not in i in the balance we want them in now we can understand that enough to go back and then look in those ten cupboards and and i believe that just about everything except those biological outliers a head injry fits in to that huristic which is why we can use it to understand we can use it to help we can use it to make change what a powerful lends to think about and explore the self and were things are working for us and wer things are possibly not working for us if i are anyone else out there wanted to get some read on assess their level of aggressive drive and their level of pleasure drive ind their ability to experience pleasure what sorts of questions would one ask on for instance a is it a question of how driven am i a how how much get up and go do i have a how much pleasure do i a experience from an interaction with a poppy an interraction with food a is it too much miht does a draw me off course are those the sorts of very simple but i'm perhaps also very informative questions that we could start to use to probe ar psyche ye i think yes but i would come top down ight if if the goal of health is that aggression and pleasure those drives ar subserving the generative drive and start to look there right if a person can take an honest inventory of self what kind of force and my being in the world around me and and that could mean for example what kind of force am i being in my family i am i denegrating to the people around me are the other people in the home afraid of me whawill kind of force my being a force for good my bolsteringly et people cannot always see that in themselves and take stock of themselves but hat we are talking about a situation when we think a person can they can bring to bear whom i being in the world in other ways think of the example of the person who needed to leave the job who who could look at that and say say know i'm not i'm not being generative in the world in the way i want tom 'm son not doing my job as well as i would want to on making my own life worse right that person could then see that is out of balance or in another way a person might see know a lot of what i'm doing is iself serving or may be destructive i cu be people can realize that right you can realize by taking an inventory ifself is is the generative drive what is deterministic in me and again not always but we are talking about a process of exploration if the answer to that is yes if you say e'm trying to be the best person that i can and i think about the people over whom i have any authority right and inlike i try to be reasonable and i try to be fair and i try to be circumspect and you i tryand thinking somebone else's shoes an me now i ou nowi sometimes i have to set boundry's r expectations or even punishment right but but i'm mi careful about how i'm doing that and i'm certainly not perfect and i get things wrong at times but i ant do thing on contributing to the world i'm doing whatever i take on as well as i can do it on productive it were i myt mi could you do an o q or my friends or o or doing all right whatever it is that if we can come up with that than than we gess at ok exhale little re in a good place right it does not mean everything is oftiable of course or then go look at the level of the aggressive drive which mi mean o how assert of am i right am i the kind of person who comes up to the precipice but does it make the decision am i the kind of person wos little too asserted and sometimes i'm sot of walking on people a little bit a person can go look at the aggressive drive within them were pleasure seeking my doing things it bring me gratification right am i engaging with the people around me in a way that brings the gratification that one might one might wish for right if it is in a romantic relationship is there romance are we being nice to one another right ye can go and look at that and say am i getting gratification from the things i'm doing ri am i in it mi taking this wheever this drive is within me and trying dissatisfied in reasonable healthy ways that are also good for others and we are back to the generative drive that is one way of coming at it and it is the way that we would to because now what we try to do next and what can we make things better rikon we optimize things oo ay things are oq right but can we make them better but let us say we see that the thethe generative drive is not winning the day right and people can see that the k i'm seeking pleasure i is why got for example i here over and over tit is what that is wh i got addicted to this substance in now is not providing any pleasure to me is now making me miserable rght but but but i wanted what it was giving me again this does it mean that the person in it just wants have the world's best time right it may mean that the're really suffering a lot right and the pleasure that that drug gave them was some relief from pain this is how many many people the tragically ended up becoming addicted to and dying from opiates right because it say thet opiate after the surgery or the opiate after the injury then is soothing something right and it soothing something because tha person feels less bad about something inside of them heare this all the time that that than folsters addiction that person looking for pleasure that this is not something where we would say some light hearted manner that person took chances with their life i mean sometimes will see that but but more and more what people are looking for than is relief from suffering rightbut we can get to that point where were we can ascertain for whatever reason that the pleasure seeking is is too much and if pleasure seeking and aggression or too much wewe we become aware of dissatisfaction right if your if you are lying too much on a gression i always want my way it is not always gong a happen right or i always want that pleasurable thing i aways want to feel better ithat a also does not happen right then that can guide us towards being aware of where those drives and if the drives are high but how much i dissenence is created by ththe what is actually coming of the drive right verses a level to drive is tat i guess it is a long way of saying yes to your question but i would to come top down because the generative drive is important and it does gait gate forward i cant awere are we at in the specture mof how healthy am i or are theire elements of onhealth i want a kind o go after or my seeing things in myself that really say things it are unhealthy are really dominating my life are determinestic addiction we just just one example you now diction things it are self destructive right because then that is a place to then look at it more o the clinical ands i maybe i will not just talk to antrust at other wherean go we get a book but maybe i should it maybe i should have a clinical care of the example of a diction is very potent a and it also brings to mind the perhaps u less apparently dangerous situation but one that i think is really common where people have a certain amount of aggressive drive they have a certain amount of pleasure drive but there is a kind of a passivity and draining out of the generative drive were competing out of the generative drive because of social media a and the reason i i bring this up as again not because i dislike social media i rely on an you social media for teaching and learning extensively really but in going back to the pillars that under live whether or not we achieve an experience agency gratitude pece contentment and delight within the pillar of function of self there is this thing salience and what were paying attention to internal and external and social media does seem to me a unique circumstance never before observed in human evolution where you have a near infinite number of environments available to you and we know that picture is worth a thousand words an a movy is worth a billian pictures when it comes to drawing our attention m you just look t you give a young child even an infant and i pad i mean that kid is in the tunnel i do not necerily think that is a bad thing and the computers and computer screens are going to be a part of their lives now and forever presumably but it is the case that there are a lot of people who perhaps have the propensity for a strong generative drive but because they also have a propency for a a pleasure drive they wake up they pick up the phone itlook at the phone something captivates their attention than theyre thinking about that it might be i'm something that brin gs them delight but more often than not at something that brings them either mild irritation or where mild entertainments maybe even intense entertainment for a short while but very quickly minutes an hours go by in which we are not engaging in the world unless we are posting valuable content and social media is a bit of it of a drain on these drives ond ly it taps into these drives in very strong ways and all one has to do is observed the behaviour of people in public spaces now i inerport a on trains even in their cars and apeople are sentially watching t v all day long and and it does it does concern me and and i i raise it because i feel it it can disdract from our generative drive in a way that u it does not esserely speak to any kind of deep character flaw or any kind of subconscious narrative but just at that salients copbord a is is what clearly something within that salients cupboard is is happening that is unprecedented and very very powerful and potentially quite destructive i think to understand this i would a cite disbelief ii believe this to be true that human beings have a long history of underappreciating the power of the discoveries that are then in their own hands we discover gunpowder how long into ar shooting each other i we discover newclyeficient i now are we going to destroy the planet i social media since it is a discovery to think that comes from what we have figured out as humans that now is there in in front of us and big powerful discoveries deserve to be treated with respect i gunpowder is very powerful and if people need to hunt in order to survive be gunpowder can help them hunt without getting hurt and we be more successful riht newclyerfisien has provided some good things to humanity but it can also dis ruy humanity thi think the same is true here that whatwhat you are talking about is something of immense power and you can see how if it gets out a balance to let us use the sailing let us say the social media is too salient right that is going to make a problem right if it is too serient in the sense that the person is always looking at thingsthat do not make them feel good enough right well that is not goingto go well and that is going effect what is in those other it ten cupboards right and what is built on top of it then it gets into the unconscious mine oh i thought i was good enough unto now looking at all the social media and i realize i'm not i mean this is people who do treat tins you kno often talk about this that you see something that oudidn' often see before where a person who might have gotten through a lot of formed of years thinking oh how i look is oq for example then is bombarding themselves with social media that tells them how they look is not ok and then that changes absolutely or perhaps social me is just simply absorbing a ton of time and energy but mostly time that could be devoted to to a generative force right that is it that is the other side of its to thing abat the example of the person who i know it was not social meda but we are sand woat if it were social media that instead of ninety minutes a day it is it is eight hours cause there is an analogue there right only see a lot of this and it is taking something that that can be good right and can andy since ind said you could even should be good there is enough out there right in terms of learning and bolstering that why should it not be good right but it is not good because the defence is then shiff if yor if you were lying on it ten hours a day there as to be some denial right thue the're other things to do in the world there has to be some avoidance ras to be some rationalizationly something is going on there that is not healthy if you tell me this person is utilizing social media ten hours a day they are not looking at things that make them feel bad about themselves are just doing it then and i think looki something is is out a bal s not may be that that that persons defences are at a balance think about the example of the person ere the job they did not than their defensive structure changes then the thing that was good for them they rely on too much and now become something that is not good for that right then you go and look at what else is out of balance here rigt what else is is is driving maybe it is being driven by the change in defence machnisms et cetera maybe it is the other way around that that this person just kind of habituated to doing more and more and more and more of it and then you would come out in a different way of oke can you can you slowly but surely do less replace that the time with things that were good before cul you could then back that person ou to where they were before but you are not gin a back the person ou to where they were before if it is being driven by something else we again come to the curiosity you tell me that person is on social medi fourteen hours a day i'm curious ray i want to understand what what is what is the balance of those drives right youyou have just told me a very powerful point about salients that does not sound a good one already you giveim me clues about where the drives are by which mes wheres that person at what is going on in all those cabinets than you give more information i sit in talk with the person now you cannot understand what is tae lay of the land here and how do we go about making it better i love the concept of the generative drive fort to all because it is prosocial it brings about great things for us and rfor the world than mean what is better than peace contentment and delight especially when we remind ourselves of those ar active phrases ore those those can be achieved in experience inside of action it is not just sitting levitating naval gazing that sort of things it is not enlightenment right its piece contentment and delight very big difference there very by differenc yes one of the other reasons i love this concept of the generative drive much is also because it is a verb state it has to do with creating things in us and in the world in cultivating our experience of things and and what we do in what we say and how we respond to what others do and say and i also it because it is distinct from the way that we are normally taught to think about psychological well being ere being a healthy individual whuld should usually centers around a discussion of goals and values and what am i tryna focus on and and yet what sorts of people do i want engage with in the world and certainly all of that is really important goals and who you engage with but i think for many people out there much of their time is spent thinking about other people how healthy are were unhealthy are the people their dating or their friends or what is going on between two family members which course s fine to think about but a lot of emphasis is placed on our assessments of others and how those are impacting us i'm and in some cases people defaults to just thing about others and their problems and seeing their problems and what were really talking about here is a process of introspection and inquiry that is very structured and as it is been laid out by you these two pillars structure of self function of self with these ten cupboards im that might sound a lot of cupboards but s we talked about the first episode all of that flows up to these very simple right ideals and concepts and action states and ways of being and to me there is nothing more powerful then the statement that what we are all seeking are states of agency and gratitude because again to go back to the analogy of physical fitness there are not an infinite number of different physical states or states of fitness that one im can seek ther endurance their strength reflexibility there is dynamic movement there is now explosiveness there speed thether bunch of en o subtleties to it but you are it really seems that the psyche ourselves and our mental health is really tractable if we turn the lends and we look inward yes yes i think that it is upon a very very important points we talk about understanding oneself and the process of change and i would describe that as rational aspiration lets use the physical health example i if if i think oq i want to be healthiere youknow i want to have more strength i want o have more endurance and i might even have ideas of what that would be i want to be able to run a certain distance in a certain time lift a certain amount of weight i've an idea of what that is but rational aspiration is rooted in our present lik i'm aware that there is a me now that that that is not in that state and i'm aware that there is hthings at i'm going to do to get to that state and i'm not that dreading them igoll athether'll be difficult right but that is o quet i can do difficult things i can take pride in doing difficult things and that is how we all achieve things i see myself in the present ase of course goals are good and that that is true as long as we are still living our lives in the present because otherwise goals just become fantasies or things we want a want to possess if i'm aware of the state of physical health i'm in right now and i'm aware of the state of physical halth i want to be in and i know there is a munch pathways i culd take to get there but i've to think about at bout it figure it out do those things and that i'm ging to navigate myself there that is how the whole process is good i do not feel bad about myself now i recognize something i would to change i'm not saying or you will loser because you do not have those things rih i feel gi fel good about myself now i recognize there is something i want and there is going to be a process a process of cross time a cross effort that is gon navigate me there than want i get there i feel good about being there it is very very different if i think i want that i want to possess in a sentense right i want t possess the ability to run a certain distance in a certain time i just want the thing i'm covetous of the thing right that is not good right is a person then often is denegrating to the celf not always by this semotivation to go out and get that thing that is better and and ther the're really im lamenting the process of getting though they just want something is an end point and that doesnit make for happiness it does it make for even te the humility and humility in action the gratitude right of the humility as i cannot just do that overnight i'm gan to have to work hard people have to work hard i'm no different than anybody else i'm not special i got to get in there and work ain use the elbow grease and and i'll get healthier all of that is good that i just want to possess something is not good and that is why people in insenarios this they might li go through maybe in an unthinking way or they are gutting it out where they goin to get that thing right but then nothing is not enough right and they want more ndno there is not is nothing wrong with wanting more if it is if it is the healthy anaction of self rit in in to now map my way this feels better i want te map myself from here to the next level of better physical fitness that is different than i just want that thing because in if i get it it will not be good enough right it does not make me happy it does not satisfy me and that is the that is the the unhealthy state of just wanting things to possess them and then we do not feel good about them which is even of the thought of if you give people if you give a person something thol resent you for it right again wud it that were were painting in it istot a certain way the context of that statement which i used to hear a lot even when i was younger the people would say that right and what were they trying to get at right what they were getting at is it does not feel good if you did not work for something rilic if you need not work very hard and you had a see but i give you an egg or somebody gives me an egg right i know that that is not good i know that i got the thing i got the a and i might feel happy in the moment cause i wanted that thing but there is no real pleasure in it there is no f satisfaction there is no content wet thre's no sense of self there is nothing generative i dadn't work hard enough to go from a sea to anay right it is that that and that really brings us back to to the self that we are growing on top of yu know of the structure right and how that how that self is functioning i how it is striving because now were really talking about strivings and if i going to strive for something in work hart to get it will i get the good feeling on the other side of it and now we are we are living in the generative space well i love the structure of what you have laid out again think you the pillars of structure of self and function of self with ten cupboards between the two of them that when explored can seem a lo bit complex but there really some very straightforward types of inquiry that any one can go about about self awareness and address podential defense mechanisms what we are conscious of may be what we are not conscious of look at our behaviors an our strivings and how that flows up to these simple ideals again of empowerment humility agency in dratitude as verbs and then from that piece contentment and delight and the generative drive which goshi i there ever was a a more powerful concept and something to strive for i i i do not think it exists because som the generove drive is at is extraordinary and in the number of different ways it place out and it seems always positively right and of course the aggressive drive the pleasure drive exists o varying extense in all of us but u cannot be allowed to overcome the gener ofe drive if we are going to to really thrive em thank you again much for this frame work and again to remind people

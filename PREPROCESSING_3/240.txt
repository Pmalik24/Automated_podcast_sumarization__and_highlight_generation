by one trying to catch a man had been harassing her as ap wistners the stories about sexual harassmens or their sube secual content to this won thiy i've say that is interesting about this recording and the man's behavior in it is how inderstated it is it doesn' raise his voice et does not overt we threaten but he just gets his pointy cross all interesting the woman made the recording her name is christin sellers years later to day when she hears this recording she hears it very differently than she did at the time it raises a wholesit of question she did not think about myh spectthen recorded jessigo lesson hop med christon years ago putting together a story for the b b s here is jessica the recording just ten minutes long the man christon was trying to record was her home in specter this is back in twenty twelve at the time she did not have a self fon she borrowed one from her friend can you just sort of lake explained how you made this recording in the first place n i had on on som around hous clean up clothi mi a baggy clothing i had a phone and it at the phone and on i put it in my shirt put it in i think i was mo bros strap for something sittin some tipe away i because of the phone under the shirt secured by a bross strap the recording is hard to hear hiding the phone there christin's nervous she gives herself a task raking the yard as she waits for eric penner to pull up he is who she wants to record she is kind of afraid of him but she is focast on all the things any one making this kind of recording might be she wants to stay halm not look suspicious ack natural and most incordingly she wants to get audio up eric pender harassing her she has undeniable proof eric penders red trok pulls up and parks on the street the is a long driveway sommin lik a wood aria an now how much o houses near me an that the and he was walking ot but ia still wriking li you knowt doin both and he was coming up towards me and ous con o con o turn other way at's when he cant ot got real close and he was m or y be careful you talk to i'm not worried about me if there somebody yu think you can trust than i'm just letting you probably cannot trust him he best iderstand i needte te watch what im saynce ot people and hom talkin son and i am whet i mu sayin o people trying to put to face on of mi sayin nothing o nobody byut what are you talk mo how far away is he from you when he is probably li han mehers i know my producer robin she is about two feet away this recoring is the fourth time christin had spoken to eric pender ever oo it if i y i l i'm super nervous in nothin tat i'm nervous at deatin i was shaken and i could believe he did not se it was a tremble in me that i just was tryin to hold on to a rite is hard as i couldit soed it he would not see to tremble in me you none on me were you making lik contact with him i ealy was down to te rit down to te wrat iu was if i was somemidy as the wi was rekin in the same spot ho i would ave ben lithic wat is she goin but was six month sin pot as i's scare to move iwas just nervous the house eric pender was coming to inspect was not christans yet it was a house she was hoping to move in to with her three kids the only thing she needed to move in was his signature on a form she needs this house just two weeks earlier christen was staying at her moms just home from a presensten she served six months for approbation violation she was looking for a house for her and her kids if he needed a section eiht voucher in larnburg asmall town in a realary of north carolina one of the only places to go was a non profit called for county community servis as the problem was the only house they were willing to give her was a house no one else seemed to wante christon was oke i'm not picky they had a house and i said that house in particular was abandon and if i was to i clean that house out thet i will go head and be able to movein th house and when hav to payt to pas they actually called the landlord and they will pay the first my seran i think this hil if she cleane a house it be hers but clening a house she would come to learn was a big project it was a three bedroom house with a dining room and den and all the rooms were filled with jonk tit smelled awful there were roaches lots of poop the naivors had telld me des wt was many feesees an stuff in the house because they had left the dol and in finally i guess the do o the dati left an they's got it o i do not know but by time i got the i just was there wit the left o yo not the house being full of clothing and a food in the cabines sit was otest as o is jis harbl she cleaned and cleaned she had a list of tause that she would been given from the no profit its ot we mayb two weeks or three weeks may be more tan e i can he e really remember remember i just remember going a lot of times don it well i call down tan hi sent and spet out i i thought i had everything done it was my duty to do eric pender showed up he was the housing inspector for for county he is a tall man older lightskin black man with a taste for cowbay boots and belts cackys pender was there to review christon's work if she passed his inspection she would get approved to move in anyway he was you needo have a om a man to help you wy youon't have a bor forin an otes an an im an i do not have one because i'm just come on prisom tine to get on my fee for my kis i'm dryn explain t him and he was but you have if you had a man here a man could get ti stuff do and i wy i did i what are you asking me to do this talk of men quickly turned explicit chrison said he asked her about her sex life if she performed oaral sex before not wy wh iwas sotlly throng and he was li cause you have have mein to take you out to donners tho andin i ha tell him ye i have he was li way you to havin people take you out to dinner that is what e wer paying you for it will payi you wol says he said i say you rin six hundred thousa times twelve months her rent was six hundred dollars a month to be clear he was laying out her exact situation he proposed sex with him as a kind of home insurance policy the pender valued dover a years worth of rent he was best way over six thousand tholars my signature is i si s tha lot you' be hav i stakes wos s bestly test he said e met it out just did he even acknowledged that you had clean the whole house e then he did not want to he wanted to let me know t aske theo has stuff to do i'm dot cause im no inm here with this man and i li he got he can sign his paper and he can not sound is fire cu say whatever and my word against him is what at tis time on mi yo know who what do i do ah i jus do not know i jus knew to try to keep a distance between him as much as i could it pender toward the house with christon following behind him he starts pointing to stuff that was not christin's responsibility to clan out that was not on the list that the non profit gave her broken mirrors a broken toilet that is what havs seld me to told it need e faxon and he cannot pull me bout a hip in a and batroom and he pulled his self out in front of me what ye he pulled his self out and i look down and i lood up in account of i i nee to get out i fin away out i cont o got out i the men he is blocking you he is bout hroom door and your in te bathroom and cannot get out and he exposes himself to you definitly he was yo know t do you knows tat if you want tisaske you kn what you got to do that is what he was sandin in that point she says the only thing she was sure of was that there was no way she was going to do what he wanted ever she managed to push past him gets him to leave he does not sign the form tet was overwhelming i wrote dow i caus i felt when you in situations i was an om you feel conon you got loseffstin aready and on dennin what his situation is jis conon lie ye dis fell this way he looket too this is that out man lokit to and im is is im say whatever o haricas he is who she is criston did not go to the police she thought it was her word against his and that because of her record she would not be believed she thought she needed to bulster her claim in some way collect some evidence or something she called a privae investigator wondering if they could surveil him but they were too expensive the private investigator she talked to gave her this tip north carolina is e one party consent state meaning it was legal for christen to record him tried to get proof without his permission which yo bes o o o her er she wu es which brings us back to the recording christon made on that sunday in april back in twenty twelve handers coming back ostensibly to inspect the house he still has not signg the form she needs to move and remember christon is trying to record hender propositioning her but when he walks up he is not doing that he stirs talking about his job at the housing office how he is in charge of handlind complaint e o a e w pot toit to be al he says any time i deal with e complaint he is talking you about a complaite doyou know what he tausing him he was sand at som mit o told his bouse that i say it that he was making advance is in batherin me but she had not she d only told a few people in that private investigator about pender confused cristin tries to play it off heis o paus se w thin i was fe sited out si to sto osit o jus to e meowat the sum of all this for chris tion she is realising that telling her howsing office about pender filing an actual complaint is out of the question instead af colon me da co him and tell him everything instead o co o me saying it did is dis happening you at that point you that nobody on your side ne te people as case to you o o yo ga a tese a i ol se it is a weird recording because aric pender says things that son simultaneously a thread i an they could be the advice of some one who is protectid and carrying pendr had wat christin considered a supreme confidence where he could feness words make insult sound flowery and innocen isike to me he was just trying to make me his frn and i was trana keep myself afloat in the conversation while i was felling i was drowming at the same time for example as she is reaking pendersor's lecturing her about her kids yo as s kiss o i yer ta she but a ner her a wa a a nothin a e we i e we a o e wa i i o you ges i ol po be o may wt i was l calld a a o besi a war to by yo yes pot get on a paes i e e ee its in his but you got to get hi as to wi o ti was la wo mas lo yinno you be ma wa ta o me to kno ho te an to tell you can lied el how to li gree a le o to git i or o all christin can think is this is not which he was heping to get recorded i did not think none o this was no wor cause i i'm you sim coman sand youlso you on have sax you and do this bein very blant on what he wantin why he wante and when i'm do it and what i get for doing it when i'm going to somin is i i lo e to plac i i'm i this is not on work i thas thus i felt at it but also all that advice about how she shou'ld raise her kids hes arrogan he ase im belief an in his my he co say what he want to say to me no matter who ives n involve you believe me i know how to raise your children ow you believe me i know how to get you in this house and you believe me i can help you everything was talking down i making me feel im not enow or i'm not a good enough mam or everything was to try to belittle belittle me and sod nothing pndr keeps talking but nod about home inspection he still does not explicitly proposition christon the first time that they mot he suggestid thou he mentions for know apparent reason how women you tostop oco litly do not know how they o i ye yet o a i ma y ow mo o e e ba e me a a me oll be maed ol he os further he re mines christin how he came by her house in ot asked her for son e is you lo tan wa mes le wi a us wul ta ma be o o me o otain u le lias the be becos li we i te li e re o w w o wa a o wa i a oa ta lik o a or si o lose yours it what if i was ga you knoms an li would likely lie whi would you use that against me you knot im say but he would do that anything that he fellt could be a target to hit you in a way to make you feel i o to prove him i'm not this then he would use it did you fel he was trying to make you angry ye i no yer i did i fell lie he was tryng to make me give in to say no no li did o i'll do it approve ot tis own he hints at making deal with her to help her with her housing but does not spell out which she would have to do in that deal christin keeps recording he reminds her that he has a lot of authority and can help her i bo hal all iscolpeaaal fo e fo tol e ol la gi o o whis he ala e aa orty al al ol o ol ol e al al al ol tha o tistol ge th e ol that al oe sl l asl dat to what i know the previous conversations when he do ex for sakes and not i that is how he gets it it is i'm helping you let me tell you what yhe got to do the good theil that tone is what i was use to when he got that calm place on my he go you knough in a chil to make me fell i hes help in me because if i have sex i have somewhere to say for haven saks for ever and he is getting red o goin to day i want you to do suc i sic i ded that point i've really knew lit oka is come but it does not come pender instead brings up the most on topic how is ig inspection related subject of his visit the barn there is this little barn typed shad in christin's back yard it is filled with garbage and cristin had put snake repellent around the outside of it to keep snakes if there were any trapped ginside pender says i get that barn cleaned out o i wi al fol al i he said that he as at e o e co ga ta aas his payin all this pndersards listening all the thing she could use the barn for hard gans an escape from the kids he suddenly singly folkgessed on the potential greatness run down barn yoon e keeps te i tat al oi fe o tav ar a we ee o yet is gone t barn he see had o wonan barn and se been gone barn you cul have this he you n i was dislike the more he was describein the close he was trying to get to the barn y he was trina fine a way to get me there and my do we ask i i guess him trying on do anything that wild probabby the best place for pender keeps insisting she go in the brn with him christin keeps aporting it she will not go she finally says if i see a snake in there i may pass out an die farn a mater agersyo e hai yo ser a e oa t e nen e ean may ap in a pass aa i out life if i woud a would not have mar he defimitely i it would have been oca for him in his mind at she sain oka and i ni was not wontin anser it seems to work pender backs off slowly they e one lust back and forth he starts to walk away says all right then we straight i o w c ii finally he says the most damning thing he said in the whold auporting i sa wea for te eeee well we almost straight he will take care of me later on cristin stopped hrecorting she worrd immediately that whach she recorded was not enough and if it was not that she was stock right where she started her house hanging in the lurch she felt desperate how is this going to be over when is going to be over him san i say i take care im it as jus this sant o beoont ti i do it an he say it is des what it is i have sex in this is not oer this not open and in my mind i knew thit he had o come spit every year every year him haven expect every year that means had to have some c ana sexual thing wi him for him to approve it ever year it jus ust prayin it that cording was enough proof that he is been doinit younow that just didn nos i had enough proof this recording kicked off a pretty remarkable series of events cristin used it defile a criminal charge against eric pender he was convicted of simple assault but appealed and got the case dropped she also played the recording for a young lawyer who did not even have an office yet orno for sure if what criston was describing was illegal but he listened to the tape believed her and took the case rston's lawyer filed a civil suit and a local paper ran a story about it mornmore women started coming forward with stories about eric pender and penders boss john wedsley who was also asking for sex in exchange for abouchers the case grew from three women to eight and then to sixteen six of the women went along with the men sexual demands one of them lost her housing anyway the lossuit ran on for years which h became its own form of punishment for criston because eric pender was still her home inspector he continued working for them at one point he tried to cancel criston vouchher her lawyers blocked it the case was moved from state to federal court department of justice lawyers got involved criston got called all the names lyer fell in opportunist once in a gertry store a women criston barely knew approachedtor she woly fell admadont telling me youre miston is o you messno how we get at losters and thats she was sayin we y not just me has a much of on a understood when she sayid is to me it just con a hat me o how they were able to do it for som on haw he was why you now coffinit because loo i have this worme for you there are any good numbers on how common sexual rassment is in housing situations no one seems to be tracking it in july ove twenty fifteen three years after criston made the recording the federal lost suit ended for county settled with the department of justice penderd wesley were band from working in sextion ate or renting or managing any property permanently neither admitted to any wrong doing both denied all the allegations against them i reach out to pender and wesley for this story wesley did not call me back i called pender's lawyer tried previous addresses called old numbers and is ex wife no one knew where he was four county did not respond either they have changed their name sens the women were aworded a two point seven million dollars settlement the largest sexual harassman and housing settlement in us history at the time altimately the number of victims in the suit with eihty setten criston's recording was evidence of penders behavior but now years later when she listens to it she hears it very differently than she did at the time which she hears is herself who she is in that recording she hears how small she becomes around him and she thought about the recording a lot when i first called her in november to see if she might be willing to talke o me for this story almost immediately she said i'm glad you brought this up she told me shed never talked through with anyone the way she is always wanted to i visited criston in the house she moved to right after the case settled a three bed room in greensburo where she lives with her two youngest kids i played the recording for her she had not heard it in years even listen to it o lik i you could a sy is she could a say at you could i is i beat myself up for someday yes becaus isel i could i aroud more a something and and i knowd it it did have a god outcome but i jis fell if i would it told him more sometimes i wish i would just told him off i do beat myself up for some some little things the way she dealt with eric pender she says is something lots of women do with men particularly men who have power over them she laughs teflects pretends tells half truth demurs changes the subject wites her tongue smiles too much agrees too much hides her anger hides all her motions beries her personality it is familiar i asked every woman i talk to in this law suit about it and then nearly every woman in my life about it as we talked cristen and niced her to calling it the tactic thi ad te comon place wone is some mady who has control o somemody whos i have to see on a regular bases in ther affect in my lively be cause you li my dream as on t other side of that person you knoem sand my my livelihood is on the other side of this person if i id a terrtis person down than they can stop me from reaching i you knotem san would you when do you think you learned it when do you think you whit is the first memory you have of of trying to use this as a strategy to get through a difficult situation i had in a certain fhan re member a home they would do things to hr me but i i did not want in te hart me i knew i got to be in the same house wir him for certain pier of time this family member abused christin both physically and sexually until she was about twelve years old tas a kid she never told anybody bein a o income families a lowd of people shelter these things becaus it would cause more pain to the family we a readystroan we aready going through this we already going to day low would i put more on the family i me then you also have te fet that this and is embarrassin oh and would have not a low to believe o ta ot us things sos is is sangs better to shelts er she did not start using these tactics with eric pender and she did not stop using them after him in the year since the last suit christpin said she found herself in a job weare again some one in a higher position than her star to making sexually explicit comments to her she was afraid to offend him she used the tactic made up an excuse read erect him she told him i'm not for you i'm too crazy and you should steer clear of me not long after chrisin says that i walked right up behind her and rapter breast cristin quit that day walked out never went back she told me i cannot file of fettera low suit every time something this happens to me i said chrispins thought about the recording with eric pnder and how she handled him in the recording a lot over the years i asked her after all this if he could go back to when you first met eric pender would you wish you tove said oh ye now o tet know on that ow yet jus i wish i could a just loot to him o say mister fende i'm not interesting you i do not want you and nos ave away form or ffasson i do not want to have no dines which you for a vauter her now of ever more i do not want no di was wich and i wish you ad jast tot askingme caus to me a fella he did not think i ccomplete a sin is latday and if i will a said it to him li tey maybe he would ben li wa we o she she talk a letthe bit better than tha thout ye now that would have been the best thing for me to be able to say it to him an away where as li i her not believe me a mom not beneeth you i o where ad i here just the other day christan told me she has a new tacting she used it with a guy at her work who kept trying to tell her these sactual jokes christen was not having it in a room ful of people with her boss watching she tried her new move and it worked he backed off she

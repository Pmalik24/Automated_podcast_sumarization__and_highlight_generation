pisticuffs abound as non trump republicans fight each other in the first republican debate and we grate all the participants and from tris to counter program at that debate with tucker carlson i've been turo this is bentubero sho tody showsponserbackspressve pian dou a web his tribing seen an sold to advertisers no meneither get expressly pian right out expressive piansi coms lash ben whenever there is a big debate the big question that people have his tro one and who lost but to understand who one and who lost you first have to discuss what the metrics are for winning and losing because you can win in tobate and it can mean very little or you can lose i debate and can endour a campaign the question for each of the candidates on the stagion last night's first republican debate was what is the goal in order understand what the goal was for each candidate n the we can grade them in terms of how they achieve teir goals we can also grade them in trms of what we personally thought of them in terms of truth honesty policy in order to gray them on that basis we first have to can assess the state of the race going into the debate and to understand where the race was going into the debate you first have t understand that the republican party is not actually a cohesive thing the conservative moment at this point is not a cohesive movent there is an anti left umbrella under the anti left umbrella there are several groups inside the republican party wive seen people divide these groups six ways if you'r nte coen of the newyork times i've seen them divided a couple of ways they are not divided however into two groups one ofthe corusumptions going into the rpublican primaries by a lot of politicoes is that theyre basically two groups the pro trumps and the anti trumps maybe three the pro trumps the anti trumps and the luke warm trumps that is not really accurate in reality in this re publican primary i believe that there are four lanes right now they are four lanes and the question is can you occupy multiple of those lanes and be the top person and multiple of those lanes oure can have to do that in order to challenge president trump who is running away with the primaries right now by forty points nationally and he is winning yes still in iwik he is winning in new hampshire and every other state in order to understand where the race stood and what people were trying to accomplish on the stage last night we first have to look at where people stand in te race right now i put together this chart to serv explan the various lans and where the candidates stood befour last nightes debate they are basically four lanes in this republican primary way number one are people who absolutely love presiden trump the trumpers and it is thirty five percent of the republican party the lov him it is rider di he is their guy yout twenty five per cent of the gopee they' be the traditional geope bates beg the ragan conservatives people who believe in the three legged stool of conservatism social conservatism pysical conservatism in small government free trade and four polisu hawkishness i bey the traditional geopete third group ut be the liberal wine its be then never trumpers the cris cristy one and then finally have the trumpet jason these are people at twenty percent o the party who trump tek that they they am nelic is policies that gotus god president but they understnd their serious conserns about his presidential run whether it is the invictmens whether it' is his bazard habits on truth shol l wheather it is is commentary weather it is it is the toxicity he has with suburban whatever it is he is or people who a lot of what trumpt did who mal even him personally but they also are not totally sold thet trump is the guy for wenty twenty four that islike twenty per cent of the party let us go through each of these candidates and where they stood going into debates last nights to bate ronto santis is currently in second place in the national polling with the trumpers he earns a b hi's the way that i waited the sort of stuffs everybody's on an a two f scale trump gets an a plus in the trump category because he is trump and it is the trump category sat's an aplas he is only persont gets an plusan any categor ka but everybody else on an a to f scale and ais worth for o be is worth three as he is worth two at he is worth one in f is worth zero and then we waited itit out according to te size of these particular groups ron to santis among trumpers going in to the a bate he is a a b they the got they think he is fine he is solid but h's not trump among traditional geo pe types the santis is currentl at a b among members of t called liberal wing this or of never trumpside the santis is not a d and aong the trumpet jason crowd he is at a b those the peopl who love trump but you now they could see sumpody else which means that he is at a b an three categories and a d in one other the vak grum a swammy has an a with trumpers no tat is great for him in the sense that the trump people really really him i mean a lot for him being vice president or a cabinet sacretar but he ai'tgon to beat trump among thetrumpers he is got an a among the trumpers 's got tha d among the traditional go p because he takes lot o hederadox's positions and seems to shift with the wind based on who is asking him questions whether it is nine eleven conspiracies or whether it is o crane or whether's climea change get the liberal wing which hates the vage they never trumpwing he is got an f with them and then among the trumpet jason he is got an a riht now this is where momentumas been flowing trum to santis two the vague is that in the trumpet jasonawing the people who trump but they could se somebody else the vake has been doing well ot those peopleis gotan a with those people san he is got an a with te trumpers an the trumpet jason and he is failing with the traditional geo p and the and the left wing of the party mike pens has an f in two categories the trumpet trumpet jasent they hate him and among th traditional go p he is got a b because again the tritional geope conta likes trump and if trumperips tum pens hee's got a b and among th never the never trumpers that she do not pencs on polsy but they that trump hates him n tes got a b with them nickey halee among those four groups she is got a d with the trumpers they dn't er cause he is run agains trump among the traditional go p she does well she is got an a going in probably among t never trumpling the party she is got ab b they kind the kind of her that do not love her but they they kind of her and among the trumpet jason she has a b a they they ut there lse or nout superfond of nickey haley they think that she is quortaquite a neo conn all the rest of it kae tim scot e's basically in the race for no reason ut tim scot very nice gy no mat gnat is on nolement to know nothing among trumpers he is a s or a d among tricinal geops a c liberal wing's a c trmpedjasens he is a c basily he we all i we all tame's fine eh and then cris christy he is an f mung trumpers he is ot a de among the tritional geope whou do not him because the way that he treated barokobama and all the rest he is got an f with the trumpetjacent cas i hate is guts and among the never trumper he is got an ae he is got one lane and then yu got trum trump himself as an a pluss with th trumpers he is got an a with tetrumpetjasen an's got a b with taritional geope it is only the never trumpers who hate him everybody else either love's the guy or likes the guide varying degrees in order for any candidate to defeat donal trump in order for thats to happen the only way that that is going t happen heis if ve con solida the other three non trump wings of the party lets say the our candit n you anhto be donal trump and on trump right now has the trumpers locked up r ait is thirty five percent of the party and you need to get i let tain a two person race which it is not which is art of the problem what is haye wanted to consolidy s you thegr at sixty five per cent of the party is up for grabs well you would certainly ned pick up the never trumpling a bot twenty per cent of the party and then you need to win probly eighty per cent of the tritional geope in youd get a lot of those people to believe the donal trump is not the guy which means yeu need to win them over with sort of traditional geop positions reckart ll the rest and then you would still have to win half of the trumpejacent ah'd have to take all of the ever trumpling at's twenty per cent if take twenty o the twenty five per cent fom the tritional geop and ye'd still have to win half the trumpedjacen that is a very up hill road now the only candidate who is scoring at all among all three of those groups the only candidates who are scoring at all among those three groups the trumpet jason he liberal wing and the traditional geope are haley an to santis the others are doing well and one of the categories to sanstis campaign initialle seemd fairly well position for this possible challege right he see he might be getting in a with the tritional gope among never trumpers whoas a b and among the trumpetjacent he is at an a there is a possibility he mght hav ben able to consolidat the ant had trumforces it that really has not happen which is why he is been losing momentum because right now he' seems he is the second tchoice for everybody among traditional geopeters he is a bee rater a supposed to nickey haley who is an a among the trumpedjacent he is at to b as supposed to the vague who sait an a and among the ever trumpwing he ranks behind right now christ and haley and pence probably an when you lok at the initional g p as of these candidate's going into the race way y s is donal trump way out in trump wit a three point three when you gve a weighted average here and when you look at ronisantis he is it when you have awaited t aggregate rather you get three point three for for for trump when you look at to santas he is a two point six be vake just trailin him at two point for five if nickey haliot two point one five if scot at one point six five pence o one poin three o five christia one point o five nat does not explain the entiretinamic of the race because momentum as will scuss hi's really about can you win one of these lanes one othe ways you generate momentum is by winning one of lanes than building on that sright nowv a vake is doing really well the trump adjason which is why he is building on that and seems to have momentum christ he seems to have momentum because he has him momentum with the never trumpling of the party hayley had de use is to bate to git momentum but this defines where the caniditar going into the race to sato spasecly just wants to hold stedy that is his goal hold stedy as we as we look at that charp by the way i'm ana explain in just a second what everybody's goal is going into the debate by looking at that chart first let us talk about the fact that your selfum it is in tesper ned of freplacement aw as you have yourself along er longyour battery life basically to grad since now you cannot coloutside for five

isha puro oket to go back to this chart in order to under stand what everbody's goals for debate number one are if youlokgat this char what you see again to santis is in second place but he is kind of stagnent with all the with all of these groups regt he is in second place in all of these groups in three groups he is got a bee and mong thenever trumpery's got a bee his original plan was he was going to score a bee with the trumpers and then he was going to scoren to a with prett much everybody else tat was ging o be the thous can be the idea that is not happen right now because to santis was in a slide his goal for this debate and because he is in second place was just to avoid the spotlight actually his goal is to live another day he did not want last night to be a red wedding then he the time when he just completely collapsed on the stage as well see i think tha he largely accomplished that for vake scoal i's to continue to gain attention to be a lightning rod that was his goal on the stage and he is doing really well with the trump adjason he knows he is going to do nothing with anever trumpers and he nws not kin do inthig with traditional geopee which again is why he is not really runing for president he is running for donnel trums vice president or for a cabin a position or for senti position he knows' ot taking it away from trump and that was not his goal last night his goal last night was tobasically to grade to samtis with the trump adjason by gaining momentum with those people and he may have accomplish ackel last night for mit pence pence really knows that he does have a shot at the presidence he but t he feels that he has to ron because he has to preserve his legacy as a person who stood up to the predationns of donal trump tbetween novmember in january and as he sort of traditional old line republican politician how doyou do last night he basidally achiepe his goall nickee hayly hergoall was i need a lane and i need t actualy shows some momentum in a lane nicky haleas will see actually out performed last night and she actualy achieve trigoll tim scott he is a quicksotic figure i notua why he is in the race is not his moment i'm not sure he has a moment he is incredibly soft spoken he is not aggressive he seems a very nice person but he does not have any teeth and there wis no goall for him to achieve and he succeeded in not achieving a goll i suppose but i feel timscottascan be one o the first people out of the race and for chris cristy the entire goal last night was to the bake lock down one lane my lock down that never trump lane and i think cristy may achieve that goall last ngh meanwhile trumpechieve his goal which was stayaway gollatchye last nght i thing actually everybody kind of achieved their goall but he effects in terms of momentum i're going to be the question regong t get to that in just one second the effact what actually happen vethemomentum in order to explore that question as to who has momentum coming out of thedebate we were we aregoing to have t actually jump into the ebate it en get to the fun part hake i'm about you the summer heatenin sot florda itis really really hot outside but there is something you should not be sweating this summer that is the price of meat thanks to good ranhers yon halft your price can be locked in for two years you might be thinking a price lock guarantee on meat yes it is amazing it is a mazing because again these prices are going upso why not locke that in good ranchers is the only meet company locking in your price with he're industry first price lock guarantee since twenty twenty one thet benhelping people combat the inflation of the metile as well as the mystery of it as well it turns out over eighty five per cen of all grasfed beef is imported from oversees to not only is tore bout me to spensive offennts low form quality is well but when you subscribe to god ranchers you aregettng a guarantee price an a trusted one hundred per cent american sfirst for favorite cuts youcan save on your beef chicken in pork by locking in your price today every single stake house quality cut is individually rapped in flash frosen to make a meal time easy hat on over to good ranchrstacom use mycood ben for thirty buxoffanybox that 's prummockood ben at good ranchers dotcom iagain good ransherstot comthat is american meat delivered good ranchers dotcom they maye me a coshstick when hi got telyus unbeleevable there meat is that good i think for everybody else it does not keep cocher gocheck cin out right nowt good rancherstot com meus my cood ben for thirtyboks off anybox okse as we jump into the actual debate i'm n explained you how i analyzed this debate the way that i analyze this particular debate is going to be my own subjective belief because every debate is a groshmon i tea the old crrisolophone tere's a thousand perspectives on what somebody says the vake might stay something and i mighthing man he is being wildly dishones and then there ig be peoples hye abut y's punching somebody again every debate is a matter of perspective i'm going to critik debate par ticipancs through a couple of diffent prisems that i think should still be important even if they seem increasingly non important in everyday political life ay i'm going to grat them base on is what thy're shing true are they being a decent person one my my grades of decency generally is i do not attacks that are false i do not them im thin voryu n atak somebody should attack somebody based on what they have done i'd onlhy you should just launch specious attacks on people as a general rule i understand that weliv in a very aggressive time and a lot o people take a gression on stage performed of aggression as well if he is doing it there then hall definitely do it to jobidon but does that make you a good person i feel you could actually launch well timed and well calebrated attacks on people and still take on jobine maybe it maybe i'm just shooting in the dark but that is how i grade people but again i understand that y prerspective not the only perspective which is why as we go on here i'm going to explain how each lane is grating people in this actual debate i'm also going to grate people based on theire actual policy performance which means inherent advantage to people who actually have governed a state or done athing as supposed you just said a thing now again i'm not sure this matter is in re publican primary any more it certainly has not mattered since present in trump i mean when when presidein trump became the nomine he literally had no governing record he' not ben in poltics at all igan i'm using metrics that may be outtated but again i get to do it i's mysho my metricks are generally tris wha theyre shing true are they being a decent person is what they are saying a reflection of actual policy winds on the ground for example i'min a grade people better if they do something ant i woke i suppose tou just saying something anse i woke i'm also going to grat people based on the actual policy conservatism of of what they are saying i do i think that the're actually right or not it is that that is how i typically grade these things now does that mean that my grades i're going to somehow going to be reflective of the momenthim in the race i thing absolutely not again i'm if i're going to place myself on this chart of trumpber's traditional geope liberal wane trumpit jason i'm i'm somewhere between trump adjascent and traditional geo pee probably i'm certainly not never trump chris christy liberal wing of the party and i'm certainly not in the i will vote for trump i walk over broken last tovote for trum i'm the people who think trumped t a pretty good job over all i though that hid the first three years owas president ho got som big policy wonsbut i was also very very un comfortable as yo all tnou with a lot of his reteric many of things that he said his habit of tweeting thati think was counter productives his own presidency his his is activities betwe november and january of two thousand and twenty one all that his behaviour sense all that stuff makes me un comfortable with many of the things trump did but also warm toward his performance in the first three years of as presidency get see the first three ears he last year i think was was rather disastrous on all fruns thin covet was a disaster i think his handling o belime was really bad i thin that we blew out the budjet lik they wre lot of problems even amongst those probem there ware winds s for exemple the abrahamicorts but iagain i wont m my o prospective clear mon bysey's cler how to analyze what i'm saying as whommon be up front notus with you on that sort of stuff lo people wont morgan go through the debate in detail right nou i do want o thank fox news they backed off their position yesterday that the had expressed clearly to us at they were not going to a low shows ourst actually cover the dbate by plaing more than three combined minutes of the debate i was rather livid about it yesterday fox news did get in touch with us they did let us know thatit was oka if we played as maneclipseis wanted from thedebate it is feiry use actually but good for them one give them credit for that ioga let us jumep in to the debate a that bate opens and everybody sort of gives there little intro rondo santis who is the yeu going into this the front runner of the second teare rich there is only there is only one person in the top here rand that is trump was there the person who is i the second here leading this thing was to santis te sansis goal as i say was it basically emerge alive did di santis emerge alive yet i'mean he did that really easily actually here as ron to sansis intro jo bidan back to his baseman and reverse american to clstandin we must threverse bine anomic that middle class families have a chance o succeed again we cannot succeed as a country if you are working hard and you cannot afor groceryis a car or new home while hunder bine can make hundreds of thousands of thollars on louse panings that is wrong en this is fine rihte down the line solid stuff from rontisansis and that thou describes a performancely last night fine solid ike tgoese are adjuctives that come to mine then weu have avate a vvake has womantom because in that trump ajacent lane which is not huge lane but's there he is doing really well he is out performing because he is going everywhere he saying anything he is slipping his positions in ord to say anything i here was eres a bates intro and very energetic as we will see he is gin n get knocked by chris cristy for cripping from obama there is something to the idea here that vavake is a very studied person i mean he is a very smark i and vevake basically has taken in political in formation over the course of last fifteen years and he is now and ave re turning it in vavake form and you get some times is lines that they come out of a bate that obviously up from somebody else to here here is a vacan his intro firs loemat just addresst a question that is on everybody's mind at hon to nine throu the ead is thes skitige with a funny last name and what the heckasy doing in the middle of this debate stage i'll tell have not a politician breat you are riht about that i'm anout to proneer my parents came to this country with no money forty years ago i have gone on to found multi billion dollar companies i did not while merrying my wife a poorva raising our two sons following our faith in god that is the american draine and i am genuinely worried that that american dream but we will not exsist for our two sons and thei're generation unless we do something about it and i do think brid is going to take an outsider because for a long time we have professional politicians of the re publican party who have been running from something now wi's our moment to start running to something oo gases ilook of the sort of stuff and i think this really platituding us but i also understand that it is very energetic i ve vick was extremely energetic on the stage last night and he is made for the enternt me he knows how to speak inter net on the nter net he sort of emotive big hand mothins excitement he was all enerty last night which made him lightning rod as we will see llget to more on this in just one

intrduce himself the vake introduce himself and then nicky haley introduces herself and agin i think the nickey out per formed last night i shoofs kind of surprise here she was last night w i do not care about polls what i care about the fact tas that no one has telling the american people the truth the truth is that midn did not do this to us ar republicans did this to us too when they pass that to pi to troan doler coit to moa to they lat tus with ninety million people on madicane forty two million people on foodstancs no one has told you had effect that i'll tell you hd effect that they need to stop that spandin they need to stop the borrowing i'll get points for truth here i understand that the new republican party says we should nver talk about titlemen programs ever again reality thosen't timen programs con bankrupt us those ar real and sowen nickey haley says that it may be onpopular it also appens to be right s o in my book sayng things that are on popular but true tens to when you points for me nickey haley i think gom yo did well last night meanwhile mike pence had a hard task last night head that simultaneously brag about his record is part of thetrumpence ad ministration and then is we will se to fend his behavior on chanuary secs here was last night o credibly crowd of the record of the trumpencs administration wen forshort years we rebealed our military we revived or com an we on lesh american and or two and we pont of three conservatives to the supreme court thet gave the american people and we be gan gak all of that as yoe can see from the crowd all that is perfectly fund ha then the real debaybroke out the real debake was that a lot of people on stage were annoyed with the vake the reason lot if heople on save runroy of the vake there is a pretty god reason he is obviously not running for president n he is not he is running to replace the guy he says the best president was we will see of the twenty first century he is running without criticizing that person he is running by attacking literally everyone else on the stage an he is saying things very very confidently that he was saying the opposite of five minutes ago now does any of that really matter in terms of momentum in particular lanes no and maybethe way thyou rave o vake is that heu's really aggressive i get it i totally understand he is really energetic he he is magnetic on the screat i mean he he passes what roger that the roger ails us roger ailsmen who would watch tevan determined whether somebody was good ontavy the way he would do it as he put on the mu but and if you watched last night there is no question that if you turned on the mu button the vake was the centr of attention there is just no question about it he also drew all the fire because all f the people on the stage who have actually spent their life doing politics are annoyed that a thirty eight your old guy with no political record and a long history of comments that actualy contravine his own comments to day e's showing up and calling them names that they were not real fond of that last night and a vake played right in to it ran me the vake really went for it this is the partwere again i think there is can be a gap between some of the stuff that i think about what vake said an maye be at the crowd thinks about what the vake said clip eight this is the one whre where romaswamme really decive the vake really again i know a vake i avake i can sur ressels friend of the vke i think these attacks are pretty dishonest here is i'm here is the vake basically just attacking everybody on stage with with a hatchet i sort of fun a bike for once that can cause he invoke me back let us now that who has got in their memris three prepared slogans out of the way we can at to have real discussion now o not not realling by gacly whers can ask e fun tonight and the reality is you have a bunch of people professional politicians superpact puppets following slogans handed over to them by their four hundred fate superpacts last week the real choice we fac in this primary is this do you want o superpac puppet or do you want a patriot who speaks the truth do you wantin or do you want revolution the is at an thiss the partwor my skinstarts ta in a risala but because i do not know what he is talking about i honesty got do not now a he is talking about when he says superpack puppet i soom tnow what he is talkingabout is the fact that rondisant is is superpack accidentally released some sort of debate plan that is not how superpacks work superpacks do not control the candidate the questions whye the candidate controls the superpack is when he says every one else on thi stage is a puppit it is what what that' deeplyked when i get to the decency point this is it just because people disagree wth you in are on the same stagis not mean tht they are corrupt or evil and i do not that line of atack on a personal level i do not that lint now is an effective line ofa tack sure it can me an effective line o attack but t seems to me that if you ought if you call somebody corrupt if you suggest that there superpack oons them if you suggest that they are preproduced while you you are doing this all spontaneously which is not true oh eh i but shoud be real about this when when pen says to the vake right there is that a pre canlin the enswers yes of course to pree can line clearly to prekthin camp if you think that that bevaked and prept for thetd bate you are you are idiotic i mean everyone prepts for to bate of course because it abate in fro a national audience in youst woke up in the morning rorld out of badness iman of just figures this thing out on the of course not ha butin any case that that sort of atack that the vake launch then prompted everybody to fire on him in response and the rest of the night was essentially just the vate taking in in coming now that is a vakes idea right he wants that by o people coming out ofthe bate were le tok a lot in coming firewright that it must to hurt him ut with whom the question is with whom he waunches this and then just to make sure that everybody gets the message that he wants to fight he does it again clip tan he then suggest that every sinple person on the stage is bought and paid for bea as republicans i've the only person of the stage who is in boughtan paid forsel i can say this that climate chanin in that wor w a he at alo bit a booze from the audience there but again everybody on the stage is bought and paid for except for you it is just it is tiresome it really is ii really dis tit on a moral level i did not one trumpted in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen iwling or omasuammy's doing it in twenty twenty three it is is not my bab is not my bak ano there some peoplewho love this sort ofthing i do not it i do not think it is moral to assume that everybody who disagrees with you is doing because they have been bought and paid for i ithings ugly does it achieve the purpos sure by the way there are politicians who our boughton paid for jo bidon is a politician who when he was the center of dellawere was bought and paid for by em bianet ca can name the people ho boughn paid for him here is mything if youre gon to say somebody is boughn paid for you then have to explain who bought them and paid for them i'd almoso confused by this particular line of attack on climate change just for a second who bought an paid for ronde santist on climate change was it the seera club what the hell is he talking about ifvyregt a pickin the rap on republicans is that there supposedly is what the left says bought and paid for bi the coax to be profracking an he being boughn paper by the oil industry who buys it and pays for republicans i'm climate change it is also worth noting here that five months ago a vake was asked about climate change and he said i actually actually climate change is man mad the rest of the peutebut again this it this is him trolling and i understandingour nect culter beas i'd do it everyday and thout thistude is an expert in a culture this the thing you can admire what he is doing on sort of a political level at the same time thayofre looking at this ling i'm not trade is morals wo simply suggest without any evidence whatsoever that every one who disagrees with you is some sort of corrupt tool of the shato we establishmen ithout to finding corruption tool or establishment but as you see thhe alweady wanted which is to be the lightning rod i chris christy who cannot help himself and if there is a pie to be thrown chris christy well for go even eating it in order to throw it christy then whent after the vacand i will say that that crist cristy does have a particular sot of skills when it comes to just recking people on stages that isyou would heach if he says n you wretct people on the stage and he was out of peata last night and im and his hit on romaswammy here actually is pretty well well based i ot enough already to night of a guy who sausi se bciy sit in one of these tho batesprad who stood in the middle of the stage who said what is a skinny guy with an id last thin doing up here whoas foroco bama and i'm afraid we are deal with the save type bamasure s o gat then the vake smacks christy bacto this this to bie him up for rit this gn o smacking om i hit that smack i do not is recalls everybody on the stage a a corrupticon tha the thing i do is christy says something through about romasuammy this kenna dissing amoke with here is where christy says something true about romasuammy which is basically you sound is though ou just took a bunch of slogans you threw them into a catchy peatiim what cim out wath vague and then ve vake comes back and and by the way you are ripping people off which is true i can when te vake says what is a skinny guy with we are last name duing up here that is literally aquote from borockabaman to thousand for at is literally a line from borockaba he is not wrong i will say that that cristy does have a long institutional memory and he is weaponized insult machine that was correct but i will say romas wamy's respons is just as correct bry which is if you are going to in votebarockabama it was you who is hugging him coming off the plane during hurricane sandy and two thousand twelve andyou are helping him out the national lection this gan to bad him up for actually

pluss join owt daily wire ot cams lash subscribe aget twenty five percentoff your knew anual membership she can watch convicting a murder when in prommers trustme ore not con whan a missit o k the debate continued there were a couple of isses that came up there ar couplishes that fox absoly did not cover they 'did not cover the giant gender issue they din cover that at all they would not cover critical race theory in any real serious way they they kind of touch on emigration but they made it secondary two things climate change which was very odd but they did get to abortion there is am honest to god interesting debates about abortion dug burgham and that is him the elimention ou hre of dug burghamall all day to day dugburgham who is the governor of north to cota i belive yes that yes nor to cota dugburgham them ous for his eyebrows and being a man in dug burgham he ot he made the bezar statemen thet when it comes to abortion la the tenth a men meant prevails and a lot o people can knocked him around for that there is an interesting debate however between nicky haley and migt pence particularly on abortion thereis niky haley pointing out quite rationally and i think with a night toward the general election the whn it comes to national abortion law your shit to pass things before you sign them let us be honest with the american people and say it will take fixty cen at vots it will take a majority of the house when order to do that let us find consentes cannot we all agree that we should band mate charm abortions cannot we all agree that we sho incorreg to docton cannot we all agree that doctors and nurses you do not believe in abortion should not have to perform them again i di this i this a perfectly fine general election take miht pence took the strongest line with regard to abortion here he was last night after i gave my life to jesus crise as my lord savior open up the book and i read before i formed you in the wom i knew you and see i set before you life and de blessings a curse is not choose life and i do from that momen on the cause of life had to be my cause an i'd been a champion for life in the congess o champion for life is governor and is vice proson him and ougt to be honest wy the advicto your my friend but a consentisis the opposite of leadership and that is an interesting sort of debate a consensus is is the opposite f leadership i only is particularly true i mean sometimes consensis i's actually built through leadership however with that sat it is an interesting and fastening i it completely went un noticed rigt tha the side show then continued what is it what is interesting as then we got into te section of the ebate where everybody sort ofe tried to lock down their positions it isin now the first hour tha dmade is bot establishing yor position that the position establishe by the various candidates in the first hour of the ebate was as we suggest in their lanes and and a and basically in orientation for predicular gles for o santis it was maintain your presence do not lose ground stay where you are for vak it was become a lightning rod and own that trump adjacent lane that we talked about for nicge hailey was on the traditional geo pe lane and that was the dynamic that sort of permeated the rest of the debate for example rondassent son crime his entire campaign and this is this is why i give to santis aditional creton give people for jur santings as i live in floren i've watched him do it de sansis entire campaign is you want a thing done i did not in florta maybe ashou to it nationally that is his entire campaign it may not be enough because we live in a period wheree a lot people do not seem to care what people actually do in trms of governing whe ni mean people could say they coul u say things now be amazin hero is ot rondassans is talking about crime there is one guy and this entire country that is ever done anything about that me when we had two of these e district aturties and florida elected with soros finding who said they would not do their job i removed im from their post they are as it at we are getto go after all of these people because they are currting the quality of life and they are victimizing innocent people in every corner of this country in it wi'll stop when i get into office s o get his entire campan last night was i'm bust governor in america i'll do it nationally that is fine did a mean momentum as we will discussin a second maybe not gat meanwhile we got into the most polorizing questions of the night these all surrounded trump and you can very clearly see who is aiming for which lane an there is a a question those asked as to whoud support trump even if he anded up being convicted in cort as bery awkward moment because the only prersent the vake was the kid in school who had the answer before anyone else he is in the front rubming this is sort of a vakes personality also because thi supersmark i but te vake's entire personality is basely the kid in modily you and tat you might not want o hang oupat youknow that he is asmark i here is a vake who jumps out of his seat basically runs around the room with his hand up screaming everybody else a little but slower i'm the gun here here is the question you all saw to pledge to support the eventual republican domina if former present trump is convicted in a court of law would you still support him as your party's shorce please raise your hand if you would and then then then vvacous time when we may hand up here all day long hesall if you go back to that clip is actually fascinating to see the order in which people raise their hands a something to this right and dom and franklim kana shock that' some of the handidte tend thought about this question being asked beforehand because we all know thering a support trump it these thenominy obviously except rasa hutchinson ho knowon cares about but ifyou look a that if yofll get te order o the hands go up in the vake as i say is superfast off the gun duit is wiet erp on the trigger here the next couple of hands they go up are hayly and scot and burgam te santis sort of reluctantly raise is hands on his pens and then and then cristy is can a shaking his head why 's cristy shaking his had u here was cristy locking down the never trumplane soan's god sto stop normalizing this conduct lo ce ow whether or not whither or not you believe that the criminal charges are right ore wrong the conduct is believe the office of president of the united states dothis is the great thing about this country boing is aloud wut it does not change the true it is thery is locking down that never trumplane right again there the fore lanes there the trumpers trshon giope trumpetjason never trumpers that is that is cristy locking town he never trumplane here is a vague trying to lock down the trump adjacent lane by being slavishly sicopantic to president trumpright here let' just speak the truth oca present trump i believe it was the best president of the twenty first cent your claim the donald trump is motiv aded by vengeance and grievancs would be a lot more credible if you are entire campaign we are not based on vengeance and grievane against d trump withowt and ioda of vison for this country they could just change the channel to amasand be sa right now but i'm not running for presid an an asan be seen i am running for president of the united states gaso there there is agai he is locking down that trumpetjacont lane but he he is not runng for president because here is the thing if you believe the donnal trump is the greatest president in human history at first of all i will say agai e vsupersmunkoc when he says at greatest president of the twenty for century that is a real shortliss guis there've only been three of them il ca and two of them not great it is george do bush followed by barockobama followed by donal trump and the next one is byden shat's thats on amazing lists that you have to toprt te but if you are that into trump you could not run we trumpit sain he wants the field clir i've noticed by the way that in reaction to thes debate and everything else trumptess prace is romis wommy which is donald trump if you see somebodies at threat youthink he praces them thot'n tromp has never praised anyone he has ever proceed as a threats this is why they are lot people in re publican party politics right now hare you are just a stalking horse that that is why you are in thrac does that mean the the vacasn an lock down that trump it jason line up he could easily lock down that trump adjacent lane and tom you kow he continued i to do this he he made a comminven on the station to day on he would pardon donal trump then we got to i think what was one of the most fascinating exchange is of the debate and that was the exchange over you crane because this goes to sort of the future of the republican party were broadly and where these various slans stand on foreign policy and this is a complete worshocktest because if you are in the sort of more isolation as swing of the re publican party ser of tocker carlson wing on on forign policy you loved with vake had to say if in the more traditional wing of the republican partyou think of thy got has ass hand ted to him s again every element here is based on which lane are you are you part of i'll get then we get to the form policy tebate and here once again this is the vake locking down the trump adjacent of peoplwo love trump on policy but have some probems mabbe with trump personalitywise the way he does this is by being the only person on stage who basely says right away that he would would draw all military aid to ou crane om and tom this turns into a pretty fiery debate which igthis is why you watch the debatesis she can nactually watch spirited conversations about issue soashing enjoy this part of thedebate the bout yuris ae vake and i think that this is jusati elses border when we should use those same military resources to prevent across the invasion of our own southern border yerin the niathe rusho china llions is the single greatest threat we face and i find it offense that we have professional politicions on the stages that will make a pilgrimage to keive to their pope is e lensky without doing the same thing for people and malwy wor the southside of chicigo man although i will say that i do not think that the sort of anti catholice slap there popezalensky is is prticuatly helpful to the vake he is the only one on the stage who is drawing a contrast with regard to ou crane and he was forcibly smacked around by both mike pens and nickey hailey here is my pense going after a vake and avake actually striking back with once again a quote from aboma this is why i say that because with tacu studied and because heunderstands what wut successful politicions has done in the past sometimes e justons a cribping loff of them buthe if we do the give away you want to give to prudent to give him his land is not tot to be too long for he rolls or cross an mato boarder and frankly ar men and women of are ar forces are i have to go on figdim i want on let fo ou crani as a rnin o to raou ith th rearlier do or asis mat that by as efence i dou ta lush that you as the sar does not exist any war it fell back in nineteen nindy u orser re a f t the ciin o as tas tat tof ra salk a that is enough that right there that is where he quoto momerate whet hou will that that is ol bom up against mit ramny twenty twelve the nigtin aties called then one ta form polisy back ran me that that that is all that is then matay gets into it with nicke haly and this was nickey's best moment o debate because she made a pretty coaching cases twhy the united states ought to be involved in the war in u crane again thi's ta very split question inside the republican party show thiscent of a fastioning part of the debate the reality is tha to da te d ii i ta soan i that tat the same yeople who took us into the eroch war the same beople who took us into toe ve at not war you cannot end that you not stor another no wind war and i do not want to get to the point war senting on military resources abroad when we could be better using them hured home to protect out on borders protect the home land ar that woilld mi top firyf a we ti t te f t in te ry ta fint gointng t to tother people because everybody ah iwe respect everybody's time here governor haley an you did not raise your hand meaning that you would support more funding for the u crane wor you have a said of governor dosantis that da you did not appreciate it when he initially called it a territorial dispute why first of all the american president needs to have moral clarity they need to know the difference between right and wrong they need to know the difference between good and evil when you look at the situation with russian yu crane here you have a pro american country that was in vaded by a thug when you want to talk about what has been given to you crane less than three and a half per cent of our defense budget has been given to you crane if you look at the persent at just cur g d p eleven of the european countries have given more than the uess but what is really importa is go back to wen china and russia held hands shook hands before the olempics and name themselves unlimited partners a when for russia is a wind for china we have to know that you crane is the first line of te fand fr and that ve that tot then understand is you wants the hand you crane to russia you wants the a let china eat ciwin you wants to go an stop finding israel you do not wios at to friends what you do in said as you have the backs of your friends you crane at te front line of defence boden has said if russia once russia takes you crane poland and the baltic surnext that is a world war where tryine tou for that war look at what pudn ded to day he killed forgosim when i was at the you ed the russian baster suddenly died this guy is tha murder and you ware choosing a murderr i e te cre on the teen the lock heed an rad thei nin the ta te the a eo ra yon and you in oin te o ta a gan rin i is li dad you ben pushtin is li allwe wan y go and de find dis you wan gen e an u ta on tat you o oin yi o ten o a thing you a no or o thing ver tan in shan wat ia kase sof this was haley's best momen of td bay by far it was a very weak moment for e vage i have the reason is his come back right there right which is i wish you well on your future career on the boards of locking rathyon again that appeals to that trump adjasent crowd who believes that all american forn policy as run by the military ans ustrial complex perhaps but tht is a really baseless insult and again i go back to if you are going to hit somebody hit somebdy for wat there was when he hits christy and he says you were hungng obama true if he is gon to hit somebody else on the stage for doing a thing they did o k but insulting all of your opponents as tools of the military industrial complex that any evidence to that effect is really really absurd and and nicky hay laghing handled herself really well right there it the rest of the debate was effectively more of the stage and this brings us too sort of my personal gradeon than will see lake what how people actually did let us start with ho got the most speaking time the promise you make candidtes on the tage definitely shuld not ben this many candidates on the stage burgham and hutchin son tok up fifteen minuts of time they souldnhae ben on the tage tim scott was on stage for eight minutes but really was absent now you are talking about li twenty three twenty forments of time that really was distributed poorly there the real people who shoud he ben on the stage the or are the are the top five people in from to time pence romasuamy christy dsantus haly by everybody else in in the stage is basically and also ran at this point now reignoing thelephant outside the room wich of course is trump which maymean that all these people off ran's but in terms who got most time pence got the most time which make some sense in that he is the person who has done precidential demates before the most of any of these people vevake because who is a lightning rod got the second most time followed by christy christy also wantets you some lightning rodstuff the santis got the fourth mauntime haly actually only got eight minutes on forty on seconds but she made him count how dos that stack up in frm is my personal grate i thought tho santus was fine i thought he was solid i thought that he he basiclly laid out his record he stayed out of scraps i think that his answer on you crane was a little bit but fuddled but i think other than that to santos tid o k right it was fine i would grate him a bee i'd give nickey haleian e i think she accomplished for purposes i thin she did towne of very short amout of time i think she really sur paset expectations for nearly everybody who watchd the debate even yoe do not nikey heu have to see that she actually did better than you expected or to do i ygi've saw a timscota see i who is basely not presen for any of this for pence i say yo probably give him a b but for different reasons then to santus a be because he is just in an unwinnable situation an he tood up for himself i thought actually rather well on january sixth i though that was worth while he is not can a gain any momentum from it will get to that moment and as for christy i'd say that tt that was a be cristy per formance in a cristy per formance e he is always ging to get the punch is in but he he does not have any of the charm that he once had in twenty eleven now he jus the punching machine be isabout thevesty can do as for the vakue the vake is very hard grave because the vake is the total roshamon candidate you look at the vake on the stage and for me if i'm if i'm assessing how he did based on sort of what is he telling the truth i thought a lot of ti'm not or based on were his where his attacks on other candidates rooted in their actual record on what they did no many times a or f youre basing it on his policy i think he is wrong on some of his policy prescriptions having some of he stuff he says about form policy in particular is just not true or within the realm of reality when he says a il i'll start with drawing aid from isral exum o creebe piece of middaleast between cotar and omon in israel cotar and omon are proeron tat that that just betraysn not a lot of knowledge about h mat a least and on is record right but but if you are talking bout the intrnat culture if you are togue wat the mem culture if you are talking out who had energy on the tage you aretngue bout the guy who as saying the things nobody else will say which is one way that we have now learned to gage politics is will he say the thing no one lsewud now i'm of the view and i'e always said this there is a difference between being politically in correct in saying the thing that must be sad that no one else will say and just saying the thing no one else will say but that distinction 's ben completely obliterator f of course the last ten yers or ifyou just say a thing that is vor boton then this means that you are brave by that metric fo vke kicked ass by that metric the vakted grave and this is what you see reflected o kas let us look at these debate results through that light who has momentum coming out o the spake that is really all that matters right three days ron ound nobodys gon amemis tobate there there is no lastin in pack but did anybody get momentum here did anybody get momentum i grated people based on whether they have strong uppwer momentum in eash lane sum up er momentum same down war momentum ore really downward momentum if you take a look of this chart what is looket y tof tese candidates ronassan says again his gold here was survive a which as whoup hol this debate affects to santis is going to be really up to what to santus does next on the you lost ground on thee gane ground with any group he was basely the same with every group going in as he was coming out does he have any momentum inside any lane to one of the there two ways theacan gain momentum they are too ways the ingin momentum in o presidential race wone hes tou gain over all moment national mo mentbig nationalmentum bcaus you are doing grat an multible groups and then there is the do you have momentu inside one lane this cannaction mu a lot se youcood action not too great in a debate but if you really lock up a lane you are momentum in that lane that lane is now going to start generating some up tickin nationalmu may not be huge mo bean up toc a national numbers ho can build off of that lane momentum is something you want coming out of the debate in at least one of the lanes you want momentum the santus does he have any lane momentum no coming out of this debate can he build it sure basically it is statisquo ante for to santus it is as though the debate never happen for t is santus forvavake the vake had some momentum among trumpers the thing about the vake is that no one really has momentum among trumpers because trump has trumpers ramine they are locked up among the traditional geope out tay the vavake whas can of the same is before the traditional goped not superfont of ake maybe has some negative momentum frum it but certainly 's not picking up ground among sort of the traditional geope three legged stool crowd with he never trumpling ofthe party he had serious negative momentum but again he was not gong to win tose people anyway he was himming for one lane and one lane only that is that fifteen per cent ror trumpetjason he has strong moment among those people that means that his upwer boundary tevakes upward boundary in this republican primary is probaly about fifteen per cent he is chiseling that away frum the santus right that he achieve his goal which oas strong upward momentum inside that one lane which credit to him he achieved that goal and he made himself more fa national lane which was his goal in this race in the first place because once again he is not running for presdent against nonnal trump the way i know that is because donald trump noses he is not rung for present against nonnal trump which is wy donnal trump his not attacked him every one who goes after trump who is proceeds the threat trump is attacked the is only one candiate in this race who is he serious candidate or proceeds the serious candidate who has not been a tack by tonal trump andthat is te vake o ak mike pente he comes away with negative omentum from the trumpers because again trummed unlike among the traditional geope he cam wear the lubit of upward momentum he came away with sum liberal wing momentum likh some never trump momentum little bit but does he have lic over all lane momentum strong lane momentum and the waym measuring lane momentum is basically d' youhave a too in any category right dod you have strong momentum in any one lane nothing minor ents big momentum an any one lane no for penc he would ake comes away basicaly the same he was before a person why i know my pent i thinke's an honorable human being an honorable person who is not going anywhere i this race nickey haley she is basicly wersihroes before him with trumpers in the traditional eope lane she has strung lomentum rit thats a bit was very good for nickey haley among the traditional geope lane and you could start locking up some downers she could be seen as an alternive to tim scott youcouldsee a lot of people turning away from scot and moving the money over to nicky haley for example are turning away from my pense and moving over nickey haley i would not be surprised if nicky haley's campane sarts to move from your two per sent nationally toward that seven o eight per cent nationally if you look at at timscot again i think he ended up basiclly wher he was beforehand every can elikes the gabinow nos ways here and has for chris cristy he has some lanemomentum with the never trumpling which is strong new hampsire did everybody sort of achieve their goll the answer is yes is this con make an overall diffrence against trump the answer's absolutely not because when you look at the te over all a the over all sort of take away frum the race trump still has all the momentum with the people who love trump and the trump adjacent wng nobody is taking him at away from him in the trump adjacent wing if you wished in order to beat trump a soome he has thirty per cent locked up absolutly locked up and assume there is another forty per cent that is that is playable and right now that splitting twenty per cent trump twenty per cent everybody else and then here is anever trumpling this twenty per cent this means that if you are going to stack up how to beat trumpright now you ave to assume trump has thirty five per cent of the boat locked up then you have the traditional ciope wing which he is splitting half with the rest of the party which means that he is alredy at forty ceven per cent and that is leavingside the twenty per cent tror trump adjacent an order to beat trump you basically have to wind all the never trumpling you havethomg an all of the trmp adjacent wing and you ave to split the trump giope vote or you have to take all of the traditional trump iopeevot and you have to take five per cent of thetrump adjacent wing who can cansolidate that youn see whi trump has this very very solid lead who exactly can consolidate that sort of math right now all of these lanes are split and trump has a foot in at least three of them is there an neard cother candidate who has a foot in three of these lanes the answer is no there is not a single candidwho has a foot in three of these wins except for to cantus which i's why to santus is still the person who has the be shot of beating trump in a primary buty's can have to show some momentum coming out of this debate because the maf just none work all that well for anybody who is not name trump meanwhile don trump assess this debate in his own way as you 'd pedict he is big fan of romas wobby which demonstrates once again that heis not running again tromaswammin nors the bake running against him ye at one point tweeted out this answer gave the bake a big win in the debape he is of a thing called to rooth thank you the bake that would be with regard to the bake explaind ha he was the best president of the twenty fir century of course again trump i think at abrygod time probably watching thedebate ya he he was attacking criss cristy he was a attacking nickey haylee little bit he went after for sure the santis but over all nothing really happened the debate that that i think shook trumps lead meanwhile trump sory gets wer were complaining tht they were blocked from the spin roomhich they should be blocke from the spin rom if your candidate does not shop for ther bate you do not get to go to the spin room and then jaber about the other candidates cen rediculous m but t here is a tonjunor complaining about last night right now trying to bin people from action wy having just course about polip ah ow y probably houldn't surprise any of us but that is what it is i've been told by other s i would be able to go i they said we weren able to go in at the sent they were i ow the were here wit handi candidate that ad you theyr telling we re ow os wont lame into tospen ron i eartiry posket down is o a cind of an colling hand rts for security here but they'r telling ham that i'm not allowed to go in there because the candidates the moni e dancren a lass to mate o no un understand for the last what two years did not perform as they had hoped they cannot have someone who can maybe bea re presentative of my fother to sice a few weeks ago when i was canselled after the first indictment i was catual to go on t abut hana the tantarn tis id this is silliness this silliness if your candidate does not chup to the debate you do not get to put your person in this bedroom i mean tat that seems fairly fair anover level especially because trump was getting plenty of attsention ofhis own in interview tug across an unswitter ax apparently it has some two hundred million views now worth exploint explaining here that every time you scrolled past the vidion ons witter and spent longer than two seconds on it that countss of viou 's that equivalent tactually watching a a national telivise debate those views are anot in any way equivalent but those are a big number none none the less and trump had it easy tucker asked him zera hard questions tuckerd not press him on pretty much anything we will get to that in the member block but if you are not a member you have become member and

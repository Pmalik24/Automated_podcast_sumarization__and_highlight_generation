welcome to the huberman latpoes disus science science pace to i madruhubermen and a roprofessor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin to day my guest is doctor mathew mac dugall doctor matthew mc dugall is the hednero surgeon at nerl link nerl link is a company whose goal is to develop tecnologies to overcome specific clenical challenges of the brain and nervous system as well as to improve upon brain design that is to improve the way that brains currently function by augmenting memory by augmenting cognition and by improving communication between humans and between machines and humans these are all of course tremendous goals and nerl link is uniquely poised to accomplish these goals because they are approaching these challenges by combining both existing knowledge of brain function from the fields of nero science and nero surgery with robotics machine learning computer science and the development of novel devices in order to change the ways that human brains work for the better to day's conversation with doctor mathew mc dugall is a truly special one because i and many others in science in medicine consider nero surgeons the astronauts of nero science and the brain that is they go where others have simply not gone before and are in a position to discover incredibly novel things about how the human brain works because they are literally in there probing and cutting stimulating et cetera and able to monditer how peoples cognition and behavior and speech changes as the brain itself is changed structuraly and functionally today's discussion with doctor mc dugal will teach you how the brain works through the lens of a nero surgion it will also teach you about nerl link specific perspective about which challenges of brain function and disease are immediately tractable which ones they are working on now that is as well as where they see the future of augmenting brain function for sake of treating disease and for simply making brains work better to day's discussion also gets into the realm of devicing the pariferal nervous system in fact one thing that you will learn is that doctor mc dugall has a radio receiver implanted in the perfry of his own body he did this not to overcome any specific clinical challenge but to overcome a number of daily every day life challenges and in some ways to demonstrate the powerful utility of combining novel machines novel devices with what we call our nervous system and different objects and technologies within the world i know that myght sounalobit mysterious but you will soon learn exactly what i'm referring to and by the way he also emplanted his family members with similar devices while all this might sound a litimate science fiction this is truly science reality these experiments both the implantation of specific devices and the attempt to overcome specific movement disorders such as parkensins and other disorders of deep brain function as well as to augment the human brain and make it work far better than it ever has in the course of human evolution are experiments and things that are happening now at nurl link doctor mc dugall also generously takes us under the hood to speak of what is happening at nurl link explaining exactly the sorts of experiments that they are doing and have planned how they are approaching those experiments we get into an extensive conversation about the utility of animal verses human research in probing brain function and in devicing and improving the human brain and in overcoming disease in terms of nur surgery and nrl link' goals by the end of to day's episode you will have a much clearer understanding of how human brains work and how they can be improved by robodics and engineering and you will have a very clear picture of what nurl link is doing toward these goals doctor mc dugall did his medical training at the university of california sandiego and at stamford university school of medicine and of course is now at nurl link he is in a unique stancs to teach us about human brain function and disfunction and to explain to us what the past present and future of brain augmentation is really all about before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's potcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the caled electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolite concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performances element contains a science backtolectrolite ratio of one thousand miligrams thats one gram of sodium two hundr miligrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doccom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleement docom slash hubermen and now for my discussion with doctor matthew mac dugal doctor macdugal welcome good t be ni cc ndr grat to see you again i will get intoour history i litleat later but just to kick things off as a nero surgeon and as a nero scientist can you share with us your vision of the brain as an orgain as it relates to what is possible there i may think most everyone understands that the brain is alon g with the body the seat of our cognition feelings are ability to move et cetera and that damage there can limit our ability to feel the way we want to feel or move the way we want to move but surgeons tend to view the world alo it differently hand most because as the not funny joke goes they to cut and they to fix an they to men than the in your case have the potential to add things into the brain that do not exist they are already how do you think about and conceptionalize the brain as an organ and what do you think is really possible with the brain that most of us do not already probably think about ye hat's great question thinking about the brain as this three pound lump of meat trapped in a prison of the skull a it seems almost magical that it could create a human a human set of behavior is anda life a merely from electrical impulses when you start to see patience and see say a small tumor eating away at a little part of the brain and see a a very discreet function of that brain go down in isolation i you start to realize that the brain really is a collectien of functional modules pinned together duck tave together a in this in this bone box attached to your head a and e sometimes you see very interesting failure modes one of the most a memorable patience i ever had was very early on in my training i was down at you see sandiego and saw a a very young guy who had just been in a car accident we had operated on him and as is often the case in nor a surgery we had saved his life potentially at the cost of quality of life when he woke from surgery with bilateral front a loab damage he had essentially no impulse control left and i we rounded on him after surgery saw that he was doing oka to our first guess at at his a health and we continued on to see our other patience and we are called back by his eighty year old recovery room nurse saying he have got it come see your patient right away something is wrong and we walk in to see him and he points at his elderly nurse and says she will not have sex with me and you knw it was apparent at that moment his front a lobs were gone and that person is never going to have reasonable human behavior again am and th that is it is one of the most tragic ways to have a brain mouth function but i anything a brain does anything from control of hormone levels in your body to vision to sensation to the most obvious thing which s muscle movement of any kind from i movement to moving your bysep all that comes out of the brain all of it can go wrong i any of it any part of it or all of it a y a working with the brain is the substance of the brain as a surgeon very high stakes a but once and while you get a chance to really help you get a chance to fix something that seems unfixable and you have un a lazarous miracles not not too uncommonly it is extremely satisfying as a career could you share with us one of the more satisfying experiences her or perhaps a the top contour of what am qualifies as satisfying in in nurus urgery ye a one of the relatively newer technique that we do is some one comes in with a a reasonably small tumor somewhere deep in the brain that is hard to get to the traditional approach to takin that out would involve cutting through a lot of good normal brain and disrupting a lot of nerons a lot of white matter that oun acount of wires connecting ther ons am then the modern approach involves at two millimeter drill hole in the skull that down which you can pass a little fibroptic icanula and and attach it to a lazer and just heat the tmor up deep inside the brain under direct amari visualization in real times your this person is in the emar iye scanner you are taking pictures are e second or as the tumor heats up you can monitor the temperature an get it exactly where you an at where it is can kill all those tumor cells but not hurt hardly any of the brain surrounding it and inot uncommonly nowadays we have some one come in with a tumor that previously woul have been catestrophic to operate on and we can eliminate that tumor with te leaving a poke hole in their skin i with ialmost no visual after effects that precedyure that you just describe translates into better clinical outcomes meaning fewer call them side affects are collateral damage exactly right ye i we do not even in cases that previously would have considered totally an operable say a tumor i in the brain stem or a tumor in a primary motor cuartex or primary i verbal areas broke as area i where we would have expected to either not operate or du catestrophic damage those people sometimes now are coming out unscathed i'm very curious about the sorts of basic information about brain function that can be gleaned from these clinical approaches of elesions and a strokes and maybe even stimulation for instance in your example of this pation that had by lateral frontal damage what do you think his lack of regulation reveals about the normal functioning of the fronta loaves because i ting the obvious answer to most people's going to be well the frontaloves are normally a limiting impulsivity but as we both know because the brain has excitatory and inhibatory noronts a sort of accelerators embraks on communication h that is not necessarily the straight forward answer a it could be for instance at the frontal bloabes are a acting as conductors and are can of a important but not the immediate players in determining impulsivity a two questions really what doyou think the frontaloaves are doing these on very entrigue by this a human expanded real estate you have a lot of it comparative other animals and a more generally what o you think it damage of a given nurl tissue ameans in terms of understanding the basic function of that tissue yit varies inink from tissue to tissue a but with respect to the frontaloaves i think they act as sort aa filter they selectively are saying s backward to the rest of the brain behind them a when part of your brain sas that looks very attractive i wantic o grabit and take it a out of the jewelry display case or in whatever a the fronta loages are saying you can if you go pay for it first their filtering the behavior there there letting the impulse through may be but in a controlled way a this is very high level very broad athinking aout how the frontalopes work and that that patient i mentioned earlier is a great example of when they go wrong he had this impulse sor strange impulse to i be a tr acted to his nurse i that normally would be easy for frontelopes to say this is completely inappropriate wrong setting wrong i person wrong time i in his case he had nothing there and even the slightest inclination to i to want something came right out to the surface i ya filter calming the rest of the brain down from acting on every possible impulse when i was a graduoues ton i was am running what are called these what these are but jus inform you what are called acutes which are a nour physiological experiments at last several days because at the end you i you terminate the animal this is an my apologies to those that a are made uncomfortable by animal or search i now work on humans i a diffrent type of animal but at the time we were running these acutes that would start one day and and maybe end two or three days let later since you get a lot of data the animals an necessize and does not feel any pain the entire time of the surgery but the uone consequence of these experimentes that the experiment or me and another individual are awake for several days with an hour sleep here an hours sleep there but your basely awake for two three days something that really i could only do in my teens and twenties was in my twenties at the time and i recall a going to eat at a diner after one of these experiments and i was very hungry and the waitrous walking by with a trayful of food for another table and it took every bit of self control to not get up and take the food off the tray something that of course is totally an appropriate and i would never do and it must have been based on what you just said that my forebrain was essentially going off line or off lyine from the sleep deprobation because there was a moment there were i thought i might reach up in grab a plate of food passing by simply because i wanted it and am i did not a but i can relate to the experience of feeling the response is a flickering in and out under conditions of sleep deprovations do we know whether not sleep deprovation limits for brain activity in a similar kind of way i i do not know specifically if that i effect is more pronounced in the forebrain i suppose to other brain regions but it is clear that sleep deprovation has broad effects all over the brain i people starts the visual lucination the opposite end ofthe brain as the the visual cortecs in the far back of the brain is effected people a people's cord motor cordination goes down iafter sleep deprovation m i think if i if you force me to give a definitive answer on that question i'd have to guess that the entire brain is effected by sleep deprovation and it is not clear that one part of the brain is more effected than another s weve ben talking by damage to the brain and inferring function from damage a who youd talk a little bit about what i consider really the holy grail of the nervous system which is naurro plasticity was incredible capacity of the nervous system to change its wiring strength an connections weakin connections may be new nerons but probably more strengthening and weakening of connections nowadays we are a lot of excitement about socal classical psychodelic psycholisty and sylisiban which do seem to quoting qu open plasticity they do a bunch of other things to but am through the release of neuromodulators saratonan and forth how do you think about neuro plasticity and more specifically what do you think the potential for neuro plasticity is in the adult let us ay older than twenty five year old brain with were without machines being involved ycaus am in your roll at naurow link and as a nerrow surgeon in other clinical settings am surely you are using machines and surely you have seen plasticity in the positive and negative direction what o you think about plasticity what is possible there without machines what is possible with machines as you mentioned are alluded to the plasticity definilly goes down in older brains a it it is harder for older people to learn new things to make radical changes in their behavior a to in a kick habits that the have had for years a machines are not the obvious answer implanted electrodes and computers are not the obvious answer to increase plasticity necessarily compared to a drugs we already know that the're pharmic logics some of the ones you mention psychadelics that have abroad impact on plasticity yait is hard to know whicherry of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation target for an electrode a to broadly juice plasticity a compared to a pharmic logic agents that we already know about a i think with plasticity you are talking in general you are talking about the entire brain you are talking about altering you kow a trillian synapses all in a similar way iin their tendency to be rewirable to their tendency to be up ar down waited and an electrical stimulation target in the brain necessarily hass to be focus with he device petentially nurlinks there might be a more broad ability to steer current a tumultiple targets with some degree of control but you are never going to get that broad a target ability with any electrates that i cancy coming in our lifetimes say that would be coting the entire surface and depth of the brain the way that a drug can and i think pl asticity research will bear the most frut hen at focuses on farmaclogic agents iwas not expecting that ants are given that your at nerl link and a and then again i think that all of us me included yeed to a take a step back and realized that while we may think we know what is going on at nerrl lnk in terms of the specific goals in the general goals and i certainly have in mind i think most people have in mind a chip in planted in the brain or maybe even the perferal nervous system that can give people supermemories or some other augmented capacity we really do not know what you all are doing there i for all we know a you as ar taking or ministering syllicidan and combining that with stimulation and we we really do not know and i say this am with hat with a tone of excitement because a i think that one of the things that exciting about the different endeavors that elan has really speareheaded m space exs tustle et cetera is that early on there is there is a lot of mistike in a mistik is equality that am is not often talked about but am it is i think of very exciting time in which a engineers are starting to a toss up big problems and go forden and obviously elan is certainly among the best if not the best in terms of going really big min mar seems pretty far to me electric cars all over the road nowday is very differen than the picture a few years ago ah when you did not see many of them rockets and forth and now the brain to the extent that you are aloued a could you share with us what your vision for the missions at nerl link are and what the general scope of missions are and then am if possible a share with us some of the more specific goals i can imagine basic goals trying to understand the brain and augment the brain i could imagine clinical goals are trying to re here things in them humans that are suffering in some way or animals for that matter ye it is it is funny what you mentioned a nurlinc and i think testlin spase before it and up being these blank canvases that people project their hopes and fears on to and we we experience a lot of upside in this people assume that we have super powers in our ability to alter the way brains work and people have terrifying fears of the horrible things were going to do a for the most part those extremes are not true a we are making a nurl implant we have a robotic insertion device that helps place tiny electrads the sides asmaller than the size of a human hair all throughout a small region of the brain in in the first indication that we are aiming at we are hoping to implant a series of these electrads into the brains of people that have had a bad spinal cart injury people that are essentially quadroplegec they have perfect brains but they cannot mov use them to move their body they cannot move their arms or legs because of some high level spinal cordamage exactly right and this in a pristine motor quartex up in their brain is completely capable of operating a human body it is just not wired properly any longer to a human's arms or legs and our goal is to place this implant i into a motor quartex and have that person be able to then control a computer a mouse and a keyboard as if they hade their hands on a mouse and a keyboard even though they are not moving their hands their motor intentions are coming directly out of the brain into the device and they are able to regain their digital freedom and connect with the world through the internet why use robotics to insert these chips and the reason i asked that is that sure i can imagine that a robot could be a more precise or less precise but in theory more precise than the human hand no tremor for instance am i more precision in terms of a maybe even a little a micro detection device on the a the tip of the blade or a or something that could detect a capilary that you would want to avoid and swerve around that not that the human eye could not detect and you and i both know however that no two brains nor are the two sides of the same brain identical navigating through the brain is perhaps best carried out by a human however and here i am going to interrupt myself again and say ten years ago face recognition was very clearly performed better by humans than machines and i think now machines do it better is this the idea that eventually or maybe even now robots are better surgeons than humans are in in this limited case yes a these electrids are tiny and the blood vessels on the surface of the brain numerous and densely packed that a human physically cannot do this a human hand is not steady enough to grab this in a couple my crown with the loop at the end of our electra thread and place it accurately blindly by the way into the cortical surfas accurately enough at the right depth to get through all the cortical layers that we want a reach a and i would love if human surgeons were essential to this process a but very soon humans run out of motor skills sufficient to do thi s job and we are required in this case to lean on robots to do this incredibly precise incredibly fast incredibly numerous placemen of electraes into the right area of the brain in some ways nurlink is pioneering the development of robotic surgeons as much as it is pioneering the exploration and augmentation and treatment of human brain conditions right and as the device exists currently as we are submitting it to the f die it is only for the placemen of the electrates thathe robot 's part of the surgery i or or another nar surgent still neds to o the the more crude part of opening the skin and skull and presenting the roboda pristine brain ser surface to electrats into surely getting quadruplegics to be able to move again or maybe n to walk again is a a heroic goal and one that i think every one would agree would be wonderful to accomplish is that the first goal because it is hard but duable a or is that the first gual because you and elan and other folks at nurl link a have a passion for a getting paralyzed people to move again broadly speaking the mission of narrolinc is to reduce human suffering at least in the near term thers hope that eventually there is a use here that makes sense for a brain im inter face to i bring a ey ias a tool embedded in the brain that human can use to augment theire capabilities i think that is pretty far down the road a for us but definitely on a desired road map in the near term we really are focused on people with terrible medical problems to have no options right now a with regard to motor control i our mutual a friend recently departed a chrishnicionois was a giant in this field of motor cros thesis it just happens that his work was foundational for a lot of people to work in thissara including us and he was an adviser tonurling that work was farther along than most other work for addressing any function that lives on the surface of the brain the physical constraints of our approach require us currently to focus on only surface features on the brain we cannot say go to the relie very compelling a surface a deep depth functions that happen in the brain alike mood appetite addiction a pain sleep we would leve to get to that place eventually but i in the immediate future our first indication or two or three will probably be brain surface functions motor control i'd to take a quick brak and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag one is a vitament mineral probiotic drink that covers all your foundationa nutritional needs i've been taking athletic gren since two thousand ind twelve a'm delighted that their sponsoring the podcast thereason i story taking athletic greens in the reason i still take athltic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate wit the brain the iman system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiotics and athletic grens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptigens vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tasteripe if youd to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greens dock calm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel p o that make it really easy to mix up oth letic grains while you 're on the road and the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply o vitem in d three k too again that is that letter green stock calm slat humormen to get the fivefre travel packs and the year supply a vitemind three k to for those listening the a outer portions of the brain or a filled with or consist of rather a neel quartec the the bumpy stuff a that looks a sea coral a some forms of see coral a look brains or brains look tham a and then underneath a reside a lot of the brain structures that control a what math jes referred to am thinksin trali mood hormone output a how a waker sleep the brain is a an would you agree that those deeper regions of the brain have in some ways more predictable functions i mean that lesions there or stimulation there lead to more predictable outcomes in terms of defasits or a improvements in function yein some way yes i mean to the deeper parts of thebrain ten to be more steriotype as in more similar between species then the the outer surface of the brain there kind of the firmware or the the housekeeping functions to some degree body temperature blood pressure sex motivation a hunger things that you do not really need to vary dramatically between a fox an a human being a whereas the the outer more reasoning functions a problem solving functions a between a fox an a human are vastly different and he physical acquirements of a those brain outputs are different think i heard elon describe it as a the human brain is i'm essentially a monkey brain with a supercomputer placed on the outside a which amsparksome interesting ideas about what neel quartex is doing we have all this brain real estate on top of all that more stereatyped function type stuff in the deeper brain a and it is still unclear what noquartex is doing in the case of frontal quartex as you mentioned earlier it is clear that it is a providing some quieting of of impulses am some contact setting rule setting contex switching am all of that a makes good sense but then therere a lot of cuarticlary is that surer baldin vision or tauch or hearing but then there is also a lot of real estate that just feels ununexplored i'm curious whether or not in your clinical work or work with nurl lynk a we are both whether not you have ever encountered nurons that do something that is really peculiar and intriguing a and here i'm referring two examples that could be anywhere in the brain ag go wow these nurons when i stimulate them or when they are taken away leads it something kind of bizare but interesting y ythet there is a the one that comes immediately to mind is unfortunately and a terrible case and kids that have a a tumor in the the hypothlmas that lead to at what we call gelastic seizures which is sort of a uncontrollable fit of laughter there is been cases in the literature were this laughter is uncontrollable and pervasive that people suffocate a from failing to breathe ere they laugh until they pass out and you do not normally think of a deep structure in the brain the hypothalmas as being involved in thyou know a function a humor and and certainly when we think about this kind of laughter in in the these kids with tumors it is a mirthless laughter is the the conitexbook phrase a humorless laughter it is just a reflective a almost zom belike behavior and it comes from very small population of narans deep in the brain this is one of the other sart a strange a loss of functions you might say as it is it is nice that you and i can sit here and not have constant adesructive fits of laughter coming out of our bodies abut that that is an neronal function that is in a thank goodness to the neran's properly wired and properly functioning and any nerans that do anything this can be broken and we see this in horrifying cases that from time to time 'm starting to sense that there are to broad bins of approaches to augmenting the brain either to treat disease or forsake of increasing memory creating superbrains et cetera one category ulid to earlier which is pharmacology and you specifically mention thet the tremendous power that pharmacology holds ewith a nots through psychodolics or through prescription droger wo know some other compound the other approach are these lill micro electrodes that are extremely strigegically placed e into multiple regions in order to play essentially a concert of electricity that is exactly right to get a quadroplegic moving an that sparks two questions first of all is there a roll for and is nurllink interested in combining pharmacology with stimulation not not immediately rigt now we are solely focust on the extremely hard some might say the hardest problem facing humans right now of decoting the brain through electrical stimulation and recording that is that is enough for us for now omti gis i give us a bit fuller picture of this r tuging about a patient who cannot move their limbs because they'e have spontle cordamage e am the motor quartec that controls movement is in fury fine make a small hole in the skull and through that hole a robot is going to place electrodes obviously motor quartec but then where how is the idea tat you are going to play a concert from different locations you can hit all the keys on the piano in different comminations and then figure out what can move the limbs am what i'm alluding to here is i still do not understand how the signals are gingto get out of motor quartec pass the lesion and into am and out to the limbs because the leision has not been dealt with at all in thes cenaria sor just to clarify there i i have should emphasize were not in the immediate future t talking about re connecting the brain to the patient's own limbs that is on the road map but it is way down the road map a few years im what were talking about in the immediate future as having the person be able to control electronic devices around them with their motor intentions alone right drosthetic hand an arm or just mouse and and keys on a mousin keys on a keyboard for starters you would not see anything in the world move as they have an intention the patient might imagine say flexing their fist or moving their wrist and what would happen on the screen is the mouse would move down and left and click on an icon and bring up their word process sir and then a keyboard at the bottom of the screen would allow them to ou select letters in sequence and they could type ithis is the easy place to start i easy and quits i would say because uam the transformation of electrical signals from motor quartecs through the brainstem into the spinal quarter now to the muscles is somewhat known through a hundred years or more of incredible laboratory research but the transformation meaning how to take the electrical signals out of motor quartex and put it into a a mouse or a robot arm it that is not a trivial problem that there that is a whole other s of problems in fact well wwe are take we are unloading some of that difficulty from from the brain itself from the brain of the patient and putting some of that a into software we are using smarter a algarythms to decode the motor intentions out of the brain we have been able to do this in monkeys really well we have a a small army of monkeys playing vidio games for a yu know smoothy rewards an they do really well we we actually have the world record of a bit rate of information coming out of a monkey's brain to intelligently control te curser on a screen we are doing that better than any one else a and again thanks in no small part due to chrishnachanois and his his lab and the people that have worked for him that ave been helping narling a but what you cannot do with that monkey is ask him what what he is thinking you cannot ask him we can ask him body you will not get a very interesting answer you cannot tell him to try something different you cannot tell him to he try their shoulder on this i try the other hand and see if there is some cross body a ner on firing that that gives you a useful signal once we get the people a we expect to see what they have seen when they have done similar work in acdemic laps which is ththe human can work with you to vastly excelerate this process and get much more interesting results one of the things a out of ut of standford recently is a there is a lab that a with christhnan jamie henderson an and other people decode speech out of the hand movement area in the brain a what we know is that there are multitudes of useful signals in each area of the brain that we have looked at far they just tend to be highly expressed for say hand movement in the hand area that does not mean only handmovement in the hand area here is the confidence test there is a long history dating back really prior to the nineteen fifties of scientists doing experiments on themselves not because they are reckless but because they want the exact sorts of information that you are talking about rability to really understand how intention and awareness of goals can shape outcomes in biology if that is vague to be belistening what i mean here is that for many probably hundreds of years if not longer scientists have takin the drugs they have studied or stimulate o their own brain or done things to really trying get a sense of what the animals they work on or the patientsthey work on might be experiencing psychotris are sort of famous for this by the way not twenty fingers an anyway but psychitris are known to try the drugs that they administer and some people would probably imagine that is a good thing am just to that the clinitions could have empathy for the sorts of side effects and not great effects of some of these drugs that they administer to the patience but the confidence test i present you is would you be willing or are you willing if alowed to have these electrodes implanted into your motor quartacs yyou are not a quadroplegic you can move your limbs but give in the state of the technology at norl link now would you do that or maybe in the next couple of years if you are allowed would you be wiling to do that and od be the person to say hey turn up the stimulation over there i feel i want to reach for the cup with that robotic arm but i'm feeling had of some resistance because it is exactly that kind of experiment done on a a person who can move their limbs and who deeply understands the technology and the goals of the experiment that i would are you as she stands to advance the technology fastest sire as opposed to putting the electrotes first into somebody who a is imperated a number of levels and then try to think about wy things are not working i ight then again it this is all with the the goal of of reversing paralysis in mind a but would you implant yourself with these mycrelectrotes ye absolutely i i would be excited to do that i think for the first iteration of the device it probably would not be very meaningful it would not be very useful because i can still move my limbs and our first outputs from this are things that i can do just as easily with my hands ight moving a mouse typing in a keyboard a we are necessarily making this device as a medical device for starters for people with bad medical problems and no good options a it would not really make sense for a able bodied person to get one in the near term it as the technology develops and we make devices specifically designe to perform functions that cannot be done even by an able body person i say eventually refine the technique to get to the point where you can type faster with your mind and one of these devices than you can with text to speech aour speech to text and your fingers that is a usecase that make sense for some one me to get it it does not really make sense for me to get one when it allows me to use a mouse slightly worse than i can with my hand currently athat said the safety of the device i would absolutely vouch for a from the hundreds of surgeries that i personally done with this i i think it is much safer than many of the industry standard fti approved a surgeries that i routinely do on on patience that are are kno one even thinks twice about their standard of care a nurlint is already reached in my y mind a safety threshold that is far beyond a commonly accepted safety a threshold alone lines of augmenting one's biological function or functions in the world i think ni'ls the appropriate time to talk about am the small lump a present in the top of your hand for those listening not watching there is a it looks a a small lump between a doctor mc dugles a forefinger and thumb or innex finger in thumb a place it on skin bl on the top of his hand a you have had this for some years now because we have known each other for goch probably seven years now or and you have always had it in the time thay've known you what is that lump am and why did you put it in there yso it is a a small a ritable arifi detag what is an rifide what is our ifi d stand for yoa radio frequency identification a and it is just a very small implantable a chip that wireless devices can a temporarily power if you approach an antanna i can power and send a small amount of data back and for i most phones have the capability of reading and writing to this chip i'm for years it i it let me into my house it unlocked a deadbolt on my front door am for some years it unlocked the doors at narlink and let me through that the various i locked doors inside the building a it is writable i can write a small amunt of data to and for some some years in early i i the early days of cripto i had a cripto private key written on it a tostor a criptocurrency that i thought was a dead offshoot of one of the main i cript o accurrencies after at fork and i put the privat walikey on there and forgot about it and remember t a few years later that it was there and went in checked and it was worth a few thousand dollars more than when i left it on their that was an ice finding change in the sofa and the twenty first century and when you see you read it your esentilly taking a aphone or other devicein ganning it over the re are if the the a lump in your hand to speak and then it can read the data from there yo unsually ye what other sorts of things could one put into othese areifid es in theory and how long can they stay in there before you nad to take them out and im ye and i recharge them or rplace them well the these are passive they are coted in by a compatible glass and as an extras i'm a rock climber and as worried about that glass shattering i during rock climbing i additionally coted them in another ring of silicone i before emplanting that it is it is pretty safe they are passive there is no battery there is no i active electronics in them they could last the rest of my life i do not think i'd ever have to remove it for any reason at some point the technology is always improving i might remove it and opgrated im that is not inconceivable already there is ten ax more storage versions available that could be a a drop in replacement for this if i ever remove it im but theyt it has a small niche a use case and it is an interesting proof of concept tiptoing towards the concept that you mentioned of you have to be willing to go through the things that you are suggesting to your patients i in order to say with a straight face that you think this is a reasonable thing to do im a small subjuctaneous implant in the hand it is a little different than a brain implant but yet what is involved in getting that am arfed egypt into the hand is it hemassuming its an ou patient procedure presume whle you did on yourself ye ye the this was a kitchen table kind procedure many anaesthetic ors or no i a i've seen people do this with a lighti can injection i for my money i think a ligt i can injection is probably as painful as just doing the proceedures a little cut in that thin skin on the top of the hand r some people are cringing right now other people are say i want on as you laft i never where about losing your keys ye wor passwords i actually rear it for passwords because i'm dreadfully bad it a remembering passwords i have to put them in places a all over the place and then s 'm that kid in am that rmemer that we be stand by me where the kid hides the pennies under the the porch an the rases the ma spends all sommer turn wmis i can relate a yes i a little iu's just a little slit and then put in there no local ammun response no no no posson all well n teterials are completely about compatible there on the surface expese on the body no no bad reaction and healed up in days and twas fine very cool nim since weare on vidio here maybe cane jush a maybe theres it and show us has were you not to point out a that le lumpi i wouldn' have known to to ask about it but and a any other members of your family aa few years after having this and seeing a convenience of me being uplt open the door without keys a my wife insistent that i put when in her as well she is walking round with one fantasta can we consider them sr or our version of wedding rings we it well certainly am more permanent than wedding rings and in and some sense am i cannot no but ask this questionan though it might seem a little bit off topic as long as we are tying bout implantable devices and am blue tooth and a ar if i e chips in the body i can ask a lot about am the safety or lack thereof of a blue tooth headphones im you work on the brain youare brain surgeon am that is valuable real estate in there and am you understand about electromynetic fields and am any discussion about ye a mast immediately puts us in the category oh li get other tin foil hat and yet i've been researching e ams for a future episode of the podcast and eameps are a a real thing that is not a a valuable statement everything's a real thing at some level even an idea but there does seem to be some evidence that electromagnetic fields of sufficient strength can alter the function of may be the helth of but the function of nerl tissue given the nirl tissue is electrically signaling itself a a'll just asses in a very straightboard ways uuse blue tot head phones are wire edphones yemply to and you are not a worried about any kind of a m fields across the skull no i mean i think the energy levels involved ar tiny that a ionizing radiation aside where were wa out of the realm of ironizing radiation that people would worry about a tumor causing em fields a even just the electromagnetic field itself aas is very well described in a blue touth a frequency range it the power levels are tiny in these devices and we are a wash in these signals wether use blue tothead pones ar not afor that matter your you are getting bumbarded with ironizing radiation in a very tiny amount no matter where you live on earth unless you live under huge amounts of water a it is unavoidable aand i think you just have to trust that your body has the deena reparamechanisms that it needs to deal with the constant bath of ionizing radiation that you are in as a result of being in the universe and exposed to cosmic rays a in terms of electromagnetic fields that it is just it is a the energy levels are way way out of the range where i would be worried about this what about heat a i do not use the erbuds any longer a for a couple of reaso once is as i take a lot of supplements and i reached into my left pocket once and swallowed a handl supplements that included of a bluzu i a erpod pro am i knew it i swallowed it the moment after i gulped it down by the way folks to please do not do this it it was not a good idea it was well i was not an idea it was a mistake and but i could see it on my phone as registering there never saw it again i'm assuming it is no longer my body but am a anyweay the is a bad joke there and to be sure a but itin any at i i tend to losemispicem that is the main reason but i did notice when i used them that there is some heat generated there a i also not convince that plugging your ears all day long as yot there is some ventilation through the through the sign of systems that include the years it sounds to me you are not concerned about the use of of am your buds but am what about heat near the brain and there is the the coclia the the auditory mechanisms that sit pretty close to the surface there am heat and nerl tissue are not friends sam i'd much rather get my brain cold than hot a in terms of keeping theselves healthy and alive am should we be thinking about the heat effects of some of these devices or other things as ranything we are overlooking well think about it this way te it i use cars as an an analogy a lot and mostly internal combustion engine cars cities analogies are start to be a foreign and useless for another generation of people that grow up in the air of electric cars but i using cars as i as a platform to talk about a fluid cooling systems your body has a massive distributed fluid cooling system somewhere to cars radiator a you are pumping blood all around your body all the time at a very strictly controlled temperature that blood carries i it is mostly water it carries a huge amount of the heat a a way or cold away from any arya of the body that is focuse heating our focused cooling you coald put an ice cube on your skin until it completely melts away and th blood is goin to bring heat back to that area you can put you can stand in the sun under much more scary a heating rays from the sun itself that contain you v radiation that is that is teafonally damaging your diant a if you are looking for things to be afraid of the sun is a good one youre tok into the guy that tells everybody get sunlight in their eyes every morning but i do not want people to get burned or or giv themselves skin cants ar it i encourage people to protect their skin accordingly and and different individuals require diffent levels of protection from the sun sure some people do very well in a lot of sunshine never get bazil sell or anything that some people and it is not jus people with very fair skin i'm a minimum of sun exposure can cause i'm some issues at here aen't one about sun exposure to the skin of course staring at the sun is a bat idea never recomment thinking about the sun just as a sheater for for a moment hot to compare with blue tooth headphones your body's very capable of carrying that heat away and and dissipating it be a sweat evaporation aor temperature equalization any heat that is locally generated in the year one there is a pretty large bony barrier there but tea thereis a tuno blood flow in the scalp and in the head in general and deafinly in the brain that is goon a regulate that temperature i think certainly there can be a tiny temperature variation but i doubt very seriously that it is enough to cause a significant problem to go back to brain augmentation i'm you have made very clear that one of the first schools for nurl link is to get quadruplegic's walking again and again what a marvellous goal that is i certainly hope you get succeed well again just just to be very clear the first step is we we are not reconnecting patiente own mustler system to their motor or allowing them am scuse me a agency over the movement of things in the world yes and and eventually thereby and you are exactly right ye eventually their body we would we would love to do that we have done a lot of work an a developing a system for stimulating the spinal cort itself and that gets to the question that you that you asked a few minutes ago of how do you reconnect a motor uartex to the rest of the body well if you can buy past the damaged area of the spinal cort and have an implant in the spinal cort itself connected to an implant in the braind and have them talking to each other you can take the perfectly intact motor signals out of the the motor quartex and send them to the spinal cort which most of the wiring should be intact in the spinal cort below the level of say that the injury caused by carac that an ar motor cycle ac hatant are gunshot wornder whatever and it should be possible to reconnect the brain to the body in that way not out f the realm possibility that in some small number of years that a nurlink will be able to reconnect somebody is own body to their brain and here i just wone to a flag the a hundred years or more of incredible work by basic scientists a the names that i learned about in my text books as a grades to georgiopolis and a that will not mean anything to anyone unless your norl scientist by georgiopolis a perform some of the first a sophisticate reqordings out of motor cuartex ju's simply asking the what sorts of electrical patterns are present in motor quartex as an animal or human moves a limb a ecrischenchenois being another a major pioneer in this area and many others then just really highlating the fact that basic research where a a exploration of neral tissue is carried out at the level of anatomy and physiology really sets down the pavement on the runway to do the sorts of big clinical a expeditions that you all at nerlink are doing yi i an't be said enough that we broadly speaking in industry sometimes are and sometimes stand on the shoulders of academic giants they were the real pioneers that they they were involved in the grind for years and an unglorious un glamorous way nostock option nosens and you kow the reward i for all the hard work is a paper at the end of the day that is read by dozens of people and they were selfless academic researchers that that made all this possible an we all humanity and nerling in owe them a massive debt of gratitude for all the hard work that they'ave done and continue to do i agree along lines of augmentation early on in some of the public discussions about ner length that i overheard between ilan and verys podcass host et cetera a there were some lofty ideas set out that i think are still very much a in play in people's minds things for instance electrical stimulation of the hippocampus that you appropriately have worn on your shirt to day ass they a beautiful a looks either a elooks a golgy or cohall rendition of the hippocampus em a translates to sea horse in its and area the brain that is involved in learning and memory and a among other things there was this idea thrown out that a chip or chips could be implants in the hippocampus that would a allow a greater than normal memory abilities perhaps that is one idea another idea that a heard about in these discussions was a for instance that you would have some chips in your brain and i would have some ships in my brain and you and i could just sit here look at the looking at each other or not nodding or shaking our heads and essentially her each other's thoughts r which sounds outrageous but of course why not what why should we constrain ourselves am to as our good friend edichang and a whose a nuruse urgeon w was already on thi potcess once before said speech is just the shaping of breath as it exits our lungs or incredible really when you think about it but we do not necessarily need speech to hear and understand each other's thoughts because the norl signals that produce that shaping of the lungs come from some intention i have some idea although mi not seem it about what i am going to say next is that possible that we could sit her and just hear each other's thoughts and a and also how would we restrict with the other person could hear well absolutely i mean think about the fact that we could do this right now if you pulled out your phone and started texting me on my foan i look down and started texting you we would be communicating without looking at each other or talking a shifting that function from a pone to an implanted device it requires no magic advance no leap forward it is technology we already know how to do i if we say put a device and the lazy control keyboard in a mouse which is our stated intention for our first human clenical trial or i n against a amdeliberately interrupting or i can text an entire team of people ulture simultaneously and then cintext me and in theory i could have a bunch of thoughts and five ten fifty people could hear i or am probably more to their preference a they could talk to me ye and and texting each other with our brains as may be an uninspiring rindition of this but it it is not a very difficult to imagine the implementation of the same device in a more verbally focustary of the brain that allows you to more naturally speak the thoughts that youare thinking and have me have them rendered into speech that i can hear i may be vea bone conducting implant silently hear or re not silently i could let say i was getting off the plan and i want to let somebody at home know that i had arrived i might be able to think in my mind think their first name which might cu up a a device that would then play my voice to them instave just got off the plan i'm ging grab my back and than i'll give you a call on their home electa that is all possible meaning we know the origin of the nerl signals reada gives rise to speech we know the different mechanical and neurrl apparati the coclia yeur drums et cetera u that trans du soundwaves into electrical signals i especialy all the pieces are known we are just really talking about refining it you ever fining it in reconfiguring it it is it is i mean it is not in easy problem but it is really an engineering problem rather than a neuro science problem for that for that outh case for un nonverbl communication you might say am that is a solved problem in a very crude disjointed way i cersome labs have solved part one of it some labs of salt partwo of it there are products out there that solved say the implanted bone conduction part of it for the for the deaf community there are there are no implementations i'm aware of theire pulling all that together into one a product that is a streamline package from end to and i think that is a few years down the road dwe have some hints of how easily or poorly people will adapt to these but's call them novel transformations a few years ago i was on insygram and i saw a post from a woman u her name is cassar jacobs and and she is deaf since birth and consign and to some extent can relips but she was am discussing a neocensory this is a a a device that translate sound in the environment into touch sensations on her hand or wrist a she is a a a admirer of birds in all things avian and am i reache out to her about this device is very curious because this is a very interesting use case of of nerral plasticity in the sensory doion to the fascination of mine and she said that a yes indeed it it afforded her novel experiences now when walking past say pigeons in the park if they were to make some whatever sound set don pigeons make that she would feel those sounds and that indeed it enriched her experience of those birds am in ways that obviously it would not otherwise i have not followed up with her recently to find out whether or not on going use of ineo censory has made for a better worse or and of m equivalent experience of avians in the world which ere hers as anear obsession a she delights in them am what are your thoughts about in a periferal deviceis that perfering perferal meaning outside of the the skull a no requirement for a a a surgery do you think that there is a more immediate or even a a a just generally potent am use case for perferal devices and do you think that those a are going to be used a more readily before e count of brain surgery requiring devices are used ye am certainly the barrier to entree is lower the barrier to adoption is low a if you are making a a tactile glove that is hard to say no to when you can slip it on and slip it off and not not have to get your skin cut at all am well would again there is no perfect measure of the efficacy of a device ave one device compared to another especially crossmodalities but one one way to you can start to compare it what apples to orange is is bit rate in a useful information in or out of the brain aas transformed in to digittl data and you can put a single number on that and you have to ask when you look at a device that is what is the bit rate in what is the bit rate out how much information are yo able to usefully convey into the system and get out of the system into the body i into the brain an a i think there is what we seem in the early stabs at this is that there is a very low threshold a for bit rate on some of y devices that are trying to avoid you now direct brain surgery cul could you a perhaps say what you just said but in a way that a be people who aren as familiarw thinking about bit rates might a might might be able o digest that there i' i'm referring to myself a i understand bit rate i understand the adding a new general of information is just that adding information are you saying it is important understand whether or not that new information provides for novel function or experience and to and an to what extent is the the newness of that valid and adaptive well i'm saying more a it is hard to measure utility in the space it is hard to put a single metric single number on how useful a technology is one crude way to try to get at that is is a bit rate think of it as as back in the days of dialop motums the bit rate of your motum was fifty six cay or ninety six it is you will hear the sound or a dia et an te bager that ely yethat is a bit rate tha thankfully kept steadily going up and up and up your youry a internat service provider gives you a number that is the maximum usable data that you can transmit back and forth from the internate that is a useful way to think about these assistive devices how much information are you able to get in into the brain and out of the brain usefully and right now that that number is a very small even compared to the old motums but you have to ask yourself when you are looking at a technology what is the ceiling what is the theoretical maximum and foraloties technologies that theoretical maximum is is very low disappointingly low even if it is perfectly executed and and perfectly a developed as a technology and i think the thing that attracts a lot of us to a technology narling is that the ceiling is incredibly high there is no obvious reason that you cannot interface with millions of narans as this technology is refined and and developed further a that is the kind of wy band in a high band with brain interface that you want to develop if you are talking about and a symantic prosthetic at and ay i assistant to your cognitivabilities the more syphy things that we think about in the coming decades that it is an important caviat when you are evaluating these technologies they really want it to be something that you can expand offin to the syphi let us take us a step further because as you are saying this i'm realizing that people have been doing exactly what nurl link is trying to do now for a very long time letme give you an example people who are blind you have no pattern vision have used canes for a very long time now the cane is not a a chip it is not a an electrode it is not neosensory none of that stuff what it is is essentially a a stick that has an interface with a surface it swept back and forth across the groun nt and translating what would otherwise be visual cuse into some otisensory cuse and we know that blind people are very good at understanding even when they are approaching say a curb edge because they are integrating that information from the tip of the cane m up through their some outisensory quartecs and their motor quartects with other things the changes in the the wind and the sound as a round corner and a crom imaging a a corner in san francisco down town whence s you get to the corner s a completely different set of auditory cues and very often we know and this because my laboratory worked on visual repayer for a long time and talk to a lot of blind people used different divices to navigate the world that they are not aware of the fact that theyre integrating these other cues but they none the less do them subconsciously and in doing get pretty good at navigating with a cane an now cane is not perfect but you can imagine the other form of of navigating as sublind person a which is to just attach yourself or attached to you another nervous system the best that we know being a dog a sited dog that can cue you again with a stopping at a curb's edge or even if their some individuals that might seem a will sketchy dogs are also very good at sensing different a arousal states in others threat danger i mean t they are exquisite at it right yeare what were really talking about irs taking a acane or aanother biological system he senchy a whole nervous system and saying this other nervous systems job is to get you to navigate more safely through the world in some sense what neurolic is trying to do is that but with robodics to insert them and chips which raises the the the question woe a say finally a question the question is this we hear about be m i brain machine interface which is really what nerling specializes in we also hear about a i ano or example where there is great promise in great fear we hear about machine learning as well to what extent can these brain machine interfaces learn the same way a sene i dog would learn but unlike a sene i dog continue to learn over time and get better and better and better because it is also listening to the nervous system that it is trying to support put simply what is the role for a i in machine learning in the type of work that you are doing that is the verat question i i think it goes both ways basically what you are doing is taking a very crude software intelligence i would say not exactly a full full blown a i but some well designed software that can adapt to changes in firing of the brain and your coupling it with another form of intelligence a human intelligenc and you are allowing the two to learn each other undoubtedly the human that has anerling device will get better at using at over time undoubtedly the software that the nerlink engineers have written we will adapt to the firing patterns that that the device is able to record and over time focus in on meaningful signals toward movement right if unneron is fire high firing rate when you intend to move the mouse cursear up and to the right it does not know that when it starts when you first put this in it is just a random series of signals as far as the chipnows but you start correlating it with what the person what the person wants to do as expressed in a series of games you you assume that that the person wants to move the mouse on the screen to the target that is shown because you tell them that is the goll and you start correlating the activity that you record when they are moving toward an up and write target on a screen with that firing pattern an similarly for up and left down and left down an right and you develop a model am semi intelligently in the soft ware for what the person is intending to do and let the person run wild with it for a while and they start to get better at using the model presented to them by the by the software as expressed by the mouse moving or not moving properly on the screen right it is imagine a scenario where you are asking somebody to play piano but that the sound that comes out of each key randomly shifts over time am very difficult problem but a human brain is good enough a with the aid of softword to solve that problem and and map well enough to a semi sable state that they are going to know how to use that mouse even when they say turn the vice oft for the night come back but the next day and some of the signals have shifted s you are describing this i 'm recalling a recent experience i got one of these am rowers for to a exercise am and i am well aware that there is a proper ro stroke and there is a a improper rostrach and am most everybody including me who is never been coached in rowing am gets on the ting and pushes with tyoir legs and pulls with tyoir arms and back and it is some mix of incorrect and may be a smidgin of correct type am execution there is a function within the rower that allows you s gessto me to play a game where you can actually am every rowstroke you generate a arrows o towarde dartboard and it knows whether not you are generating the appropriate forces of the given am segment to the row the initial pull when you are leang back et cetera and adjust the trajectory of the arrow that when you do a proper row stroke it gets closer to a bulls eye and it is very satisfying because you now have a visual feed back that is unrelated to this am the kinds of instructions that one would expect owe hinger hip a bit more or you musplay your knees a bit more reach more with your arms ar pull for rst with your back all the rowers are probably cringing as i say this as a realizing the what is exactly the point which is i do not know how to row but over time simply by paying attention to whether ot the arrow is hitting the bull's eye or not more or less frequently you can improve your ro stroke and get as i understand pretty close to optimal ro stroke a in the same way that if you had a coach there telling you hey do this and you that we we really talking about here is nurrowby ofeed back sire is that analogy similar to what your describing that is a great analogy i humans are really good at learning how to play games i in software somedy o games are an ossome platform for us to use as a training environment for people to get better at controlling these things in fact it is it is the default and the obvious way to do it as to have people and monkeys playvitio games do you play the duiames ye sire we be m games bet' see i play old ones i'm a little nestalject i i the old blizzard game starcraft and worcraft omai do not even know those i remember the first apple computers i i ma i i hold or you i forty three o gay fortit e have wore now as of a few days ago i havyou birthdays were a lo it offset there i can recall a mitisons ponch out your origin or intend no games to lon ar ing others ican hardy a bu the game that games youare describing i i do not recall that a minor standing is that the newer games sir ar far more sophisticated in some respects i i did recently find time to play cyropunk m which was really satisfying and may be appropriat s ta game where the characters are all fully a motered out with sibrnatic in plants not perfect but thg the root of the game as run around to shoot things i may be not different from dock hunt or whatever from our childhoods reason ask about vidio games is a there is been some controversy as to whether not they are making young brains better or r worse and i think some of the work from adam gazalis lab at you see asef and other laboratories have shown that actually provided that am children in particular anadults are also spending time in normal face to what is call them more traditional a face to face interactions that a viio games can actually make a nervous systems that is people a much more proficient at learning an motor execution sure a visual detection a an on anon yet there is some work a showing that surgeons are better if they play vo dio games las i try to squeeze samen as e a professional development activity vey well i 'm sure you aregetting cheers from the a from those that vidio games out there and am some of the parents weare tryin to get there gets to play th fewer vido games are are curinging but that' ke will let themsettle a they are familial disputes a among themselves thet's talk about pigs sure nurl link has been am quite generous i would say in announcing theire discoveries and their goals at nigh i wone o high this because i think it is quite unusual for a company to do this i'm probably an earn a few enemies by saying this am despite the fact that i ave always owned apple devices and from the south bay a mean of the apple desin team is notoriously criptic about what they 're going to do next or when the next phonor computer is going to come out is is is vaulted to am i a serious extent nurl link has been a pretty open about their gals m with the understanding that guals change and halfe to change a and one of the things that they have done which i think is marvellous is they have held am on line simposia where you and some other colleagues of mine from the nero since commen dan adams a tremendous respect for and elon an others a they are at nurl link have shared some of the progress that they have made in experimental animals i'm highlighting this because i think am if one takes a step back i mean just for most people to a know about and realize that there is expementation on animals inplantation of electrose and on is it self a pretty bold moved because that understandably evoke some strong emotions a in people and a in some people evokes extremely strong emotions sure a neuro link did one such simposiun where they showed implant devices in pigs right then they did another one you guis did another one wer a it was implant ofvices in monkeys right i assume at some point there will be one of these public simposy awere a the implant ofvices will be in a human what was the rational for using pigs a i'm told pigs are very nice creatures i'm told that they are quite smart right a and for all my years as a nero scientist and having worked admittedly on every species from a mice to cuttlefish to humans to hampsters to i i confess a verys cornoorsh specieys which i no longer do i work on humans now for various reasons i never in my life thought i would see a implant device in the cartecs of a pig sure why work on pigs ye well it mi let me say first a narlink is almost entirely composed of animal loving people a the people at narlink are obsessive animal lovers a there are signs up all around the office iu a spontaneously put up by people within the organization talking about how we want to save animals we want to protect animals if there was any possible way to help people the way we want to help people without using animals in our research we would do it a it is just not known how to do that right now and we are completely restricted to making advances to getting a device approval through the f die by first showing that it is incredibly safe in animals and as is the case for any medical advancement especially ma do one a high this that th the f t e and the other governing bodies am oversee these types of experiments and insure that theyre done with a minimum of discomfort to the animals of course but a i think thereis an inherent speciism right o in a in most humans not all some people truly see equivalents between a lizard and a human lizard life being equivlent human life most human beings i think in particular human beings who themselves ar of loved ones the re suffering from diseases that they a hope could be cured at someit a view themselves as species and feel that if you have to work on a biological system in order to solve the problem am working on a non human animals firse make sense rto most people sure but certainly thereis a category of people that feels very strongly in the opposite direction sure and i think we would probably be having a very different conversation around animal research if we were not ou know we is a species we as a culture were not just casually slaughtering millions of animals to eat them a every single day and that is a back ground against which that the relatively mniscual number of animals used in research it it becomes almost impossible to understand why some one would point to that ridiculously small number of animals i used in research when the vast vast majority of animals that humans use and and their lives are are done for food wor frefur or for fur or these other reasons that people have historically used animals we in in that context we do animal research because we have to there is no other way around it if tomorrow a laws were changed and the ft e said o k you can do some of this early experimentation in willing human participance that'ld be a very interesting option i think there be a lot of people that would step up and say yes a i'm willing to participate in early stage clinical research you already volunteered i am and i i would not be alone and that is a podential way that animals could may be be spared a being unwilling participance in this m on that note to whatever extent possible i think narlinc goes im really really far much much farther than any one ive ever heard of any organization i've ever heard of an anything of ever seen a to give the animals agency in every aspect of the research i we have just an incredible team of people looking out for the animals and trying to design the experiments such that their as purely opt in as humanly possible a no animal is ever compelled a to participate an exiperiments beyond the surgery itself im if say on a given day ar our star monkey pagor does not want a play vidio games for smoothy no one forces em to ever this is a very important point and i want a few people to really what mad is saying here am obviously the animals are being researched on a four naurol link they do not get to opt in to opped out of the experiment am but what he saying is that they play these games during which neural signals are measured from the brain because the have electrose in plantin their brain through a surgery that thankfully to the brain is painless right no pain receptors in the brain am and our playing for reward this is very different very different then the typical scenario in laboratories around the world where people experiment on mice monkeys some cases pigs or other species in which the typical arrangement is to water deprive the animals we never do that and then have the animals work for their daily ration of water am and some people arehearing this impavything wole that is barbaric and here i'm not trying to point a fingers that the people doing that kind of work i jus think it is important that people understand how the work is done in order to motivate an animal to play o vidio game depriving them of something that they yearn for is a very eficient way to do that we do not do that we they have free and full access to food this entire time they are not hungry they are not thirsty the only thing that would motivate them is if they want treat extra to their normal rations a but thereis there is never any deprivation the is never any adverse negative stimuli that pushes them to do anything mus say i'm impressed by that decision am because training animals to do tasks in laboratory settings is very hard and the reason many researchers have defaulted to water deprivation and at having animals work for a ration of water is because frankly it works it allows people to finish their ph to ear their postoch more quickly then having to a wait around am and trynd figure out why a there monkey is not working that day in fact having known a number of people who have done these kinds of experiments ii renember n them in my lab am my monkey is not working to day is a a common a and gripe among gradute soon supposei shou do this kind of work am end for people work on mice o case to this is am a very important imformation to get across am and there is no public relation statement a woven into this as just we are talking out the nature of the research but i think it isnimportant that people are aware of this yes one of the one of the under appreciated annovations out of narink is how far the animal careteam has ben able to to move in the dire ction of humane treatment of these gies wonderful what as an animal lover myself i can only say wonderful why pigs ye pigs are they are ctually fairly commonly used in medical device research am more you knowing the cardiac area their hearts are somewhat similar to human hearts how big are these pigs hi seen little pigs an i seem big pigs yether there is arrange there is a bunch of different varieties of pig there is bunch of different species that am you can optimize for different a characteristics there is many pigs there is a yorkshires there is a what lot of different kind of pigs that we use in different contexts n when we are trying to optimize a certain characteristic am ye a the pigs are we do not necessarily need them to be smart or task performers although occasionally we have trained them to walk on a tread mill a when we are studying how their limbs move affer some of our spinal cord research am but we are not recording interesting say cognative data out of their minds ther really just av a biological platform with a skull that is close enough in size and shafe to humans to be a valid platform to study the safety of the device unlike a monkey or a human a pig i do not think i can reach out and and hid it ry a button we are a lever exact hower they signaling that they umsaw or im sense to something yes again the the pigs are really just a safety platform to say the device is safe to implant it does not break down or cause any kind of toxic reaction the monkeys are are we are really doing our heavy lifting in terms of insuring that we are getting good signals out of the device that that what we expect to see in humans is validated on the functional level in in monkeys first but's talk about the skull ye years ago you and i were enjoying a com versation about thes very sorts of thingsthat were discussing to day and you said the skull is actually a pretty lousy a biological adaptation far better would be a titanium plait you spoken a true nurus surgeon a with the auready receiver implanted in his hand but in all seriousness ydrilling through the skull with a too millimeter whole certainly do not do this at home folks am please do not do thist but am it that yes a that is a small a entry sight but i think most people cringe when they hear about that or think about that and it obvously has to be done by a nurse surgeon with all the appropriate am a environmental conditions in place to women infection what did you mean when you said that the skull is a poor adaptation in a titanium plate would be better and in particular what dos that mean in reference to things dramatic brain injury i mean our human beings unnecessarily vulnerable at the level of dramatic brain injury because our skulls are just not am hard enough maybe on being too harsh about skull the skull is e very good at what it does given the tools that we are working with as biologic organisms that develop in our mother's uterus a the skull is usually the appropriate size it is one of the hardest things in your bodi a that said there are couple puzzling vonerabilities a some of the thinnest bone in the skull is in the temporal region this is nurse surgeons we all know that i am heading toward a feature that sometimes darkly is called god's little joke where the very thin bone of the the temporal part of the skull has one of the largest arteries that goes to the lining of the brain right attached to the inside events this this bone just to the side of your eye tends to fracture if youre struck there and the sharp edges of that fractured bone very often cut an artery called the middle manindial artery that leads to a big blood clot that crushes the brain thi hol a lot of people with a otherwise would be a relatively minor injury and up dying i is this large blood clot developing from high pressure arterial blood that crushes the brain i'm in why would you put the artery right on the inside of the very thin bone that is most likely to fracture it is an enduring mystery but this is probably the most obvious failure mode and in the design of a human skull otherwise in terms of general impact resistance i think the brain is a very hard thing to protect and that the architecture of human anatomy probably given all other possible architectures that canterize from i development it is not that bad really im one of the interesting features and terms of shock absorption the hopefully prevents a lot of tramatic brain injury is the fluid sheath around the brain thatthe brain you may know is im it is mostly fat it floats in salt water iu n our brains or brains are all floating in in salt water and with rapid acceleration deceleration that a sheath of salt water adds a marvelous protective a cushion against development of bruising of the brain say or bleeding in the brain man i think for any flaws in the design that do exist im you you can imagine things being a lot worse and there is probably a lot fewer teby eyes than would exist if a human designer was taken a first cract at it as you describe the the thinness of this temporal bone in the in the presence of a critical artery just beneath it im i'm hinking about most helmets am and here i also ant a cue up the fact that well whenever we hereabout am t b ey or c t brain injury people always think football hakey but most dramatic rain injuries or things car accidents or construction work i it is not football and hawkey that for some reason football an hawkey and baing get all the attention am what my colleaues that work on tramatic rain injury tell me that most of the tramatic rain injury they see somebody slips at a party and hits their head or am i is in a car accident or environment a miremental accidents of various kinds to my mind most helmets do not actually cover this region close to the eyes an is there is there also a failure of a helmet engineering that am it can unisan why you would want to have your perferal vision out the sides of a your eyes a perfree of your eyes but it seems to me if this is such critical real estate why why is not it being better protected 'm no expert in helmets but am i do not think we see a lot of epiderl he matomas in sports injuries i to get this kind of injury usually need a really focal blunt trama the baseball back to the head is a classic a mechanism of injury a that would lead to to a temporal bone fracture and epidraymatoma am with sports injuries you do not often see that especialy in football with iyou know ia sharp sharper a object coming in contact with the head at's usually nanother helmet wright is the the mechanism of injury i i i cannot think off the top my head of an instance of this exact injury type and sports you spent a lodtime poking around in brains of humans m and well i realize this is not yourairy of expert eace a you are somebody who i am aware you cures about his health and the health of your family and othing generally people's health when you look out on the landscape of things that people can do and should not do if their desire is to keep their brain healthy do any am any data or any particular practices come to mind i thing we have all heard the obvious one do not do not get ahead injury if you get ahead injury ma sure gets treated and do not get a second head injury but those are sort of da type am answers that i'm able to give some trase about the answers that i'm perhaps i'm not able to give ywell that the obvious ones at is when they do you talk about a lot a and i see a lot of the the smouldering wreckage of humanity in the operating room and in the emergency room for people that come in i i work my practices in san francisco wright next to the tenderline and a lot of people that and up coming in from the tenderline have been drinking just spectacular amounts of alcohol for a long time and their brains are a very often on the scans that look small walnuts inside their empty skull there is much atrophy that happens with ean alcohol soaked brain chronically that i would say that is far and away the most common source of brain damage that many of us just volunteer for and it is when you look at them morbidity can tha the human harm you naggregate that is done it is mystifying that that it is a not something that we are all paronoid about wer tim people think that i do not drink at all i'll occasionally have they drink i i could a take our ter leave it frankly fall the a'll call on the plan disappeared i would not notice but i you occasionally have a drink maybe one breater or something that but i am shocked at am the current state of affairs around alcoll consumption in advertising et cetera when i look at the dateo mainly out of the ucape brain bank which basely shows that for every drink that one has on a regular basis when you go from zero to one drink per week thereis more brainatrophy thinning of the gray matter quartes you go from one to two more thining co from two to three and there is a near linear relationship between the amount that people are drinking in the mount of brainatrophy and to me it is it is a sort of obvious from thet these large scale studies that am as you point out alcohol atrophies the brain it it kills narants and i do not have any bias against alcallar people that drink i know many of them but it does seem to me kind of shocking am that were talking about the resprar trall and red wine which is at infantestaly small amounts and i am clear resperr tralls good for us anyway ryther way am a matter of debate i should point out but am alcal certainly alcalon excessis bad for the brain sir am in terms of a o case we have head hits bad alcohol bad am youre working as you mention year the tenderloin am is ther any awareness that am emphetamine use can can descrupt rain structure or function that that is not an ariatt i spent a lot of time researching and i i incidentally take care of people that have used every substance known to man in quantities that are n a spectacular but i i have not specifically done research i in nat aream not superwell verset on the literature i ask him part becaus am maybe you kno a colliue or will come across the collague whose work on this is either us such a am incredible increase in the use of things aterall riddle and modaphinal armodaphinal which i think in small amounts in clinical clinically prescribe i'm situations can be very beneficial but let us be honest many people are using these on a chronic basis andi do not think we really know what it does to the rain aside from increasing addiction for those substances that is very clear well for better wors for generating a massive data sat right now well put a i to briefly go back to our earlier discussion about narrow plasticity you you made an interesting statement which is that we are not aware of any am single brain area that one can stimulate in order to invoke plasticity read the smaliability of nerl architecture a years ago a michemersinic and colleaguesthat you see asaf a did some experiments where they a stimulate neucleas pasalus and paired that stimulation with a a kilahurt's tone or a in some cases they could also stimulate a a different brain area the ventraltigmental area a which causes release of dopeing ampare it with a tone and and n it seemd every one of these cases they observed massive plasticity a now i look at those data and i compare them to the cclassic data a i think it was coral ashly that did these experiments with their take animals and they scoop out a little bit of quartex put the animal back into a learning environment and the and will do pretty well if not perfectly o they scabout a different region of quartex in a different animal and by the end of may be three four years of these kinds of leision experiments they a referred to the equapotential of the quartex meaning they concluded that it did not matter which piece of the arte you took out that there was no one critical area on the one end you have got these experiments that say and i do not really need a lot of the brain and indeed everone soewhile a new story will come out where am built patient a person will goin for brainscan for some other reason or in experiment and the person seems perfectly normal and the missing half their quartex and then on the other hand of these experiments the stimulation of basalus or vitie ere yet massive plastisy from stimulation of one area i was i've never been able to reconcile these kin s of discrepin findings and i'd really just your opinion on this that ou what is it about the brain as an organ that lets it be both critical at the level of individual nurons in circuit critical and yet at the same time on it is able to a circumventese what would otherwise seem massive lesions and holes you mean itself yei mean a lot of a lot of it to reconcile as experiments you at first account for the fact there probably in different species right i you take out a particular portion of a pig or a rabbit brain a small amount you might not see a difference but a small portion of a human brain say the part most interested in coordinating speech or finger movement and you can see profound losses or or visual cortecs right i take out a small portion of v one and you will you will have a visual deficit a and species matters age matters if you take out half of the brain in a very young baby that maby has a reasonable chance of developing high a high degree of function a by having the remaining half subsume some of the functions lost on the other side a because they are very very young and their brain is still developing its a it is to some degree of blank slat with extremely high plasticity over many years that can overcome a lot of deficits a taking in adult animals brain that is not very well differentiated functionally to begin with you might not see those deficits apparently there is a lot of redundancy as well right there is a lot of a cerabellar and spinal circuits in other animals that generates theretype behavior patterns and might not need the brain at all to to perform say a walking movement or or some other sequence is of motor activities a ita lot of that depends on the e perimental set up i would say in general adull humans are very vulnerable to losing small parts of their brains and losing discreet functions i going to take the liberty of asking a question that merges across nurl linkan tessla i could imagine that course whether not their on autopilot mode or being driven by the human directly am and society generally would benefit from knowing whether or not a human is very alert or sleepy sure i do not know na tessla am perhaps this tychology already exists but is there any idea that a simple censor maybe even of just eyelid position or pupil size or head position am could be introduced to a car the tessla or another car for that matter ye and resolve a a common problem which is that when people are lessaler not just when people fall asleep but the simple drop in alertness that occurs when people are sleepy is a my read of the data is responsible for approximaly a third third it is a credible of a accidents between vehicles and then of course some percenage of those are can be legal accidents som terms of a preserving life this might seem a minor case possesshi a major case cenarea i i have no unospecial inside inder how teslas off to our works i know the have brilliant engineers am when i i have a tessla when i drive it it seems to know when i'm looking at the road verses not and it yells at me if i'm not looking at the roads how does it do that ind what voice does it use there is a small camera a by the revemer and i think it is a simple eye track my my guess here is that it is a simple eye tracking program am and it may already be the case that it is implemented that it is detecting whether your eyes are o n or not obviously it is not a strict it is not stringen because some glasses a and i've i've seen forms on the intrnit were people tape over that small camera they they can vasgoodness ayou know i think they are devinly making efforts to try to try to save lives here incredible i saying gredible just because i think i'm fortune enough to live in a lifetime where there there were no electric cars when in was growing upan now things are moving o fast a no one intended what is your wish for brain machine inter face and brain augmentation thet let us let us assume that the the clinical stuff can be worked out or maybe you have a a a ampat clinical condition that you just are am just yearning to see resolved the other that would be falling to but in addition to that way that you really just expand out let us ay we can am extend your life two hundred years or am workhing about the kind of world that your children are going to live in and their grandchildren will live in what do you think is really possible with brain augmentation and brain machine in her face and here please feel no byus whatsoever to answer in a way that reveals to us your am your incredible empathy and consideration of clinical conditions cause that is how you spend your days is fixing patience a and helping their lives be better if it lands in that coatigory great but am forsake of a fun and forsake of delight and forsake of a really getting us the audience to to understand what is really possible here a please feel no shackles ye a well i ei love the idea down the road and we are talking a ten year may be twenty year time frane a a human's just getting control over some of the horrible ways at their brains go wrong right i think everybody at this point has yeither known some one or second order known some ont a friend of a friend who has been touched by a diction and or depression and suicide obesity these functions of the brain or or mouth functions of the brain or what drives me these are the things that i want to tackle in my career eyou know in terms of my kids lifetime i'm thinking full human expansion a human cognition into a e i full aimmersion in the internet of your cognit of abilities a having no limitation for what you think as bottle necked by needing to read the wickapediarticle first ah to have the data to inform your thoughts a having communication with any one that you want to unrestricted by this flapping air past meat on your face ait is o a means of communication that is ridiculously prone to being misunderstood it is also a tiny narrow bottle neck of communication were trying to send messages back and forth through a tiny straw and there is no reason that needs to necessarily be true it is the way things have always been but it is not the way things are going to be in the future and i think there is a million very sifi possibilities in terms of banding human minds together to be even more potent as a as a multi unit a organism as an optin a multi braine these hof things that are far down the road i cannot even directly see how they would be aimplemented but the technolegy were working on is a little crack in the door that allows some of thi stuff to even be thought about in a realistic way to that to that point i encourage any one who is excited about things that specially mechanical engineers soft ore engineers rubotics engineers come to the ner link webside and look at the jobs we have got we need the brightest people on the planet working on these the hardest problems i in the world i in my opinion and i if you want to work on the stuff come help us i h'ave several responses hat's what you just said im first off i'll get tat the the least important one out of the way which is that years ago i applied for a job at nerl link im the nerl link webside at that time was incredibly sparse i it was just said nerl lincoln is that if youare interested give us your emails i put my email there i got no response im the a they made a wise choice in an unterrible ar rigtin now a fast forward several years i am i'm very grateful and i think very lucky im that you who passed through fortunately for me through my lab at one point and we had some a fun expeditions together in the wild an nerl explorations co talk about some other time as well as i'm learning from you as you i pass through your time at stamford im but have arrived there at nerl lincolnd and i'll say that thei're very lucky to have you and im folks dan adams who have known foru very long time a phenomenal ner surgeons yourself nor scientists and im vision scientists dan and others it is really an incredible mission i really want to start off by saying am thank you to you and all your colleagues there i know that nerl link is really tip of the spear in being public facing with the kinds of things they are doing and and being forth coming about how that work is done in animals and exactly what they are doing am and that is a very brave stance to take yespecially given the nature of the work but well that is classic ye lon right he he does not keep secrets in public too commonly he tells you what he is going to do and then he does it and people are always amazed by that he releases the testlamaster plan and tells you exactly what the company intends to do for the next several years and people assume that there is some subterfusae that he is misdirecting but it is a it is right out there in the open and i think narling follows in that path of we want people to know what we are doing we want the brightest people in the world to come help us we we want to be able to help patience we want the most motiv aded patience with quadroplegia a visit our patient registry and and sign up to be considered for clenical trials that that will happen the future we will put a link to that by the way am maybe just at the direct call a could happen now you a this is for people who are quadroplegic or who know people who are quadroplegic who are interestin being part of this clinical trial it is a patient registry wright now that we are just collecting information to see who might be eligible for clinical trials that will happen in the future a we are still working with the f t e to hammer out the details and and get their final permissien a to proceed with the trial rigt ples see the note a in the shownote at the linxcuse me in in the shownote captions for that i i want to think as for your stance a inpublic facing and also doing the incredibly hard work i also think the robodics aspect which you have clarified for me a to day is extremely forward thinking and a absolutely critical a lot of critical engineering that no doubt will am wake out into other domains of narrow surgery and medical technology not just in serving nar linx mission directly and i really want to think you a first of all for coming here to day and a taking time out of our important schadul of seen patience and doing brain surgery literally happen i time away from your family and time away from your mission at nerllink briefly to a to share with people what you guise are doing as i mention befor there there is a lot of mistake arounded and eve am despite e that that a nerlink has gone out of ther way to tryind a rase some of that mistake a this to me is the clearest picture ever a to my knowledge that am has been given about what is going on there and and the the stated and the real mission and what is going on am at the level of of of nuts in boltson and gotsin brains and this kind of thing and i realy just want to thank you also for for being you which is a perhaps sounds a a a kond of an odd imthing to hear but i think as made apparent by the device implanted in your hand you do not just am do this for a job you live in breathe and embody truly embody this stuff around am the nervous system and tryn to figure out hw to fix it how to make it better and you live in breathen and i know your deep love for it i want to thank you for am not just the a brains that you put into it and the energy you put into it but also for the the heart that you put into it thinks for that andra apprechent tha i we we just want help people we want to make things better well i know that to be true knowing you and am thank you again for coming here to day and i look for to another round of discussion in am whenever the time happens to be when these incredible technologies have a spelled out to the next a major malston thank you thank you for joining me for to day's discussion with doctor matthew mc dugll all about the human brain and how it functions how it breaks down and the incredible efforts that are being carried out at nerlink in order to overcome diseases of brain and nervous system function and to augment how the human

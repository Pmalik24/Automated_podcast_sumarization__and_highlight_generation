welcome to the huberman ladpodca t cust science e science pace toe or li elow everybody and welcome i want a thank all of you premium huberan lab podcast subscribers for joining this is an exciting one even though the backdrop here looks very much likethe studio back in united states i am doing this a m a live from sidney australia where i and hubermen lab podcastim have been for well over a week we were in melbon and we just did two live shows here in sidney and were headed off to brisben to morrow and it is been absolutely delightful that much fun talking science learning from people hat's a wonderful place i want to get right into your questions and do my best answer as many of them as possible as thoroughly clearly and suscinctly as possible over the next hour ibeen a dive into those in just a moment just one last important thing before i do that which is that i want to thank every one for being a premium subscriber and let that we based on your contributions to the premium channel have already as supported four laboratories at stamford columbia university sall constitute and elsewhere for important projects on humans that are already leading to important theraputic break through that we will soon share with you on the huberan lampodcast but that this year twenty twenty four we were fortune enough to secure no fewer than three dollar for dollar match doners who have generously agreed to match our contributions from the premium channel to additional projects in those are going to head out to a number of different universities and researchers working again on human studies of no animal studies human studies on important projects everything from novel treatments for mental health issues headache and my grain i'm some interesting stuff on imenology and cancer mind sets and immune system function and much much more also nutricion physiology exercise physiology et cetera your contributions to the premium channel really do make a difference i can say this i' because i'm familiar with the challenges of raising funding for doing truly break through work and getting things quickly out to the general public thank you thank you thank you and now without further adou let us get to your questions the first question was is how are you managing to achieve your key health pillars while in australia and anthe other place you have enjoyed doing all while working hard well thanks for the question i'll answer this question in the context of what i think we all can and should and im really will do im because if you are premium channel subscriber i'm certainly you are taking your ealth seriously a first off am i think there is a bit of a misconception about the protocals on the hubrmen ladpodcast being that a we are all including myself super superregimented about them to the point where we do not enjoy other things in life and that is simply not true i view the protocols of the hubermenlad podcast as science base actionable locostirocostminimal cost in almost all situations there few exceptions to that but the really design to mash with the rest of life and in hints mental health and physical health which of course means remaining social staying on typical sleep scheduals et cetera the big ones for me when arriving here were of course to get morning sunlight 'm as often as possible a saw beautiful sunrise this morning over sidney but even on the overcastas we have had a few rany overcastas to really make it a point to get outside and to get that morning sunlight also a our crue did travel in with a a red light not a red light panel although you have a couple red light panels an those laportable ones i'm that i use from time to time the red lights om referring to om in reference to answering this question are the red lights wich are just red light bulb that we i i should trauble with a red bulbunit it is sus just a small screwn unit you plug it in here a within dapter of course and then in the evening we have switched off the lights and the place where we are staying in it just brings the over all levels of quartes all down lo very quickly and it makes at very easy to get to sleep each night it makes a big big difference and this is a very low cost tole you could sentry purchase any red light even red party lights and put those up and then switch off the regular overhead lights it makes a big difference that is probly even cos saving ah we have also stayed fairly regimented about exercise o this morning took a great jog down to the ocean jumped in the ocean if you do not have access to an ocean on vacation just getting outside and getting some movement early in the day can help shift your rhythm really the quadfecta of shifting your cicadian rhythm in a new place or becoming an early riser if you want to do that is morning sunlight movement social engagement and in my case kaffine although some people would opt for eating breakfast i just happen to prefer to eat al a bit later in the day when you combine those things you are really ample fying that morning cquarters all increase hat i've talked about on the pod cast morning katacolemine release o dopamen up an efforn in nor up an iferen and those act in synergy to create mor early day and daytime mudfocus an alertness and enhance the transition to night time sleep but of course tha dimming of the lights and maybeven red light in the evening really really can help and those are the biggies and then of course if you want to shift your cicadian rhythm really quickly to be on a local schedul it helps to hop on the local meal scedul but for me that always means skipping breakfast i'm not a big breakfast eater i lunch an afternoon snack sometimes and dinner when you do all of those things makes a very easy to stay with the halth pillars and of course stress control is important we are doon lives ere's a lot of work to do theres a daily for me non sleep deep rest or yoganedra proto call by the way you may be familiar with non sleep e breast in yogenedra terrific zero cost practise for reducing stress replacing wer replenishing dopeming and mental and physical vigor i've talked about this and the studies that support this on the podcast there is a a huberman an esty ar scrippet on you too that is agains zero cost but while down here we recorded a ten minute twenty minute and thirty minute and st ar script with a view of a beautiful sidney sunrise those should be posted to our huberman lab clipse channel in the not too disterent future probling the next couple weeks and then you can have different duration and sti ar scrips that you can use again complete these ero cost any time you i wee recorded also some additional meditations and a were considering putting out a a spotify album if you will of an sty ar in meditations that are science base of different durations if you that idea maybe just i give a shout into the internte and hofly will hear it or put a comment on in the latest episode of the uberman lab podcast on you tube and if that sounds a good idea to you we will do more of that these are agan zero cost zero to access tools for enhancing menta halfan physical halth combining all of those is really what we have done u next question was is i have followed your sleep advice and i have seen a huge improvement great happy to hear that wonderful but i still wake up at night and only yet five or six hours is that enough can you please give more advice if possible well forso all thanks for turning into the the sleep advice the question of whether not five or six hours is enough really depends on person context and by contexts i mean it can even change across the course of the year by life circumstances the criteria for insomne our very clear insomnia is excessive daytime sleepiness due to lack of sleep at night excessive daytimes y sleeping ess due to lack of sleep at night if you are not falling asleep during the day and you feel reasonably good throughout the day may be only need a brief ten minute to thirty minute nap in the after an some people nap some people do not want to no does not matter but if you feel pretty good throughout the day and you have enough mental and physical energy and focus to complete the activities yeu need to complete then i would not worry much about five to six hours and i would not obsess over thes and of scary things that we hear o for not getting seventy eight hours that we get to mensho et cetera becase that is not necesarily the case everyone has different sleep needs the other thing and this is perhaps the most important hing for everybody listening to this really to think about is cu cu arty which is qualit quantity timing excuse me quality quantity regularity and timing cu cu art cucu art ah which is an acrnym going by the great matwalker author of the bookwuy we sleep yes on terifict potcast in his own right is a series on the govern lawpot cast coming out soon cucu arty is what you really n to think about when you think about your sleep you want to thing about the quantity how much are yu getting you rema who askd this question are getting five to six hours to night o ke what about the quality of that sleep is it consistently five to six hours with no break saries there break in the middle one trip to the rest arm the ill the night is considered normal and healthy for most people you are making multiple trips to the rest aurmen the mill the night you are waking up multil times throughout the night on a regular basis that something to try and overcome the quality pieces important also whether not you remember your dreams or you do not you want to make sure that you are getting ample amounts of slow wave sleep which dominates the first half of your sleep night and rapid eye movement sleep which dominates the second half yor sleep night because they have different rolls in recovery of brain and body namely slow wave ach deep sleep is responsible for growthomon release rapid eye movement sleep responsible for nof the unpacking or the uncoupling of a motions to prior day and previous day experiences and in that way acts as a kind of a a scrubbing out or atherapy for your emotional state are yo feeling emotionally rested when you wake up as a good indication of wether not you are getting enough rapin eve movement sleep some people sleep trackers using their eight sleep or their whoop or ther or ring or something that i'm a fan of sleep trackers but i think that relying too heavily on slee scores can be risky there are data from allycrums lab at stamford showing that if people receive a poor sleep score even though they sleep well their performance will drop if people get a good sleep squore even though am their their sleep was lousy their performances maintained or even inhand you do not want it take any one sleep score and over interpretit you an't a look at the average and compare that to your subjective experience of sleep maybe i would say go about half way through your day if you can bear to do it before looking at your sleep score and see how you feel then look at your sleep score as a post to the other way around that maght be a good way to a just for that unbelief effact i just mention but if you are getting enough quantity let say you get five to six hours than quality our sleeping through that bout maybe with one a epoch of waking up and then the regularity of your sleep is that you are going to sleep more or less at the same time each night pluser minus an hour on let say five to six days per week because sometimes we to stay up on we can night and have some fun or something that and then the timing where that sleep is falling in your twenty four hour schadul is really key and hear's what we are learning as a field that for many people who are early to bed early to rise types if they go to bed around nine p m nine thirty and they only get six hours of sleep they feel great whereas if they get the equivalent amount of sleep but go to bed at eleven p m or midnight they feel lousy similarly if your night oul you are somebody that really prefers to go to bed around one or two a m and wake up around let' say ten a m if you take that equivalent amount sleep and you go to bed earlier you are going to feel not good getting the timing of your sleep in the twenty four hour cycle correct and fairly consistent that is the are part of tucuku arti a correct is going to be beneficial i would not worry much about five to six hours only here is what i would do rema i would take that five to six hours and before getting out of bed each morning i would do a ten to thirty minute and stiar non sleep deep reast protocall which will allow you to feel deeply rested and frankly to recover whatever bits of sleep that you perhaps miss during the night i've found that to be a tremendously beneficial practice waking up if i do not feel thoroughly rested doing at ten to thirty minute and star then getting out of bed and continuing the dand if you do not have time to do that do that ten minute may be twenty menute at s yar later in the day at any point and i think you will see terrific results not just because you are recovering some sleep that you lost perhaps during the night maybe you just need five to six hours but also because you will get better at falling and staying deeply asleep through the practice of anstiar in the morning or at some point throughout the day im i would not recommend anything else elaborate unless your feeling really exhausted during the day in which case than i would move to some of the more advance sleep tools i've had vertigo i should denounce this is a question i'm not just telling about my vertigo i've had vrtigo on and off and wonder what causes it is it hormons a drinals autolists moving around ah this person knows about the coclia hidration virous exposure zenana i think it is how you pronounce your name forgive me if that is notpronunciation zanana vertigo is very interesting am unfortunately it is uncomfortable but we can learn a thing or two right now that should beto help you zenana and others even if they have not had vertigo vertigo this perception of falling or dizziness needs to be distinguished from light headedness if you'r ever feeling dizzy it is worth stopping and sitting or if you cannot sit standing an closing your eyes and asking yourself a question do i feel i'm ready to fall straight down or do i feel i'm going to spin and fall down because in answering that question you can determine whether not you are light headed that would be the straight falling down or you have vertigo which is you'r dizzy which is that you are going to spin ind fall thot ni do this in the sate place please you can do this while bracing yourself against a wall or that is what i said ideally seated sou do not actually fall but in most cases if your feeling that spin if you are feeling truly dizzy your feeling vertigo in move my head are only on purpose then chances are you have got some issue in either your visual system or your inner ear o ciso since this is being recorded on vidio i can display when i'm about to say your visual system and your inner ear system for balance have some really important features oone to make this a very quick tutorial your head as you move through space is experiencing visual images going by all the time your retna's your eyes are essentially exposed to a lot of what is called visual slip imagine your walking in your tring to take a a picture on your eyephone or a have an androyd phone on your handroyd phone and your moving it is can be blurry right well there is a stablization process in your body and brain it is a magnificent one that frank is built in into all jawed animals whereby your head because it can move forward think noding right this is pitch for you pilots right yaw moving from side to side this would be the no this would be the no no pitch yaw and roll which would be the puppy look right pitch yaw and roll pitch yaw rail those are the three major angles of visual slip and in an absolutely magnificent set of things your inner ear has three hoolahoop shaped structures one that is arranged vertically up on its end one that is at an angle of about forty five degrees to that and another that sits aholahoop flat on the ground and inside of each of those little hoolahoop tubes thei're little stones called autilist can you heard that word earlier that roll around on the bottom just marbles at the bottom of ahoolahoop such that when you pitch nod the marbles in the verticalhoolahoop slide back and forth when you say no the marbles in that hoolahoop lying essentially parallel to the floor move around and then the one at forty five degrees when you roll your head from side to side those move and each of those sensnral signals that converge on the nurrl signals coming from the eye and get this when you move through space there is a precise offset of whatever visual slip you happen to be experiencing by walking thimages e movingyour looking up you areloking a buildings you arelooking around you are talking a somebody they are moving their head and your eye is making little tiny movements little microsicads on the midle second time scale that act is a perfect image stabilizer what this means this is by the way called the vestibula ocular reflex te stibular system ocular reflex and it is meated through a structure calle the cerebellum in the back of the brain this is why when you are on a boat when the horizon is tipping back and forth aftr be careful this because i have such prominent sea sickness spaced on a prior experienced that of rything about this too much i might get nauxious when that horizon is moving around youre system becomes uncalibrated because you cannot really keep the system jolting about in a regular way to be really careful yourm getting dizzy nosistid dizzy not light headed u and you will end up disrup ting that slip processing you essentially over compensate which is why whenever you feel sick on a boat they say look at the horizon fixate to something at a distance oh ke if you have vertogo almost certainly there is something going on in you are inner ear yes it can be caused by virisis yes it can be caused by hormones these things tend to be transient but the most important thing is going to be to anchor the visual part of the vestibulaocular reflex what you are going to want to do is you'r ging to want a fixate on a point may be three or four feet away and then you are going to actually want to move closer to that point or if you gont ave axess to youwould want a look at your hand yen your finger out in front of you and then slowly move it in toward your nose at some point you will feel you aregoin to go crosside and you can stop at that point then move out again then in again what are you doing when you are doing this we ou're doing is you are over riding the error signals the incorrect error signals that exist in your kind of default setting at that when you have ver togo and you are forcing the visual component to dominate and then your inner your mechanisms will adjust to that this is a very powerful tool if you ever feel nautious or see sick ats a very powerful to if you ave in mes in the back of an uber and in th ubers too small you get out nofre walking to a building wherethere no windows oare i do not relieve feel good get outside and look at a fixation point some distance away this actually happened the other day we went to the gim we went inside this gim we have been in a in a van and then wen inside and were not feeling well we decide to get out and just take a walk and fixate to the longest distance possible the fresh air probably helped as well but when doing that you are anchoring the visual part of the vestibulaocular reflex now that is far and away better than trying to avoid moving your head to not get those little stones moving around in the semicircular can canals lots to say about this oma could go on and on butfuly you learn somebiology and you learn to how to not be nautious if ever you feel dizzy or nautious based on movement motion sick and we can talk about why you get motion sick but its through the vaguest nerve et cetera et cetera but this is a very useful tool and if your ever just not feeling well unless you have a fever r something that i recommend getting outside and looking at the furthest vexation point with your vision that you possibly can and then walking toward it as far as you can safely if not by ushi jis doing a few of these exercises of looking at your finger up close that is going to be very good for anchoring the vestibular ocular reflex and not every time but many times people port feeling better especially if you have moved from one closed environment to another closed environment to another closed environment and on ok next question is what can be done to improve brain function for people thay've been negatively impacted by things such as poor sleep poor di and t bi early in life james yet this is a great question i get this a lot i think that it reminds me that a lot of the conversation that we have on the pod cast is about the good things that happen when you do things right and the bad things tho happen when you do things wrong and while i think that is an important conversation what i've frankly failed to do u enough and thet's wm grateful for this question becaue it gives the opportunity to talk more about the fact that your your system is very robost there is narro plasticity and also as my graduaadviser used to say time machines broken which is not to say you are out o luck but i would not spend any extra energy thinking about how many se not seedskus how many have to be careful the seatoil debate is still a debate it is unclear how many a transfats a you are exposed to in childhood we know transfats are bad everyone agrees they are bad governments agee they'r bad this perhaps oneof the few things everybody agrees on in the nutricion space transfats are bad when i was growing up transfats were abundant in foods u the're probably fewer of certain things that we have more of now that are bad but yo now we ata lod transts we had margera in our fridge am there are other things that wele probably warn't good for us that we consumed and never one while i'll think ash if i had only been eating grass fed meats and fruits and vegetables and am and healthy grains as i do now back then imagine how much healthier i be but i really do not spend too much time on it and i do not think you should either i think the most important thing to remember is that biological systems unless there really damage you talk about it a a major injury a and even then there very robost you can overcome years decades of poor use are misuse of those systems that said if you have the opportunity to take care of them now i highly suggest you do for instance if you have not slept well for years now's the time to get it right i would not worry about the past truly you can always rescue some of your health and healtspen in life spind a poor diet same thing just it is a just do it kind of thing just hop on hop on the train of getting things right eighty to ninety per cent of the time t b i tramatic brain injury well the episode of the hubreumen lalpokes its outright now with doctor marked es pazito he is an emty and arologist a riginally trained at a universal pennsylvania now at universily calfornia berkly we talk about t b ther lo different forms of t b i am different origins am everything from bomblass to car acidento construction work to justyou slipped on the stairs at a party i know ne that slipped on a some wet floor and party and you o has a brain injury what what do we know well get back to the basics sleep is a going to be important but there are some things transcranial magnetic stimulation certainly things that reduce brain inflammation glemphatic outflow glemphatic outflow is this washing of the brain at night the removes debri very very important am in the weeks and months after dramatic brain injury to get adequate sleep for that reason but then there are ings that also seem to perhaps improve outcomes from tramatic branantries such as hyperbare chambers o hyporoxygenation treatments if you have access to those even things elevating the feat slightly when you sleep by about five to fifteen degrees is known to increase clemphatic flow during sleep which can we believe by way of increase clearance of a bunch of basically debri react if oxygen speacies within the cells but also debris outside the cells in the extracellar or space o between noranzeis an just empty space there is all this im heavily loscillated stuff which basily just means this kind of spongy carbohydrate stuff that fills in the spaces the clearance of some of the a metabolites and some of the debris that is accumulate there by just sleeping with feet slightly elevated deffly not falling asleep in a chair upright that is the worst thing for glemphatic flow things that some people go and a bonkers on all things anti inflammation they stare taking tons of kurcumen and they cannot get upsessed with inflammation as as the enemy i would not do that in fact there'e some negative effects of things kircumen am turmeric if you take in hydosis limiting the amount of the hydratostosteron production which s not good you do not want that a male or female you do not want to take too much tumeric or curcumen on their real issues with that i'm to say nothing of the the studies have showen lead contamination in a lot of tumericso you want of check the sorcing very carefully if you do consume any tumeric a little bit is probably fine cooking with it is fine but where here where tie mut supplementation and and youll just really not trying to turn inflammation into this terrible thing to the point where you arestarting to do other things that are potentially damaging there is some really interesting evidence that five grams may be ten grams depending on your body weight of creating monohydrate per day can enhance creating phosphte metabolism in the forbrain and inhants brain function under conditions of high altitude or t be e i take five to ten grams of creating just creating monohydrate powder frankly any creating monohydrate powder should be sufficient there are other forms of creating they are not any better cretin monohydrate is the least expensive fortunately am that makes in water ou take it with her without food some people ask o this creting make your hair fall out no it does not make your hair fall out but some people to experience a increase in d h t with with creatn monohydrade an there can be a d h t hair lost links if you think you are losing a hair from taking creatine then stop and see to the control experiment it should grow back but five to ten grams of creating mono hydrate something to explore hyperoberc chamber something to explore excellent sleep definitely do that and i just would not obsess over past ills are wrongs to the extent that am it impactsourability to try and correct those in the present i wout see that about most everything but then again i understand that is humans because we can remember the past the present and the future that sometimes a and it is difficult to let go of the mistakes of pass that we made but that is just simply o being human and i do not have a solution to that are we any closer definding the cause of o c d well i think we know what causes os d i think om it is pretty clear that o sc d is some form of miss wiring in the basil ganglia the structures of the brain that are involved in go action and no go with holding action type o behaviors a and some a malwiring of those structures to the dopamin reward system because hereis what is interesting about o s d o c d involves obsessions obviously that is h o in o s d compulsions the actions that te c in o s d but in a kind of weird twist of the neurology oc d is a situation where the compulsion does not remove the obsession rather it exascerbates it ok the compulsion does not remove the obsession it exascerbates it unlike an ith that you scratch with o s d the scratching of the ih makes at worse which is actually what we experience when we have a mosquito bite which bythe have absolute loathe mosquito bites tonomy least favorite things in life a i've about thirty six hundred an counting pepeeves that sdepoling high on the list of those the obsessive compulsive disorder is one that really needs to be treated frankly neurologically it is one for which there are behavioral interventions but it is clear that adjusting the pharmacology of the neurl circuits involved in osd really cannot help there again there are behavioral treatments but for severe cases of o c d it is just very very clear that interventions which include essessorises which have been demonized a lot of people say oh sire selecto seratona reup taken hibiters are terrible baboblad the ceretonan hypothesis of depression is in true well listen the reality is this that all treatments for depression that are effective which include escessorize in some cases coggnon behavioral treatments all of these sorts of things which have shown efficacy are all about what they are now about saratonan they are about neuro plasticity that is why some anta depressin center on dopening an norpanefferand other center on seratonan they are about neurol plasticity theyre about changing neural networks they are not about neuro chemical perse but the neuromodulators such as saratonan allow an access point they are a wedge into the neuro plasticity process now with o c d in order to overcome these these malwirings it is very important to get plasticity how do you get plasticity well you in my belief you work with an excellent psychiatrists who can prescribe the appropriate dos of drog to release the appropriate amount of neurmodulator then and this is really key you have opened up the window for plasticity but then it is really imported that the proper behaviors are engaged in and when i did an episodo nosedii talked about what some of these are for instance the person is exposed to the stimulus that causes the obsession or maybe the obsession arises spontaneously they feel the i mpulse to complete the compulsion the behavior and they resist with the support of a therapist but they are doing this in the context of having elevated levels of ceretonan or some other naurmodulator that then allows fewer trials of resistance fewer times of needing to withhold the the the behavior that this person badly wants to perform because it is coming from within as this compulsion literally then they are able to achieve plasticity more quickly perhaps also transcurnua my nex stimulation a conjunction of the correct behavior the withholding behavior maybe a replacement behavior that is often use use a replacemyn behavior with the appropriate neuro chemical mileu is the solution to o s d ocan next question is if i'm just going to new york city from san francisco how do i control shifting my circatiang rhythm by only three hours if you are going in new york city from san francisco the best way frankly would be to get up an hour earlier two days before you head off to new york and then another day you might trenchif by two hours before you go and then head to new york can do the last shift on the last day a most people will not do that is just on takes ala bit of work but on they just do not have the the time ability or your discipline to do that but it is perhaps the best way i would say the best thing to do is to kno your temperature minimument i'll try and keep this o pretty simple if you typically wake up at eight a m let us say just by way of example that means that you are minimumbody temperatures at six a m which means that if you want to get up earlier in the days where you travel to new york well in the couple of days before you leave any time between six a m and ten a m get some bright light in your eyes even if you go back to sleep for instance get up at six a m sevenalarm clock i know you nnly to get up at at a m get up at six a m get some bright light in your eyes from artificial sources or from sunlight maybe five ten nminutes and go back to sleep until eight da m you do that again the next night and then you head off to new york you will find the shift to be much easier now here is what you do not want to do you want to make sure that you do not vieu bright light before six i m in the middle of the night if you get up you would use the restauran trying to use dim lights as dim as a safely possible et cetera and what you doing when you are doing this yei could get into a long description of the science behind this and i'll probably to a podcast all about this at some point but really what you are doing if you get up at six a m and getting some bright light exposure is you think about it you cannot looking at a new york sunrise of sorts ay if it is not a sunrise you are gtting some bright light that mimic sunrise at least to som exstent nothings quite sunrise but to some extent in that sens even if you go back to sleep what you are doing as you are sending the light signal the zit geber the time signal to your circadian clock of your hypothalemus that it should shift that you need to get up earlier and indeed that will happen over the course of about two three days the other thing you can do and i no this is a is is kind of a rare these days to get an answer this the other thing you can do is just flat to new york and force yourself to get up and just drink kafhine and get out and exercise and use the social rhythm of the activity of the city in order to get up earlier but you will feel lousy late morning and you would only want to do that if you could access a brief nap of anywhere from thirty to ninety minutes late morning and then you will feel fon but my suggestion would be to some something back there sayd some animal or something that answer much th at yet would be to just trying to get a lobit of light exposure a couple hours before your normal wake up time then go back to sleep in the two days before you had off to new york city and of course everything here was set in the context of the new york city a flight from samrecisco new york city but but the principl the logic holds and if you have any questions about this temperature minimum and wake up time and you want to get your circitian clock r ihte for travel check out the episode that we did on jetlagan shift work and i'm realizing now as i say this and i at my teams here and theyre listening that i will do a vidio on the human labclips channel where i explain temperature minnimum and how to plug in your wake normal wake up time in order to essentially arrive at whatever time shift you want we shpi put that ouas a news letter too where to lok shar wirds as i currently wake up at eight a m and then which means my and the ey'll say subtract to hours my temperature men in am six a m and i want to travel to whatever it is i sidney australia on this day from this city and then we know the time change and hat i can tell you exactly what to do for couple days i've done this m for verys military grooves have done this for people ind a close friends and who travel lot and i works favilessly well i cannot eliminate jet lag for you do not i wish i could just wet limina jilag i cannot do that but i definly can have the time that it takes for you to shift may be more i i i love the sidney show thank you thinks for coming out thanks fore coming to australia thanks for having us i take fish oil but i'm not sure i'm getting the dose rit what your thoughts on fishoil and dose i have lots of thougts on fishoil i think it is a terrific tool i think every time i see a study er an news article saying fishoil not shown to i giscagashi listen whoeverzri wrote that article i m i take no pleasure in em your on declining hell spender life span but o whatsoever but the rest of us sar going to be taken fishoil a men here is why there is just oh much evidence that getting enough omagathree fadiacis is great for brain health body health and i think that the the issue around fishoil is typically round contaminance soyou one may sure that does not have loads of mercury things sardines caued liveroil et cetera you can get those from natural sources except there is one problem i hate sardines and i do not want to slirp down a bunch of cod fat i'm just not interested in that if you eat a lot of fatty ocean fish in it is really clean fish great i do not most people do not i believe in taking a high quality fish oil therre lot of different sources of these in fact on the episode that we do with doctor roner patrick there is a link in the showno captions i believe that takes you to a chart of the different fish oil sources and there leve relative levels of contaminance et cetera but most of the reputable brands out there are not going to have any contaminants because they have been cleaned out it is been checked for ah i take the fish oil from ag one or fror momentous that is just me ther're lot of other great sources out there but i will say this that is when i'm travelling and i take capsls typically i to take it in liquid form and i will take the taken liquid form i have no financial relationship to the to the liquid non capsul forms of fish oil and i get the one that has a lemon flavor to overcome the absolutely discusting flavor of cod liver oil i guess i not presumely cod the taste of cod liver oil but i do not that is what i do ill ake a table spoon of that once a day in approaching shake at taste lemon it does not takes cod ant goodness and when i travel i take the capsils from ag one o romentous or their excellent ones from other sources ma lots of great sources out there now what are we trying to do when we take fish oil yes it can produce inflammation yes it can do a number of differentinks but that is all by way of o mego three fatiacid and take right most people get far too much o maga six riht this is why there is a seed oil debate ene no can have that debate now we would put us all asleep am frankly the keything is to get enough fo mega threes and there hard to get unless you are eating crills unless you are large you knowt bolin wail am your ply niting that much crill ah if you are getting faty fish great but when you take an o maga three fatias in the form of fish oil ere you sardines for that matter what you are getting essentially is the substrat for a lot of other important building blocks not the least of which is the lipid by layer that surrounds the nurons of yu of your of your brain and basically the obegathry fadiasits provide the substrait for some key building blocks of nerve cells and other cells in the brain and body and and this is perhaps the most important reason i can think of when you get out past one gram of the e p a form of omega three gen one gram of e p a form of a megathre per da it is clear there is a either mile to moderae anti depressint effect much that one can in some cases talk t your psychatro s or psychologust partially offset the dosage of any anti depressent i am not telling you to go off into to present medication and go on to fisioil that is not what i'm saying im tust saying that there is some impressive clinical trials showing that fish woil if taken at dosages of one to three grams of e p a per da can have a mil to moder anti depress int effect and i do not know any one that woun't want to have better mood i take one and a half grams of e p which is not to say one and afgrams offisia uned to look at the package and see how much fishoil woutd then look at how much e p a and typically it is less than one gram per servings you may have to take two servings some youlls i was it safe to take two servings i do not see any reason why not a and then of course there is the high potency fishoils for which there is certainly one gram or more of e p a keep in mind that all thes discussion about fishoil might sound cone to health food hippy store forgive me hippies a health food store kind of stuff but the reality is that e p a high concentration e p is achually a prescription drug in the united states and elsewhere a prescribed often for enhancing mental health and ence in cartyo ascular health and on and on we are not out on a limb or out on a fin as it were when having this discussion we are actually just talking about something for which there is a lot of clitical evidence there is a lot about chemical evidence there is a lot of mechanisms i take anywhere from one to two grams of e p per da even if th t requires taking six rather than the suggested three capsils per day or taking a full tablespooner even two tablespoons of fisha oil and frankly most people are getting too much foor make a six fadiacids and not enough tol make a three im shout out to the fish oils what is the recommended protocal for measuring hormon levels interesting how frequently do you advise monoring these levels to accurately determine their typical range and i just have to try and pronounce your name volad res neshenko what a cool name volot jesting i'm a big fan of let two syllable forishn whento i volad regnashenko thank you for this question in the opportunity to the trying pronounce your name hormon levels i think a good thing to do is in the absence of any apparent or suspected indicring disfunction i sort ti gm out you feel pretty good you are wondering if you are good under if i say good under the hood that to sounds we are a rives if you are feeling pretty good i recommend getting your hormon levels checked once if you can if you are still in your teens in your leight teens after you have gone through puberty to establish a sort of base line most people will not do that because it is too late i did not do that once in your mid twenties again we are talkin about no suspected or apparent endicrin dis function okain you are made twentycs you have a base line something to compare to when you were in your say eighteen to twenty and again whenyou are twenty five that would be ideal and then again i would say when you are thirty and then start once a year starting when you are forty or alder i think that just just logically i would love to know what my hormon levels were when i was twenty five when i was thirty maybe when i was yet when i was eighteen twenty five thirty thirty five and ishally thirty f ve is when i got my first blood blood drawf for just getting a look under the hood what is there what what what are my estrgen levels woer men testostron levels er my growth home on levels this kind of thing and then once you are forty and older i think once a year minimum and i realize that some people out there against say ble that is ridiculous what ecen do wit that information well you cin do a lot with that information you are gin to figure out whether not your eldial clastral is in healthy range youregin to figure out whether not your al t is in healthy range you are gin to figue ot withe not your apo b is in healthy rangeor you are you areging to figue out a lot more than just whether nt your testostron is four hundred six hundred eight hundred or or twelve hundred and i think we also need to be careful about over interpreting results of hormons because a lot of ask to do with the ratio of testostro an testrgen or the ratio a free testostron to testostron both in men and women for instance if you are testostronlevel is nine hundred but your free testostron level is two well then you have a problem whereas if you are total teststron level is five hundred or six hundred but your free testostron level is n fifteen well then youe probably doing pretty well i would say getting your hormon levels checked once a year after age forty and prige that once every three to five years starting in about eighe eighteen would be ideal but most people do not do that thereither do not have the disposable income i cerlindon when i was eighteen twenty twenty five and i at that time it was really hard to get that measured unless you had a clinical problem now if any oneg has a clinical problem that they suspect or is real then obviously more testing i think great sources for enticrane profiling are things inside tracker for disclosure they are esponse for the pod cast but they do an excellent job they will evin come to your house the flambadimus will com to yor house if you honor you can go to clinic they make it all very easy but there are other sources as well right i'm i'llnever make the amas or anything else about specific companies for for its own sake i just think insi trackerd is a great job there are number of clinics meric health and others on mine clinics that will do that but it is part of a more comprehensive package of of agreeing to work with them at least that is how i understand it ihope i did not get that wrong but checkan s now idays it is pretty easy to find ways to get your hormons a check but i would am suggest that the fallowing things at least beyond there grothhormon or igef on rather igef on tesastron estrogen is true for women and men a by the way igef one testastron estrogen do not shopas estro dial on there free testastron diadrotestastron courtis all keep in my morning cortis alls always elevated relative t afternoon court is all am it will be impacted by food you want to goin fasted in the morning a my deali get this done early ayour creat mean levels which by the way will be elevated if you are taking creating oar your exercising hard your doctrines are your creatinan levels are elevating you say will great will my creating and take his elevated too am take that am it is not ing to be a problem necessarily do check with your doctor a eldio clastral apo b and a ther pey a few others hat that would be good am yo having there for a men and women sexhormo bining globulan se at es h b g and for women especially progesteron and pro lacton am and proch and any of the progestins are going t be important and of course for women the trick is going to be wen you get your blood taken with respect to your hormon cycle youre ovulat tory cycle an to try to make that at least consistent from test to test not necessarily having to go in both during the felicular and the ludial phase of your cycle but always going in juring youn omidfelicular amidludil and and that can be challenging to do perhaps but that is going to be important because of course those are widely fluckd luctuating levels across across the cycle but am unles you are really obsast with your a hormo levels amend and analyzing them taking them at multil times throughout your menstrual cycle probably not necessary unless your sarry to think about conceiving or there is some issue am pisio as for other issue oqe i find that i need you anist yoare after working out any thoughts on this am yes well forswell glad you'r using an istiars youre costool known to replenishment mental and physical vigor works o well i think it is great i think it probably is accelerating your recovery i think this tells me you are probably working out really hard am and hopeully not too long if you find that you work out in the morning and then you are really really sleepy in the afternoon and the next day you might be working out too long or too hard may we ratchet back the intensity olo bit or the duration it is amazing how great we can feel when we work out to eighty to ninety per cent of our maximum out put am in duration we did the the other day wyou knowyou know we we went out for a jog runbounding skipping ah jumping jack thing and stopped it eighty to ninety per cent of maximum and ten went about the rest of the day and evening feeling great if you do this consistently you will find you have more energy and there is a actual lot of solid physiology and physics to support why that is as suppose to if you go to the gim an you do every set to failure or even every exercise you include one set to failureand you are grinding out for straps or you are i do not knowat kind of exercise your doing yor you are running more and more distance each day or with more intensity yoh it it is understandable how one gets kind of endrawn to ar addicted to that burn or the effort but keep in mind that is stress you are you are stressing the body to produce a certain kind of adaptation either endurance or strength or hypertropy or et ceter adaptation there is there is real beauty and learning to love working out hard but to leaving the gim or ending the run with ten to twenty per cent of the gas in the tank and knowing that you can come back can do more and you ef she can want to do more there is that it increase is vigor is supposed to taking yourself over that cliff even a slight ten to twenty percent and then finding that our you are kind of to pleated and this is something that we do not hear enough about becaus we ah most people theyre into fitness are into pushing themselves it is also true for work i think some of the best advice i ever got in the professional landscape was when i was a graduate student that you see burkley and excellent naurologis by the name of bobnight said the key is to figure out how much can you work each day consistently if that is four hours a day fine if that is eight hours a day fine we are talking with weekan breaks cause that was in the year of wee can breaks maybe a week end every one while where you have a dead line but by thinking about what you personally can really do consistently while maintaining sleep and mental health and physical health you are ging to go a lot further then doing for instance what i did which is omaniac and working hundred hour weeks as a graduate studend than an upsick four times a year and missing out on a bunch of days when i could have been in lave these days i trying get as much focued workd on as possible but trying make that as consistent as possible if not from every day to the next over time figure out wath those averages are and do not be ashamed of those averages i was say declare those averages to people they know it to expect and the fact that you can do more does not necessarily mean that you should do more because i think one of the best apiece of advice i ever got in the world of fitness is more important than training hard more important than doing any particular exercises more impornt than anything is to not get hurt because if you get hurt you cannot train i love thatyou are doing enest you are after training i love that you are am making that part o your practice but maybe also throttle back a little bit cause you said i have to do t after training maybe throttle back low bit on the duration or intensy of exercise and see how you feel what can we do to optimize the function of our gutbrain access that is very simple get enough sleep in addition to that avoid excessive in tak avantobiotics but if youre doctor prerscribes them take them i maybelever an antibiotics o he before the intrnate jumps on mea i'm not ant i by i'm not anti antibiotic iw always want to say that i'm not anti antibaotic i am not pro antibotic but i am pro probiotics i'm probiotic i a think you should in just wonderfour servings of losugar formented foods perday sarocrat kimpchi nato or keefer or otherwise whatever you in fits with your nuntrition preferences in plan i think it is also very important that you do not overuse antiseptics canteceptic mouthwashes and handransas and all it stuff this was all discussed on a pokas episode i did with doctor just in soninberg on the youverin lapokas which is just to say that just in whos a professor at stamford an is amazing even said that he lets his kids eat lunch when they have been playing outside without washing their hands before eating lunch because he wants the probiotic make up of they are got to be diverse including from outside now i'm presuming that is not a public park ofme assuming its their yards who are not talking about i'm gros stuffbing on their hands retuying about a little dirt here and there turns out owning a pet increases the diversity of your microbium i'm lots of things that i mou do not want to go round licking people's pets can to let them lick you undepending i'm on what your preferences are but do not lick them but when you interact with people you shake their hands or pets your you are increasing the diversity of your microbium when you eat lowsugar formented foods you want to make sure also you get enough fiber both prebotic and probiotic fibrs of fruits and vegetables i the fibr debate to for me just makes me roll my eyes im it is clear that fibr is good for us forget motility and for offsetting cancers of the got i may i realise ther're the people out there who are really into elimination diets where they just only e me but iman there is jus much good data on fiber i'm especially from fiberous vegetables it just tseems a or yes i'm i' ma not i's almost silly that we have the debate frankly but i'm sure soone out there whose pure carnivor will be i'm shouting but guess what you are shouting and you are constipated last question regarding the subject on tongue cleaning from the oral health hap episode can you please share a bit on brushing tongue scraping tongue and generally how best to clean the tongue tongue cleaning came up on the orl health episode i talkd to four different dentists and a paridantists in preparation for that episode almost all of them remarkably extraordinarily converged on the same advice except for some slight deviations around frequency of flotsy skand of cool ry a field where almost everybody seems to agree i realize that is not the hugeot sample size but i pick them from diverse locations backgrounds trainings et cetera every one of them said brush and flostyer teeth every one of them said antiseptic i'll call base mouthwashes are bad and every single one of them said that brushingyour teeth before sleep is e specially important because at now you produce less alive when you want to be able to remineralize your teeth that is pilian cavities that are staring to form while you sleep brush your teeth flosts ideally as well before sleep at least brush and of course in the morning too for everyone is sake but if we are talking about tongue brushing and scraping it was clear that the tongue scraping was atvised if dongue correctly oka because there are certain backchery that grow on the tongue that you do not want there and that scraping can help with the turn over of healthy bactoria there in addition of removing some of the bad bacteria but that most people scrape their tongue too hard and rather it would be wise to brush your tongue gently with the soft tooth brush d by the way you should also use a softbrush for your teeth but not the same one that you use for tongue brushing thet take away that i was told and makes lost sense to me base on what i know know about the biology physiology and care of the mouth is that you want to use a different soft tooth brush to brush your tongue then the soft brush that you use to brush your teeth and that you do not need to use anything on it but if you want to put a little bit of salt and baking sota that is perfectly fine a lot of youll wonder whether not baking sota scrapes the enamel off the teeth it ahally is low on the abrasian scale dentis have believe it or not an abraian scale with a list of things of how much enamel it scrapes off at a given pressure dentis have done their work it is really really cool i cannot say always liked dentis i did not going the dentis they away seem nice people but now i have newfound respect for dentis they really care about their craft and orl health has been pon a push to the back seet of the different aspects of health i consider it one of the major pillars of bent halth and physical ealth because taking care of your teeth your gums your mouth gling your oral microbyum it is critical for carty of mascular health it is critical for brain health one of the bad bacteria stripped cocus am you tans that can preliferate in the mouth especialy after sugary eating sugary foods om can make it through the blood brain barrier and maybe it is thought o oneof the causes of dimensia can desrupt your nurons your brain aboudy is a system everything's talking everything else and yet brush your tongue but use a separate soft brush to do that and replace it every few weeks to months i that can i suppose get expensive but probably not's expensive as o some of the other health issues hat or just described appreciate that question ah we did not talk about oil pulling on the pod castlot if you willast about thats and you will to swish oil men spittet out as a waight that is oil pulling i for oil health ad all the dentis i spoke to said e not big fans of oil pulling but none of them said it would be particularly bad but im a if you enjoy it or you think it works for you great but i'm none of them really pointed to any clear evidence that was going to be beneficial i was told that was the last question and we are coming up on the hour a gan i want a thank everybody for joining this a m eh i'm doing this from australia sidney australia what is interesting down here is because we are below the equator everything is reversed right this was actually shut it is been presented you upso i was i'm actually upside down but they turn the camera i would appear right side up to you i also when i'm down here i drink my age yo one normally i swish it counter clockwise by nose here reflexibly on swishing at clock wise an my lots of interesting stuff going on we will talk about how that all works it is not through the vestibularcular reflex it turns out but may be on a future episode of the podcast about the relationship between im location relative to the equator and nerl functioning and i'm just kitting but what i'm not kitting about as they appreciate te utuned in and alas but certainly not least thank you for your interest in scine s

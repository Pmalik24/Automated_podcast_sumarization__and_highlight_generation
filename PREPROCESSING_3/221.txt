remember years ago guy ran the military secretary defence downal brumsfelled said confamously there'r the things we know the things we kdo not know and therewar the thingstat we do not even know we do not know the last cinom spooky categoy he called the unknown unknowns and a ges may be talking about known unknowns and unknown unknowns might have ben appropriate for the hing he was talking about which was a rock and weapons of mas destruction but who knew that some day was gon to be a good way to describe the caos sworling this year around to which should be the most pedestrian predictable things the government does counting vots an election and starting the school year o geglet us save thelection for another day can we talk writn ow about the demolition durbe mon'te car pilop of known unknowns and unknown unknown it is the opening of the school year mat teachers an ta big high school in the suburbs of south carolina and all summer he is been doing what parents and teachers everywhere h been doing this year wondering if theres can to be inperson instructionis fall watching stake local officials ge at information that seem incomplete and contradictory and confusing and it was sort of hot potato of responsibility to is everybody's con up passing lie when you hear from your district when you hear from the statesy roomen when we hear from our govern other els saying somebody elses wan to set the course and then your know yet it felt very the flective my il ges when they got to the first day the teachers reported back to school no keds are yet just teachers that is as things still seemed very unclear thinking surely when we get in the building workin to get the answers the the answer is in the building where my bosses are te'rgano know and over the course of the week sort of having the vail lifted and realize a my bosses do not know anything more than i do about the stare of school my principl and i know the exact same about of information at that point teachers had received to nemo with a tenat if plan but the ambuses was very much on tentative his principal noted quote things change daily the plan was got the a b plan and was the hibrid plan that lasts of schools are doing students wil be divided into two groups a b half come to school for two days while the other half what stay home and joing on line using sume then thid switch but if gonis y a high school spending through the malstrum of known unknowns and unknown unknowns o get here is what happened that first day the teachers came back the first meeting that i got to is at ten and it is a department meeting we how just fifteen people spread out and you all are sitting there socially distance from each other wereing masks yet there is a good atmosphere in the room were all things consider were were hoppy to be there and happing to seach other a very glass halffull whatever may come sort of vibe in in the room and our department had whos a teacher has written up these two plans on the board the ight a bd a sort of hibrid plan and tin an all virtual start virtuuss tor o no students in the building you teaching everybodya on line got it yet we get a little into this meeting and there we have an administrator one of our our assistant principles is in the room a d he is been mostly quiet but when we get to a conversation about how we get back in to teaching he sort of pipe sad and he says hang on is the egh a bt a plan is out apparently they had received word from the district that our school needed e cance of that plan are i everybody first change curball com in at eleven and change of plans less plan on all virtual sommer is ten ofcock its they be eleven ofclock it is all virtual or anyway tht's how mat took it ister parpencho told us he had know idea what would happen the an tin meeting ins then around two in the afternoon word sort of spreads that there is this there is this bom drop of an announcement and that administrator who had been in our meeting caught my colleague in the hall and he was kond of flustern he said plans are changing again we just got word from the district 's just wait for the staff meeting let us see wat happens i staff meeting is the big welcome to the new school year alstaff meeting for the whole faculty in strarke to three ofclock bout two hundred and fifty teachers are on the ezume call where all in our own rooms you are on the building but you'r in your own rooms yesones t in't nothing happens at this meeting the whole meeting is trivial information they introduce new faculty members they sheare positive news from teachers summers new babies or engagements they talk about our essay tea schoors sand last year all things that we hear annually when the fundly you talk about the restart plan he says is a lot of we can do it positivity but no concrete details bout wether toy be going on virtual or what the planwas con to be them meeting ands and we are all sort of sitting there thinking what what was it and my colleague and i are determined to figure the sout it is for now we are we are gongto go down to the administrators offices and just see what we coand see and we we go to one of the administrators offices and there are two other assistant principles ind there at's pretty s pretty jamed and it is sort of the situation room and an y white house action dramaouno there is papers all over the table and everybodyes on the computer and even for as few people are in the room there is sort of talking past each other in their multipal conversations going on and my friend and i con i got thaive of where does geen a stand at the door oare not oven gon to come and wait into the water but what we find out is that in the afternoon the district apparently came back to the schools and was o k new plan you need students in the building on the first day of school five days a week at twenty five per cent capacity that is all we are giving you figure it out and well wwy at table are all theses rosters of students and and schenduling and there is some legistical nightmare the lejistic to night marriage to south caroline a mandates that every parent should have the option to send the good to school for imperson instruction if they want we will keep them at home for virtual learning if that is what they want which is the kind of trying to pwease everybody solution that in practice it is just enormously difficult to execute it means that there hve to be some students in school five days a week but of course ir's only much space in the school for students with proper sers o distance sing how do you figure out who gets to attend and who does not get to attend and what happens when you cannot give every family what it wants meanwhile in the class rooms he south carolina heads tords first day of classos september eighth de yous have to figure out how to do something that they did not do last spring when schools went on quarentine that 'i we get how do you teach a class ire's partly at home partly in the room with you which is a particularly it is particularly funny to thing for chuir it is a very difficult subject to teach virtually a man he is a quire teacher trying to sing in azume with other people is itis just a nightmare because you cannot evens if you say what is clap at the same time they will tat you will here a bunch of different class because every beits course i tis a little delay and that to lay makes ip impossible to sing together yet not to mention that usually the soft wereis built to to identify ho is speaking and amplify their voice and silence other people the only wt to sing together is with everybody on you and you knowt what con a rehearsal s that and the one forth of the class hs can be in the room with them they cansing together in the room because singing in a chorus can be a superspreador event for the virus remember that acquire in your seato at the beginning of the pandamic where fifty two people got sic even with mass its not save which means singing together is the one thing you cannot do in chorus mat's glasses are ninety minutes long and write nowye figures whe teach the kids onzume in the kidsen classroom together for half an hour at the beginning of it lecture style ge about singing simons to do at home and then at tha thirty minute mark or something i would probably dismiss those zume students say o you got your siments i'll see son take the students that are in the room somewhere outside where we can be spaced out and actually practice singing with that wheather permitting yet whether et we just work an have to just ma giver the whole smass ter basic lay yeu know you re engineering every part of your job every single isofit exactly othe teachers is aid this to me too the virtual teachings making them rethink and re engineer the most bas ic things they do in their jobs to get through to kids te second great teachering cicago told me that she was still struggling to figure out how she was gon to hold the antention of a bunch of seven year old over vidio for the man dated three hours a day a live real time instruction cus in ove enough developmental wy that is even possible for them the fokuss on the scream for that long not to mention what activitiese wich sho oing to give these little kids yto do on the rome on supervises by her for the hours they would not be on vidio with her shs speny weeks before school started every day on our own time on paid to for you the o pen a few days since i have pot to that conversation with mad and since then he sischoal surveyed the teachers and realized that many of them wanted t stay home and teach from home the w's no way they coul actually have twenty five per cent of the students come back for in person instruction right now it seems ther roing on t haf anough instructoris for fewer than ten per cent of the students but administrators is still figuring it out of course who knows how everythings going unfold in september when kids actually arrive when ny ba t get coven will things be fine man knows some teachers and states were school is alredy started what it feels right now is going cliff jumping with your friends and our friends and excessar georgia and alabama and were one too three e were all thing and for weeks as their jumping off cause they want a we want to see what happens toou to the other district i'm starting to see i have friends and louisi anotheir teaching entirely virtually our friends and georgia and alabama thet are posting their instogrand stories of plexy glass in front of their desk and youre we go w you tow wear situation were you actually do not know what is goin a happen in your kind of worried but you have to deal with parents and students and with them do you let them know your apprehensions or do you just keep a a big smily face and it is gon to be great dou just do fl your line ye it sort of feels it feels a little contorted am bi have teachers that are posting first day of school pictures as always and they sound bright and cheery and it is cannot wait to see my students tosfight the challenges really excited to show them a great new year but underneath the surface these teachers are my friends and i know these teachers are terrified and it feels it feels twisted this here becaus we really do on't know what aur safety looks lie and what r studed safety looks but you still have to be the boss forout of the cglass and we lik what is up ya excided r here let us go am i am going to put my best fut for because i cannot wait to teach kids and i love doing that but i'm scared cok us about what the year looks of nevy be easy chicago it is is american life to day in a programme teachers students parents launch themselves into a school year that is beginning none that any of us have ever experienced since thi spring everybody has been inticipating the school opening this an of this asteroy that we ave all been watching ad towards earth floating towards us humbling towards us in space in school motion and now it is finally hitting and we are finding out if it is just as bad as we thought it was going to be away better than we hope we ave stories rom arund the country of a going badly and i'm going to tell you in some placeis going surprisingly well wes renow anyway stay with us a gon mass crusaders i preferse school started in you to this moth our producer meki me caut up with two high school teachers clark is thirty three bales twenty six the married and we greed not use he last name s they joke that their pillatoc is reviewing each other's lessons for the next day clrk teache startin photography this hears his six year as a teacher baily's a newly about tave roun class room for the very first time teaching sophmore english the to r em teach a ifferent public high schools in you tall county southo sot city and they found themselves thrown into this really hedid and ugly fight in the county right before schools opan back op here is meky clark and baily or stilly's frash faced enthusiastic teachers but they spent the summer strussing about their schools reopening because cobid cases had started surging in outop both of them would have classes with is many as forty students in them the classfroms are too small to space tosk six see apart and the windows they do not open governor garry herbert issued a mask mandate for all kathror twelve schools which made them feel a little batter untell a county commissioner a guiding billy he started lobbing against it he thought it should be up to parents whether their kids were a mask he called it a quot compassionate exemption to try to drum up support he invited parents to the commissions next meeting suddenly you were either promask or anti mask clark and baily decided to go in support of masks but im going into it i was as any one really in it be there hitis they ma go to contess masks i just thot other can be ten people there int no id yet there were actually around a hundred people there the meeting was held at the county bilding in provole and when clark and baily got there they sawmostly monscattered outside some with kids hardly any one was wearing a mask but one family who was wearing mask stop baily therey you should go in because leres no one really i saparenoug masks and i was o can going a a i just can arad in the builty it was pat there were tairs set up with tape across them for social distancy but that did not work well people were just peeling off the tave and sitting down and people were just ri'ld out te cou sail as energy that was really intense at just wering abask in that face but it is hard at out ot that an yet the room was hot and crowded and a bunch of people without masks for fanning their faces e were goon to go all right that is a county commissioner i nean taner ange he was not happy about this meelen hello every one this is going to be this is going to be brief i think om th is is the exact opposite of what we to be doing we are supposed to be visically just insee werin masks oall of all o or mot o exbords or the parten of helevery one is incuraging us to do that this room is not complying with reselve guad lines is brees o health dicern for this meeting in a little over a minute the whole meeting was over o a the meaing is a jern hane stands up and walks out of the building people in the crowd call mac har and then ange later to eated this is not a parks and rack episode it is you talk county government to him this whole thing was just a political ston the county commission has no jurisdiction over school districts they do not make decision for them et be the sheriffs department wholling a meeting to the one school loget it did not make amy sense but billy the guy who wanted the governor to give the county a compassionate exemption from wearing masks and another commissioner they agree to stay behind to listen to any parent who wanted to make a comment again hereis baly at that paint when i realize that people are get evee making comments ti can afpeched by way and to the rim because i ouhtn't to make the coit she got in lying for the potium there around twelve people ahead of her even more behind her costly moms one of them had a baby carrier frafter her task i watch this meeting on a facebook live streem most of the speakers accepted that covid is rael they did not think it' a hoax they supported handwashing anstaying at home in her sek but did not trust the se e see and in general all the precautions seemd over own some sounded libertariums there were tons of conspiracy thearies tlike that mam with the baby she said the thaing i heard a lot of parents their say that seal too and germs can get trapt in yer mask and make you seck which is totally false you want arkin the re go suein or ald er ar hours she saying do you really think it is good to breathin her own germs for hours this smith is taken off in parent worts all over the country the american accademy of pety actrics the den't put out a statement to try and dispellet and another conspiracy theory at this meeting pors that mask mandates will lead to more kids getting obducted and sex trafects also not true the fear is that kids or waring masks they will be harder to idontifying rescue tho servers will continues e rests because of the world home a i l tain di masts is' i i treams i tre thomas jofferson also ket coming up this pretty i ronic way i o min is a ma tons jersin said i is ver dangerous fring them over peaceful slavery i wirl mhever i the matter wat ittis giv me liberty or give dat i mean tat i will do what bever in tays to hot words thank you flistening all these parents baily and clark were alarmed worry that they might have to face classes of forty kids who were in a fight with them about wearing masks baily she got up to the mihke she was sweaty and nervous but fired up wan ai ni er a o a ishe tells the crowd she is a first to er teacher whos ordy juggling a lot of anxiety and she scared that shall get covit in her classream the crowd turns on her wa as ii mi er in be intni ii in o whos that is clark doing some very teacher sussons somay i whyrre i r reso a omony you or t it is this for five minutes and then bailey finally ands er speech and takes a little bow on their way out of the meeting clark feeling sheepish apologizes to the people that he told to shut o i have never been fo e riit was it was it was just wile to be surrounded by many grown adult who were shouting at me calling me names i well also rewatching the viyo i i realize thi kind of did a little bow after mi after my comreds which is thad of embarrassing now bat it was just it tougt such a outrageous experience that it was almost comical but bailey was also sympathatic to the parents in that room she thought a lot of their hostility was coming from a place of fear not wanting kids to poff to bein schools where things feell very destoty ani the spere that having to be mask is going to scare their childrer there something that or in pocked tha negetively i th thels our reasonable points in some ways but a also o at the same time i grew up a you cok county i still have a lot of friends in family there si fel pretty safe bedding that most of the people in that meeting were moremen the majority of the county belongs to the church but watching that meeting i saw something i did not recognize mormans yelling at o their moremons with total vitriol baile and clark that they felt the same ther from the area to by the way i know were not suposed to say moreman any more or to say latterday same but i juston't actually knew that many mormons who use that with each other anyway right after ou tas republican governor garry herbert issued his mask mandate church leadership in the state backed him up they asked moremans to whear face coverings in public clinded a sign of good citizen ship immediately there was pushd back i saw a commen son line about corruption and false propits in the church that was mine blowing it is not members nember speak out against the church it just that i have not seen at down casually romask people were called maskers and maskcals governor herbert called the parens who went to that county meeting foolish and he refused to back down from his mask mandate which just enraged the anti mask movement and you ta county even more they held another ralley and told parents to tell their kids to fight back against their teachers bailey and clark wondered how wide spread the feeling was and worried that some of the parents or fellow teachers at her new school would recognized bailey from the county meeting nd thinks shue was a crazy ratical tedio had hit local news and it was a big deal have you thought about what youre to say at your classes on the first day anticipating you might have kids who come from families that shares from the same beliefs to the people who were at the county meeting i really don' know what i good say ore how good a perst that cover such ya really do not know what discover as got a look whon the scooliarash was church and soll you happens thet would you get whut if you get bood i will bow and walk out on the first day of school baile and clark got in their cars and hadded an opposte directions their schools are about a half hour apart they both recorted voice memos for me while they were driving oca aen der ithing to school e far wa fris stay of teaching a very my who life as an actual teacher theres can memakes an yelling excitad anda ner

whole team weares masks for games in practice a girls says she heats it that they make a glasses log that about fifteen minutes into this conversation clark heess the tactic that did not work with the parents with the county meeting he tells them about his own anxiety but that is when one of my exieties caving back to scols i i dont wat how to tell somebody to wear mass but that that feels trustfulst me and the kids they seem to get it foon clark has a few other periods that day and he starries seese class with the same bochbell he never gets any push back the cids all were their masks

school this one of the first in the country to open up and it opened his cases were rising in the area on the coved map that harvard gobo healthins to maintains the county is currently red as we get to day show in the air red the institute says mesa they are at a tipping point for uncontrolled spread that is exactly the kind f situation the lots of teachers around the country have been saying would keep them from returning to their classrooms maryville however is been at it for a month now what is alike how are they holding up for glompe of the futher that awaits many educators elsewhere they ave castonbaum talk with t teacher named stacy travis stacy is the ind of teacher people go to when they have problems wele o the time their math problems that is what she teaches one of the days we talked she goten a call in the middle of the day for mac kid who was not even in school that year he graduated he ws in his dorm room in college and i call hin back and he was i do not know how to sol this and he shows me this paper and i save wat cath or you and he goes freshman in juneering and i said i taught you how to sll that he goes i know that is why i call to you the decision to go back to school in the middle of a pandemic that is e different kind of problem even before school open tere were cases some kids could not come in on the first day because they tested positive she says couple teachers have taken these extra precautions in their classrooms one has this and almost looks the old fashioned bat tubs with the ring around it with the curtaoon where and it goes all taway around their dest wat waits the teachers desk is facelac surrounded wit a a a clear hor arn on on kenysy pipe even with all the mask and social distancing stacy says school feels kind of normal ones the dey get started thut ther's always this menace that feels jostoff stage since the high school open several students of tested positive she gets anemale every time we talk she had one student out awaiting test results it does not lok any of the students got of irish from school but their hus ban one case in the district were it looks a maintenance worker may have gottin covid from a college there are moment that it worries me and i can give you a tetific example an i i had a te to ask for help and i hav my maone a i mask on every come i walk up clis yest in it si o for help and im he had his mas on to hi below his nose and i i was riding on his dest and we are talking t tis polem and i kic fel is breath on my arm and ti kind ov made me have a moment o oh i go shes freeding on me mi i can feel the bread ca may have his nes on o my arm and i after our finish telping an which ie ti ater help iny gid a ther as i sand i a my hand but then i te have since frac and ather and i jist sraid it down my arm a that i know i probably lok weard and i was not trying to make him fel comfortable but it make me feel little bit better do you think about it the question ofs her risk with maugh ever ysince your mauth person im as the risk of meaf me catching her it yet i annou you are not as i a job ye ye this her this many case this many positive cases in the community where this many people in school over this criative time i'm in contuct with this number of them you could do the numbers oh ye i can defiline to the numbers i do not let myself t the numbers im because i think iv just kind it real i that i'm probably i'm probably get in get it either i'm going to get it from a sudent arm gongto get it from my kid who got it from another kit im yw or i'm goingto get it from my husband yho got i from one of the workers on his jof figt what do you think about that it it might be o cabut it might not i know i know it my be o cane an my not and i'm it is again it is one of thos

reassured her that things were going well far and they asked if there wis anything they could do to help get the kids into school when she told them it was hard to pick them up on fridays they said that was fine they could keep the kids an extra half hour until their grandma got off work this plus the fact that there were no covec kases those first few days won over both kiera and her mother and

many peopl traye teacher the school counsellor and mister mcguire were willing to talk through her concerents even the tone of their voices that they were confident in jovial signaled to her that they felt good about reopening maybe she did not have as much to be worried about its i stunning amount of extra work for the school convincing parents one by one for their kids to attend the school there already en roll den but this is what it took in many cases by the end of that first week the school tracked down all but three of the missing students they convinced around seventy more kids to come in person and another forty or decided to stay on line jemelas son tray went back to school that tuesday kira the mon who had to convince her mother she sent her kids on thirsday i just feel you ir

brandon they din't asnhi was as ous ton outsock as are yu serious what was the point of towding the safety plancs that you had in place if you if you had any sort of inkling thad if there is an outbreak that you can cent people hole i i wulh love to be in the room where that happened and in sit down and listen to them say wif theres in a three hundred cases which consent everybody hol

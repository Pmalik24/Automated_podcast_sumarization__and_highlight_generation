of quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in to day's episode of the shou if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our websight this american life datwork re member that old fashioned idea the two people who disagree about politics could sit down tah e could see the others point of view al bige used to quit scripture as he haded into political negotiations come wlet us reason together now of course we all realize that that is impossible a mever stating for a fact but when i mean man thers this famous moment a few years ago when all this seeme way might possible a moment we shees long go now the cam bad ecause of this thing that happened into presidential press conference before i take your questions i want a talk for a few minutes about the progress wer making on health an surance reform that a goes ta dracobamarecanomigates two thousand nine six monmy co wickis here ato re the o sho raon semian has been revisiting this piece of very recent history because it is recent that feels thike its almost quaint he fact the pople thought that sitting down in talking together myht work he rabbin he ira o case i talk to daon fiper he is the deputy communications guy in the obama white house at the time he was there in the room for that press conference before hand they gone over with the president that ten specific reporters they wanted him to callon a ye got to the ender that war and nat at going off gat and you can tell ah the prevident wit goin very good about it reformen you get gusually think e go well that he wal e h ake wore question can i not te ever god ever como e e wone wore question i i try to maye that short that whence we would get her last question thank you mister president and i renember te question i gular yesterday recently professor henry newescates cunior is arested at his home in cambridge what does that incidento say to you and what does it say about races relations in the merican well i should say the outset that scip gates is a friend i may be a little by asture i do not know all the facts o gase such as turn on everybody word henry lois gates junior famous harvard professor african mericans colar he comes home one night his trying to get into his own house an h is a problem getting an lene the keys do not work or something and someone seez him and calls the police the copsho up and he responding officer f sergeant james cally he learns that it is in fact gates own house but then ageitn to an argument and ascolates and they both have words and then gates gets a reston rit ocats this comes up i the press conference us igas yeand presidnt ant obama is comfortable on his again he is casual in this comman was that he even makes thus little joke that is impossible to imagine i making ow i a m if i was tranagigerin well i guess this is my ausass hi wene at but let us say my hole house in cae a here i get shut i a but then he says this this is the part that is can a cause all the trouble i thing is fer to say number one any of us would be pretty angry number two that the cambrage police i acton stupidly in arresting somebody when that there was already proof that they were in their own home an number three what i think we know separate and apart from this insident is that there is a long history in this country of african americans and lottines being stopped by lon forcement tis proportion that that is just a fect the night ends and enyers thinking nons pretty god ye i po fi yev wu we cobi it yo ce goon an qitom yusually re with your pacafri i would walk back wuit ham ah an coa ligt you put came at out i but in hi thin he might have got up there to ded a preasure we were in that wa he anywhere ah got on wenever talkin you about it that night he might ave got the gallery rigt afterward vallery jarrett one of abama's senior advisers she was at the press conference to i remember listening to the answer and thinking yet tat sounds right and then when he said the word stupidly i paused for a minute and then i thought about n i said ar when when somebody gets a rested to their own home that is pretty odd right and i did not give much more thought to it but by the time i got from the easteron i in the residentes back to my office in the west wing it had gone up oh that night i man literally within six or seven minutes it was acjust went viral ride away of his a big deal almost instantly the reactsion to him saying th word stupidly rojes was an instant problem after accusing police of acting stupidly for a resting a harvard professor in his own home president obama came under fire camsh poliece i muc stupid i the yor taty the knows us knows that i thin te preset mi o polgin pall wor forspo preson o wha ten tri contri to professof this president i think has exposed himself as a guy over and over and over again who has a deep seedid hatred for white people or the white culture i dont know what it is i not saying that he does not white white people i say he has a croblem he has a this guye is i believe a racis tha was gon back on fox news confamously ye that was one reaction but simultaneously civil rightscrups are calling the white house and thinking obama for putting a spotliht on this issue that was important to them essentially prison mabama had afertlessly divided the country with this one word stupidly it was not intended to trigger i polorize the police from the communities of they servant protact it was really and of an off handed comment and if perhaps he had not said stupidly things would have go would not have gotin his derailed as they did iif he had if he had said for an example it is understandable that skip would be annoyed than a police officer werd address would arrest him in his home oi think people would have said ye i'd be annoyed but when he said something about the police officers in tend or behavior i think that is what gone under people's skin inside the white house they going to full crisis mode the hoping it all die down but i does not they come up it is idea to in vite gates and cralley to the white house to sit down and have a beer and then that wun te prac yoube a deryer ed an wha atwy tay da ma nen to bear omat at a a man or ban overdod your tomat bea miwated o yor mea carent the it iada a icture yer other ad at we did what a eres anti gan of the an e sto th get to gt the fo beers commination down pictic pictures and as we onl know that did not word ya no it still comes up ike a month ago as our collague sohe chase was that in trunprally in new hampshir the talk to people there about why the country is divided and two supper people brought this up on their own when it to this as the moment that they knew that obama was out to divide the country would he did his fir is first what a ithing hors oer he went after the copsing cambridge that is the thing that i started in i really started he he started hat just the things that did as starting with the the beer somit we hadin cambridge yet all these dome things that he did beown i thos is t i was is is jengthen e case o bear som i did not unify america right i have thought about this much since it happened just the casual way that president obama stepped into this i've won ndered if he was i sat the table already with the race conversation as a candidate people know where iam coming from ive wondered if maybe he was just trying to test the water is right then maybe he just thought wel let' just see how let just see where we are i do not know that there was that much thought i think to your poin on haana an onesty rominan thought about this before he put it to me but i'm sure because the race speech had gone well and was embraced broadly and it was raw and honest not himself he hope that people had a better sense of who he was and because he would one the presidency a an had comported himself throughout his short tenur at that point as the president for all of america i think perhaps he thought he had the standing to say that and and not experienced the back lash and that was a teaching moment to than iu na fir ier for him prawl of us yen dan told me he thinks that it was not what a bama said but that he was the first black president in the white house and that if it was not this wouldhave been something else i cay but if the goal of the beer summit was just three people sitting round trying to understand each other alittle better even for those people did at work i mean yet it kind of did lake they were really mad before and then after the beer som that sargea crawley dote this press conference where he says we agree that we both have a lot to learn from each other and we wanto stay ind touch and they stand touch yet it seems it since then a gates has said that he and sargea crawley have developed a really good relationship and then he did this thing he has as pvst v show where he tests teleberties d'anna and tells them about their history a'm he asked crawley to do a daannatest and found out that they have a common irish ancestor a cousin sir robin another words that it is possible for people to get along and a and become friends in see each other's points of view especially around the magic potion that we call beer but wek of in a country where a most of the nation for one reason in another choosis not to believe that seems out wa yet but that is actually ou show to day people sitting down trying to see the other persons point of view over beer in all these stories no getting beeri is involved at a critical turning point in one story the fate of an entire nation is its tag ac tuall nothe o think that thes trup for theother story to from debybasy chicago its this american life stay with us one one for my baby and one more for the road if everybody theunited states in europe breaking off into political groups who seemd to understand each other less and lest these days this german gournalists named basty on berbner ismet the last three years were putting on people from these kinds of groups that dislike and mistrust each other and see things very differently who actually sit down and try to get along he tralen to a bunch of ifferent countries looking for examples of this were people do indeed somehow come to see id eye for example when denmark he and a vewd policemen who decided that the very best way to combat the most radical people they faced jehadas and teonazis was to invite them in for coffee with i have to say amazing results and the most extreme example of the city found was in bazuana were for decates now the government has been running this kind of big an a social experiment to fight triboism basey what happens is that every year the government tells thousands of civil servants to just pack up their belongings and move sometimes very far from home to live and work th people who are som ad very different from them this pine is not popular sometimes a parent is forced to work hundred miles from around family buthe government as stabornly stack with this palacy for decates here is pastyan when whatuona became independent from britain in nineteen six six six it was one of the last african countries to do imagine the colonialess sleev and you are the first president of pazuana for years all around you you have seen the same story over and over again countries become independent athnic violance follows marley became ndependent in nineteen sixty two years later the tuaric startef o civil war congo same story soon of that is independente the province of catanga tried to break away nageria independence in nineteen sixty very soon the ecbos and housas started clashing having seen all of that the early leaders in bazuana knew they had a problem because the exact thing that had fueled the violencs in all those countryes they haded as well a if you think about that these borders a wil just to an ap and some of the lestrat bord us see that they could have cut through the passing is fully you this is sunity dow the foreign minister of pazuana she was a kit beck in the sixties when a few people in london through the borders of her country on a map creating bazuana and lik in all those other places in africa they were putting a bunch of ethnic groups together that did not really each other the colanga in the north the baquanaa south of the cala hari deserat the banguato in the centre in whatuana every one refers to these groups as tribes that is what i am going to say in this story in whatuana they were twenty tribes givo take they spoke different languages at different traditions and now they were forced into one country the early leaders figurate to avoid that kind of violends here whut we need to do is breake up tribeli thantities tand form a true nation no more as no more than just a wee but how do you do that they came up with tha plan first they decided every one needs to understand each other in schools they would only teach english and said sguana the other tribe languages not at all second to keep people from fighting over land they gave a pece of land to any one who wished and they said everything underneath tat land belongs to the state this is important because this is one of the diamond richest countries on earth whtevens if im given a thits offland i settled there i dik and i find a rich diamond mine w you get moved what you mean that you get moved you have to declare that taminy my saran ite is tey gainst the lor to absolute to to keep it for yourself you cannot defind tham man an and i find o a wat once yo find it it is not yours theres a lord that jus verge lady says it is is not yoursis belongso to everybody a you just get an atherpisolan sam places i would be frustrated amso of ter troubles e fata there was one more thing probably the most important one people told me the transfers wremember each tripe at its territory if you were from a certain village in the north you were most likely calanga if you were from the central district probably bangua to they figured why not make all civil servants moved to a different tribl area from their own for a few years there would make sure that their teachers and doctors everywhere in the country but also it would force people to mikes it would be an anti tribalism too when you move people around you ar in devore tly forseing and then to take that catat in that new home sheald up the new canta anyvin to col that ho you forseing ali is ino and te that for sin friendships can you force friendships does that kind of thing work the transfers affected every one working for the government by far the lartest employ in the country andgineers administrate us doctors nurses and most of all teachers when i was in botuana i talke to twenty teachers to find out if this works and what it is for the people going through it i'm going to tell you the story of one of the teachers a woman named caroll rammele atsana in a way caroll's story is typical of what i found but she also stood out to me i'll tell you why in a minute thet is as would always ask you what do you want to vo when you wi you grow up alta i want to be at ich i you maam caroll told me she became a teacher for the reasons a lot of people do she liked the one she had a a kid this lady was a lady who always every one n when she gets to school she wlok as that i as she would not showted as if you did not come

to think that this could be the real secret to hit might actually work people fall in love for carol after she met tabo everything changed i i as tat a living then the place hohow did e change and how did at change he know you have some one in the village he is you by friend he moves that oun show youtin in the village you ten't to love it the the place what did you discoverabout place before you

people i love them i love them she became friends with the owner of the smelly bar she cooked for the socratine she was invited to be a jhudged in a beauty contest which is kind of a big deal in the village she went to weddings and funerals there was even a woman who gave her a piece of land i ave buit a housetey no we am talling you no series the former education minister unity doll she says what carol experience is actually pretty common and a big part of the programme success what happens when he put we people around maybe eighty percent will come back to ints day they cud marriage i its a mass of stating programm wi i do novesin me havin a e governments conceretating thing li is people go some place they fall in love fastaphon would not say that you joke but the truth is at just i nature of how he meants move and a the aclematize and conos arms o a few years after she had moved to the village caroll finally felt at hom she had built that house her relationship with tabo was going qrat caroll was taking oranges to glass again she did still bring her hand back antd her heels to class every day in fact one of the women who teased her about it a sience teacher she started bringing her handback too caroll was still a little bit of a snop about the locals but over all she was as happy here as she had been in the city but there is something i have not told you about the transfer programme hou do not just get transferred once for teachers it is every five years sometimes a little less sometimes a little more one day the school had called us it was a lady she told us that one of you as togo there were five teachers teaching religious education one too many we as to what kinded i wituse she busigalisid we ever came fiste would be the ont to go and definitely i knew it was me i think for about for fife manda was waiting for the letta newin that any time i would be going that that must be frustrating i mean now you there people intimately ye and then that you have to start from the bottom yes and you have tis little forestrisin ye it is es at is at is first ritin at is first reting a lot on the other hand if it were not for the transfer programm she would not have me tabo are you a ye ye wheren i shep and we are plening to get merit oh ter is am te i prom me this was desember last year they had been together for fifteen years at that point survived three transfers tabo had never moved with her as a soldier he was also told but the government were to work but then a couple of month after the interview i was texting with caroll and she told me she had broke up with tabo just before the wedding she had found out that he was having an affair do you blame the transfer programm for the end of youer relationship with tabo at all sometimes not really a pensence mentality s not you be blamting on any a known the government i dont but if if it was not for the transfer a grogramm you would have been able to stay with him maybe and maybe anoye mayme icnly ye all the teachers i talked to fon the transfer thing mostly annoying some of them foundit disruptive that at some point they considered quitting a there was this one guy after being transferred he fell in low much carol he had a kit ut then he was transfered again and again and again he worked in seven schools he had four kits with four women and he was single again when i talkd to him he blamed the transfers and himself recently the government has made some changes they now allow married people to move together theyve tried to reunite couples whove been split up they also low swaps if you find another teacher across the country who is willing to swich jops they usually agree yes they tried to make things a little easier but still this policyes suppose to be intrusive that is the idea all the officials i talked to acknowledge the hardships at causes and all of them tood buy it yes it was sometimes bed for individual people but it was good for the people us a whole in fact they say it is a big reason why they are ao he effect of the transfers has never been systematically analyzed there is no study and wats one had other things going for it tat help them unifi there was less of a colonial legacy to overcome the british had kind of ignored the country and ruted from neighbouring south africa and patsona an act that those loss that prevented any one crud from getting rich of the countryes dim and wealth but the officials i talk to were convinced the transfers were escential they help make their country drawn on a map fifty years ago in to a unified nation one that has never seen war one that is the least corrupt country in africa and one of africas best working democracies and you connomy from the mid sixties t the mid nineties but'son had the fasters growing economy in the world not they united states not emerghing china bhat'suana it works miracls this is the precident of poazuana maguitzi mas sesy i had the chance to speak to him a few weeks aco in the same way as aly on when egkys system was still in its nascin stages we had body school you had people from this patthe country going over here and there and people married from mevery way and at what is fors i asked if some version of this might work elsewhere in the us another countries tat o divided it could be a fix but an an i do not really want to comming too deeply about the issues of another nation state a e ou do not sand wy at do hav us athey may just copy us cobe from us it is hard to imagine the s shipping teachers from new york city to red states and bice werse if you attempted this with teachers in germany wel if you would probably have rides on your hands but we could try something to get different kinds of peoplet talking to each other face to face everybody i spoke with in butzuana told me the transfer prokram works and everything i found in my reporking suggestsed wrks but i also got a climpse of its limits one day i gave a woman aride a young french teacher we set in the car waiting for the rain to pass and she talked about her family a family of teachers a family shaped by trancs fors my father was the teacher and he was posted in another area my mother was a teaching che was posted another he got on did i since noty business as she got upset and left but then i grew up knowing that that the teacher is my father by my father with someone else another village somewhere in another tri innesence my mother raised me as a mozana and i motzuana in other words a batzuana i hate that question because which which qess omoga omoga her what does i mean what is your tribe oh hi ki gi was your home village and is that ha very common question it is a very common question every one will ask you that i wheever you go that is the first thing people ask you omogay omoga whatsai gaghai e ger ame i do not that am just a mozana at does not matter where i come from does not matter where my village is te mozana and and that is not just an answer to shut the people up its it is it is you what you really feel s how i feel i do not i do not understand why we have to always identify with our tribes do you realize that this is likted in e notshal tat the bozuana story really o i do not you think i i yest now you given me that hamoment fore d you i am sin mocusho se he at at all thench he stolted listing th botzuana tribes gala gat calaci the caa latde it the we agt distributed all over the country and we all one thank you to the tenset it w yes it has worked here is a woman who first and foremost identifies u spozuana we has not spoken her native language in years but also it has not worked not all the way i mean they tried the most herratical thing that i've found in my yeaso reporting on this they did not fot decates they moved hundreds of thousands of people around but still the question ess being asked what is your tribe mostan bena is a report ef wor esite if you speak german he has a book about all this called in german

tdemocratic club mere boodygige was matner of fact it took me a second to register just how wild wat he was saying us than at one of the oldest largest most important democratic clubs in his home town half the leadership had voted for donald trump in twenty sixteen o e du in other words it was in the tiny world of this one bar you had with the entire democratic parties going through in some keep places the midwest a bunch of democrats deserted and the democrats los and the rest are left trying to figure it out are they man at those peoplea sure and they win those people bact what the hack is ging a happin with those peopleso a little while ago i went to the clay democratic club to see how this was all workyg out there the clay democratic crub it sort in american legion hall cross with th bingo hall cross with the neighbourhood bar pool costedala twenty five beers are t fifty because it is a private club you can smoke which is a well exercise right there is a stage in the back for drawings bans curioky night as i kid from wisconsin i would say it is pretty much everything a bar shed be behind the stage there is the club's logo a red and blue donkey with the name clay democratic club over it there is tables that the club moves around depending on whats happening and at the bar their regulars who always seemed to be in the same spots regardless of what happening every time i stopped in it was marty on the right end of the bar thending in the middle and then down at the far left end of the bar libs lismc hombes the nights of electians they will be packed on here bans and food it is a huge event on here this whole thing started liss told me on the eve of indiana's last presidential primary may second twenty sixteen this was a monday night donal trump was in town he was holding big rally in south bend just a few miles south of the bar headed on all the bars t ves sey are just hours away critical vot an india everyone is watching the coverage of trump on the bars t vs drinking there was a lot of off hat comrants and things that because we are democrats wedefily wanted do for lack about or words just the repolicans and trump and then it was over the rally ended when the rally was let now and they had it on the news the eleven ofclock news and somebody' sat all my got that is rost and it was right there on the t v in the crowd streaming out of the trump rally was this guy that everybody in the bar recognized a guiname rust thomas every one recognized rust because he was a long time member of the clay democratic club but on top of that rust thomas was the sitting president of the clay democratic club and then everybody can i he blot they were all all al s but i must say it oh da and al shock and all whoi called rust to hear his version of all this russ i'll say is gruff but nighct he is real connoissuer of short answers what is it that convinced you to support president trump i just him but were there policies or certain issues i just him he did have more than that to say about the rally though mainly that he was completely and totally on apologetic if you had known thet people at the club were watching t v that night and they were seeing you on on t v farteknowner wachin anr b had a banner russes here at wae down rig nr yes russ as the ralley was exciting he went there with the buddy that night another democrat turned trump sa porter it was not easy rust has problems with his legs and by his account can hardly walk his friend could not use one foot because e dibevs but they willed themselves through the walk to southben's convention entr and then they stood an waited until donald trump made his entrance to the rolling stones start me out find facing the the present were where were you in the rood he is ak rightoweer rust points indicating he was in the back back towards the back riht corner of the rooms dan back under back wall back ers and but we had such incredible crowds look at this rum as s example right into the corners people hallo corner how far away were i crow ofs a host toeo the wall pretty far in the back as osson relar cract or nonalso indian as primary comes pretty late in the crocess others but that night trump was on the verge of effectively locking up the republican nomination and he told rus and his body and the crowd there that there votes the next day could put him over the tie and the at is becoming very importantusually by this time it is over a then out does it bat but this time you folks belong wa you belog it is called the porti fel ra i la of course that night in important bell not every one was feeling great about stub specifically the patrons of one democratic bar who would been watching tv anger embarrassmet utrage there was people that were raging agan lismc combes long time clay democratic club member it it was e it was every of motion cause you felt the rog had bet ripped out underneath your feet it was the wizzard of oz you really a repoblic ad ru a democratic club never mind was behind that curt it was exactly the wizzer of oz anon n it probably seems rest could not hade been more busted bat he was the head of the saint joseph county democratic party that is the county wore south bendis the head of the entire democratic party at that time was a guiname jason cric club jason was outside the trump ralley that night hi's checking out the trump supporters and then what happene he looks across the street he told me who do i see it is russ fucking thomas he was i i think he was warin a hat he was it was one of those things fore it was'n an accident he was his walkang long the side walk it was obvious tis due was going ind to the rehality and was a trump supporter jason was i'm the county party chair this kind of a weird thing for me to get mixed up in but also connof too big of a deal to just let go hou non toy how much o a fight do i want a pick over something and this is their club it is their rules not knowing what to do jason started calling and texting a small group of people who he knows go to the club eventually he gets the dan hardman former president of the clay democratic clu yesed me what is going on i told hiu missur jason i do not know i'm that an off stur to club any more dan hardman is everything about the clay democratic club turned into a person his life seems to rhime with everything about the place dan was born in south bend nineteen forty six same years the club in the beginning the founders did not haven of money for a building they just pord a basemen and put a roof on it some of dan's early memories are being a little kid running around on the low slung roof of that basement building while he adelts were down stairs on the club dan was a member for years eventually became vice president dan was present for seven years before rest came in for anything bad to happen down here gon as affected me emotionally begus i've got such strong feeling for the membership and the club i mi desire to have this club sucsheeded just he meant the hulongas om iu in athin goes wronl his club its i feel it is part of me and moston offsters lately feel that way and and that is the way the offsters of the club should feel the club is part of im an and o i do not meet your life revolved around it but close tois every one at the club seems to lobe dan which is easy he is not a big guy but he seems big because he outgoing his grandfather of sixteen retired team ster drov a truck for years army veteran he is got this completely balld head an a long greay gotee when dan got the call from jason about rest hit was the first he would heard of any of this dan was reeling what woad do you feel in mean to presender your club you dever cratic club is shane at a rally tor a republican candidate for president what do you doing do a me your put put n black mark on our party on our club dan who known rust for years endid at being the one to have to call him to see what this was about i confronted him about it a why did you do that rust i because i believe in the the man i'm im i ige support trump sham not republica obliged support trump i should you are the president of the democratic club in your doing that till your democratic party it does not look very good rust i mean you go to sid at home watch on tther any other vanu he soi that is my right to do that my i should of can appreciate that you have your right to do whatever we want to do i did not rac hall or anything that good does not get you hr at the club meeting tha soon followed dan asked every one to quot not crucified their friend for his beliefs i right away they want to kick him out of the club right away they on de tard feather the poor gucan running off well it was not me what it was all ther peopll stating he is gone he is done or not again lis mc combes lis says she was friends with rust still is friends with rust but she says most people at least the ones that spoke up at this meeting drew a hard line about what he did this democratic club we are old yellow dogs and what that means as i rather vol for ald yellow dog that a republican they just lable as a turn col and that was it it was i possible it was hethere was just no way that he could even function as president day no you lie tot everybody wo there is no he jus he did not understand what his position met and how much it mut rest resigned his presiden a couple people told me he was not doing that good ma jab anyway rus denies that the only thing rust would say is that it was quot personel no matter how many times i asked that is what he said whut i do know rust ubmittedn a very sistinct letter of resignation shortly after the incident at the rally no reasons just that he was stepping down as president of the clay democratic club dan hardman came back for another term li geft y are but what makes all of this complicated is that rust quit as president but he kept coming into the club because it the great bar fol of people he knows and because rust still considers himself a democrat previously now in the future he says he just likes trump his o mokene dona good jon ia're not fatin i us thing about him tha deve bragon oh is that right did you you voted for ragon r would it do you feel there is a couple times in your life when for the most part you have been a democrat but there is been a few times in your life that he said i'm gun for the republican in this case i fun mi tick at everyer eery e rebot i still bo som democrat i will not on bonas first year at this point it seems it became clear that the rest tim as situation was not just going to be about rust when rustted thus it split everybody apart because you are either a democrat or you are not lismc combe says things changed at the club in the months that followed when dan hardman came back as president he told rust if he was going to keep coming in he d to be tactful about his support for trump but dan also made sure russ knew that he was still welcomep and rus continued to do some of the things he would always done run carryoki at the club on friday nights which is how carryoki night turned into a time for people at the club to choose sides you had people got in for rus that is true and then you had russ opporters which i get it is freedom of speech you are allow that in you'r alowd to do whatever you wat and that that is part of the constitution and on thankful everyday we have that that is fighne an everybody's regular alife but what did those people do when they would come down how often would it happen that people would stir up trouble sort of it seem every week and because russ was doing the carryoki and it seem there was a fight every friday night every time he fight somebody would just start yelling and being out o control because he was up on stage doing the carryoki he catimate himself the trarget wake would it go both ways would it be he would run the carryokin night and somebody would yell something at him they would heckleham about what id happen absolutely and then there were people that felt sorry for him begaune they would defend him yes because he is an aging man and the're uneducated and they did not understand what he did rus estimates that maybe ten per cent of the club's members president trump others said the same thing but most of the trump supporters keep it quiet most though definitely not all another contingent increasingly came into the club spoiling for a fight looking to mix it up dan hardman and lismac chombes and a number of others say the loudest was agotting mike powl he would pound his fist on the bar trump trump trump trump trump rus mike's a life long democrat member of the club for years who decided to support trump dan hardman told me mike would come into his office at the club and tried to convince dan to defact he had again here is liz why would you come to a democratic club to be a trumper when you say that he would pound his fist on the bar and say traru i that is what he would say tromp tromp trump literally and that is catahaw the trumpers are that is exactly how mike pawl behaves surprisingly and unsurprisingly mike powl sees this whole situation differently mike's account he has not gone looking for fights about trump in fact he feels if anything spend the other way round madebody old toi pul i somebody shut stone mex to me n stort cuttin down trump i'll sa you your trumki the rold gie he rogi talk over ther the gs somethimes are you man well thete was a blow up over the situation at a board meeting at the club hen they discuss rest his support for trump and the impact it was having according to a few accounts i've heard some one a long time democrats stood up and he said some version of half the board did not even vote democratic club president dan hardman shot back saying that was in true though i guess that comment about half the board is what produced the story that spread through democratic circles and eventually made its way to mare buddhagidge at this meeting mike powl told me he got called out as a trumpsipporter to which he yelled back it is none of your business how i voted mike told me a staunched democrat started shouting at mike's wife who was the club's financial secretary he is pointing a finger in her face mike told me he went up to the guy after the meeting and told him if he pointed a finger in his wife's face again he breake it off and shoveed up his ass danhardman says he is done what he could to limit the damage an stories this circulated he wrote in the news letter telling people not to believe everything they heard making it clear that it was a democratic club for democrats dan' told me leading up to all this membership of the club had already been to clining but all this strife they made it worse we went down from from nearly a thousand members to write now were we are looking maybe three hundred any and and that membership iis hard to to keep together because we cen os you we cannot get people to come down because se they they think that we turned our our backs all he means democrats did not think the club was really for democrats any more and the there are someth the i hovn't see them oh i through yours that must have been difficult to go through with a a club that you woulde been running and that you built over the course a years all it was heartbreaking it was really heartbreakings i do not know i do not know why they do not come back mike an rus the more they have come under attack from the democratic friends the more they have thought the company of those who agree with them rest told me these days he is relying almost entirely on foks news both guys read a lot of conservative stuff that they get from other trump supporters on the internen democrats want open borders president obama wanted one world government mike said he does not want muslims in our government that scares the tar out of me he said as both of them what the democrats might do to win them back if that was even possible rest said maybe for twenty twenty four but i'm sticking with trump mike told me he some of what he heard from tulsy gabbard and amy clob bashare but really it was pretty unlikely what do you think the democrats do not understand about somebody you or somebody rus wo identified for a long time as a democrat and then they and then they left for trumk i dan't think they cere they in this to deel they hamppen in genda in tee do not cere what we think any more i mean everything is about ou legols and and the poor everything else they do not care about ah o any more they tis do not it is just we are arolvit you do not you shout about us if there was a democratic politician though and you felt that is somebody who cares about a guy ma that is a big tou that is the kind of thing they could get you back that is huge yes a ou are not just what trunk does but it is about feelin your manr you knowy mean if you think somebdy do not give a crat about you what isthe matter youre inn't got towards somebothe care somebody youn't think thinks sho matter that is that is that is about a lie what apout us there is a certain sketsofrania to rest in mikes politics these days even though they support president trump ther bigest concern still do seemed to be traditionally democratic pauses rest says he is concern about health care and if someboy could present a plan to get everybody covered he before that mike also werris about health care and the cost of prescription drugs and about the quality of public education in america they both told me the story of the democratic party they were loyal to that they still love was the story of a party that was for the little guy and against the big guy i told them i think many of the democrats running now stil talk about the party that way and they are making proposals to do things that both men say they want but whatever the story the democrats are telling russ and mi do not see themselves in it the one part of the democrat's message that seems to be getting through to rest and mike it is just how badly they all want to get rid of trump which just makes them wanto ofend him one democrat whos had to come up with the strategy for how to deal with the resses and mikes of the world its club president dan hardman and his strategy could pretty much be boiled down to let us just all tredit chill outsom go easy on each other maybe have a beer rus is int interested in hearing for many democratic politicians right now but he also made a point of telling me about this thing the dan did for him after all this went down rest lost his wife caroll earlier this year hey been together since high school after she died ruscot really depressed in the middle of that dant organize the dinner for him and he held it at the democratic club russis that that meant much to him and there is one democrat i know for a fact rest respects that he listens to nthat he likes it is a guy who keeps letting him know he is welcome to sit with him at the bar regardless of whose in the white house ol tan alon is one of the producers of our she aoe s oth to ragraaara aa e o mus produs to day by sou he chase

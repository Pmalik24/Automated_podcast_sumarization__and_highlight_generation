another day another law suit this time looking into elon musqu it appears that if you are an enemy of the prevailing regime they will come after you with all of the elements at their disposableif youare if youare donal trump they will come after you with the federal government with various state in local governments tey will come after you because you have become an enemy of the regime in donal trump said and he is not in correct that fort thirty forty years he was in the american public lie one of tose famous people on earth there ware no prosecutions and then he leaves the presidency and boom within three years that there are four prosecutions all to be hitting within an election year an that leaves aside the civil suits that of all arisen in the last two years that does moseime a coincidence nowy can always attribute that to his behavior on genuary six lare between november and january but the reality remains the domaltrum hes pretty wild and crazy character well before that nwhen it comes to some of the supposed financial crimes that he is now being accused of those financial issues were well known for a very long time yet he never found himself in the dock he never found himself in front of the public this way whill elon musk is in the same boat now sa in last month there've been two in vestigations by the federal government launched in to companies related to elon musk just last week the justice department sued space acts for discriminating against asi leas and refugeees an hiring claiming that spasex had to hier more people who had claimes asylum tpeoplewho claimd refuge status in the united states despite the facthat as elon musk claims spasax has national security contracts thet means that they have very high standards for security and they wr sort of damned if they did an damned if they did not if they started hiring people who are claming asylum or refuge status hend then it turns out on most people ore security risk they could lose their security clarence and presumably hundreds of millins o dollars and contracts and if it did not hire those people then the do j would su them and that is exactly what happened last week ac cording to assistants to turning generl criston clark of the oj civil rights division our in vestigation found that spacexs failed tho fairly consider or hier asi leasand refugees because of their citizenship status tan imposed what amounted to a ban on their hie regardless of their qalification and violation of federal law our in vestigation also found that spasexs recruiters and highlevel officials took actions that actively discouraged o sileas and refugeees from seeking work opportunities at the company asi leasand refugeees have overcome many obstacles in their lives and on lawful employment iscrimination based on their citizenship stati shuld not be one of them this looks a put up jobjs from the outsete loilok a put up job directed at elon musk and now one week later we are learning that prosecutors are now investigating tesla for use of funs on a project described internally as a house for le elon musk according tothe losstr journal man hattan federal proscutors are investigating testlas use of company funs on a secret project that had been described internally as a house for elon musk the us attorney's office for estyon why has sought information bout personal benefits paid to msk how much tesless spense on the project which called for a spacious glass structure to be built in austin texas and what it was for the waster jornal was the first report intualy that tessleboard members had investigated whether company resources were miss used on the secret effort known internally as project forty two and wether musklass personally involved the outcome of testles internal investigation cannot be learned the es c has also open a civil investigation into project forty two and is seeking similar information from the company according to one of those peoples well here' that thing the esian why and es c investigations there still in their early statios they might not lead to formal allegations of wrongdon yet magically all thes founits way into the newspaper why look at dat all of it is on the frontpage the wolster journal to day tesla did not response orequest for comments on the story spokesman for the es c and manhattn es attorney's office to clinedto commen employes were working on project forty two last year plans called for glass building to be erected near the automakers austin area head quarters atd one point the bilding was invition in the shape of a twisted hexigon other images showed an expans of glass box that appeared to include a resodunchal area the status of the project an whether glass was ever delivered teslat could not be learned federal proscutors are nou seeking information also about the driving range of tesla's electric vehicles wroiters is reporting that tessla had inflated the projected distns its vehicles could travel on a single battery charge it just seems all of the re sources of the federal investigative authorities are being unleased at ulon musk now why is that just a few years go elon musk was everybody's darling elon musk had early mark' zukerberg status elon musk las the most creative man in the world one ofte great innovators and then he bought twitter and hen it turns out that he has sort of rightish libertarian political leanings and this cannot be allowed elon musk stepped into the hornet's nest and the hornet's nest is now stinging him that is what it appears to anylon from the outside because again nothing for years with regard to elon musk and then magically the year before the election two separate investigations into eulon musks companies wonit is basex won it tessla either you believe that uon musk suddenly started being corrupt and terrible or you believe that thei are people who actually would to se lon mus takin out or leas minamized in terms of his public abilities whent when people on the right are worried about lawfare when they are woriedabout the militorization of law enforcemen resources the d o j local attorney's offices against right wingers this is one of the reasons why in i've set on the program publicly for years i overpay my taxasa over pay my taxis specifically because i suspect that this is alwaysben the caseon that it will always be the case that if there some one in power who does not you there is absolutely the possibility that they an ubcoming after you the problem of course is that it is the exactly the sort of activity that destroys all faith in our institutions in f we do not have our institutions an common then we cannot have a functioning system here in the united states nowthis bleding its way over not jus from

now being contemplated with regard to primary and general elections and donal trump according to the mur times new hampsturs first in the nation primary is quickly becoming the leading edge for an unproven legal theory that donald trump is disqualified from a puring on the ballot under the fourteenth amendment to the us constitution a long chok presidential candidate has filed the lawsuit in state court seeking an injunction to keep trump off the ballo a formal republican candidate for sentat is urging the secretary of state to bring a case that could put the issue before the o supreme court on wednesday free speech for the people a liberal leaning group that unsuccessfully tried to strike house republicans from the ballot in twenty twenty two sent a letter to secretaryes of state in new hampturas whiles flortin to mexco ohio in wis consin urging them to bar trump from the ballot under the forteenth menment tho outfortar im ploying a theory that has been getting traction among liberals and ant ha tfrom conservatives that trumps actions on ganuary sixth twenty twenty one tisqualify him under section three of the fourteenth amendment which pars people from holding office if they tok an oath to support the constitution and then later quot engaged an insurrection or rebellion against the same well normally you would have thave a conviction for something that orsay you sworn oath to a forn power the confederate states of america right that might be good evidence that you shuld be barred from he ballot that is literally why the lall was written that is why section thre of the fourteenth amendment exists it does not exist to do a last secretaryes of state to simply to clar somebody an enemy of the republic and then bar him from the ballot according to the yor times the theory as been gettig lomentum since suprominent conservative law professors publish an article this month concluding trumpets constitutionally dis qualified from running for office well the left whisch is to appeal tis oltoway to thupreme court why because of the supreme court rules in from favor then they will jistclaim that the supreme cort is stacked on behalf of donal trump under my ning the credibility of that institution and again this is now being considered by multiral secretaries of state not just in the primaries bhun the general election as well according to national review a recent articl publish in the pensylvania lawe of yiou from the federalos societies william bowed and michael stokes palson argues that trump has been disqualified from accis to the presidential ballot re based on their reading of the fourteen the mendmen the authors believe that their theory is self executing by which they manua selection officials do not need to see permission or special authority to bar trum from the ballad indeed their oaths oblige them not to donal trum mad the case that migtpense could unilaterally disqualifie states certified state votes in the two thousand twenty election tnous a specious theory this theory is that secretaries of state can simply deside without any reference point without any legal case without any actual conviction bithout any charges being filed theoretically that somebody has violated this element of the constitution and therefore can be barred constitutionally from appearing on the ballat this is pretty crazy stuff obviously n you arnt tug about underminding faith an elections this would do it you on constitutional crisis have ot when a secretary of state insate arizona tesides that donal trump cannot be on the ballat and then that goes to the supreme court and then thesrimcourt strikes that down that is a constitutional crisis because of that point you have a state acting within its own perview but violating basic precepts of constitutional order theing struck down by supreme court on which three members were appointed by the person who is at issue the left will claim that it is lawfare the rightwill claim that it is lawfare mean this is where we are headed it is really really ugly and s what we now have is a bizar situation in which the left claims that becuses the right is cuonquant insurrectionary they can use the law in extra legal ways that is what is effectively happening right here this is why the use of the lawts glufter trump over a bunch of nonsense intay manhatton is devastating to rule of law a politico today has the new york a g claiming that donal trump fraudulently in flated his notworth by as much as two point two billion dollars per year the new estimates came in filings from the york state atturning general's office which is suing trump some of his adult children and his business empire for falsifying his not worth in an effort to obtain at favorable terms from banks and ansurance company that trial is said to be in on october second now one of the things that is pretty obvious here is that none of those company is are actually suing trump is a criminal prosecution that are a civil trial that is being brought to beare by the state on behalf in turns companies who are not suing him again lawfare being used to go after donal trump and what youre getting here is a self perpetuating cycle where the left seese the right as inherently evil and dangerous an insurrectionist then we must use the legal abilities that aure disposal to go after them we must use the geocated gluf for elan musk that is a dangerous character that o maght alow things on woter that we do not an if those things are allowed on twitter then donal trump might win an election or dobide might lose an election we better use whatever legal methods we haveat our disposal to go after backeye donal trump superdangerous that means hatwe have to ac tivates secretaries of state to do things thatare pretty illegal but they have sort of the pettina of legality to them in order to accomplish wht we waw and e we really really hate donal trups or one one thngs we have to do as we have to go after im on speecious bullcrap charges in new york its it is it is morally mandated because the right is dangerous and reactionary and insurrectioniss and the natural responds from the right is well ocaso youre doing extra legal things with the law which means they are acting illegally which justifies us in going outside the law to do things a mean every revolution starts of the claim that the power is that be aret engaging extra legal activity under color of law it there is every revolution now i'm not calling for that revolution i think that there is a a weapons down here but this is what we are quickly spiraling toards weare quickly spireling towards te belief on the part of the right that the left his mili torise the entire justice departments of the united states as well as the lot of local justicse departments secretaries of states offics an all the rest against the rights and therefore the right is justified in doing whatever it can to stop that and then the left looks at that they say what ar you gots dohn you doing all the stuff that is extra legal ell that justifies us in stopping you no matter what it takes with or without the law it is a self perpetuating cycl and the is something even worse about this which is that the positions reverse themselves depending on the circumstance ill get to that in just one second first everbody knows it let my helik sleep mattress is youknow that just launch their newest most high ind collection he lick leet i got tpe i'dn't apreciate my helik sleep mattress e nough and i prechat a lot until last night's last night mi daughter came down who ont ofthree fever which men is sleeping in her room ou nout i could not take with me my helick sleep mattress as its in my room sune that i was on the floow on a yoga mat sleeping next to my daughter to make sure that she was oka let me tell a not a great sleep quality helick's mattres you need it it is great helic's elet includes six different mattress models each kilor for specific sleep positions and from tis preferences i've had my helick's mattress for seven eight years this point it is great if you nervous about buying matres on mon yont have to be heliks has a sleep quits that mattres your body type and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress why would you buy mattress made for somebody else i tok tat helicks quis ous matt or the firm but breathable mattress go to helic's sleep dot comslesh men take ter to men ute sleep qoas find the perfect mattress fo your body and sleep type your mattre'll come directly to your dorship for free pluss helik has a ten yor warrent to you get to tried out for a hundred nights risk free ne'll even pick it up for you ifyoudoft lof it but you will heliks has over twelve thousand five star reviews theyre find nancing options and flexiblel payment plans make itswill great night sleep is never far away in honor of labor day helik is offering twenty five pressents off all mattress ores and two free pillows frunalessers go to helic sleep dot comslesh men yeuse cot helic's partner twenty five it is the best offer yet he will not last long with helick's better sleep starts right now ogay when i say the situations can reverses i mean that the natural dynamic right now is that the left because it is in controll of the law i's using the law is a weapon and the right because it is not in control of the law is bucking the law right that seems to be the generalized perception et's you feed on each other the rght is bucking the loss lefts as we have to use the law andthen the rghts as left is using the loss we have to buck the law such a complete cycl but here is the thing here is t w that it is not just a battle over institutional credibility at the left wants to say is the right they are not the're not being extra legal because we are misusing the law they are being extra legal because they do not care about the law they are ben extra legal because the law does not matter to them at all the laws the institutions that they wanto tear down the institutions they are the ones are destructive forces in american life we are here standing for the institutions but we know that is not true because when the left is not in control of illegal body they attack the legal body with just as much lacrity as they weredefending it literally one second ago for example donal trump yesterday he was on with ebly glen back and that yeu was aske about proscuing democrats is president and he said well yah i mean their prosecuting me here is what a town you said in in twenty sixteen a locker up and then when you became presenet you said we do not do that in america that is jus not the right thing to do that is what they are doing do you regret not locking her up and if you are president again will you lock people lup we gi inexample i the av e e i e doing it at i always hat e e eeee oei the president e presidentte and at tat the ofti e te president and i never i i e harte i culd have and en i eu a on t e and wit him that wis doing it ye i do not think yot ta te think about much ogay the entire left when insane tonal trump pledging to lock up his political opponents and he nowd be crazy if yeu wins the office andten he uses the gojais who weaponized the oja against his political opponents that is just terrible that is unthinkable and we would have to resort to extra legal means to stop all of that we would have to do someout in the street to man riots we would have to stop that thing because the tyrant would be taking over twhat he exactly do you think that the wright is arguing right now about yobiden and his meri and mericarlands deojag they'e coning sweetheart deals with jobidan son sweet ardeals that are sweethardish that he judge literally saw it blanched and was note not interested andtheyhad to go back to the drawing board meanwhile they are going after trump for every jot and tentl including charges the do not even fit when it comes o the ganuor sixth case they'r letting hillery clittenoughsgot free but they are going after nonal trump and lan forcemen is good right now for the left but if don trump takes over lawnforcement immediately comes bad the geoja turns into a weaponized evil law inforcement than must be bucke it every opportunity and then the positions reverse then it is the left thits insurrectionist against the institutions and the rght that is defending the institutions as as viable and durable and necessary yeu can see it to day an politico entire opinion piece from errand tang a law professor a you se davis and a former lawclerk to sonia to mayor yas a bestittle the supreme court is infected with the most damaging human byus he says the biggest prob it the partisanship dignosist is that the sprimcourt has alwaysbeen part of the politics not about it most important yofve justice in our history john marshal is a federalis party operative these historical periods o just that if partisanship alone were enough to torpedo public legitimacy the supreme court never would have risens wois prominent place in american society what really is different and dangerous about today's justice it is not partisanship bhe rather a cognant of trap then nobell prizewenningpsychologist danuel conmen is called the most damaging of all human biaces over confidence put simply to day's justice is possess a frightening degree of certainty they alone can answer society's most pressing probs with just the right laowyelly arguments or now you have the left than on argument tat the right always made for generations the arument the right made was who gave the supreme court the power to simply declare abortion on demand the law of the land who give hem the power to do that who give the supreme court the power to simply declare that game marriage was the law of the land an shrine in the american constitution who gave them the power to do that they ren overed him that power now the left is making exactly the same arguments tabout the people we are on the sprime court now now leve claim that this was underminding legitimacy the upreme court that if you if you said roversuuated in illegitimate decition because it is if you said that base not on your dis respect for the court round your respect for the rule of law if you said that they claimed your basically an insurrectionist you are trying to overthrow the the legitimacy of thesuprime court and undermine it is credibility then the constituents y of the court shifts and the the positions entirely flip they entirely flip what is that mean it means that basically the only thng that matters is who controls the various institutions it is all just a power gane it isall just ta pawrgan now this is really dangerous territory it is really dangerous territory because what it suggests its that if you lose an election ad if the only thing thet matters it is who controls the government and that you automatically believe the institution is illegitimateif the other party controls the government for example we do not have any institutions in common and it is only a question of how badly some one' to oxgeteds gord before thingstart to get really bloody and ugly and violent it is a syrious probains happening by the way all cross the lest is not unique to the united states in western countries all over the world there is now a feeling that is arising that because the institutions have failed hor because the institutions are weaponized by your political opposition the you can do whatever you want and th ndis tat by the wight thit is not a right left thing because the left will do the same thing as the right if they are out of power when the right is out when the right is in power in brazil it is tyranny afoot and insurrection in the streets is the only thing can stop yeaterables anarrow and when it is lula te solva in power and he is actively using the supreme court as his tool and and breaking the rule of law there then it is the rors thee the rght to saing its an insurrection the we have to be in the straigts an woeu roun of a choice once every election becomes a matter of tyranny versas liberty and there is no clear definition of these things things are about to get very very ugly the fight over institutions as it turns out is not over about institutional credibility no one respects the institutions right once the institution is only good if you are one in controll of it it is not a god institution any more if the police are only good if your friends are in the police and f somebody do not know in the police the police are bad now then you do not respect the police qua police just respect your friends if you arerespect for the american government is reliont on it being staff by people w'll gree with you what that really means that the peoplewho disagree with you are dangerous and out of bounds that the institution becomes fundamentally illegitimate because it is staff by those people which means we doft ave a prome with institutions in the united states wever prom with each other now irn'ni shoul believe that americans rit large hav prom with each other i think the eleets really ofe a prom with each other and i thik the're weaponizing institutions against each other for fun and profit i thing you go every day america and most americans they doft cabout the stuff thid just one a go about their daily business be left alone raise their families go to church go to teir work that is about it but they are people at the top whe have a real interest ins it in in essentially saying that if they l if your side loses the country is irrevocably broken and there we will not be for example another election and by the way it is bote the right left sangthes we going on the nestucions likhelyuhave the right saying that if jobine windsry election the countryes over and youhave the left saying that if don trumplinds re election the ountry is over that is not a good place to be in a second own get into what this what this sort of means how we can how can we get out of this connundrum this sort puzzle we have crinted for ourselves first went when you buy a house you look at the house you try to fix some things up boud and n paint job fix the doors whatever but there is something ou pobly nonthing about all that much an that is the stuff covering the windows an men that' suss been the forever would but how light flows into a house is a huge thing natural light is oneof the reasons that we bought our house for example ite also meant that we wanted to up grade the window coveringsand this wy we had it on over to blindstock com blindstot come is the umber one on mine retailor of custom window coverings with over forty thousand five stare of vieus ou can measure an in

labertay sail it is their biggast salever to fifty per cent right now a blindstock commweny check out on linet do not forgets telling you herd about blindstot com from the benship yerosho rules and restrictions may upply hayso what is this mean what is the future of te united states look wha first we have to fix the social fabric if we do not fix the social fabric the institutions are rrelevent institutions are usually only effective if they govern with lighthand when the social fabric fails institutions have to come in with a heavier hand and then they are not good at it andthe people get angry t each other and they blame the institutions for the actual failure of the social fabric generally institutions get tyrany grows as social fabric fails for to take an example the place for social fabric is the is the most durable the tightist is between you an the other members your familyt you generally do not need a third party arber ar coming in and is judicating fights beten you members infact you resent it if a third party arborer comes in an sarts messing around in your families business why as the social fab ric is tight well if things start to fall apart that iswhen you have to have or protective services show up or divorce lawyer show up and things are to get really ugly and the more theire involve the uglier they get now that is true on a socita level is well as we failed to get along with each other ore as we felt to respect each other as human beings we start calling in the big guys to come in in in force aure opinion with the gun this is why as societies fail institutions have to get more and more tyrrannical they do not really ave ic choice there two ways that societies go south with regard to societies an institution ind their interrelationship one is the way that i just described the social fabric decays and then the institutions follow you maken't argument that that is effectively what is happen in the united states that since the nineteen sixties with the rise of a radical left that overthrow the social compact than instead of saying we required change with in that boundaries of the social compacts have te entire social compact is corrupt and evil and nasty and a guise for power we have to throw it out that it was no longer a fight between j f cay liberals and neonian can servatives that now the fight was between revolutionaries thought the entire system as corrupt that er bermarcu's argument they t the basic itdea that all institutions including freedom of speech where actully guises for power that once that corrupted are institutions and took a couple generations to do it once those cinfuse throughout our institutions then the failures of the social fabric were made manifest people stop going to church which was thay social fabric builder people stopped believing one another and their arguments their arguments they started to think where actually just an excuse for you to do the thing you wanto do anyway ad when you would have a good faith argumen tere's no such thing as good faith argumen any more it was basely just accusations once that stuff made its wape to the institutions of course the institutions fails that is one way that societies fail that institutions fail after societies there is one other way and it is possible this also happen in the united states and that is that institutions can cause social fabric to decay how do institutions cause social fabric to decay well what what happens the leats in a society gain control of an institution and they decide it is time for world breaking change they have to centralize power that power is now going to be used in top down fashion in order to crowd out the social fabric because people ned to change and the curren social fabric that is created flaud people eget rid o that social fabric create we circumstances and the people will flourish and flower anew that sort of the case that marks ism makes is that people are petty and nasty to one another but if we live in a marks is utopia people be assums all we have to do is changed the superstructure and sudenly the people themselves change institutions captured byt eleats start to try to cram down change on people at the top level and in doing they must break down the social fabric it is necessary tbecause the social fabric are little platoons against that as hat been bork describe them now n a good functioning society uses the social fabric and and the little platoons within tht social fabric as the building blocks for a broader society a terrible society must in you topian fashion destroy all those building blocks level the earth and then build with whatever is left and that is effectively what you can make argument happen with american institution particular in the sixties the growth of government effectively crowded out religion it effectively crowded out the social fabric it it crowded out all f the connections tat you ave with your friends annouce all been filled by the government and then the social fabric fails and then the call from the government is whale the social fabric failing we need more government and the governmente fails at that but t still crowd out thef social fabric and out all all faith in institutions is lost whichover those arguments you accept one thing is for ciar true if what we have here is not a failure of institutions predominantly but a failure of the social fabric this can only be fixed at the local level through the rebuilding of the social fabric what that really means that w what we ought to be fighting for an it is funny because when you discuss this with rational members of the opposite political party many of them will agree i have this conversation open with anicasparian from the unturks for example and i got her to agree ins are broad strokes thet wha we really need to do wit the federal government is minimize it thet when you hae ae federal government that institutionall is incredibly powerful and everybody's just fighting over the power in order to use it against their po litical opponents this exasformates the collapse of the social fabric what you really need is local communities to be able to be local communities the what you cannot do is make the argument that the best form of american institution making is going to be done at the top level because it is not it is not by the way the founders understood this which is why they made the federal gvernment really weak comparatively speaking the federl government was very very weak not just even even after the transformation from the articles of confederations the constitution that is a weak federal government and the truth is that it it is only weak top down structures that it have been able to preside over large populations one of the great lies about empires for example is that empires ten to be incredibly ownerous that ten to be tranical the in your business all the time at the lowest level not durable ones they aret if yu'll get ta history of empires and the united states is an empire now i'm not room tungment a international empire just by any stretch of the imagination a government that governs three hundered and forty million people over ar the course of three thousand horizontal miles and another fifteen hundred vertical miles and in your talking about a land area in the united states that is continental in nature means enormous that would be by any stretch of the imagination an empire just domestically an empire i all the states of de countries theoretically and the united states would effectively be a domestic empire it is just o big ayrenot governing a tiny spates great britain or something and youenot governing homogenist spaces either the united states incredibly diverse ay the only way that that succeeds is if the top level is relatively light handed and every durable empire ever has actually had a relatively light hand of the top level the great lie about the roman empire for example is that te roman empire was unbelievably ownerius to people in the outskirts of the empire is not true the roman empire could be owneros if youreabut against them they wofre come ing their crush you with an iron heel but if you 're not rebelling against them thou're actualla relativelea decentralized the greay lie about the roman empire again as there is a highly centralized empire was not if you are living in the middle east for much of the time of the roman empire you are basically living under canave a local potent ate tvery often the romans were negotiating with you to appoint somebody who might be slightly friendlier to you and that is why the roman empire could last for hundreds of years if you look at at other less powerful empires for example the ostra hungarian mpire the ostro hungarian empire which start off to the hapsberg monarchy and was an empire that dominated in incredible amount of europe tthat the hapstro monarchy which launchisin the sixteenth century and then last the othe ostra hungarian empire all the way up to world were one the reason that it was able to to govern this amount of territory with this divers o population is becase it actualy had a very very light hand it was it was actually more visible by its absence than by its presents they had can ave unifined military uniforms in uts kina it we ther therere a lot of people inside the ostra hungarian empire arranging from jews to muslums to orthodox christians to calf legs to protestants and they are all living under the ostrangaran empire cs the ostro hungarian empire actually had a fairily o fairly decentralized approach to governments the same thing was true actually for a lot of the otoman empire the oom empire was connima lazy empire it iswhy by the time it died at in in world were one just after world were one is called the sick old man c assn't even capable of governing its own territory now lot ofpeople see that as a flaw but the reality is that the only way that you can retain any sort of centralization at all in a very very large space is either oppressive tyranny at high levels which cannot be done for long is what the ussus are wearned or you can have to have relative the centralization the probet is the united states ry now is notted the centralized empire the united states ry now domestically is a very very centralized empire wen we are spending seven trillian dollars a year we are engaged at the federal level in everything from how much whar you have n your toilets to which individuals should be put in jail that this is a very nonty centra and and to what that is doing is is exastrbating all of the social conflict that already royals under the surface it used to be the people in california nearlly care about what people in florida were doing an those people in floriden really care about what people in new york were don can lam that on social media or we can playmen on the fact thet virtually all policy making has now been elevated to the federal level and not only that a huge percentat o tat policy making is made by unelected beuric rats who are staffed through unofficial political patronage networks the only ato pcure that is to minimize that power the top level lhat people go back to doing exactly what they would to do in their own local communities that can only happen ironically if you have enough trust freer fellow american that you are willing to allow them to do that and if the answer to that is know it is hard to see how the country maintains that is why all the lawfare that were seeing right now is is incredibly dangerous me what we were a dangerous moment in the united states ust system systhemically speaking is a dangerous moment for the system of the united states is very few people have any baseline faith in the system itself which byway is again another irony becaue the fact is the system inself actually the cons two sional system as direct about t founders tactually justified itself in twenty twenty forall the talk about how americ was on the virg to being overthrown in twenty twenty by januaries six the rioters wio was not even closes it was not even remotely clothes the system prove itself unbelievably derable and the natural raction of left was the system is fragile here we hae to capture all aspects of it and mill trises it

ford president trump is focassing in on the stuff that you wonts to focastin on which is really his enemies inside the republican party yesterday he posted some thirty one times on truth social dozens of vidios ae us wen heigber with th camera and dom pretty much none of them were about jobidin as a president he made one viddu i think the twelvl of in to the twenty twenty four election and the rest of them were just attacking people on his own side which is not the way that you actually win an election as it turns out i'm for example donal trump spent yest erday fulminating onch with social about the evils of bill bar on fox news why dos fox news constantly put on slow thinking in thethargic bill bar who did not have the courage or stamina to fight the radica left learnatics while he ways the attorney general of the united states and who even more portly refused to fight election fraud of which ther was much he knew always going on just look at his past remarks unless fox news starts putting on the right people the radings will continue to a road it is his personal grievance after personal grievance o first of all calling bill barr in comwat things coling slow thinking is a weird one considering that he wents columbia in george washington in sch o cay then but that not just that fox news s apparently very cruel and terrible i he he then went out for ruper murdoc who was once one of his supporters fox news and the wallstree gournal fight me because murdoc is a globlis that is i rupert murdock is at loplist yo do not know that and i am america first it is very simple i put america first et will always be that way get used to it the sanctimoniis by the way is done he was a murdock pick just a je bush was a murdock pick hout of that work out just killeryt litton murdock tillery lan crooked hillery and athat was another pick of murdock now we are about america first and some people do not that the wall stree journal is totally lost its way can you feelows independent votors flying into the party hen feel it he fellows burden ladies who are now wiching their votes back from biding to its he down't trump because of these vigiots oh and also he had om notes about losing georgia a gent lasn't you want o pick the scy for nomenyn be it but i'm ust wenting out this will be the campaign you think this lhistls a successful general waching campaign who cay i easily on the great state of george in twenty sixteen did a fantastic gob as president for george and the attire you have say receive ten million more votes than i got nation wide and twenty sixteen got by for the most votes and history for i sitting president but shockingly lost georgia all this despite winning near by alabama and south carolina in record setting landelives why did georgi officials agree to sign that horrible one sided consenticry nobody to this day has figured that out does anybody really believe i lost georga because i do not o gay now i assume that he is also saying that be cause if he does not claim that he that he on georgia than he also loses his legal case in georgia entire basis for legal case in george s that he knew he wast and then manipulated the system to try and essentially steal the state if he continues to claim that he absolutly believes it maybe does ma be absot down'ts frum has uneed capacity to make himself believe nearly anything or it the very leas odn'thimg to care very much about whether it is true or whether it is not o kay far noff he is establishing motive in legal case there but i just im keep askingt because i want in answer from somebody how does this translatinto a general electro victory now again you can hope that jobiden just falls down on the job it is quike possible he goud why not but if that is lete you if you are playing a game where your best hopes that the other gui bastically dies that is not the best move the coul pob possibly make and again he is folksing all of his ir in the wrong places jobidon is busy being a terrible president how about that but noll worgan get more i here herizon from going aft for the quonqua pretenders to the throne the debat on foxters had a hard time with the proverbial ratings in ot televisionratings arents all about the ratings it was one of the lowest ever rated in terms of debates if not the lowest it showed that many of those participating are second teer they were second yor people people christy and people ata i callmata ata hutchesn and merely pretenders to the throne they just pretenders to the thron these aren' presidential people these are presidential talents yes the yes wer wore yes this this will win arizona georgia pennsylvania michigan was consin yep that that ra there by the way speaking of a losing arizona i'm old enough fremember because i am a more than eight years old i'm old enough remember a time when when when arizona was completely readet had a red governor and two red sentors now you may hav thought that the centers were squushes that is true jeff lake and john mican ware squushes the're lso better than cirston son motn markelly well apparently the arizon re publican party is a deciding that the thelma louise methodof electioneering is probably the best way to go now blake masters is going to run against carry lake is the new is the new idea for the geo pe senate race against cirston cinima grat the best that arizona can come up with furthe sentate race is going to be two of the three candidates who lost their last election cycles in arizona that is gright the in last election cycle we had cary loose for governors to catyhobs ay went to shrag an we had blake masters lose his race two mar kelly who is extremely vulnerable and now the two of them are gin ta face off for the opportunity to run against cirston cinima o goody goody gumdrops good that this seems this seems the sill go well by least we will feel good yelling at the wall probably and meanwhile speaking of things that that are quite terrible mitr ma conal froze up again it was actually it is getting quite frightening at this point he is any one years oll is the second time in the passmonh i that he froz up for thirty solid seconds whos speakings the media and a it is it is really harda wa herehy was you i is you here las thater ranin a reoway n fn fin foith a far o war o cade that is som that is awful to watch e lot of senators are a worrd about is personal health as they should be hea he then held calls with allies including my nordin but john thon conference church ohn borasso and center john cornan of texas of them are potential successors to mc conall is led to a spate of speculation over his health lot a talk about whether thes are some sort of brain problem or whether this parkinsons that is one of these speculations thats beeng put out because nobody seems particularly alarmed about this which means maybe hardhy has a prior diagnosis ironically jobidon is out they are saying i'll get in touch with him i mean honestly the i wish that the media dedicated one tenth the amount of true worry they have about mc conall to jobiden but were told the jobidon is verl and with it r woeway ii just heard lutery coming now wic is a frend i yo know not yo we noi o know yo ow we that tcas wo we and disa geis w we ms o go fren en i no tren on to o now we i a on noni don' know not to now ocas soem again the media basically suggested mc conall has to step down they think o taci ough to keep running for presidenat mc coals aty one thac is eighty i thoa down from he seventy eight at a certain point maybe we ought to get somebody who i is below retirement age to run for the presidency o cane meanwhile it turns out there are still people in this country who are a somewhat capable at their jobs ronasantis has been presiding or flord during hurricane idealia thank god hurricane ideal is seems to have done lest human damage then many of the prior hurricanes of its magnitude it is already passed on to georgias turning to a tropical storm i dissantis yesterday he was morning aluters he said basically guis your yearn floria you try looting after hurricane and on do at your own parelth there are reports of people trying to lut i down in steen hachy and i've told all of our person help the state level i o you you pretect people's property and and weare not in a tolerate any loting in the after math of the nastural disaster i made it just ridiculous that you would try to do something that on the heels of an almost category for hurricane hitting this community i'd also just remign petential loters that people you never know whit you are walking into people ov a right to defend their property i this part of florida you got a lot of advocates and uproponents of the second amendment and i've seen signs and different peoples yards in the past after these disasters and i would sats property here you lut we shoot this is the best oround a santis riwentman he is beeng governor this again why he would make a good president he is actually good at the actual jop he was asked by report about donal trump in the fact thet trump his spent effectively little brain power on theon the hurricane in florida he was used tweeting a lot piy alot of truth socials whartever to tancis however gives the proper answer which is why you ask me about this i'm busy being governor no my concern my con cern as protct an that beople of a floridaf being ready to go and nd we have done that and luck we idnin florita you you just have to do this om this is something we put a lot of time an effort in to throughout the course of of each year knowing that that there is gen a be time where youre can have to activated a that up happens to be an excellent response to all of this mean whilve left of courses is using this as excuse to talk about climate change cause what is not in excuse about climate change mean honestly s youwill have one note titterscon a keepsing it over anover here was drobidon yesterday claming that do because there is a hurricane no one can deny the climate crises any more which is weird since there are ben hurricanes for literally all documented history i leeach governor i spoke wit no i tis anything anything takes te ra now im really mobilize thats port indeed ido not be anybody can deny the a of the climate crase is any ortis took around stort lo me tor lo moreintense drounds extreme he significant whil i co significant damis i we never se be wor not you the wine islan ye non saes tey can another parts o the world by the way it is bad he said that one time is kitchen got set on fire not getting hidded again in that esamesac press conference his tige i lahina and he mentioned again that his kitchen got set on fire one time he is just he is he is the best i cae time for some things i in mhnsonethings that i hate things that i to a 's i mentioned earlier the rare benshbiro show reference to the ostra hungarian empire im if you are interested in learning about any of that sort of stuff i have the recommend jacob miccanawskys new book good by eastern europe an intimate history of a divided land it is it is really worth the reed excellent book a basically trace is the history of eastern europe l yeu sho be caled eastern europe from essentially the dark ages socal darcages up until modern times and and looks it at the fact that a lot of borders were sort o drawn post fact o changed a lot if he will gen a map of europe in twelve hundred looks completely different thin th map of europe to day it is shifted it is moved a lot of times populations have shifted moved and and there is some valuable lessons to be learned in the history of eastern europe about how empires fall part about how nationalistm rises about the costs of population transitions and all the rest of it i definitely work three jacob mac canawskiys good by eastern at europe i'lk gate time for a couple of things that i hate alredy the california aterning general obonte is now suing a school district over what he calls it outing policy what exactly is that policy while the policy is that if a child comes to you at school and expresses genera confusion rather than secretly transitioning them at school and calling them by a name of the opposite sax and allowing them to dress up as member of te opposite sexon ploset ours post calmomadad this apparently is not allowed in california here is i hers the story a turny general robboo as the policy recuaring a school to deschoos tugengrad deneby with out their permission which students in danger by howding them to their own parents i refuse the stand by and allou cenal valley or any district bord of education to put our children at risk or infringe upon their rights specially not one of our most vunerable a risk groups cor the arist from their parents that is the baseline assumption the base len asumption is that yourse of parent ar risks your crial the cre b teacher from the american federation of teachers who is encouraging billy to cal himself jane and get in that dress while i watch to im that that is that is a chilt that is a child being protected according to the state of california s now school distrects are going to be presumably sued if they disclosed to parents that their kids ore acting in sectually or genera confused ways becaus the parents ore the enemy when i talked about leveling all of the little platunes all the small social institutions that ac should provide the basis for function in society this is what that looks when the state says that you as the parent are the threat st your child we is outsiders are not thrats as we convince your trial to engage further in genera confusion that will rect their life we are the actual we are the staviors non in about threatening and violative that would be it and meanwhile canada is now issuing travel warnings to l g b t ku pluss min as divided by sign people a to not come to the united states global

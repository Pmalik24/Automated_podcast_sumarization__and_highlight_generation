welcome to the hubermen sciencesciencepacto i may dra hubermen and om r professor f nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is rick reuben ric reuben is credited with being one of the most creative and prolific music producers of all time the range of artists with whom he is worked with and discovered is absolutely staggering ranging from artist such as ello cool ja public enemy minor threat fugazi beasti boys jeesus and mary chain jaise red hot chilly peppers metalica greenda tompetty system of a down jostrummer coniewess jonny cash a dell and many many more not surprisingly therefore rick is considered somewhat of an enigma that is people want to know how it is that one individual is able to extract the best creative artistry from many different people in many different joneras of music well as today's discussion reveals rick's expertise in the creative process extends well beyond music in fact our conversation takes us into the realm of what the creative process is specifically and generally a cross domains including music of course but also riting film science an essentially all domains in which new original thought ideas and production of anything becomes important our conversation ventures from abstract themes such as what is creativity in where does it stem from to the more concrete every day tool based approaches to creativity including those that rick himself muses and that he is seen other people use to great success that took us down some incredible avenues ranging from a discussion about the subconsciess to how the subconscious interacts with our conscious mind and how the subconscious and conscious mind interact with nature around us and within us indeed our conversation got rather scientific at times but all with an iye and an ear toward understanding the practical tools that any and all of us can use in order to access the creative process we also spend some time talking about ricks new book which is all about creativity and ways to access creativity the title of the book is the creative act a way of being by rick reuben this is a book that i've now read three times from coveredta cover and i'm now reading an a fourth time because it is rich with wisdom and information that i'm applying in multible domains of my life not just my work but my everyday life i cannot recommend it highly enough rick has an incredible ability to translate his understanding of the creative process in a way that is meaningful for anybody fure in music if your musician it will certainly be meaningful for you but it is not about music it is about the creative process and whether or not you consider yourself somebody creative or not or whether not you seek to be more creative rick's book and to day's conversation sheds light on what i believe to be the fundamental features of what makes us human beings that is what allows us unlike other animals to look out on the landscape around us to ex damin our inner landscape and to come up with truly novel ideas that thrill us antertain us antertain other people scare us make us laugh make us cry all the things that make life rich are essentially contained in the creative process and to be able to sit down and learn from the rick reuben how the creative process emerges in him and his observations about how it can best emerge in others is and was truly a gift i'm excited to share his knowledge with you to day one thing that ou'll quickly come to notice about to day's conversation is that rick is incredibly generous with this knowledge about the creative process in fact he very graciously and spontaneously i should add offered to answer your questions about creativity if you have questions about the creative process for rick please put those in the comment section on you tobe and in order to make those questions a bit easier for me to find please put question for rick reuben in capitals than colan or dash whichever you choose and then put your question there i do ask that you keep the questions relatively short that i can ask rick as many of those questions as possible we will record that conversation and we will post it as a clip on the huberman lap clips channel before we begin i'd to emphasize of this podcast is separate fror my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's pod cast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar wsalt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to electorolite ratio of one thousand miligrams that' one gram of sodium two hunder milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doccom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el emente doccom slash hubermen and now for my discussion with rick reuben crate to have y her to derich thank you for having meds pleasure of all the topics in science and in particular in nerv science i confess the creativity is the most difficult one to capture because an you can find papers scientific studies that is on convergen thinking verses divergen thinking and their definitions to these take on different forms but in it et strict definition form it seems that creativity has something to do with i ther rearranging existing elements or coming up with new elements but as i when into your book which i've done twice i've read it twice and by wit i feel blest an honor toave gottin in early copy from you im or a final copy early that is but having gone through it twice i'm now convinced that the're may not actually be an internal source of creativity that exists on its own write and and the example that you give that for me really is serving as an anchor and tell me if i'm wrong here is this idea that ideas and creativity or liolbit a cloud if you look out at it one moment you might think that it looks one thing where it has a certain shape and texture but then you look at it a moment later co be quite a bit different and if you look at an hour later it very well could be gone and the the reason i think that serves as such a powerful hook for me to think about creativity in why i think nera scientists and scientists in general have never actually captured away that even talk about creativity a stems from somebody that you knew in person but that as i've greatly admire i do not have many heroes but i would put joe strummer among the short list of heroes that i have and i remember once an interview with him fairly disjointed i he was sort of a often different tangencs that i could not follow but at one point he just can ae blurted out that if you have an idea you have to write it down and you maynd up throwing it away but if you wait it will be gone and i remember that and as a consequence i have alld system that i used to try ind capture ideas but what are your thoughts on what joe said this cloud idea that comes up im in one form in one area the book but then i think it is thread throughout the book in different ways no how did that come to you and im and how does it serve you an trenix i ont say extract would try to access creativity i think the best way tof think about it is a dream s f if you think about your dreams they do not they do not necessarily make sense when you wake up you will rebe might remember part but not the whole thing then if you start writing them down the will they'l they will come back and they may not make sense to you the ther they will be a series of abstract images and may meno may be some day in the future you will be able to look back and understand what they mean and maybe not and thats sort of house the art making ah process works is making things and we are looki for feeling in ourselves and it is it could be feeling of excitement or enthusiasm a feeling of interest a feeling of curiosity on one no more am feeling of leading forward and wev were following that energy in our body we feel be this there is something here theres something here i wanting o want i wantin no wan i antin no more anu but it is not it is i' say it is not an intellectual process is a different thing that is what is it is hard even to talk about it because it is a elusive recently i was listening to a podcass by our friend am lex freedman thin who is in episode wi bology srina visan where this it would bology who is a investora type guy thinker type guy this is an ait our apisode he says someting inthe beginning that i'd love your thoughts on he said lok we can train a rat to lever press every other time or to expect reward and every even number press where every odd number pressor event even every fifth number press but a human and a rat cannot do that for prime number presses you cannot actually train that and then you think about the reward systems an the way that we follow life from when we get up until we go to sleep and what he said is the fact that we cannot do that means that we may not actually be in touch with the best scheduals of doing things every time i'm thirsty i take a set i assume that is the right way to do it but it may not be optimle right optem for whatever purpose when i was reading your book i'v sinking about there is at there is a there is a set of things to follow things to pay attention to you talk aby this things to access that none of the creative process comes from just within us it can but it is always being fed by things outside of it and what i'd stard to do is the second time i read through the book was think about it through the lends of what bology was saying was that there may not even be a language for this thing that we call accessing creativity i mean there is a process but that language in the form of words is a little bit trying to use even numbers to try an access prime number sis the the math become convoluded that we end up in a conversation this where i'm confident we can get to the colonels of it because in what is remarkable about the book is that you do ou you show and in form the process but there may not be a english or any other language for saying do this than this than this than this and you will have something of creative value yo that capture it yes i think language is insufficient insufficient to to drill down on crativity it is more it is closer to magic than it is a science when kids come into the world u do you think that they have better access to this creative process than we do as adults because we start to impart rule plays and books well it get likes well people it but also all the things that are available to us that we are not paying attention to the texture of this table riht they we are discarding things it come systematically we get coticoset in our ways do you think kids are more are just by definition and by design more creative than thedult yes it kids are they are open and they have no baggage they do not have any belief system they do not knowt how things are supposed to work they just see what is and if we pay attention to what is we learn we learn much more than if we a most of us select frum an endless number of datapoints available to us to well as as a species to make sure that we do not die and to procreate and to feed ourselves or probably the primary functions first and then and then we learn things about what is right in what is wrong and we learn things about a how to do certain things or we are inspired by someone who make something we love and we want to do it the way they do it and all o those things under mind the purity of the creative process they can be tools to build your skill set to be able to do it yourself if you are a a a singer you might imitate a singer you really for a while to get good at it and then eventually come to find your own voice it does not always does not always start with your own voice but if you are three years old or five youre yors old you try singing you are not singing anyone else you are you are singing with your own your own voice and when you make something you are making it based on not not knowing and i think i had the advantage early in my creer of starting making music without any experience which was helpful because i did not know what ruls i was breaking and it was not intentional breaking of rules i just did what seemed riht t me but i did realize that i was doing things that other people would not do then there is this idea that there are no new ideas i sort of disagree ye as every one know iles he or her something that it least seems different enough m thin it is a a a coma combination of a new combination of existing ideas presented in a new way ithink this i think that is how it works i do not know a but it will say as seem things that are most interesting to me ha a series of familiar elements joined together in a way the discreeting something a eer seing before you mention that it is that when you are close to where you have see hints of creativity that is of real value that you can et that it is a feeling and i also believe that the body is a great source of information which youa once people realize that the brain of courses in the skull but the nervous system extends everywhere in the body the whole mind body thing just falls away ou nove philosophers of argued about this forever but it is a silly argument it is also true that god forbid over to imputate all my limbs have them imputated i'd fundamentally still be me the same is not true if we took about big enough chunk of my brain and i still survived i would be fundamentally different human being i still have the same name and identity and social security number but i would behave very differently who knlse maybe better ah the signals from the body we know or at least we assume oure pretty generic i can think of fifty different ways ore a hundred ways that we could talk about creativity to day and we could define it and re define it and carve it up and serve it up suty in a bonch a ifferent ways but the body send signals that most of us are im we have a kind of course understanding of it is oe my stomach hurts are my stomach feels good or i'm not sensing my stomach or im that feels good if feels warm it feels co wat most of us are not trained in understanding how to interpret those signals it is almost you have a few vowels a feu syllables and there is not a lot more but resnen we talk about our thoughts in our experiences dependin on how hipe preverbal somebody is and how much emphasis they put on different sounds it it is kine of near infinite i im not infinite bun your infinite for you personally when that you are on the on the the end of a thread of creativity may be listening to an artist are your or your hearing something ou anyor there and the the you are unten i start to te flect in a certain way right do you feel that in your body as a recognizable sensation or is it a thought and a sensation it is a it is a feeling in my body is it low is it localized no it is inso it is a feeling of i wus it is a a surge of energy do you remember the first time you experience that probly dou no hearing th beatles when i was three or four years old three or four years ol her well y is there something wrong with me that the beetles have never done it for me i maybe just werean exposed tha direct time in the right way it is is no nte red o wrong way and and everyone i can love the beatles and you cannot and we are both right in o thiss nata i'm glad we can still be frands asle and sir is all scar da that question i know my taste of music is a l ofit obscure but i'm and an gon fragmentary but im ooket gut i'm always felt cash there must not be something wrong with e i their songs but they do not there is no juse for me ere i think maybe l watch em it was a and a part serious call the beatles anthology which is at a print but i i can try to find it somewhere and we can watch at together an maybe thatle make the case for the beatles k yed be i men nothing against them as just and i'm always bothing youf fr story that ramonds i saw that s wha jane's eidiators everyone had to change their last name to ramn a lot of them hated each other there is ot much drama and there and and three cords and just but to me it just was whale kids from new york that energy i thing it different things for different people right absolutely that brings me to a question of when when something feels creatively right and you are sensing it and i'm and you are there what say in the studio or maybe ben you are listening to something that somebody sent you howd how do you translate that givein the absence of a language ha how do you translate that into a conversation with the artist and again this could be about writing or comedy or you nor science or podcasting that matter how do you say that keep going that way when they mig not even recognize that he did it and i'm gessing a lot of times they do not ye sometimes it do not it depends when we are in the i'll try to be in in a setting where as where talking about it we can engage with it in that moment sit is not much good but say i was producing your new record and you played me something and i had some thoughts about it it would not be helpful for me to tell you what those were it be better for us to wait till were in a place where we culd try things and see where it goes i'm the first thing is i would not rely on language to do it it would be more of a making a suggestion of something that is actionable we try it and then we have more data and either were moving in a good direction or removing away from re moving towards it or away from it and we never know and it is always an experiment and maybe simple way to talk about it would be if i gave you to dishes of food and ask you to taste them and tell me which when you better it is pretty usuallys pretty straight forward when you have two choices wich ou better and i think most creativity can be boiled down to that that is very different then i wonder how this is gan a perform on certain social mediat platforms that is a different then what is it when i'm tasting these two things which is when i want e finish eating and and if i were to say i this one better but it needs little salt and then put a little salt on it maybe a ptoo much salt and you' hen you taste that is it is it is that simple a being in tune enough with ourselves to really know how we feel in the face of knowing that other people might feel very differently which is part of the challengeis of if everyone tells you a a a a a a and you listening you that is be a as an artist it is important to be able to say to me it is be and that is a it is a disconnect because much of when we go to school it is to get us to follow the rules and in art it is different because the the rules are there as a scaffolding to be a chipped away as need be sometimes the're helpful sometimes ore not and sometimes will even impose our own rules to give something it is shape we can decide to make a af ween to make a painting but we are only going to use a green an ret or the only clothes were were allowed to use we decide that in advance and thend how to we solve the problem knowing all we have as green and red aii can because otherwise if there is an infinite number of choices anything can be anything you knows it is it is of sometimes more choices is not better limiting your palit to something manageable forces you to solve problems in a different way now in are a in our digital age a musicwise you can make anything a digitily here is no in in there was a time when if you did not have a guitarn studyo you could not record guitar or if you did not if you could not hirer an orchestra there could not be yorkstra on your according now you can just call any of those things up there is infinite choices and infinite choices do not neces sarily lead to better a better compositions or better final a final works understanding half how you feel in the face of other voices without sucan guessing yourself is probably the singlemost important umthing to practise as an artist ore skill set to develop is an artistis to know how you feel and on your feelings and and the kee to that is not i know i know what trike for you it does not work that way its just i know from me and the reason i chose to be an artist is to demonstrate this is how i see it if i'm if i'm underminding my taste for som commercial idea or ah it it defeats the whole purpose of doing this this is not at's not what this processis about this process is i'm doing me and i'm showing you who i am and you can it or not but either way this is still how i see it i love that because som in science in having trained graduates yunes having been a graduates to i was very blessed o have mentors one of who is a real iconiclass he is dead now i shealt all my advisers are dead sois i canswer canswer the joke as you do not want me to work for you sthey were all had a morbid sense of humor thei'r laughing about this some place right now that you can to say they ill ate the poison mushroom no the last one a said to me you are the common denominator andrew and i thought o my goodness and he said kind of just getting but not really and no that is a low of it yeary but in any case he he always said i seem was been he always said the're the one thing i cannot teach is taste and the one predictor i have of the people who will never develop it are the ones who are perfectionist because the're filtering their perfect perfectionists that filter their perfection through the feed back of others he was always looking for the person that was t putting up a litl bit of a middle finger to feed back not much t at they would get things wrong cann't can be badly wrong in science you can be wrong for the right reasons be can also be for the wrong reasons but people that just had almost a compulsion to do it their way or to believe in what they we are doing and i i'm hearing some of that or i'm hearing that in what you are describing i i also think that there is something about the human empathic process or the emotional process where when we see somebody doing something and they seem to really not be paying attentionto what anyone else is doing ment i guess that the crazy person on the street is one aversion of it where we go there just in their experience and just crazy but when somebody seems to be enjoying themselves or the emotion seems to be real i think there are are a good fraction of people who feel a kind of gravitational pull e go have that in the best example i have of this as i remember growing up in the scapeward thing we were the first we were the first start doing the baggy sagging tha clothes think we ought teased endlessly one ear in school then there was a bunch a hyppot that came out aguies were wearing sagging there their genes are the short next yeare we come back and the very same people who are making fun of us we are all doing it and that is when t a it clicked for me is thi most people do not actually know what they no they what they because of the certainty of the people that they and on the question that is in this am landscape of creative stoff what is real what is not real on these are it is almost whoever can create the most convincing story at least captures a good number of of a good fraction of audiences but that is not what the creative artisan us to do the anant actually depart from that do i have that right wit thir just two different things a coming up with tha story with the purpose of pleasing some one else i's a skill said but it is more of a c it is more of a commercial endeavor than an artistic in never that is a tactical yet i wa seing it in your book you describe again whenything about it the creative processes the cloud for me again into servisas such a powerful anchor and then i think about the the biology the neurbiology of strategy formation or strategy implementation and then almost by cheer luck or miraculously i turn a few pages later into the book and there is a description of how animals that are trying to accomplish something eat mate find water e accomplish there the're the requirements of living it requires a narrow visual focus this is something my lauvh is kind of obsessed with an ivbeen obsessor and in that more narrow visual focus we know that the the play book becomes more narrow the rule set is more narrow now at some point in order to come up with a new creative idea that means broadening vision is essential in some way a broadening thinking wat it could either be abroadening or narrowing but it is changing the aperture from the standard the reason we do thous is to present something knew that maybe you already knew but did not know you knew it and for that to be the case if to be looking at it is not unlike what a commitian does and a commedian makes yo laugh usually with they are saying it is outrageous but you have know that it is right just kno incessat that way or nown as sait it that way before but it is always the truth in it that makes it funny it is it is that it is the same it is the same idea is recognizing something that' seems really obvious once you see it but seems nobody else sees it or no one else points it ow and i feelic sciences that too we how much of science when once the ayou know there the light flashes over your heads thik i got it of rit just seems i we knew that for ever no one knew it but doyou now never sayg as tik i obvious it is obvious and i think another the superpower of harnesses is is excepting we do not know anything when we think we know things that also limits are our world we think we know it is only this this is all it is possible we are mici this little box but in reality who is to say that is that is the case who is to say any of the we could take all of the a what we believe in science now and decide to throw all f that away and start from scratch and we probly created different a whole different one i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional neens i've been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast thereason i story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that i need for got health ore got is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turm health and those probiotics enothletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic grens contains a number of adaptigens vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste righpt if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greensdock calm slash hubermen and they will give you fve free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road an the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vitemen d thre k too againd that is tathletic grensdock calm slash hubermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply o vitemind three k to in a off line conversation one time you aske a good friend of mine who is been a guest on this podcast ed chang is chair of nero surgery and one i iwuld place him in the top top one percent of neroscientist uknows pulling speech out of people who are completely paralyzed wit locked in sendrument ceter and you asked him a what percentage of what is contained in medical tex books and training to day to day if you wento medical ettle to day rigt and you learned what was in the textbook what percentage of that information is accurate n percentageist now and he said may behalf right and you asked and what is the consequence of that and he said incalculable and i i completely agree and and asked him a second time and he still came up at the same answer that is a good sine im reliability from experiment to the next is good yet i think that the there is this idea that we really know things in science emen you see we have observed amazing discoveries from chance we have observed amazing discoveries from incredible bouts of hard work in both cases people wre spending a lot of time in the lap no one walked in the lap saw something one day and had a knobell prize whening discovery or fundamental discovery they were all hanging out in labae lot just some of them came up with something that they did not expect others were were drilling toward an answer and in all those cases when the breakthers happen i'm guessing i do not know this that considering we we assume this information then this discovery i's true based on everything that came before it but if everything that came before it is wrong then the discoveries are probably built on a the know i'm saying it is tha that the context everything that happens takes into account that the context that it sitting in it it is in that context yat context is not right who knows we do not know i'm saying were to we are too close to most things in thinking when we note when we think we know things we are they are a lot of assumptions that go into it anm at any new discoveries ore essentially built on top of these beliefs but they are beliefs i remember am learnt of course i listene the beasy boys growing out rudenos child the nineties and they were in the in savatage was you serve an outgrowth of e scapewording movy spike jones and the girl movies and those worlds that beseboys n scape waring were were really closely interwoven for while some people know that some people do not in spite sort of form the bridge and then spike wen off tha start making more trtit bigger movies am the more people watch but ylet us jus use them as an example i heard you say once before that yen geswere kind of joking around beasy boys these guises doing hippop it as conn the hard quarseseen in new york punkroc seen and ow a sort of a joke therewra lot of inside jokes when you were working together was there the thought that people might love it might hate it or you just warn't paying attention at all were' paying attention at all never considered it the you knowm at that pointing time when you are making i conill hippot me usic wasi tiny underground thing and it was no one making hyppop at that time thought it would ever mean anything it was it was not realist thic thought we were making it really for our crazy friends that is it you think nowadays the fact that one can create something and quoti release it quickly i can put it something out on to twitter inster gram now you dii in ten saconds from now and i will get immediate feed back that that that which is external if you back of course but then i can iterate on the basis of that feed back to you think that is problematic for that larger opportunity for creativity in other words if we were to go back twenty years or even fifteen years when the opportunity create to create was certainly still there but you really did not know what how it was gin a land until you quotic released at there was it seems to me there was more opportunity to stay in that magical na rain forest that is the the the creativity itself i do not think it is wrong or right it is just it is more information that you can use or not use and use it in a useful way and and you can make something in could it out and people cound not iting i cood hey still do not get it hore i men i got o go harder a no i got to go harder in that direction not do you kno at i'm saying it is that to react a way from information can be helpful it can be helpful when tere could be different stories that happen at the same time were making something and you have an idea of what it is and then other people engage with it and may have a different idea of what it is and they it for different reason than you did or dislike it for a reason different than the reason you it we cannot control any o those things the only part of it that we can control is how we relate o the thing that we make and any external information that undermines the clarity of that connection is probably bad for the art is my is my ces and and again i i'm only things from my experience i try to make things all i've ever tried to make were was something i or something that i felt was missing as a fan that i wanted and i nobody was making it i i'll make it but it was not it was always in the service of i love this thing i want something this no one else's making one ave to make one that is a it is beautiful cause i the wortha keeps coming to mine is this it is almost a compulsion therr there are other options of ways to be and to behave into function and work and lik but ther' if something is a compulsion it beyanks us away from those other opportunities just enough that we have to get back to it you have talk before about and you talk in the book this notion of the source in i to me again i cannot help abut my narraw scientist lends on this i think of the source as not one brain area but some function within the brain where we we are in touch with our about bodily's signals iwhat feels right what does not not tasting the two foods i love that example and that it is a it is a play book that is far more vast than the the short turm adapt if play book this how men get from poinad to point te and yet when i listen to an albomer a song i man i have to assume that there at some point it becomes not stratagy development or creativity but stratagy implementation thereneeds to be tha songs are g to come in this order and i i do not know much about music i've my musician friends ar always ever an either s a it is not muchy about usi oer that tham right well well put am but the ordering of the sequence of the melodi is et cetera at what point te does one deside oquet now's a time to get into that more narrow focus of of effort i we have got it let us run with is because there is a componeent at creative process invalves packaging and finishing and is that part less satisfying to you or is it just all part of the same larger art it is no part of the same it is it is nice ite's a good feeling is usually a good feeling when something is done on the one hand it is sam it is a commitment because up until the time that you say it is done you can keep experimenting and changing it f if you think wenl maybe to more i can make it better en it is not finished and keep thinking that for a long time you can do that foreverend never never put out anything getting to the point where you are ready to sign off is a good feeling and it alous you en thinks i took about my book is a because it is a difficult thing to do is fun to playin it is fun to maybe it is not the best thit coul be at em to use what ever the next priject is gon be as motivation to finish the won you are working on now i i'm working on this an spending all of my time on this thing it is really good i believe it can be better but is tis other thing that i really want to make and if i keep tinkering with this when i'l never get to make the other one using other projects as a impetus to finish something and release it into the world's good one and you said the your description of of source is something in us and i do not know if i would accurate if i would see that was accurate it is definately in us too but it is not only in us and it is i think of source as the organizing principle of everything and it is how everything exists how the trees grow and why ther mountains and anything that we can see in the outside world and and every discovery and every piece of art and every a new design and every machine are all outgrows of this source energy our part of it is the antenna that connects to it and and may be wearthy un were the the vehicle for source too allow things to happen in the world thend thank you for that cause i i did indeed misspeak because i recall very distinctly in the book he described how yet the physical world is constrained it by the laws of physics and certain things are the imagination is unconstrained and you think i have this write these that yoen the work sit somewhere between those it is neither of one nor the other but that ultimately what feeds in to all of that our imagination and the way indeed that are our brain is a physical entity that nature in the outside world provides at least what appears to be near infinite if not infinite options and i love the example of the color palete that if we restrict me to whatever sorts of paints or medium i have than it is restricted but in nature there is a an infinite number of shades and tones and combinations and even on one we pick up a rock and look at the color of the rock and tried to find a paint to match that rock it would never match ir's too much t the're too many variations in nature within a single color rock for us to get close is is too much information we we scratch the surface we are only scratching the surface and we love when we are able to peer in at different scales spacial scales times scales to but spacial scales the delight that comes from that that these nature picture seem the were more thies in the eighties i cr you see a drop of oil shot at high very high resolution there is beauty in a drop of oil and then you would see that the earth and the galicsy there is beauty in that too rit extremes i'm an of course are daily perception is mostly through the filter of these kinds of interactions walls and sometimes outdoors there is a a b brilliant nurrow scientists and im not surprisingly he has a nobell his name as richard axl he is at columbia universiy is outrageous personality choose nikarett non stop yougues we get along great not because of the nikeret but becaus his perspective on things is is very abstract for a guy who is solved a he wont the nobell for solving a of great problem within how we smell perception of odors and taste and he says you th everything that the brain does as an abstraction think i could take a photograph of your face and show it t yousa yet that is me or let us say for the moment i call myself an abstract artist les just play a game because i've never been accused of being an artist but and i do three dots and as quigly line and i say that is you and you say lat does not look me and i say but that is my abstraction of you look et with ha brain essentially does that ias er something in between that because there is no actual photograph of you in my brain it is just a bunch of nuron's playing what we call in on somble a different keys on a piano and we go rick i recognize you rick ruben and everything is an abstraction and it is only once we start tinkering with the parts and this is the essence of science to remove and add and manipulate and the best example i can come up with would be a rothgo i only come over this example cause i start off in vision science and maybe make the most sense to everyone except the folks who have been blind since birth and they can swap something in here the if i show you a rothgo and i do not tell you it is a rothgo you may or may not actually think it is that impressive t depends on your taste in art but what rothgo did which was amazing even if you do not rothgoes and i happen to is that he removed all the white and high contrasty stuff and when you do that you alter color space and the colors look very different some people saw that dress a few years ago is it oranger is a gold or whatever that was a little bit of the same phenomenon i doubt in fact i'v be willing to bet my left arm that rothgo knew nothing about the nurrow science of colord perception but somehow got to this place where if there was no canvas showing and no high contrast and the paintings were large enough and on the appropriate wall you saw them a certain way that tapped into something fundamental and this is where i think art and science really converge is that every once in a while we see something that feels amazing to enough people and not just the baggy pants phenomenon not just because other people think it is cool but there is something there and again thatis defies language and at i have to imagine that in you are a your years of of light and music and other creative endeavors that you have that every once in a while to you have you ever encountered something something fundamental keep showing up indifferent form or there is somethin on a a almost a rule wer a principale is it ever come about cause in science we thing of this as this it reveals something about our limitation tou abstract the world i hope i made that clear m not exactly but i have a thought you talked earlier about the of the drop of oil the photograph of the drop of oil and the photograph of ord we could use the on the other side huble telescope images of these these vast things and i i definition what we see every day is as impressive as those things but where numb to them because we see them all the time and if we were to look at drops of oil every day in in a microscope a a month from now we would not we would not find wonder in that image it is sometimes it is the novelty of not seeing it from that perspective before that is really thrilling you could and i could imagine and as probably relates to the rothco idea that you could see something from a particular angle and have this magical experience and then walk three feet to the side and see it from a different wan it just evaporates it only works it only triggers this thing in us a when we look at it just the right way u there was a paint tha n experiment i just heard about heard about the other day that that sounds fascinating that u a painting teacher recommended where instead of painting having a model in the room and painting the model that you have the model in the next room and you go into the next room without your equipment you do not have your equipment and you can study the model for as long as you want and then you go into a different room were you cannot see the model and paint the model instead of and it is it changes your relationship whert's not we are not just painting the lines we are painting what is interesting enough about what i saw what is the datapoints that' stuck in mind mind and when i string those together what o i get and and what do i how do i form it to get as close to whatever that the experience of that person was which the close the closest to of getting to the experience of that person in the painting might not look a photograph it might look more different then more the same to really see what you see this if we think about them the pecotl paintings that were inspired by african art were the eyes are undifferent different levels they may give us more information than a photograph would give us am thinking about the ewhen you ere describing the sensation of whin something pixes your breath away and we all have that when we see a dramatic sunset any one when there is a really dramatic sunset or if there is a whale and if any one's on the beach and there is a whale everybody's really interested that there is a whale it is denot im saying these feelings of wonder we get to experience them depending on where we are were dragon fly we are a bird flies into your space these things happen and when they happen we are we are ah confronted with the the mystery of the world when we change the perspective normally we do not think of whales in our back yard or birds in our house flying freely but but they do happen these things do happen and they they break us out of our trance when these things happen oh ya the're birds this everywhere i'm just not paying attention thisguis coming intellect tap me on the shoulder thak remember me here i am i would say that that the whale example and what you are describing is it is revealing to us how in a delightful way how deficient our perceptinal filters normally are yes it is a little but the rothgo is revealing how i've never thought about it this way until this moment is revealing to us how color normally looks as actually first all not the only way it looks those colors we think our one way but all color thits gets into the biology of colorvisions all about contrast what something is next to dictates what it looks than that is the origin of that dress mem or whatever you call it i still cannot firg grout exactly what i mean as some one will frenchlly tell me the in the same way when you see a whale and it is delightful i think it is revealing to us the extent which those whales are thet ocean is vast there is a whole universe there and we are blind to it all the time and i think the misperception or the misconceptions gives me as that were delighting cause we see the whale we might be just as delighted because we are getting hit with the contrast of how little we recognize all the time and in that way it reminds me alof it about comedy we are and ivs i've been watching more comedy lately and sometimes it is the shock sometimes it is the the absolute truth that is revealed and then other times what i've noticed and i saw rogue into comedy at the vulcan club in austen which he does every one's a while and it wis small club in and he was leading out this story during his routine or bit i think it is right this bit he is leadi and everyone knew where it was going we all knew and then when he finally told us it was exactly where we thought it was going and it was hilarios and if o good and it felt amazing and i and i thought in thain that moment i was way sicond how did he pull that off that was masterful becauses normally it is this thing you create one story there is a scripting out almost a courtroom lawyer and then that kind of pull the curtain and it' something different it is theand and if you look at the the science the narrow science and brain imaging of of laughter and humor which i've looked intofto be honest and notice respected the people in that feel it is pretty lame it is lame because it is always that the jarring nature of a surprise but what he led us to was something that oh no he is actually going there o he is really going there and it was this anticipation with a with a beautiful delivery at the end and i'm convinced that ba som what we are talking about here that there is something about when we see something we think it is about that but that the the delight that we feel could be about all the other experiences that now become in a subconscious way and of hah it is almost laughing at this perceptionabl def as it that we hav it is almost laughing at how little we actually know which is what you have said it it could be better also could be te sense of community of when you think it is ciniga particular way and it goes that way it is reinforcement of you e os o ue i yet we he saing it but in we were saing it together i'm listening heu sing it but wer in this together nat's good feeling to think about that for second i was try to think about wise certain music i'm still can evoke such powerful emotions in me and and there does seem to be something special about the music we listen to when we are tean agers from about fourteene until about twenty five it seems to get routed into our nervous system in some way maybe because that fase of our life is is really one of identity crisis and and you do not find too many forty year olds some who are wondering who they are occasionally but almost every young teanager or preteine and sno who am i you are jived finding personality i always likened it to that but leaving out the the sort of critical period biology stuff what do you think it is about the music that we here at that time are we that much more emotionally tuned have we not shut down our censors quite as much is there the songs in the artists do not matter to the very individual to me othit for other people 'll be the beatles or something i'm now i just really wish the be les did it for me too but m do you think that is important because i could see how it is really terrific i could also see how it sets up u one of these what a'll just use nurty languager calld at i a semy deprived filter because if i'm only looking for the way that a stiff little fingers track made me feel the first time i listen to on's fifteen the feeling is worth while but if i'm looking for that i'm missing all the other stuff i'm missing the beetles i'n missing fleet wood mack which never did it for me either i'm a missing all the stuff that you do not people i love in respect really love im i've never worried about it because there is kind of a infinite treasure trove of other things that i do love but i do sometimes wonder whether 'r not my life experiences diminish because i'm not allowing u con range and you have obviously work in a huge number different joneras of music ponk is onething hippop is n im it you will diamond too right emanem to sligher too right aand in somesense as i list these off i'm just thing about how much in high school maybe nowadays less but even in collegeind is an adult we societily were sort of asked to constrain ourselves to one of these groups i i did not know it was okay to love bob dillin and love poncrock as much as i do until i heard tim armstrong said he love bobd dillin and a'lls and recently y told me he loves the grateful dead and alls wo abut to it i remember when you had to m i both e remons and clash loved beetles minin a i o work to the mino you togetherdok soo i've a feeling part of it is the ruson it gets in at that age is is at a time when we are defining who we are and the music is part of the definition of how we see ourselves it is the bik the music that we hear before that might be the music that is on aradia or our parents music orur older brother sisters music an men when you'r fourteen or fifteen and you start choosing wol your you are listening to is noce finally mine and my parents might not it and my elder brothers sisters may or may not it but this one is mine and yu it always ha it always has that a impression in us that this is this is ours it is my it is my thought a wock of wyat it luck why continues to last how do you wipe the slate creen then life for instance if youare going o going in work with somebody knew and again as people are hearing this i hope that they are transplanting this to whatever it is that they do cause in the realm of science and podcasting communication that it is not music but there is a contour in aaway hopelitist pogcast will look nothing it does in five years that is my hope is it will still have the coor features of the beauty and you t ility of biology coming through but i hope it does not look anything episode too and i think it will evolve as you vove it is just the truer it is to what interests you and if you'are not intereting biology the same way in five years i would hope it is not the same i'll be doing psychoanalysis in real time wut if verity will aly lying down on cout what ever it is iwn ever iti ye we probably will not be on psychodelics but we might be levitating you nso how do you a stuckle of it if you would cause i know it i'm very interested in a your process i i'll spare you the daily routine a question it is very clichet but you and i are both lovers of sunlight of horizons and not as a trivial source as an amazing gift of energy right am in it in there are not words for it really u aside from your daily routines when it comes to somebodyyou are going from project to project and and you kow youre con be doing work with somebody could be your own work and will talk about the writing of this book and it is structure which is very unique i've never encountered a book with this kind of structure before and is thet it is the most facile read ever and yet every single page i underline took note starvd and it as you would notice it is very warn have a very very warn already and only more soover time do you have a process for in a removing the functions of the day and that what you are doing last week and what is going on and in order to get more access to the this sum i gong to think of it now mores as a receiver inside of you right almost it tuning a radio ucand then it comes in the beginning of a drom er clash i love the radio jo lov the radio wrigt the cotr and than it comes in clear and there it is how do you clear the static what what are some of the operational steps that you think might be more generalizable to regard less of wers u somebody and afridas listening there is the thing when i'm when i engagee in ar particular project whatever it is i i dedicate all of myself for that preed of time whatever it is whether it be twenty minutes or whether it be five hours whatever it is total focuss and know outside distraction whatsoever and when i leave that process i do my best not to think about it when i'm away from it i do not bring any materials with me i do not leave the studio wid works in progress ind spend timelessing to them during the day or looking for ideas s i i stay as far away from it when i'm not ddirectly engaging in it as possible and in the best of situations i have something else to totally engage myself in in between instead of working on project ay for five hours and then leaving in doing nothing i'm hoping to engage in a project be or be s ind with all of myself before going back to project ay again which might be the next day let us i to am relates to an amazing a chapter in series of writings i your buk that i'm not going tiscrivings i want people to find for themselves about disengaging about disengaging from the process one question i had as i read that chapter and as you'r saying thiss now is even though you are disengaged do you believe that you are self conscious as working it through that i believe i believe and i think in general to ste over problem is not the way to solve a problem think to hold the problemis ligetly and and if and when i say a problem you knowin where an was starting a project is usually this feeling of there is a question mark at the beginning of oareproject i am always anxious when i start anny project because i have no ideas can happen i never know i knever i never as i may have in some cases a potential back a plan if if nothing works but i really try not even to have that it is i prefer not to have that i prefer to go in maybe to comt myself down enough to be able to show up they will be an idea of an nothing works maybe we could try something thit is but that would only be for my own anxiety that would it would not be for actual practically hes but there is always a sense of anxiety because i know whatever's can o happen is complete the aut omy control somethings can something either interesting or not will appear and then we are going to follow that wherever it goes and in till something appears for us to follow i have a lot of anxiety even though i knw even tough it has never not come now it as come every time but there is something about it cause i also feel there might be expectation on me that i'm na make it happen and i know that is not happening that is not how works it is it is em i show up ready for it to happen and a'm oping to whatever we have to do to find that first thread and once we find the thread thence ao ike we have a and that thread may lead us to anything oud o could lead us to in a million different directions but something about having that glimmer that it is not a blan we are not looking at a blank page ou know we are looking at oke we have a we have a the beginnings of a i would say a map but it is a map we do not know where it takes us and it is just the beginning it is just it is just a stup you are here whatis i if you havea mappinesses you are here even if you cannot see the directions knowing where we are feels o k a and once we get unusually it began usually in the first day first couplof days it happens a but up intil thenits it is really and anxiety producing a situation and then i cant con remember the original questions i that was the beginning of of something completely different but i do ou remember what you asked i remer yet well iin weare time out disengaging and is you'r subconscious into it and yheu and then we were tulking about to i love this a sort wonder what is your process of af wading into this thing and and you are revealing that now i'm an i i think of anxiety as readiness anything about the characteristic a features of anxiety it tends to be a bit of a constriction of the the visual field into more of a narrow vision but that is appropriate because you have want to shed hat what is going on elsewhere and then even when people talk about the shake sor this not feeling no case sitting still anxiety was designed to mobilize us and not always to run away this is one of that i cu in ararely do i talk about the work in my own laboratory but one of the things that frankly i did not discover but it was done in my laboratory but itis brilliant graduates do not lindsey salaiy who is now at caltak was that we can often observe animals ore humans in very high states of anxiety as they move forward toward a gol and we always think of moving forward is this calm thing we these heros yo arose a parts telling people a few 'm not getten off the back tham not leavin the the given up my seat on the bos or mohammed all i bet you they were experiencing tremendous anxiety buty was in the forward tilt and i think anxieties is is least i'm comfortable when we are forcing ourselves to stand still it is a it is a activating energy and beyond that brings up a word that youn i have written my note book as an extractionoble lot of themes from within the both the you and i've talked about before which is in and here i'm mean a sound very west coast a wo but i mean it as seriously is it can be stated that i feel everything is energatic my we can do things from a place of anger we can do things from a pl ace of joy we can do things fre one place of delight im i i to think maturing into the idea that joy and delight and love as and the ultimate reservooir of energy but you a lot of the music i from when i was younger i was because of the anger that was thread into it or ium or the sadness of you think of your relationship to that music it is a relationship of love ow eas listen to that to get angry now you listen to it because you loved it and i felt loved by it yes it is matched where i was at at the aus it was true to who you were and where you were i know that collaboration there is a wonderful chapter on collaboration that but it is claboration as you mention before with the universe not with others but in terms of the especially the kind of work that you have done and do when it comes to working with artists im i do wonder and here i'm not looking for any a gossip or stories thats i've never been interested in gossip i love stories but i'm no nin gossip but once you see that thread kind of dangling there andyou are goig it is going to go after this and were you grab on to it in yu dcane now you have a little bit of a map an an orientation within that map often wonder in a scientists are complicated people people think they are very boring but there are yoe very complicated because they are often living in one limited rule set of the prefuntal quartects that is how you get good at getting degrees it is by understanding the rules of acadamia and playing by those rules yes im people think er with the rules you get your richard axels who are very playful and how they go about it but they are systematic he is known for rigor rigor rigor i when i think of creatife artists and musical artists i think of a bit more zani or lose ir you watch the documentary about the remons and whithers all as chaos how because many of the brilliant artists musical artists that are out there seem to have some chaos inside them or their lives are not always structured oftentimes and science too by the way theare substance of use issues and personal life issues how since you do not have one hundred per cent control they me to play the instruments saying et cetera how do you work with people who have it in them but are getting in their own way right and do you think that that kind of the internal chaos that the lot of artist seem to have do you think that sometimes is actually an essential piece of the creativity picture that you cannot disentangle it i do not think sinecential piece in general but certain artists that is there that is how they do it i would say i really get to see the chaotic part of artists for whatever reason they they really show it to me and most of them li most commediencs i know i'm much more serious about what they are doing th en what it looks from if you see the on stage here is much more to it and as much morm focus on craft going on and digging deep ten would necessarily be obvious see him turn round on stage ave i'm i'm a fan of boxing track and field in boxing the sports nobody really cares about now that youave see popular and and track and feel is at it is a little bit wrestling when you go the people that ther are there cause they really love it i will tall about rest than it a professional restling but you'l floid may weatheris a obviously a colorful character and one of the best records ind boxing of all time and if you urs back again to watching his stuff and and what one sees is the the cars and the money that called lyrid call themselves the money team and thats spending in the and and there is all the outrageous stuff but i know some one who is in his incamp with him i'm who achally was a sparring partner for him and the loer has it they have very closed door a sparring i'm er camps but the loer is that he would do you knoc as nowdayis it is twelve three minute rounds right with im an en between you spee fifteen but now nor a scientist stepped in and it turns out allow the deaths were occurring when it was more than twelve rounds i for whatever reason it cut off it at twelve really seem to truncate the death ther're other things to if the dad is a apparently corner man we have some one else here the potgassi knows more about this than n he bast in in you have the kid not wanting to disappoint the parent orelated with death there is am i'll but get some of this wrong an an an the takan come aftr me but in any case dis gy who was in flod's camp said that he would do thirty to sixty minutes of sparring bringing in fresh sparring partners with no rest that he would run three or four times per twenty four hour cycle despite all the critical need for sleep that his training was unbelievably intense to the point where he would just just chew out chew up in destroy all training partners and yet the perception that we see is it is kind of it is playful for him for him it sounds very similar what we see is often not what goes in to it that people are intensely rigorous and i think in a way from a psychological perspective if you knew you were fighting some one who was not taking it seriously that would give you some confidence and that would not be a good thing if your if the prirson was actually im working really hard outworking you indyou know it in abda i from a psychological perspective that makes sense to me i keep coming back to is that 'm imagining my mind have two ends of the continuul one that is about fairly narrow fokcas training training strategy ind plementation cultivating craft building craff and then the other side is this the cloud it is very nebulus right in it i'm there is is a word that i i learned from a colleague of mine when i was down at the salt institute when my lav was there aus he studies this there is this phenomenon i'm that i do not want to miss pronounce cause then it sounds something else but the correct pronunciation is peradolia an paradolia is our tendency to look at an amorfish shape a cloud or a tree and think that it looks something else an ice cream comb the man in the moon and that again reveals the extent to which the brain wants to place symbolic filters on things and we need this right because i see you walkin the door and reck i i recognize you in fact we have a brain area called the fusiform face giris literally is a face recognitionaria and you could be at any orientation or i could just see your eyes and know that it is you a there is a phenomenon calle proposagnosia where people can see faces they can describe everything in the face but they would do not know for instance that it is j f k or madonna or laks freedman it is quike the lists quike the list there yo go lacks im run for office lacks just kin i'shard enough to get you to respond my text as it is m we have these filters since i we are taking this cloud and were we are deciding what things are yes and whatd i want to go at drill into your process a little bit i more deeply when you approach a project everyone is meet each other shakes hand here the engineers when a sit down where everyone knows what they are doing caus your work with professionals and you start going are you trying to be with the cloud or in the implementation where are you in that continuum and forgive me if i'm trying to u'm surgically go into your process in a way that would disterrupt it an anyway but i trust youve been doing this for a while i know there is nothiman not i'm i'm in the cloud would the exception of i'm aware of what could go wrong on a technical side and i migh if something good this happening i might look over in makture that we are rolling im that is anl leap over to heare momentarily but then he ay be i maybe if i if i few if i was in the moment i would be in the cloud and if something good starts happening it would trigger something in me oh i hope this is i hope were really doing this because i do not kno if we can ever do this again that will that that would be a thought i when the first time the real world would come into the picture would be something good as happening let us not lose it and when that happens do you never been in as in a studio besides he podcast to you do you say he gots that sounded good a more f that what you wait you let them continue because it as see do not want to break ther ther flow would never want o break any flo whence its happening yet one something is happening just cone to sit back and watch and o you think there is resinence the the tean of engineers and other people know when it cot uncle is happening if everyone is paying attention yes when everyoe's paying attention it is usually pretty obvious sometimes the thread'll be something different than expected and maybe not everybody would pick up on it and that might be particular that might be particular based on might a store an ardist taste orr some one involvement might say that was te si some bact i think thit was better than wit them we thought that can happen i thinkoyou said several things and it was you said enough for there to be several conversation i senty that i especially with you i do not get to see you as nearly as often as i would and when i do i confess that i'm a bit of a kit in a cand i shrout down in the brain tells a stories you talked about i walk in certain dot apoints you recognize me but it is a real looking at a cloud shorthand we go through we go through our lives doing this all day with everything we see and the short hand in the case of me me the short hand turns out to be right it it checks ou if it is something we do not know and something we are not familiar with something happens we we we experience something on the street something happens and it does not make sense something out of you wurd narry hapens first thing is is this does not make sense then what we do is again sobesubconscious unconsciously i do not it is unconscious subconsciously without thinking we create a story that explains what just happened a hypothetical that makes it okay that what just happened happened and oh maybe he is running cas's dog ran way an he is chasing his dog maybe that is wha's running and as soon as we have that thought of what it might be we relax because now it is not just a guy running and this is weird but it is a gay running always pry running after is thought and now we register that story that we just made up without even knowing we are making it up as what happen and then later in the day if some one says he had you see that i run ow lets a yabes chasing his dog i saw that and y you will not even realize that it was the maybe hypothetical story that was the first possible explanation that allowed you to continue walking do ou n nem sing that is our whole lives we are whole lives are reacting things making up a story what we think may have happened without realizing that is wat we are doing i' ten living the rest of our lives as if that thing that we made up really happened and we never know i completely agree we confabulte from birth until death there is i a well observed phenomenon and people o memory defisits m you see there is the sad example this and then there is the every day typical not's who knows sad ur not sad example for ins tance if somebody has a slight memory defs it where someone has altimers to mensha they will find themselves in the whall way at night is at what you doing here they will say oh i was going to get a glass of water but they are walking away from the direction that would make sense am people who alkoholics who drink enough develops sonethe korsikov's indrum where a certain brain area gets messed up and you will ask him a question i go what you doing here and they will come up with incredible stories sometimes interesting stories that have no bearing on reality yes n we their name is but do they believe they believe that is what with one hundred per cent certainty and this actually relates to a lot of the a now better understood controversy around repressed memories tew you can especially from young people you can pull memories from them that of things that never happened this has been demonstrated over and over against the courtrooms know to be very cautious now but the whole notion of repressed memories kuyena we have veryery a a complicated area of the lawas you can imagine im because we want we tend to want to trust victims for understandable reasons but in terms of accuracy of details two people have very different accounts of the same of the same experiences in this been shown over and over again ou ne even that you can do well in the laboratories pretty interesting again because of these select i filtering and story telling and we are think of a salman rushty who said we are the story telling species he probably now i was con te sa resnory toi machines and that is great ye think o we are th story i would say that the big five if i had to pick ups a brain function is we are very limited filters the mantist shrimp sees sixty severn shades of red for every one that we see yesthey have access to things we do not av access too yes they are not as far as i know releasing albums of the red hot chilly peppers caliber but who knows maybe down there they are i did see something by the way as a relevant tangent recently and i do not know if it is lok i if even of it is crazy it supercool if you take a device that amplifies the electrical signals coming from cactus and you just translate that into a simple rule of conversion to two or three pitches of sound the music that comes out of it is beautiful nothing short of yeureal awhen i saw that they the tean ager and me thought you kowhn we hear wale song we think it beautiful wha if they are just cursing at each other the whole time i right only they the're in there i a rogen episode when he invites all his commedian friends and there who knows maybe it is a psychoanoletic conversation about their childhood tromis i do not know yes but we decide wale song is beautiful s we decide cactus an is it lelse and it is beautiful to us and and w're right that it is beautiful to us but we it does not mean we know anything about it that is right yes we have these filters perceptionable filters we only can see in hear smell and taste what we can and then the brain likes to work in symbols we tend to to match that person whose shoes are massed up must be homeless i've had a couple insenses in life where i saw what i thought was a homeless vagrant inside a building and an academics institution turned out it was the most im accomplish person in the field that is always cool yes that happened it berkeley then the other thing that we do is we tend to put youdo simbl reparat we sa perception simbol representations and then our memories are entirely confabulated based on already deficient simbole and perceptionable representation yes and i never the statementhat we do not know how the brain works i think we do know how the brain works but that it works through very limited filters yeslook as knowing that and accepting it and it seems to me that this idea of looking to nature looking outside us is critical and in fact i i hope you will not mind me sharing this but a few years back i had sent you something by text and i was kind of in disbelief about something i've seen in the media els they got it all wrong and i knew the person involved and it was it was not a good situation for them and ils ike they got it all wrong and you wrote back and you said it is all lies back to nature the only truth ow and why and i wrote that down i put it over my desk now and i still i'd a tat to ite on my forehead if i did not it i hav it well well committed to memory but i think i know that is true right nature we can look at and it is but whant one i say it is all wises you just talked about our bility to how limited our facility to see and understand what we see yes yes based on mat that leads us to we cannot know much doyou now't ow thing our resolution is low on everything that we we really just were grasping it straws we have no idea we have no idea and this great power knowing that because if you think what is going on chances are you are being deceived not because somebody is deceiving you but because they are telling you what they see and they do not know it is all dunotim thing it is all made up everything that we everything we know is made up maybe maybe it is truth the springs us o pa wrestling init is it is the reason that po wrestling is closer to reality then anything else we can watch or any other content it is we know it is made up we know that it is a performance it is story telling and that is how everything is except we think wrestling spake in the world is real wrestlings real and the world's fake you talk about in the book af we are deafly going at this direction a in the book you talk about the opthis notion of entertaining the idea of the opposite being true as it and and there is our not only emerging but established fields of psychology that are making great ground i think into the human psyche biron caties were and others where you take a statement and you start playing whit that statement for you poke at it is authenticity and when i first heard that i thought this is kind of hoke wrete is just words and then i realize how foolish i was being because she is really on to something and there are others to o course but in science that is exactly what you do you do not really ask questions in science you are forced to raise hypotheses and trying say true or false now there are limitations to that approach certainly i mean pure observational studies ive been incredible i'm in terms of what they have reveal to us spushing medicine patient that has a bullet hole through a certainary of the brain you do not go in and say oh i hypothesize that person will have a defisite in seeing faces now you the person wandered into the clenec and the go this person cannot see sees faces but cannot make sense of them and then you you a reverse an you you ferensically arrive at and understanding but in general we we go about things in this way and considering that the opposit might be true well that is a little bit i i suppose of lik seeing the wail at te surface of the water it is well the opposite of my experience which is all above water for the most part it is maybe not the complete experience of life ins our seeing the inverse all the time i wanta to consider the universe all the time and it it reallyrelats to the way you you described how we see colors is based on contrast maybe blues only blue in relation to yellow if blue is our choice if we are not considering yellow blue does not exist di non em saying to ting we t alk about night it is only night because there is day if there was no day there is no night in in all of our cases it is beunian you knowis it is we there is the the light and the shadow always there is always another side for everything and wev we focus on one aspect but if we look at the other aspect chances are we learn something to the the nervous system is not just able to do this it is the way it does everything at two experiments al toes briefly describe my scientific great granparents gave yuill in torrens of weasll show that if you force a person to look at something for a long period of time without moving their eyes there is a way that you can do this the image disappears because normall your eyes are making little microsicads and you are comparing what you are seeing to what is right next to it it is he likeic pic up imic if we do not even have to use example of pressing on the arm were sitting in chairs right now and until i said what is going on at the level sensation on the backs of your thoughs you were unaware of it because if you experience a pressure or a smell in a room never walk in the smell is either good or not good pre soon the smell disappears the nurons are still firing sledge hammers on on a bell but we become blind and deaf to it because the nervous system likes to habituate the value of that signal when it is there often and it is only the stuff that goes comes through signal the noise that con ajolts us into a attention and awareness and i want to return to attention awareness which are prominent themes in the book and i think it in an important way not just o attention o wareness is important but you also give insidt in to how to pay better attention how to pay awareness with the understanding that people re goin to go about it differently but i do on't ask you bout wrestling because when i was growing u i was not i live south of the cow palace and therewas some wrestling going on there thing back then to his w w f there was a short stin to my childhood where i paid attention to in particular was it coco beware that goy that had o ma cal i was obsess with tropical birds and he would come in n put this tropical ver o thing and then who is that georghe animals steal together would eat the ring okay and i relief he was a professor aes leon real life amazeat use a professor but he la georgi animals teal as reth and i loved the movy the wrest a the wrestler rnarnovsky itas am bemoer th wonthereans i liked as i once visited am asbery part u is not where that was fill ner's at there is a vacant he was o vis his daughter there is a vacant a amusement park or abandon musement park seen there that was really eary still kon ahaunts meal but there something about the east coast in in can a fall all the places that people normally go fr just for the summer hat we do not have out here on the west coast am peepoe lhe is coser ust tougher than when we are it still haunts me great movy but i remember watching wrestling and it was at that age i think it was prolly about twelve thirteen may be eleven twelve thirteen where your knd of entering puberity and i you no pubrity is a fundamental landmark of of development it is the most rapid period of aging it is also when we start to change our rule set certain people and certain kinds of interactions take on profoundly different meaning i it is not just a reproductive competents time and when kid's chaint their bodies change the rule book changes fundamentally understanding of the world changes in them oh ye mean the moment that a child understands really what sex is and conohow they got there and that a lot of thit stuff that we see in the world is is cond of passively are not passively being sent through that filter it is it is it is something it changes that the rule the the rule book of't a perception i view this age from about eleven to thirteen at least for me was it unique transition point where the gat between what i perceived as reality in fiction was kind of blurry is it captured pretty well in that movi stand by me where they'r hang around the camp fire night in the kid says who do you think would win in a fight between superman and mighty mouse and the other kid says you idiot miny mouse is a cartoon of course superman would win and lik to me that is being eleven d and a half or twelve years old where you are understanding of reality as it is changing but it is not completely crystallized into an adult for in reality that is oni really healthy place to be to me that not living at crystallize think that is the a there is where the downfall happens i have question specifically about wrestling but it is really about process i want to know whether not you watch wrestling because it elows you to access the energy state in your body and mind and that kind of mode of thinking in which reality as one conceives it is somewhat blurry where is it for a number of other reasons which is fine is that the energy you are trying to export and bring to the creative process elsewhere to life is it that anything is possible or that we are dealing with archetypes cause it does not matter if it is cocal bewere or randy mot to men savager georgethe animal steal in the lovely elizabeth i guess i did watch a little bit of wrestling there they are archetypes much the greek miths or the bible or i'm no disrespect to the bible or to greekmith or to wrestling for that matter archetypes are are powerful filter for humans but we know that theyare very limited filther too because people are not built square wave functions we have curves and contours and complexity what is the deal with your relationship to wrestling i think it it maintains that kind of playfulness anything is possible we expect the unexpected all the time and wrestling and it is nd it is a wait to have a kind of a feeling of the energy of a sport we have with no competition it is everyone is working together to put on the best show they can it is more a ballet than it is a sporting event and and ite's great skill involved it is one of the few things i can watch and really feel relaxed it relaxes me i do not fo look afe to think about it i can just relaxe and enjoy it this brings up at a topic that is very near near to my heart which is this notion of dopamin schedules i never want to reduce everything to dopamin but dopemean is the universal currency of delight pleasure motivation seeking there are other chemicals involve to but there is a beautiful experiment and a couple of examples that i'll use as a foundation to more questions about wrestling and wy it is powerful and why other people may want to use wrestling or some other am endeavor is a way to access creative energy and source eally are we talked about yeu now you can train in animal to press up a lever three times hen they get reward and it will learn three's the magic number for reward in thet can switch it takes a libit of training and then they can swith but they cannot do prime numbers they cannot do high abstraction schedules humans either we are not very good at figuring out the rule set for optimol foraging we do it well enough to persist as a species at least for now but it is very likely that we are not tapping in to that system as well as we could and how would we know if we do not know 's one of us you do not know h you do not knows there is a beautiful experiment that explored when dopaming is released in the contects of watching sport or watching comedy believe it or not and with the comedy stuff it was every time therewas a surprise as comd that jarringly ha they measure people dopame peoples topening output they werealso brain imaging in the game of basket ball it is a beautiful opportunity experimentally because every time one team gets the ball or shooting freethrows or and they are going down court and it is either gan end up in the basket or it is not might end up on the free throug alimebuts and et wer not but they found is that the schedul of anticipation was every time there was a switch of which team got it se you are waiting waiting and then it is ah ner waiting wedding yes waiting waiting three pointer ah osom and if something happen where look they were going to make the three pointer but then s omebody basely swatted the ball away and then went for half court shot you do not expect that very often bigger dopening release u guess that is none how the dopening thing works when you describe wrestling i wonder it because you do not know the script it is not one team gets it then ththe other team gets at you do not know who is going towayin anything could happen is what you said yes the availability of that dopamin surge or drip which is a powerful thing is completely it is completely out of your reach in interms of anticipation you do not know when it is gon to come but it must arrive often enough that you return to it eleven hours e wek of watching in many ways the way i'm starting to conceptroalize the creative process is a little but the same you do not know where those nuggets of gold and those loose threads are but you have enough experience and in this case i am referring to you specifically to know that they are in there the people walking in this room have a certain level of ability and talent to create that the map will form itself as we are going through the voyage and those nuggets of here i'm calling them dopenming but theyre they are out there and that knowledge is enough to get you to come back again and again to trust the process iishlythink of the way you describe i'm wrestling as it is the energy of the sport it is not the whether not it is this move or that move or who winds or who loses it is the energy and i'm guessing it is the energy that it creates in you yes is observer yes it is engy creates in me and the reality that it is honest in what it is in a world where seeming we nothing is honested at what it is and again tatnmit not not because people are youlying all the time we have little dabta we make up the story to explain it and then we say that is what happened and and we have a trusted sources who do exactly what i just described and who past this down as gospel of what what we teach and we are and maybe it is true maybe it is not weth wrestling we know maybe it is true maybe it is not we lean towards it not being true but it is really intresting about restling avady one must fund things about it is that sometimes real life works its way into the story a wrest to wresters get married now in real life whell we do not know it is that you never know is in the story line they are getting married or getting divorced or best friends turn on each other and it could be part of the story nd it could really be happening because they do right some one gets some one breaks their leg they are out because they'r leg is broken did they break their leg we do not know they are out do you now i'm saying the we are told they broke their leg there is always dislike i wonder what is true what i wonder where the line is we know that it is scripted were and were predetermined that is how they say it is predetermined but we do not know where reality is and is not and in some ways that is our real experience of the world is this we do not really know where reality is not is not we have an idea maybe i think in some ways wrestlings more honest or legitimate because we start with the idea that it is a that it is fixed wen we go to a boxing math re no what a boxing match thinking it is fixed yet it might be and historically it is happened you knowt or there was ja something in baseball where a was a basemalt i do not follow basepall i should known it was just there was just the big a sports a oh rone of one of the teams that lays pase i yes sai that is hat the call signals of yes aid the catcher yes yat ther's over they were you are not supposed to deprogramm the where de construct the call the call signals of the other teamen i guess maybe some a teamdok caught doing that yes and the team tet one whatever the a where series was it is it is we wrestling you no that that would not be a scandal om sayingits cause that almost anything goes anything gows and that is what the world is really in some ways it is comforting and there is still this mystery w i wonder if that is true or not because we never really know some one get's hurt did they really break their back where they just going on vacation we do not know we will never know fascinating it is fascinating i feel it there are certain people who show up in a way that is surprising in in not justs one direction but in all directions it is one thing for a celebrity to come out and make a statement i can be interesting or not interesting depending on the celebrity in the statement and the delivery but and i'm proly gan to get this wron because i'm terrible at pop culture things a most of them anyway but as i recall youll lady goga showed up to some event wearing it outfit made of meat and i cannot tell you for the life of me whether or not that was a statement against meat or for meat tey ds a statement for the carnivore di it may tos a statement for veganism i do not know in on may or maybe neither or maybe neither but it was devilling a statement in that it broke with the norm and it is said to me o k she creates different rules for herself or breaks boundaries that u other people a i never head of any one doing that before sdoes 't mea they had not but i never head of any one doing it before but we do tend to associate and outside the current play book with cotico creativity unless it crosses a line in which case it becomes something else it becomes almost feeder for sake of theder but what you are telling me is that within the realm of wrestling feeder is the goal at some level and everybody knows it who goes into those arenas who watches yes everybody yes and everyone agrees to kind of sand end outside reality and say this is reality yes and they bo for the bad guise and cheer for the good guise knowing that bacts days you are proptly friends except for the kids that are eleven who think it is really real io no i do not even know they know i'm not sure the only o the person i know who has vocalized their love of a wrest professional wrestling to the extent that you have is a large frederics in the rhythmbatareplayer for rancet who loves wrestling but his statement and forgive me lars ofon getting this wrong is that because he grew up in a arry of the south bay were there were no teams now there is ta sandos ay earthquakes but there is no football team in saint ose he is from campbell but there wul there were no good teams no sports teams but they had wrestling and he had it where on the tell ovision set and if you did not have a but guidin grew up with any organized sport thing the forty niners were up the road but for me of escapewarding and i love it for the same reason you ashin never really know what is going to happen there is no rule book the rulic is made up but they are very ait is a unique sport in that surfings a bit this too in that they are absolutely maniacal about making things look a certain way it is not about just doing it it is about doing it making it look good smooth catching it with the front foot the nend that is the trens chane styles is o it is a style style is in it that stylisis nebulous thing of in fashionereins tay right ras with a football there some amazing catches there is even la hatch which i happen to know is a is a forting or the catch during the superablel but in general it is the goal is getting the ends own whin the game and i'm sure football players are cringing as i say this but does not matter if you run ugly if you run fastest in scape oring that would never fly in fact you basily be a ridiculed out of the sport in wrestling is it the same are there is there style to wrestling it is all it is all performance it is all be carisma of the people in vou this the the physical ability theu bility to talk and tell a story and be ahow carismatic the performers are whut you want to watch them whiut you want to see them win whit you want to see them lose and with he year interested in carbing for them i was yust say it reminds me of opera but opera s get released over and over gan the story and how it ends when you walk in if you have listened to it before wrestling does seem to be unique in that way it is real time iteration at least from the perspective of the and and it is real tim iteration basetime because people get hurd all the time to do really crazy physical stuff if some one get's hurt the story has's change because in real life they cannot short next wee can do what was plaed in the script it is it is very alive and there is a a lot of am something interesting and unexpected is always happening but in a much more i calm form m i i'll share with you something i just your perspective on it for years i i used a tool in order to try an access ideas im since i was a little kid actually im because i have a li bit of ose dealo bit of a teret when i get tired i'll do that very likei'm strategy implementation oriented i had that when i was a little little kit i need all my stuffed animals arrange in certain way legoas how to oll narati eere a lo and then science is very much about you have to do things with a lot of precision and i discovered that the ultimate reset for me when i was in graduate school or a posttock if i could not make it to a really good agnostic front show chaos the chaos abupon crockshow for me was a kind f this resets could release all this thing and i got energy from it for some i saw transplants play and you knows wa cause you do not know what is can to happen and was scary and i loved it the other thing that i used over time to kind of reset this ability to to think in a structured way without it feeling it was overcoming me maybe even access the same thing in some ways that your accessing with wrestling was to stre at a quaria i to go to aquariums or i'd buildiquariums and i would just sit there because ou never know which way the fishare goin a go you think it is going that way withan all h suddenthey will turn and go the other way it is completely unpredictable and i love a quaria because of the tranquillity and have them in my lab for a long time i just a dore a quariums because of the non linearity of it it is not a b c it is a z z e cu and i think this is what some people tryin access through psychadelics but that did not seem to me a very good way to do it on a regular basis whereas with a quaria you just the tanks are there in your book you talk about something that i i also share a love for which is it how youv the ocean and aspects of nature clouds and ocean they have a predictability to them we know where they are and where to find them unfortunately the s on rises and sets every day at least for now and we can count on them with a hundred per cent reliability and yet they are from the perspective of what physicis would say their very chaotic they you cannot look at a wave and know exactly how the foam is goin a roll out it is goin to roll in and roll out we have the tides but when i hear about restling i think about my love of a quaria i think about my love of puncrock music a for instance for i think about the ocean i think in that way that we actually have a need to source from things that have both a commination of structure and no structure i thinks interesting that there are some places that do not change in some places that change a lot and i can remember thinking about this i was walking this on beach that i walk on in in why that i walk on every morning when i'm there and if you walk on the same beach everyday cinding get a sense of what it is li can remember i was in why walk on the beach everyday for year wirno was and i left for six months and i came back and the next time i walked on the beach it was an entirely different beach entirely different and and i remember thinking in that moments this is an unusual place because i pictured an the house that i did not even grow up in the house i was i lived in maybe for the first seven years in my life and i think about whith a back yard look life and i think about a particular old tree that was there and i do not know this for shore but my senses if i were to go back to where i grew up and go to that place and look in that yard it would probably look pretty similar yet here was this beach that i was walking on an why that in the course of six months completely change its face and just how interesting both of those things are and that depending on the project working on to be able to go to a place that we know has the potential to change a lot and what that would do to ar a you are a connection with the earth when wwhen we are experiencing that verses go to go going to a place that has very little change and you can kind of count on it being th way it is always bheen that both of those are interesting things to be able to draw up on depending on what we want to open in our in our psyche i have an almost a unhealthy fascination with new york and the midaties and nine us and nom a ive yount lived there though no but i since i was a kit i wen there when i was a litt kid and i was fascinated by it there is also a very interesting migration of east coast to west coast creatives including yourself that was it pai plan important part of my life just seeing things and hearing ings that we are meaning ful to me but i for instance i love the movi i'ven't seen the documentary but the ont about shaw mishell boskio boskio because of the characters thetare in it and the huge number of people in that parker posy denishopper and crisfor will and on and on that those images of new york at that time ore exciting and what was happening amh i wish i could transplant myself to that by the time ashine that is where i land first i hear a lot of people say new york isni't what it used to be safrancisco as nin whan he used to be what ever alli isnt there does seem to be something that feels a le but disruptive to people about cities changing but the idea that natural landscapes change is actually we havenen accept a fire sweep through places and assuming they were not started by humans we accept that that change and the reordering of landscapes is normal and healthy ani always tell myself they have the kids growing up in new york or san francisco or chicago now they only know it that way to them it is as cooler as uncool as it is ever going to be i theither want to get out or their loving every piece of it and this happen for all the people thit came before us my questions a very basic when do you miss the new york that you came up in are you somebody who is attached to the past im non past it all i'mount a to anything in the past i do not look back at all you do not think about oh in my dorma mendam why you beasty boy as this i mis now your your optics are forward present and for only only presen forard is there a process to that or it just happens to be where you default to i do not kno i'm not sure that is thit is i do it nostaljas not youdt in rikruben's brain no ulucky you man no i say that with with with genuine whak admiration you can hear a song that maybe you had a arollin producing or not something from the past and you are accessing a state presumably but you are not pining for wishing how it was never i'm no psychologist but i've meen a venture say that i think that is a very unique quality i think a lot of people wish for or wish that things did not happen the way they did that there is a lot of living in the past there is a lot of this notion of people future trip i do not actually think that is the default state of the brain i think a lot of people live in emotional anchors to the past good and bad e an non in watching wrestling is one way that you cleans the palate iciyou can you go to a meal and youre hat they pass around th that and they do the sam more but pass r onlo but assorbay a clens the palat turns out there is a a biological reason for that there is a kind of neutralization of the taste receptors between savory and sweet et cetera wrestling is your a new a palat neutranely if i watch us ing before i go to sleep it is can be good nights sleep do you dream about wrestling now never speminites a minutes it is just relaxing it is a it is just relaxing do you anticipate when you watch it here comes the dopoming het sometimes sometimes when it happens no noting teside o wenter yes sometimes exciting but do you enjoy will even man it is the stakes or low a si i do not really care what happens which feels good that im i'm just be entertained do they actually get hurt sometimes you said they do ala often do do imean the'r basically stuntman imagine stunt man getting her doing a crazy's thun what happens all the time when the movy the wrestler i remember he got staple stapled into him and i thought that is pretty intense i once went and saw am i guess they call that mexican wrestling i doftknow if they call it that any more where the eyes geps at agrate yet they dipp their hands in glass thas was in sacramento and i went un iosley did not a stomach for it i really did not i could not believe it was legal it might not have been legal yet but i thought this crazy stuffin resting sometimes it before sleep is that typically when you watch wrestling yes do you think it is useful for people to have some activity that allows them to hand of im clear their mind in in a and create peace before heading off to slee i think and i think youl cin mites would be god legs i you will gan to drif for wrestling any of the n any those that things yet not watching the dulmerthing i will not watch that i i am i do not watch any horror any anything or ido not violent things new i know it exist i know horrible things happen in the world but i certainly do not want to do that before sleep i think these liminal states before and emerging from sleep are very powerful im when you wake up in the morning im are your thoughts immediately structured or do you enjoy the kind of clearing of the clouds it is as its a slow process for me to wake up and i that i not engaging too much too soon i also am another i usually fall asleep listening to a lecture or a something speaking as that if i'm if i do not i can get caught in my own thoughts and listening to something is enough of a focus point that it stops me from talking myself i do the same my grandfather listene to the radio ut to im sports on the radio and he would fall asleep oftentimes i's a smoger with a cigarette in his mouth his wife's responsibility was ta stay up later than he shurein forn everything down im and then when you wake up you said it is a slow processes it an hour or or to before you feel your i would say probably an hour i usually wake up and try to get in the sun as soon as i possibly can and hope to spend hope to spend about an hour and then i'll usually go for walk on the beach im for another hour and i beminutes pending i are you with family members and other people then i'm usually focused by myself fim i'll be listening to something i do not look at the fun but i listen i listen to again lecture pon caster audiable i ogt your books lot i do to if an idea comes to mind you write it down i may it depends i to are usually a have not would do a note in my phone i do not usually carry pit pany people would me when iwant om walking i do the same i do a long sunday hike or jog and i i will audioscript into my phone im people sometimes give me funny looks cause i'm talking myself and i thet's a nicerwy to do though i'd to learn more of the ado your methods of doing it instead of a typing methods ma now i type and i do not think it is bestway the voice memos function and im i tha i phone and other fhones it is really good and they are now ium companyis a revdock calm that will turn those into were docscripts detter fairly well i'm crracted m fairly inexpensive know their nospons are the pocas i just happen s an it is great im i shal learn that trict from richard axel the nickaret chewing wild man no able prize winter im he writes manuscripts and by walking around is office pacing and talking into his fone i always think of thea would e allan move were the hav allen all the characters wit you knw y talking about y at pes es speaking comedy ideas into the fune it is really pretentious i that movy about harvey milk that chanpanplaye harvey milk iause i'll took place before i was alive mostly in the beytery but there is this these beautiful scemes of him as i recall sitting there at is kitchen table talking into a taper quarter at night telling bout how he predicted that he would be possibly assassining et cetera and this goes aback to the stromer thing about writing things down i rem i think that a lot of people including myself feel a little bit of egotistical gilt around who am i to think that my ideas could be worth while or something but im it i think over time i've come realized that the ideas about experiments or health questions i have about health were the ium they they do not always but oftentimes can lead to real seeds that growing to but its sromsing that is interesting to you it is it is it does not matter what any one else thinks a most of my notes are not for any one else is for anyone else as use i i here about something it is interesting to me and i think abou do not a want to learn more about this whatever it is and men sometimes those things work their way into things i'm doing because h universe seems to work in that way but i really at learning something with the idea of using it i learned things with the idea of this is what i wanted now this is what is interesting to me and thend often those things that are interesting to me can find their way into other projects just because they do yet it is almost coal or kindling but the moment that you think of it that way it it is for it sounds extractive right by if you you take this walk ind your in your i'm writing down the occasional idea perhaps and then i'm what is the next sort of the way that i'm here a less than do this than this than that ia'm interested in i where does your mind shifty does it become more structured as the day goes on does you are thinking become am more structure around projects in the clan a tri do im deal with things that me dealing with after that and in preparation for going to work and the when i go to work it is more free this freething were'm again hoping something good comes a welcoming something good paying attention and i may be trying to will it to happen but never a but knowing i i do not have the ability to make it happen i can just be present for it and be ready if it does arrive some of thit i'm more surprising and i i found rely a interesting and useful features of the book whereabout i'm to dancing with structure and lack of structure when i think of structuri thing dead lines when you are in the process of creating something i'm ivesee dead lines are relevant time of day i there is only many hours in the day where one can stay in the groove or this readiness to receive im have you ever found yourself in that mode where you are conto grinding all here we are oke av not coming home for dinner and ight it is the next yot work in a push well i not that put all the coff upot kind of thing a lot a lot in the over the course of my life a live not is much now i'm and one of the things that i discovered through working on the book was the phases of work where not required to treat the different phases of work in the same way wrs before i did before everything was in misstate of play everything had and a whide open times stedual it happens when it happens and if it takes two years or three years it does not matter that is not about that it is only about this thing as be great and what i came to realize in working on the book is at their theire different phases and the first phase is this seed collecting phase which is kind of an ongoing part of life in general i do that i do that always whither i'vwhe thereare working on something or not i'm always in the seed collecting phase and there is no dead line or a itjust anything that interests me that i think i want to learn more about or has potential to be something anything something i heare something thinking id to read more about that or i wonder if i wonder if there is a moving about that is the removing about that if not maybe there is a movou to be made i could again i want this something i want in my life let us see if it exist if it does not exist then maybe that is something interesting to pursue but i know that the desires there cause i have it of n the seed phase there is no dead lines is just a wide open part and then the next phase is called experimentation phase wer you we start experimenting to see what the seeds want to do you are involved but you are more o a a you are not really dictating the action you are you are setting the stage for something to happen but it is not about you yet it be the equivalent of you would plant the seed you would water it you would make sure it was in the sun and you would wait i'm you are involved but you cannot make it grow and then when it is sprouts and it grows and o if it turns into a plant thand you can look at the plants i o cay had is this plant what is the potential of this plant and then y and than that the third phaseis the crafting phase or is co have this plant maybe him in the trim it or maybe i'm than a da combine it with these other plants to make some something else with it anolse material that you have and then finally is the the completion or or finishing phase which is the final let it get getting to theversion of it that the version of it that is the one that you caldn't share with the world if if that' something you are going to do and i've come to realize that by the time you are going into the completion phase you can have a dead line and it will not hurt the project in fact it might help the project and i did not know that before i've worked on projects that have gone longer than they necessarily needed to and maybe not in the best interest of the project because i did not know that i did not understand that that the timing o that because i because i a'm aware of the necessity in the experimental phase did not have a dead line that i assume that that held through the whole project and and they are it is not a clear phase one finishes and then you start face two face to finishes and you start face three you move back and forth between them i'm collecting seeds all the time i'm always in phase one and thend probably to some degree there is always some version of experimentation going on maybe not now but if something is on a list of things i wone to look at hopefully i'll get get to the list and give them some experimentation and see what they can turn into and then if they do turn into something than they get to the crafting phase wort's more ocay now i have this thing what whato i know about this kind of thing what can i match this with what can i use this for how can i be involved as a craftsman and by the end of the crafting phase or deep into the crafting phase you can start seeing the end you neey can start seeing an end and then you can even dictate an end but i recommend if you do just dictate it for you not for any one else because if something comes up where you learn if you a set a deadline public deadline and then a new discovery happens along the way andyou mus altiys connection be much better than i thought but i need more time it is harder to do that if you set the dead line siould say having internal deadline to get to finish it that said if an unusual situation comes up and it is better for everything not to meet that deadline it is a it is one of those rules that you set the rule to break it if it is what is best for the project a but that that was a dew thing for me and an it help me a lot when did you realize tht in collecting the material for the book and finking about it when when i realized that it was phases i did not i did not know any of this when when i start riting the book i did not know any hardly any of the things in the book they are more an most of it would be reverse engineering some thing that i had experience a successful experience a using these methods without knowing there were methods just following my instincts got me to something good and then i would look back at why did i want to do that and is there a a principle at play that can be of use outside of this case and how dorigt explain that and t that is what the book is as these reverse engineered principles that have led to a good decision making in trying to make things the chapter on self doubt was really interesting to me as wer all tell me what it says rwell you i'll read the first sentence out on becaus itself dooutlives in all of us an while we may wish it was gone it is there to serve us and it goes on to it stribe how to im dance with self doubt in not many words i think there is a saying that is actually from the landscape of psychology which it which is a generally discussed in a in a kind of pathological contect which is if nothing matters anything goes this is usually the phrase use to describe people who feel as if there is no yous in living such as go crazy often to self destruct but there is a light version of this i realize where in some sense thet creative process seems to have something to do with if you are not paying attention to what outcomes are my who likes it who does not it and you are just doing it for you you make the the rule play i wanta delight myself well then anything goes and you have an infinite rule set theretto extract from at least initially as one gets better at their craft you can imagine self doubt goes down i think that is the perception of a lot of people rigt you get better what you are doing you can a landmore three free throws as a basketball player you can hip more home runs as a baseball player cobris more platino maubums as as an artist you self confidence goes up self doubt goes down but thank you and i both know a number of people who are successful enough to know that oftentimes there is a merror image to that where people feel pressure because they did at once now they got to do it again yes or that you think you are good at it it et comes easily anion have to apply yourself arrogance yet self doubt is it is likely hav it is a check on yourself it can either be really helpful or it can undermyt you it is something we all have and if we let it under my nuss and we do not make anything that is not tod but when used as a a balancing tool in our lives it serves a great function where we really do it is o kay to have all the confidence in the world and still second guess is this the best it can be you can doubt i think thet the phrases in ha book you can doubt your way to a great work to masterpiece sometimes that questioning allows you to push further een just excepting i made it it is good ye i've encountered more people that seem to be driven by self doubt and the need to constantly perform and perform again than i have real arrogance just has been my experi ts fortunately i' that is amerigan people in my life but and of course we never as a psychiatrist a who i admire a lot and by o engineer who was a guest on this pock as called dicerot said we we never really know how other people feel it me most the time we do not even know how we feel again language is a very deprived form at for explaining feeling we think somebody feels one way but we can observe an it could be another but we observe their behavior in the sense of returning to the work just always returning to process sone your routine is fairly scripted at least now but the things that you are getting in touchwith restling sleep and dreaming the ocean there is a predictability of them because you can access them in a predictable way but they seem to have a lot of unpredictability in them the ocean is completely unpredictable i also listen to a lot of music that i do not know listen to a lot of classical music an ah les but som jas and a lot of old music that i never heard before and i i being surprised by music and sometimes it really cattures me off gard i micious amalat in when i hear something i at the ever encounter music that really works well live but just does not work in a recording or that is that much better live but the recording a sort of mat you are ofto name ma i do not think if you maybe ther some artists who a great live who have never captured it well on record example would probably be the grateful dids good example would banderei fye their alblums are not their strong point but the you ear live recordings they really interesting really different from each other and that is kind of part of what makes the grateful thayt interesting is there unpredictability i confess i sister who listened the grateful dead and ie got taken to a few shows when i was younger and they would do that as a called space soas these drum solos that would go on for hours and ours is likelhy untithesis of ponhatir s resolsa ninety to hunder and twinty secondstan i yet and i remember thing what is this what is this but people i know love the grateful ded love that uncertainty about were that that drum thing i think they do call it space forgive me dead heads i'm not enough of one to i get it right u but they are looking for something and sometimes they find it and if you are dheare we may find it we feels exciting itis not just a it is not just following a script it is something is really happenings it is a real moment sa something that i i aim for in studio is to create real moments that when you hear them they do not necessarily sound perfect they sound something that really happened and in that moment something happened and it is a special moment and you you can feel that if they were to played again it would not be that ther's something really exciting about that thit is it is really what it is how jas jasworks as well and i'm i think some of bringing some of that jasmentality into other types of music is is really interesting makes for compelling things cause when you hear them ire's a certain amount o am you you you really have to pay attention to do it when you are doing it you are really paying attentions i i do not really know there is no music there is no in othere is no a there is no map to follow and now we are working together to make something do i play or not play when do i play and your really paying attention and can i adt or you go to start adding something someone else at at somethin thagoi cannot do that and s everyone is just in this thing in this moment experiencing this thing at once that you can feel as a listener and we get to we get to hear their excitement of finding it and it is thrilling when it happens i ii that experience i feelin that is kind whant the dead do live the play songs in different ways umand again i do not know very much about the dead and a sort of a newer ait is newer for me to listen to the dead growing up i never listen of the dead but probably because i heard songs on their abums and thought disit us whenly speak to me but i think that the atoms do not really reflect what is special about them i think a lather shows are recorded riter o veitape yes irs but by by fands which they i'm supported they supported that everybody come everybody take everybody trade tapes it made sense for who that man was they read tefind or they defind skeemse me the notion of followers and may people literally gave up their lives or spent much of their lives i literally driving from city a city to follow them but because it is not my going from city to city to watch a movy over an oer for thi's not a movy it is different every night it is changing prey incredible phenomenon usay i do not now of anything else quite it except cults and then those often do not end well i think i guy that i mixe the punch at that for the jellants town masker went to my high school that was the s that true i thaink selyisand my sisters really got at all this kind of eventy's eighty it is dark psychology trivia she is very person but dreda seasomof which no it is about san francisco i sixthes as great below it one ay a book ougt to check it out the way you describe a experiences going by and time and or or things emerging in time and the creative process being a way of observe grabit catching capturing those moments maybe re rrange we maybe watering et cetera i thought was beautifully captured in the in the analogy you gave about a kind of a comb a conveyor belt going by of things right that we thing of the creative process it is in a land in us or we are gin to enter it ore that we aregin to sit therein a chair in lek grid our teeth the othere is a somehemming way quote on were you just sit there in staire at the page until the beads of blood form on your forehead or something maybe you was him maybe as someling cowsker salling anyway inlly get this wrong people tell me in the comments maybe no one said it it was a drang but i love this conveyor belt thay te that reminds me of being in laboratory doing experiments thinking i mus trying to solve one thing and then seeing something else and then having to make the decision is that really cool enough to drop everything and go that direction or to kind of spend a night or a week or a career going that way an me tese er cont of big decisions given that at least as far as we know we are we aregong to live a hundred years or less an but this idea that we have thoughts and experiences in our past and we can dr drawn and try to make good decisions to be to be grabling things off the conveyor or not i hearing you in im s trying to realize that being attached to the past might be the worst thing that one could do in terms of being able to make good decisions in this context because it we have a kind of a play book of what is worked an what has not work but you exshould talk about this there is a a passage in the book that im i'll just read it im to be beware of the assumption that the way you work is the best way simply because it is the way you have done it before i sat with this page for almost ten full minutes which is not something i do very often may you could elaborate on the sol bet i mean we want to have mechanisms and routines we can trust but this is a i think an important warning when when something works it is easy to be fool into believing that is the way to do it or that is the right way it is just a way and it is just a way that happened to work that time and this pleasing to wen you get ah advice from people who have more experience than you you would explain your situation they tell you their advice the advice that they are giving you is not base on your life for your experience as spaced on their life in their experience and the stories that thei'r telling are based on experiences they have had theter that have very different dat of points than yours maybe they are giving you good advice but maybe they are giving yo good advice for them and not giving you good advice for you and it is it is easy when we try something and have a result positive result thinking this is it everybody can do this the way i ii was vigan for long time twenty years and then i started eating them i startieding animal protene and then eventually changed my change my died a few times to the point where lost lot of weight the we that i did it work for me be right before that happened i did a something that i was told that everyone else who did what you did they all lost wait for whateve reason i did not the idea that we know what is right for some one else i think it is hard enough to even figure out what is right for ourselves and if we do somehow crack the code of what is right for us be happy we have it and then still know i wonder if that is the only way maybeis an even better way that we are not considering an a not to get comfortable with thinking we know how it works just because we get the outcome we want i was raised in science with a principle it was literally dictate to me as a principal almost a rule or religion which was that the brain is plastic it can change and learn until you are about twenty five and than the critical period's end in that is it and this was a rule is semtite was dictated a noble prize which was very deserved given to my scientific great grand parents they deserve it un but i was told there was no changing of brain structure function in any meaningful way after age twenty five or turns out that is completely wrong sorry david and towards them but they knew it was wrong wol bety interesting yet i was actively suppressed because there is a competitive nature of prizes and discoveries at that time and a guy teme mike mersonic and his student on grey reckons on were showing tt a dull plasticity exists and only now as this really strying to emerge as a theme i just crazy there were many reasons and the taxtbooks said it we were all told it and it changed our behavior now we know this to be completely falsers plasto see throughout the life spen there is limits to it here and there but it is just far and away a different story why would that be the onely time matever exactly and and a but the field was run by a very small cabal of people that all field sa rund by verse in al cabality owho havan investment in things being t way they are now becaus there in chare and one of the great things about getting older is that well fortunately every one eventually ages and i i hope that you kow a david unfortunate passed away he was lovely tornson's levely hes still alive and they would say i think twardston would say yh we should have been a little more open or kind in in allowing these other ideas but i think that but just think about all the years at e wasted wi this misunderstanding absolutely absolutely and and it wen beyond that and there would be b s specials that help propagate the senor one of the gols of the podcast has been to tryand shed shine light on ideas that at first seemed crazy i know you and i are both a semi absessed with the health benefits of light and you here about the stuff negative eye on i thera be it sounds crazy right sounds something yo wouldonly heare about a asilan or in big sir turns out negtive ey onization that theraby for sleep and mood is based on really amazing work out of columbia by gynan michael terman the nobell prize i think t was in nineteen sixteen was given for phototherapy for the treatment of lupas this idea that certain wavelane sob ligkt can help treat medical conditions is not a new idea but somehow we see a red light were not used to seein red lights except in sunsets and on stop lights and somehow it bothers people or it makes them feel lik it undermines a a business model that does not take red light into consideration right until it does and then it was and then it is coopted there and the place that what i look to his acupuncture yel for a lot of years people said well acupuncturer this is no mechanism no mechanism or meca there is a a lab at harvard gyname chufuma i kno reasonably well whose laboratories dedicate to try to figure out the biological mechanisms of acupuncture and theyare discovering what everyone has known for thousands of years which is that incredible effects on anti inflammation the got mycro mm a i've a friend who was having a terrible back problem and i suggested that he see an acu punctuous and hou went to the accupuncture that i suggested and his fack problem completely healed almost instantaneously and i asseim have you been keeping out because he get another another flarip is ac ni i cannot go back there because acu puncture as a work as it will it you saw it work for ou te capitis nof science he is got it there is now there is good science and published in primiar journals it it is interesting is is a libit of science editorial but since we to exchange information about health and things that sort the editorial staff of a journal dictates what gets expublish in what does not and the premer journals have a an outsized effect on what the media covers and the beautiful thing is the journal staff now is of the age that they grew up hearing about acupuncture hypnosis has a powerful clinical a fact if it is done right youl gan nee dra and similar practices and the tides are changing but i sometimes to take a step back and think whater we confronted with now that seems crazy that in ten years the kids that will be the as to me their kids will be journal editors mike oh ye absolutely i'm making this up but putting tuning forks against your head or something that sound sound wave theraby i think when one adopts a stance of we we have to filtere everything through the limitations of our biology but also through the e social sociology of a the way culture goes it becomes a different story how do you deal with that not just in terms of of health but in terms of thinking about anything selnds you do not spend a whole lot of time thinking about what people are going to think is cool or not no i her here a har yeyou still are i cannot i ga i just know what i in what i kdown't i know it works for me what does not you kno i try things and i'm constantly looking for new better solutions to anything and wherever they come from dos matter it could come from it come from stamford or it could come from the gi a talking himself on the street if it works i'm good and it does not really matter to me at all ii do not hold dem i do not hold any of it tightly fortunately there is now a division of the national institutes of health called complimentary health complimentary and alternative health and it is it it is amazing and see see i age as run by a woman who has published on this is interesting the a some of the anti cannot sir effects of things acupuncture i'm not that i compuncture can cure all cancers but but real ent real data that i think for a lot of people certainly of the generation above us you knowt they just ilike not interested it it sheds new light on the am andrew wiles the pul standments is that the wild ones a ozun there'byr there is many there is many can look i you for long time nutrition was just thought of as something that does not matter what yo it is it is what medicine you take in what it is ixs the food is everything food food is a powerful a powerful variable in the landscape of a von ly nutricion it its sort one of the third rails for any one myself whos out there on socia mit you do a very good job of putting out posts on twitter and in surrand but each day you take get down you put up a new one and i do not talk about any i only talk about i i talk about creative ideas i do not talk about anything specific related to m anything other than youknw may be something likedo not believe what you hrit exactly a well in the landscape of nutrician sometimes i i now place it through the filter of a professional wrestling you have got your you are vegans in your omin of orders and your your carniv wore m d and you have got liver king and yu got everything in between right you could translate that to any number of different areas fashion probably has its people i'm just not aware for that music has theirs and sports has theirs and science has theirs characters are we all just pro wrestling characters in these different domains and we are taking ourselves an each other way too seriously it is all we would we do not know anything it is all if someone has an idea an it sounds intereting you try it and if it does not work it is okad try something else you are an empiricist ye whatever works wet it works and if something seems interesting to you and you are excited by it why not try it it is you kno i tried very fringy things i in some ways the more unrealistic it seems som more interesting it is to me because i feel that is getting closer to something that done somebody does not want me to know but you are not a big drug guy the big psychadelic craze that is happening now and that happened yong yours no i'm not against it it is just has never been something that i've done yew yethat is it is an interesting area that is teffling making it hadway inside of standard acanemic science in medicine now that i'm interested non pharm pharmological approaches to things whatever they are i'm a big believer that also that behaviour old duws and nots at first are that they are the most fun to explorer because in general an less it is something am jumping between a buildings doing parcoreseling it but most to time you are nocan a injure harm yourself and there is more room for iteration than there is with a pillar of potion although certainly farm a collogy has its place you have had creat of works certainly within the realm of music also comedy and producing film and other things for somebody out there who of whatever age that they maybe they are creating maybe they they theyre they know they have this creative unten i not the source is outside what was it that trummer said i ussue wrote this on the wall of my laboratory no in put no output we that is strummers law it is written in my laboratory the people my lavers ar what is going on here i think one guo under knew wing i was but ite's a picture of him and picture my bull dog and yoknow in put no out but i do not think i can just stay in a room with four walls in a ceiling nothing else and and create i mean i know that there is certain number of things in here but i i do think accessing the world is aman in world is giving us clues all the time for paintention it is men part of it i you payin attention thing that you are looking for is being either whispered or scream to you in the outside world if you are paying attention well in i've i i forget the exact title of the chapter but om there is a chapter about staying open to clues or or being on the look out for clues now i'e feel tempted to look for the exact title of that chapter but be look for clues as iy they look for clues sounds i at sounds right and since you wrote it om com gussonans raht do you think they are clues in in every everywhere yes ithink theyre cles everywhere for if we pay attention well houre frase triggerim a thought we will see something unexpected in if some one recommende something to you maybe it is a coincidence if three people recommencingthing to you may it is not ou know who knows who knows i do believe the universe is on the side of creativity and the universe is supporting things to happen and they can happen through you or they could happen through some one else if your pay attention maybe'll happen through you we had a guess on the pycestnime just in sonober he is an expert in the got mycro byom and he applied something that without knowing he applied the opposite principle the opposite is true principle i'l wee tie about these trillings have got mycro byoda that clearly are doing amazing things to create or transmitter is in governour brain and even decision making how much sugar is in our system driving appetite t cetera and he said we think of them as cargo well i maybe wore just vehicles and they are in charge ythat all of our interactions lac every time we shake hands or touch or is were exchanging got microbiota and we think of intelligence as a as thinking an intelligence and he is a a microbiologist and in in all seriousness he said maybe were the ones being manipulated were the house cats and we think here we are were falling in love and kissing and shaking hands and washing hands and a doing all sorts of things to isolator or connect with one another and maybe they got micro by otore really trying to optimize their sthat is what dem lerd hamilton said that on point in the sona that when you are in the son an it is really hot the feeling that you have of wanting to get out could be the bad critters in your body that the can'p handlei let us get at a are't strying to convince you from the inside to get out maybe that is where the that feeling of being compelled to get out comes from elon getting us all to mars might be a bit of maybe they just want to get to mars and there a maybe as i'm starngto feel am channelling freedmen here for a moment now i think this considering the opposite as really he and while it might sound mystical to people or little it we are just playing with ideas thit is exactly what you do in science some one walks in with a result and says i found this this is true an you sav but whitif it is all something else a good example might be here i'm pulling from pi casts epizodes o that we have have but a leocrome is this amazing psychologist who were son belief of facts your knowledge strongly shapes the physiological outcoming she had the amazing graduate these as were she said would if all of exercises placibo all of it ye have burn some calories and does some things turns out this is not the case but in turns out a lot of the effects of exercise posive effaects lowering blood pressure relieving strass posiben or placibo and but nobody thinks of it that because we are attached to calories burned et cetera i think that is a big point that the belief part of it is a huge part of the conversation about everything in what we believe has power if we believe we could make something great the chance of us making something great a better than if we do not believe we can ah i iould say any a bility tharness your belief on your behalf is really healthy thing to do and one thing that you make very clear s that while our own abilities may come into question from time to time you absolutely believe that the elements from which to create are out there absolutely all all the elements are are are yeure everything is here we get t pickinshus we get the conveyrvilts going by with little telittle gifts and we can first fir ust weave denotice there is a convey about then we notice the gifts and an that is the starting point a men we may even feel a empowered enough to grab one of the gifts and open it up and see what is inside men me that is start something really beautiful that we would not have we would not have done everything everything that that i'd make or have mad has always been besed on something that i see or hear that allows me to see something that i did not see before s i was can to ask you whether not it is important to be happy in order to create but certainly lot of people that we are unhappy were still able to create but the more i listen to you it seems that it is really about an ability to pay attention yes if i'm unhappy or if i'm happy may not be as relevant as wether not ot i'm able to stay undistracted yes i would say that is i was say bein able to state present in the work is probably the most most important part of it and how you feel is less of an issue in th less how you feel gets in the way of you feeling how the work makes you feel in what i'm saying if you are in a lot of pain and you'r looking at a piece of art it may be hard to know how that art makes you feel because you are ethe big signal in your body is the physical pain i'm sure there is some people who can do that to who can even through the physical pain can feel it there is tis idea of transmutation of taking one emotion and contorting it and coopting it into another action in an adaptive way but this idea of distraction being a problem i i this really resonates i think when i think of times of great productivity is when i was able to be undistracted thit i could also see how success can be its own distraction this is often discussed in the contects of fighting sports where some one starts making a lot of money and pretty soon their focuss becomes all the things they can access with their success as suppose of the thing they got them there in the first place om keeping an under dog mentality yet now before we conclude i do one ask you about one other aspect of process which is meditation a meditation an is interesting to me because when we close our eyes as most meditations are done and we focus on our brain our brain has no sensation if we i would not sey we focus on on brain oh or we focuss on something other than our normal experience that how would you defind meditation well it is different the're a different types of meditation usually either way wei would say there is no form of meditation over focus oner brakin o latewe dis agi would say here the things that happen we either are engaging in a montra which would be aversion of a almost a creating a trance for ourselves not unlike listening something when we go to sleep that would distract our conscious mind from participating we would be overriding ar a the the talking mind with just a sound that we are generating or word or a phrase series of phrases it medimetit meta meditation is ofn a loving kindness meditation with phrases could be that a work could be focussed on the breath but the purpose of being focussed on the breath is ti not her the self talk that we normally have it is a it is a single pointed focus exercise in those that i describe the other version is 't awareness meditation we youre closing your eyes and your being with whatever is and noticing if we were to do it now an hand you coun doiteyes opener eyes close within awareness practice but the first thing that i would do is i would feel a i feel little ringing in my hears might be from me aletronic equipment around us that i do not mean that i hear the sound it is a a vibration i hear cars passing in the distance see what else comes up i can feel a feeling in my chest i can feel on this part of my face not sure wy eel it is related to my jaw mor car sounds iam awere of a little feeling of warmth yoso now iwould say the room in the room feels a bit warm i was 't aware that befor when i was not just being with what is happening i feel little itch on my left shoulder in thatthat would be in awareness practice which is another kind of meditation we are just hing intention what is going on there is no story this now this means this none of those things just an inventory almost of everything that comes up when it comes up and you do that for preeto time but in in all those cases and in the example of doing the wareness meditation or doing a montrameditation or focusing on the breath in none of them am i thinking and another mi concentrating on i'm o i'm i'm being aware of the of sense perceptions in the awareness one or in the other meditations i'm doing a practice that i'm not aware of thinking about anything else when do you start meditating and how often do you meditate now i learned when i was fourteen and at i started with t m and that is probably the the meditation that i've done the most in my life and i come back to although i tried many different kinds im and also different physical forms of meditation tiche things that i meditated for five or six years and then i stopped when i went to school to to university and then i started again several years later and when i started again i realized how profound it was not in me that i had done it when i did it i usually of some sort of a some sort of a practice in some ways the beach walks could be a former meditation im but the for me typically i would wake up it be the first thing i would do during that started in between time maybe go out in the sun close mycen meditate befor starting my day ii if i'm doing it twice a day the second time would probably be right before dinner if i'm doing it on a regular schedul then if if i find myself on an aeroplane i might meditate for an hour or for i've can remember one time

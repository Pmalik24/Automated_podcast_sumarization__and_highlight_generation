dreadful and feared hamlet machine wors tam would dits of his kind of a weird play the central character is in a situation that very few of us are ever going to find ourselves in his uncle killed his father and then married his mother in order to become the king the place for hours long the main conflict of the play is a guide debating in long complicated monologues whether or not he should kill somebody what is there in that for most of us to relate to why supcors we happen to be murderers n what ould the way be if it were actually performed by murderers another violent criminals what would they see that the rest of us do not what the day in our prokhm we answer that question and the answer is a wat i wourd the course of six months reporter jack hit visited prisoners at the missouri eastern correctional center ith is a high security prison from the first rehearsal to their last performance a back five of shakespeare's hamlet were diviting our entire program today to the drama that he found there i prok hm to day act five we bring you what we believe is one of the most ivocative productions of shakespeare done anywhere in two thousand to when he woul have had a hard time getting tickets to is only performed in prison here is jack hitt the first thing the hammy when i pass through the thick iron doors is a tiny black box called a screamer pull the courted tach an ae falinx of arm gars will sweep from all points of the prison and try to rescue me i keep in my pocket as i inter a huge yard with more than the thousand prisoners wandeng round some of the ginds are playing handball against walls some ere lifting waits as i walk across most or friendly a couple of the skin heads ther orms dense with spinder tatis narrow their eyes as i pass a cross the yard there

tables in thi sinter black last room beneath inspirational slogans believe in yourself think positively the aspiring cast is half black half white and ranges from young lifers in their twenties to old timers in their fifties because it is against the rules to congregate an audience of felloncs for the four hours it would take to perform the whole play agnes is staged one act every six months starting in desember nineteen ninety nine to night is the first greed through at five the final bloody climax many thein mades here never finished high school and all thet had known of shakespeare was the fhrase to be or not to be to night the ahering some of the other famous speeches for the first time pestilence on him for a mad ruge rogue rogue he pored a fack lagon a flagin of renish renish on my head once the same sculls sir was sure yoric skull the king's gesture les bore your i knew him aracio te fellow's infinite jist of most excellent fancy he have bore me on his back ar thousands i must reethris with any class or terrible or this one is terrible do the actors know it but they plough on through the script and in mat name paul who serves is agnes as assistant director explains why first two reacts at aoo there s nothere is no way wher to get this sang down an go the elive performance in e was soliloqually to pags lon othethers no no this is is impossible but well erd in here i gues s from perform in in here at done time again was the iu'll beca it will workint the local critics agreed with paul the act four performanceer to review in the saint lof his paper the actors were said to be commanding and compelling but the entire performance the reviewe road a four hundred year old text is restored to freshness it seemed hard to imagine en i've seen hamlet a dozen times i've seened have inclined to it at the public theatre i saw the famous diined vinora version three nights in a row ages sowht in ma bergmans production don a brooklan performed entirely in sweedish what else is said to learn from watching another hamlet s but the truth is this production was different because this is applay about a man pondering a violent crime in hits consequences performed by violent criminals living out those consequences after hanging out with this group of convicted actors for six months i did dis cover something i did not know anything about him remember how it starts hamlet sees his father's ghost who explains he was murdered by colaudius hamlet us uncle the ghost command hamlet to avenge his death by killing claudies the play is basically hamlet pondering this single herific action and whether he can be the man to do it to be or not to be these days when people say the name hamlet it is usually just to metaphor shorthand for somebody who was afraid to actwho dithers and thinks to much we on must forget just what action hamlet was contemplating these acters have not forgotten the name is mamlet johnson and im thirty six years old i here for two first three assaults a play hamlet when youare on stage doing hamlet what do you draw upon in your own experience to make the the character come to life the idea of wanting to heard somene i have experience hurtings on ont to know to to the one of their in their life may be in danger i was very confused an angry person on and it es calate into me chooting a two people and leaving them for did oh my name is cris harris on thirty ight years old and i play the fourth character of hamlet let me explain something the character of hamlet is played by four people they are all on stage at the same time taking turns delivering the lines agnes tod this partly to give more actors speaking rolls and not sadle any one man with all that dialogue but is theatere it works hamlets roll is full of long soliloquies and retorical asides this small gang of hamlets which mutters to itself and laughs at its own jokes nicely captures that fractured quality of hamlet us different personalities and it is also bonded the four actors together they call themselves the hamlets and constantly talk about their character to chris it seems hamlet is just the fifth guy in their odd cleak another criminal with a complicated past le put in terms of you are two thousands will be have as an upper middle class youngster nineteen twenty years old awho colls smell will to do famly they will not quite a bit of land o the people in a small town respect im a level and a is uncle a murderd this father and is now married to his mother i mean all kinds of serious asyu ir all kinds christen the hamlets practice alone most days finding time when the four can just get together by themselves as tough when this always a thous and inmates around they do it where they can on every sunday after the noon meal the floris will assemble will have our little gray hamlet books and we will posee down to the track and if you are simply walking bye which ywou'd probably here is you would hear this chatter of somebody given their lines clearly the rest of us with our heads down in the books walking the line now there are there are people ecause there are benches that are all throughout the inside of the track there are people actually watch us you will hear this old english style speech in all oh whole oratio and these people ik o what one of the problems of doing any play in prison is it being a good actor is the exact emotional opposite of what it takes to be a successful inmate rather then close off all feeling and looked touf you have to open your vulnerableself up and withstand often cruel laughters you try to find some authentic commotion within you an this way a level four igh security prison is no different from high school and most of the inmates who addition for agnes tend to be actory people the theatr types of pris on back in nineteen ninety nine he just had to put up with abuse from the bigger meaner in mates but that changed fact a lot changed after agnes cast the roll of hamlet us best friend my name eis durick big hutch hutches i play o racio the scolar you might be surprised to learn that derick big hutch hutcheson is big he has a smooth bawled skull and hooted threatening eyes the cande gother if he met him you might think he is probably serving a hundred and twenty years for arm robberies and that would be correct hutch is not the rest of the cast and he is the first person to tell you in prison you got his howwalk he sist lisen thet's com paed to theos you got te minows and you got to kill a wal min old bean lows kill a wl ies to which are you big hutch i'm the blue way the mean i control to kill a wals and i can up do minnls if i wo nd i mean as i dis mostly guis in hem the minnows i mean i do not know n ye woild assubsiate with hm last heap plat say the killer wall verses the gopies and where il gopisand heis the iller well that is tim who plays ostric and as a minnow slash gopy his take is a little different an dailing wat an endivedual a killer well ilit that is a lot if eight in for ham as a lo shell the guy seein own he are are i now sem the guis hat coming to hamlik seeing how he has an acting at and the seriousness and he takes he is not what his person as in other words he is an actor but big hutch is also a critic his criticism is sharp and extends to place his most acters a void his own character horatio i think heis chump for real it thin s cho i mea pol to be cool with hamles the best fra wit i than a ragols jus some ma a soundin boy for hame i mean a majority of his lies is a my lord yes my lod i mean i wea fraid we do not

hein a fiv and i'm get really drink a cup of paws an i you stop meno i mean kno down alime and that i'm really yor frent in n have you never heard anybody talk about shakespeare's characters this way hutch was always doing this talking tough but then betraying a real gift for literary criticism call it his inner minnow in fact he pointed out a weakness in the structure the story i'd never heard before an all my experience with the play that hamlets dilmma over killing claudius is not really much of a dilemma do not see to comfly i do not see whet haml is dealing with man i oh i should kill a cheen now i soon kill him now o wance your father see re ves and you knew use gont duts who was the bo about do i mean same way i could not see somebody rapin my daughters som a just seen roun no no no no no i got to do you man and hat's just you dont he lit to ham his old minl to are there no reason s to delay taken swift action even if you are convinced that you have been wrong hen that is why he stays is to play within the play right to make sure the claudy assis te bad gay see deve whel we got to go back now f i'm strong enough to believe in gols i ded i'm strong enogh believe wit the gos to all me om strong enough to belie you e gold ded i'm strue as what happen se you once huch get on this rif he kept going ten mark to prison hamlet tells rosan crantsnack too and i says you could do a version of the play that takes this sentral metafor literally all the characters in the play or types he seesin the yard every day the claudiusis will do anything for the emblems of power money drugs high intende shues polaniusas who kiss up to the powel for rosin cranson gildersterns ros a chance yis o o man ministration pusm gi ot te just gives i milfol he got you rat and in hutchis

an especially riskty interpretation of the part the tim explains that folks on the outside have a teevy movig understanding of prison sexuality therei's a small group of gay prisoners in the conige another smaller group the etectually out and then there is the bask majority of prisoners straight men not having any sex at all just outside toa n inon ta ans a o wets re o iwigan a tar ware lyan he sleaps into the grave putting on a plain prisonmen is difference a first agnes always has to de with some lastmin a crisis to night one of the hamlets cannot come an he was a saulted and was placed in solitary for protection fus everyone must be strip searched in the side room efore and after every meeting with agnes or with me worse it is incredibly hot the room is stifling the only relief is an anctient stand up fan in a corner and a lot of the time the actors a justrying to figure out with their lines me here is cris one of the hamlets thereis a yell a piece of dolliga give a five too in which i'm i'm talking to a raciel about how i got rosein crants gildenstern work and it is tards rass up from my cabin the se gown scarfed about up from my cabin my sea gown scarfed about me i did not

if you on't keep exercising your mind an u stor to lose i s ayou know as possible right this gives me opportune to seea a society behind what i'm used to i'm familiar with rat music and vidios and it buts only tevian ot at but let me come back to something tou notfor me you would nd no let me get into something else that open that did op meyes into getting to reading sivia pladin frost and and whys wort fon different other people o everybody had powerful answers for why they were in the play one guid with a third great education level said that he was surprised to find out that he was not stupid just un educated and for almost all of them acting was beside the point but one an make a bit by the dramabug and bit hard his first step on to the boards was a revelation i'm james word a'm thirty two years old and i play the rold of laritis my wife told me that i should be an actor ses sa you can act you should be a actor sees had the opportunity to see me deal with certain people on certain levels and see sa me saints wycertain people uncertain laves i ga com o it ta let us as he say in thein the editorial vuses es eir that ot lo well i've always wanted to be a kind and i've always wanted people to me i wanted to be liked and thenvinmen that i was in it people the begar those what the heroes in in our neighbourhoods te beg i and i want from this real quiet church goin tit is real bega and i get around them and i be yo i'm this in it you knowan and would acted ' saynt i big bed tough and i do not care when that really was not me yecause when i went home at night i fell bed about what i did and most of a time was skirt to deaf doin what i was done and my wife sawt him you knowin that is whys i think thas oneer reasons why seems you can be an act james's word looks an acter he is young and handsome with a smile that can carry him through hise about any situation he placed larities the brother of a feeliing for the first few acts larities was played by an homase petifile that is another story but the amish petafoguad transferred and it is almost legend in the prison now something out of forty second street james word stepped into the roll he created a sensation among the cast when they realized what a really forceful performance could do for a character word made a lasting impression even on the killer wail you come along in a fol and you ged jus god jave word the words pla lerty he was e was idt spelly when he was more than the devil feel you wo se fool he mades his interest if heu fel be out to the cee an the quees tople old oer it may use to see tis got a word maye come be doi drop to his nees and e that wha wha i se we i soud ae been my por da i knew i had done a good za i did i knew i had done a good jib but when it was old and everybody was leaving in shaken hands and interacting with each other the comments that was coming afterwards we had our questions and answers many people was man you was good have you done this before youed to do this more youed to continue this and that feeling for me was tis it was one the best things i've ever fell it was the it was the day my daughter was borne and it made me ant to be better nd i jest an act o me it jus opened up a whole world from man if i apply myself i can pretty much do what ever i wo oh trouble wo fal ten times trouble on theit cursed head whos wicked deed i most ingenious since deprived you now how your dust upon the quickand dead soov this flatter moutin you have made to overtop old pillon what the skyis head of blue olempus the first chance i get to see word in action as if to nates rehearsal where larity's ghost to the grave of his sister a feeliun word was a natural and talked about acting that way too arty's emotions and the final act rollar coaster from grief to fury to shameful regret pull it off word channel's larity's character in a way that should make any method actor cringe with jealousy coming in to act for he was very ang violently ang and i can i dentify it that and i can playe tat roll very well because i've been playin that r or all my life mus ter no more be done no more we done ler in ter a from her far no pru to flas an baless friend i ta ti o salest frees i me fe o se my sis to be win tow lis howlin you no a san and lerities he falls in to the mnif you lace and he becomes a bag a for a little while because he is being deceits ful now i never en the that it was somewhat cowardly and i can relate that my pass life as a criminal to put a gun in somebody is face this a unfair advantage unless ta cowardly at that is what criminals or we are cowards when we are criminals we are cowards do you feel you can belarities because much ofiliarities is inside james word y am there it seens am am coming out what the ghost of hamlet us father can teach you about murder in a minute mchicaco public ratio when our programm continues it is his american life am my re glass if he just curning in what were doing to day is that were devoting our hosho to jack hitt's story from the missouri eastern correctional center wherever the course of six months jack watch prisoners rehearse and stage act five of hamlet again heres jack as the performance they grew closer an i spoke to more more of the actors it became clear that each actor used tos pass and then psychological ways to understand his part all the hamlet saw themselves in their version of the dane and edgar would stop me in the hall to tell me that he thought evil king quadius had some redeeming qualities but for one actor the relationship was even more complicated he used his part telp understand has passd my name is danny waller im forty four years old the character that i've played was the ghost of hamlet us father the reason i chose that a when i first read the the script the words jumped out at me and they made me feel things that i have not felt before what what what in your what in your experience drew you to those particular words a i took a man's life and a i felt he was talking to me through that that he a he wanted me to know what i put him through a i am thy father's spirit doomed for a certain term to walk to night and for the day can fine fastin fires till the foul crimes done o my days of nature ar burnt purged away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets in my prison house i could tal on fold whose lightest words would hurrow up thy soul freeze thy youn bood and make thy two imes stars start from thei sphers there is one other spot the ghost this thus was i sleeping my brother's hand of life of crown of queen it once dispatched cut off even in the blossoms in my sin no reckoding mad but sent to my account thall my imperfections on my head and the it was pretty much the same way with him he he was ho was si taken before his time wso when when you read the character are you do you feel am whos talking when you say those lines i'm i'm the body up there a but the words or coming from mostly a e william pride the the man that i yill he he is he is mostly the one tok wwwhere is not much defence between the actor and the word as you get with an actor who puts his or heard training between the two these guides call it they see it and it is true it is just dead true that is agnes the director besides putting on plays the missouri euster in corressional in her visiting room she is mounted chows on more familiar stages the cclaimed actor studio in new york the bircture festiv once dactorage and the eugenaneal theatr sentr in connecticat after becoming e artistic director of the new theatere in saint louis she started an outreach programm to take professional actors doing dramatic works by writers don delilow and performed them before prison audiences in time the prisoners became the actors and in more time the side project took over her entire theatre company now this is what she does directing prisoners who may not have the chaps of professional actors but have an intimacy with the material that does not exist inywhere else when claudies is in the chopel and speaks about his sin and his regret and is ability to undo it it broke my heart because the man playing it felt all of this things fully and innow i know these guies ave deep regret but it was palpable the audience was stoned you coul hear a pindrop and that was especially true with the in made audienc he says o my offence is rank it smells to heaven if haf the primal eldest cesipime o is i rathers on uarder a bothers m afraid can i not break it ot not the w inclination these shop is will my strong regit

would not discussd the past that was then they said this is now but i had to know one morning instead of visiting i went to down town saint louis not far from the arch and sat in a records depository reading ol case files it was more horrible than i thought one guy i particularly shot a man in the head twice and point blank range another of my new friends raped his pubecant daughter and pregnating her later there was an abortion another friend grabbed a man getting out of a car put a gun to his chest during a robbery and pulled the trigger others had sought of my children younger children the age of my own children i did not fall asleep for a long time in my fridgid remoda in room it three in the morning i had one of those cynematic nightmares i dreamed that a very good friend of mine and edirter a magazine had me over to dinner she got angry with some one else there pulled out a gun and plucked him twice right in the face then she asked me not to talk about it with anybody i panic and the next thing i knew i was sitting up in my hotel bed panting a sprinter it did not take froid to fig ot what it meant some one i knew when was a murderer i wanted to talk to the cast about this but i was anxious i know the sonse crazy but i was afraid i might hurt their feelings i felt they had betrayed me but strangely i felt that i had betrayed them too tere was only one day left to talk just before the final performance before curtain i asked brat to sit down with me i could barely spid out my question we came in here three months ago or five months ago i met yell for the first time as is actors and yesterday we decided to go down to city hall and read everybody's record and we read everybody's record and and i have to say since we met ince i met you was an actor first and now i know what you did it is very hard for me to wrap my mind around this other guy thit is on paper and i want to know how you do it how do you square the the brat jons of what it was at thirteen years ago ye ye but the one that i see on the states to night sain a lot of bractice in tryme di scover who i am no hat's not been easy i was often to dejods and ot as things when i got lotd offor that case and slowly had to come all those things t has i always knew in ta back omo my that i'd always went to the lowest point in li not was time to see what i could do as far as go into the house my lie it was a hard question for any of them to answer they all said the same thing but i'm the gy now i'm not that guy are we for ever the prisoner of our actions to good question it was hamlet us question and it is the unresolvable conflict in our penal system why do we put people in jail to rehabilitate them and restore them to our company or to punish them regardless of how much they might change one cannot hold both these ideas in one's mind simultaneously that is why our prison debates on t v and in congress a vehement and incoherent the two sides cannot be squared by mere politics they cannot even be squared by the people at the centr of the debate here is danny when i when i first o got thi sentence i sid ya i i'll i'll go ahead just die in here cause i do not deserve to be out there the way i am no i was thirteen fourteen years ago and a but a person changes i'm no longer the criminal i used to be i know that i will not do any other crimes i't there but i took a man's life do i de serve to be

quarrel and exchange insults a duelis proposed which culminates in the last sword fight scene er most directors bloscked is scene as a professional fencing match agnes has it looking a knife fight in an alley the audience totally gets it george holds his arms slightly out from his sides his hand dripping his sword he would a shiv he and one of the hamlets are circling each other thugs george jerks

before family in dignitaryes the entire cast found the magic tha paul said would happen during that first reathrough the actors knew that this would be the last time that at to performics a group when danning an stand came out for their final grave digger appearance somehow was al to be son jokes wort hoo en this taeus eaye a ye o having seen every performance i can testify the actors rose above their talencs in that last show mike and hudson as the maligrent breests buck and tommy as the ambassadors sylvesters forton bras you could feel the mutual support just as mis lines and other mistakes play off one another a con spiral downward into fiasco the rhythm of the room can go the other way too strong lines beget better performances the gang of hamlets came together away they had not before at little mobs seemd one voice ut' the real surprise from me that last night was huch a mornansy romen did not day the steel yets some licalel it is here that huchess soratio delivers his most famous line the play is anmyst over hes surrounded by corpses and speaks to his dying friend hamlet inth other performances always thought huch had been played owe i might call the jack nichleson's ha rom the actors persona is bigger than any roll he my play but to night ratio has huch under control and the audience hin his hand he has the one great line to deliver and tas huch might say he nails it

theatre crowd polite well dresse people many of them have helped fun this production they want in fully expect to meet to tellen afterwards and for many the actors this moment they call at the cass party is the most prized james word in edger evans mentioned it specifically when i talked to that just the chance to stand around in a room full onormal people trinkocok and carry on about the play

guards had informed evey one tut they have about ten minutes for the hans party any play all the work is for this moment to get to the end of the last performance successfully and now that it is here

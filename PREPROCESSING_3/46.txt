the menshparashosponsiby express v p n make shure to protect ourself against big tect protect or data at expressypiandicom fleshmen it seems that the chances of civil warn americagust rose somewhat dramatically on tuesday evening the supreme cort of colorado ruled the president donald j trump had to be removed from the state ballot for bote the primaries and the general election they satit amendment fourteen section three of the constitution of the united states that section reads quote no person shall be a senator or representative in congress or elector of president and vice president or hold any office civil or military under the united states r under any state who having previously taken an oath as a member of congress or as an officer of the united states or as a member of any state legislature or as an executive or juditional officer of any state to support the constitution of the united states shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given eight or comfort to the enemies thereof but congress may by a vote of two thirds of each house remove such disability that is what the section says the caey s made by the four three colorado majority in favor of barring presidend trump from the ballot is simple they say trump tried to conduct in insurrection in their judghment and thus can be barred from the ballot by their say the courtz hays quote congress does not need to pass implementing legislation for section threes disqualification provision to attach they say that section three is in that sents self executing in other words long as section three says in surrectionists are disqualified from office this means thet congress does not actually need to define what it means to be an insurrectionis any state court can do that what is more the state court says the constitution authorized th states to determine quote the constitutional qualifications of presidential candidates because otherwise states would be unable to exclude at twenty eight year old anon resident of the united states or even i for a national from the presidential primary ballot in colorado the court says it is qualified to determine whoise guilt give insurrection under the fourteenth amendment without any criminal case or any impeachment case or any piece of congressional legislation the court says that quot the events of january six constituted in insurrection and president trump engaged in that insurrection the curt also claims what president frums tirect and express efforts over several months exorting his supporters to march to the capital to prevent what he falsely characterized as an elleged fraud on the people of this contry or indisputably overt and voluntary moreover the evenence amply showed that presidend trump undertook all these actions to aid and further a common unlawful purpos that he himself conceived insat in motion preventing congress from sertifying the twenty twenty presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power this reading is to put it mildly incredibly straind section three of the fourteenth amendment was designed to prohibit those who had served in the confederacy from holding public office in te united states the confederacy as we know was an armed rebellingan against the united states which ended in t deaths of over six hundred dows an americans on both sides it was unclear when the fourteenth amendment was passed whether it was designed to apply to any future rebellion or insurrection or hadot ould be define or whether was even supposed to apply to presidential candidates or those seeking to qualify as such the amendment says nothing about presidential can ninitual notice or exactlly how would be effectuated by states by congress by some other party cart lash author of the fourteent amendment and professor of law at richmonds school of lawrights quote the amission of express language on these issues is significant tbecause prior publically announced to drafts did expressly appli to present and future abellions did expressly name the office of the president of th united states and did expressly bar certain persons from either holding or qualifying for office well what is all that mean it means the very least the amendment did not mean to clearly bar presidential candidates in future elections who took part in future quo n quot insurrections most importantly the amendment is totally unclear on exactly how it supposed to be effectuatent representatofe fhadious stevens one ofthe most radical republicans one ofthe great founders of the actual fourteenth amendment said the taxts would quote not execute itself the congress would have to pass laws makin clear who exactly was barred from office and historicaly as what congress did they generally in forcety mechanism for this provition in eighteen seventy two for example congress pass what was called the amnesty act which stood away with penalties on former confederates due to the fourteenth amendment and congress did passalaw in nineteen ninety four that made it a crime to quote assist or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states presumably a conviction for such a crime would automatically disqualify a candidate from office under section three now even if the amendment were self iffectuating which it likely is not given that this would then preede a huge insenten for states to randomly disqualifi candiates they do not under its auspecies it would still require the state to prove that trom actually engaged in in insurrection the cancst randomly to clear he engaged in an insurrection as the chief justice of the coloradi supreme court bryan bot right said in descent and emember all sevenjuctues here all seven justices of the colorado sbencort repointsd by democrats and this was decided forthry the chief justice of the cource ad quote age time previously served as president place of birth all parallel cor qualification issues under colorada's election cote conversely all these questions paling comparison to the complexity of an action to disqualify a candidate for engaging in insurrection another words if you barred trump from the ballot because he was twenty eigt years old that is a brightline question is he thirty five or not if you barred trump from the ballot on the basis is not a citizen that is a brightline question either he is or he is not but engaging an insurrection without a definition of insurrection without a criminal trial without any sort of evidentiary proceeding which trump could actually be a party barring trump from the ballot without an actual trial for guilt or innocens or even in enactment from congress seems to violate basic do process principles as another justice carlo samor again ap pointo by democrat points out in de cent more rits quote based on its interpretation of section three are court sanctions these makeshift proceedings employed by the district cort below which lacked basic discovery the ability dicappenand documents and compel witnesses workable time frames to adequally investigate and developed defenses and the opportunity for fair trial toch judicate a federal constitutional claim a complicated one atat maskarating as a run of the mill state election cote claim the case is obviously wrongly decided now the good news is that the effact is stayed until january forth that is the day before ballat eligability has to be sed if trump appeals which he is going to do obviously the state remains in a fact indefinitely until the supreme court decides matter or turns away the rid of surcurary but that is not the point the point is that the use of law affair against donald j trump is absolutely unprecedented will get to that point in just

colerado supreme o court decision is massively dangerous irradically undermines lectrol integrity it crates in ad hock wak for political opponents within each state to bar candidates they do not lak through reinterpretation of the constitution and of course this colorado state suprime qorruling is just the latest interation of wild and radical law affair against president trump now certainly true the trump open himself up to this legal hellstorm with his activities leading up to an on january sex his handling of classfied material after his presidency of all human beings on planed earth trump had to know there is an enormous target on his back and is always you cand ove ignored thatn gus did whatever he wanted but that does not mean thet he is not being targeted by a variety of perverse methods the lawafare that is now being to rected at trump is extraordinary it is unprecedented truly on precedented these are legal methodologies that threaten the future piece of the republic i really mean that in very serious ways there re currently four outstanding criminal cases against trump three of which are rooded in basic misinterpretation of statune and the fourth of which concerns mishandling of classified documents a matter for which trumps frorm arrival tileryclinton was leke completely off to hook furthermore the prosecutate in trumps january sixth criminal prosecution happening in washington dec that would be special council jacksmith he is openly attempting to cram through that criminal trial but fore the election specifically in order to damage trumps chances in the election that is legitimately the only reason why you accelerate the time line inviolation of the desires of the devence remember it is the defends that is guaranteed a speedy trial it is the defend did not who has the right to a speedy trial if that defendent seeks to delay the process the only reason to qrunqut rush the process before the election as jacsmith has openly aske the supreme court to do is in order to effectuate som change before te election as from a prosecured anima carthy rights quote the prosecutors proposed schedul is driven by the political calender not lawin forcement it concerns the bidin justice dopartment took nearly three years to charge trump even houghthe facts by then were well establish the indictment was strategically time to trial could take place during the presidential campan not only to smith pushd to force trump to trial and just a few months after smith's on investigators to taken years the prosecutor indited n't washington t c only after locking trump into another complex criminal trial in another district a thousand miles away in south florida what does all of this mean the sprimcourt is likely to strike down this decision but what is allthis mean it means that twenty twenty four is going to be th most insane an ugly presidential election in american history i truly mean that buckle your see belt it is going to be in extraordinarily bumpy ride that is saying alought since the years both nineteen sixty egt and twenty twenty are years that existed in time already parson use of the judicial process to stoptrump has created an narrative for trump that even if he loses he will have been cheated and he is not going to be entirely wrong in fact till be more right and twenty twenty four than he was not twenty twenty in fact if he is barred from ballats if his trial is expedited to effect the election he will be right that he that the election has essentially been corn quot stolen from him even if he loses meanwhile because thes supposedly a political judicial branch has now signed t into this fight on behalf of jobidan democrats are likely to think that trump is just not morally but also legally barred from office and if the supreme court strikes down this colerad o supreme cort ruling that is going to completely undermine the legitimacy of the course unless somehow justice roberts is able to convince a bunch of democratic appointeas to join a judgement in which they overthrow the colerad o upreme court of this thing is decided six three in which all three of the democratic appoint ese to the supreme cort bote in favor of barring trump from a state ballat than every democrat in the world is going to thing that trump is legally barred from running which means that even if he wins there is no way they are possibly going to accept his election both sides are now set to not accept the results of the election under all circumstances if you are republican and you just watched democrats the biding administration the colerdof supreme cort weaponized the law against nonal trump personally to barr him from ballats to criminally prosecute him before the election and then he loses you are going to clama correctly that trump was cheated andyou are not going to accept jobins re election if you are a democrat and you believe that the colerad o supreme court is doing the legal thing and tht a bunch of trump uppoint ese on the supreme court over through that tan trump is legally barred from running because he is an insurrectionist and then he wins there will be massive riots the weaponization of the legal system creates in all consuming firat burns everything in its fact because it is supposed to be the only part of the government that we all trust if you cannot trust the a political part of the goverment the judicial branch that is not supposed to have will only judgment it began trust that an then he out come from the judicial branch is simply a re in forcemen of theve prevailing view of one side verses the other that is going to end in violence there is simply no twenty twenty four result likely to result in anything but compleve and maybe violent chaos that this point that is truly frightening an's being exascerbated as always by our mediofll get to that in one second first i've ben talking about my hulits mattress for years i know its can be hard to sleep

sleep starts right now i'll case donall trumpereacted to the news of this byt pointing out that jo bidon and in fact the use of lawfare in general is a threat to thedemocracy here was present in trump last night it is no wonder crooked jo bidnin the for left lenetixo despet to stop bus by any meansnessessir there willing to violate theuas constitutions hat levels never seen before in order to win this selection jobdon is a threat to democracy to threat the weponising lo forsment for high leve lelection interference because woare beading them badly in the pose gay he is not wrong about this and he're in lies the issue if trump is correctly pointing out that jo bidon and his minions our threats to emocracy and meanwhile donalcrads our suggesting that trump himself thanks to january sect and all if his quotn quat authorituring autitudesis a threat to democracy that means that both sides are now justified in doing whatever the hell they can and want to do in order to stop the other side from taking offics that is that means if you believe that your political opponents in the united states are a true threats to democracy in te united states in the sense the you believe there will be no moralliginimit elections if this is the last ellection if your guy gets defeated that is very likele then in violence actually and that is being exascerbated by all the eggheads on the left side of the ile what is cin of amazing about the deferentral between the right and the left in from this sort of retoric is that on the right the sorts of people our talking about this will be the last electionthere will be no mor elections if jobidon wins the election those sorts of people ten not to be the point y heads on the left sideof the alleet is the point yo heads on left side o the allet us legal furus lorents tribe t harvard lawschool it is the coloradofs supreme cort it is all the sufisticates or making the claim that is onald trump it is some sort of threats to the very heart of re publicanism small are in the united states all the normees are na it is the loud mouth in may not im but he tenima loud mouth tits kenna elic o i really think that he is going to destroy the country wholesell he was president for four years and things ware kind pretty good it is all the ighads on the left side of the isle are creating legal furies to weaponize the actual tools of governments again stonald trump on the right side of the isle it tends to be the normees who think that jobidon is the threats tof the republic in the end of the republic an is all the ighads where i gotterno youknow iman he is really bad presiden but i really not can ave another lochiming trump is running right now that is why the media on the left are really fanning the flames right here beaus again it is the high iecu people on the left woar fanning the flames the most here ' rachel matto over on emis am me see sh does not a crazy thing for democracy o simply band people ike trum from the ballat in

she is sighting wright there post notzy germany when was america notsy germany i'm us wondering when wlike while trump was president at couple of years agois out she is talking about there what she is talking about is basically treating her political opponents a's a debathification effort as a dnosification efort senens you lihoning was doing some the same sort of stff again dep democrats are celebrating the sort of stuff you should not be saught if you are hoping for conciliation in the republic at all you should not be celebrating a rogue supreme courting colorado simply banning the leading cansidate for one of the lead political parties in the person currently leading for pulling for presidents of the united states from the ballat thee matter that trumsoncan in colorado now that matters it is the president here that i's truly shocking and it is creating again the predicates for the argument by trump and many of his supporters that if he loses it will not be legitimate under any circumstances because if the idea behind every crime is that evidence of crime is mode of means opportunity hit certainly hav the motiv the think trumps ofahus it is ertainly of the means barring trump from ballets or criminally prosecuting him and they certainly ave the opportunity meaning the upcoming luction there me a lot of people whoere pointing that out as we move forward particularly trum ploses but here is you honing again under scoring me the idea that i supreme court decision bak by colorados states supreme cort is somehow legitimate and indefensible which it is not wilf this is a historic decision it is a momentous decision as the supreme court itself says they are in unsharted territory here but it is really important to keepin mind this is not the last worriere this is almost certainly going up to the u supreme court which can review the decisions of a state supreme court in factic colorado supreme cort anticipates that possibility and for that reason they put their own ruling on hold on till gjanuary fourh anticipating that it will go up to the supreme court the practical consequence as it stands at this moment though is the dolal trump will not be on the colorado ballet in the race for president in twenty twenty fourt the supreme court almost certainly will take this up it is also important to keep mid for the broader contects there have been dozens of these challenges filed across the country and eighteen or of them have either failed been rejected or been withdrawn by the plaint if this is really an outlir the supreme court is going to have the final say the consequences here are of course enormous and meanwhile gen saki for im press secritary fourt te curm presidents of th united states she saying that of course petty much everything is loch et because absolutely trumpetintler if trump wins and twenty twenty four if the tractors will have to reconcile what it means to sheri contry with many citizens who cannot watchan tront spiro deeper in to its moral hoid and fill conclude yes that is our guy and this is not a fanic total it is all registering in the poles according to a new survey of likely re public and cocca scors and iwa fording to per cent say they are more likely to support trun proclaiming emigrants ar poisoning the blood of america gates o again the idea here from saki an company is that trump is o standing for american fashism therefore has to be stop now the pridictapale result of this entida republican primary is again a boost for trump any time the laft ta tak trump illegitimately a causes everybody on the right including people me to say well maybe you just want it you are gon to get a good and hard you are asking for the fight you aregit to get the fight that is the natural tendency of human

primary t eight trump is still ahead by leaps and bounds in these poles in iwa heis currently up in the average by thirty three points fifty one over to santisis nineteen and nicky haley clocking in at sixteen points meanwhile in nou hampshire you ave trump clocking in an the lates palling at forty four nicky hly at twenty nine cristy at ten and to santis at eleven even if you combine cristy and to santis that would take you to slightly more than trumps total vote but they are both in the race this means the trump wright now is the odds on favorite and the more you attack trump the more people defend trump that is the way that dis works when nickey haley makes the case against trump the correct case by the way the chaos follows trump which jus to say trump caus's chasan thn cous follows him she is not wrong but also when you cause the chaos but the chaos is much greater than the thing that you cause the narrative turns frum you victimized yourself to you are a victum of the system yes trump as i've said clearly and openly many many times was wrong he was lying between the election and january six when he said that sort i fied election results could be overturned by the vice president of the united states it was not true who was not true and he was fibbing about it and he was exascerbating things he is making things worse also ye result of that is not that ou get barred by supreme quarts on the state level frum the ballit that is not it is not that you get criminally crosecuted moltable times a cross the nation and nicky haley is right but it does not matter because again people are resonating to trump in re action two the thing at is being done against him i in present trump with the right present at the right time i gree with the lot of hi follit i had a goo working rel i thingtim withem but right r ar wrongr par follows that we all mara pr foinwe can part of ta but we cannot be or country an diss the ray il nov a world on fire i will not get through four years that car t re can n me even if she is right about that it does not matter because if thet emocrets are seeking the chaos the answer from any republicans is going to be ocat thin you are going to reap the whirlwind that is going to be the response prictoable response fruom republicans meanwhile democrats re ginting use that as o ka wle te're ready to elect warrent hitler fine we will dowhat ever we can to stop him this gin o get ugly quickly by the way as i say most normal people look at trump and when he says wildin crasy things they thinks themselves that is just because he is brash and a loud mouth t's not because he is wrong that is particularly true whone it comes to his rhetoric around itmigration you saw gensocky just a moment ago suggesting that bhecause people support trum more forty to per sent of republicans hav spport from more after his poisoning the blood of our system ilegal migration that that that that is evidence that they support fashism the reason that many people are supporting trump because of his imigration retoric is bicas they believe that he is saying thing that even democrats or saying but he is being panalized when democrats are not case in point to day according to the washington post authorities are not investigating the death of a five year old boy in chicago he' been staying at one of the city's largest magran shelters from new arrivals from us southern border the boy was of the shelter on south halstood stree when the child was reported to not be feeling well accordig toth chicago p d an ambulance took him to the hospital where he died on sunday the cook county medical examiners offs identified at the cago as john carlofs martinas at revero and said the office as not get determined the cause of death it is not clear while country heis from or how he arrived in chicago he and his family were among thirteen thousand magran staying in city shelters according to city records by the way folks on' knowhat it is really down at the border we h that a sunday special with tim kennedy former green berray sniper who is been down at the border participating in humanitarian mission and a it is it is wild check out sunday special fore on that meanwhile the bine administration which has facilitated this massive crisis of the border and refuses even now to sin into law border provisions thats solidify the borer even to get there new crane funding they will not do it meanwhile the white house is blaming wait for republicans on all of this greg abbot here is corren john pierre world's worst press secretary for the white house suggesting that the gest of this five year old migrans in chicago was not the fault of thead ministration for letting in a bunch of unvetded people who may rmy not be healthy het was the fault of greg abbot for sending this kid to chicago the chicage ror a hecer er e ae chia e e oeer trer er er war her seice mer wee always been very clear i ye her me at the coe firs question i i that we believe that governor abbot polithys in is poclon are not f they are not th for tecas communities and or or theb p ar lan porsemen on the ground were tying to do their work we tea in harms way and be be d humanize de humanize an demanize immigrant yet t it is bout the humanization maybe it he is whatsto humanizing is shipping people across the border by leaving the border completely open then bussing them to the interior of the united states no plan for how to deal with them meanwhile the mayor of chicago bran and johnson who is as left as left can be he is suggesting that gregg abbot is attacking the country by sending people on bussis to chicago first of all tit says a healdtha lot about chicago when you'e the mayor of a sinior aman if you send people heres a helscape houre tacking the country by sending people to mi city first all it saying alot but second of all and that the language the democrats used about imigration is the same as the language the republicans use as soon as the emigrants arrive in their areas yere's brandon johnson the issue is not just how we respond in the city of chicago is the fact that we have a governor o governor and alegted o fisshure when the state of texas that is placing famlys on busis with our shoes cold wed tired hongry bafrad tromatize and then the comdin the city of chicago where we have homelessness we have menta health inti tat be set down nclothed you have people who are seeking employment the the governor of texas thes the take a looking the mirror of the chaos that he is causing fom this contry this is not on of the chi cago din amic he is the tacking our contry i gay hes ilegal emigration what he saying ra here is that you legal emigration is an attack on our country is just the greag abbot shipping illegal emigrants up to chicago is the attack on our country that sounds very much the stuff that trumpsites afaut imigration what democrat say it it is them being toleran diverse and republican say it it is them being fashus here is nontal from yesterday saying emigrants are coming in and they could bring in disease agay well i mean that is i'm sorry but that is true that that is that happens to ean this has been truce and s the early twentieth century there is a reason why one of the first scenes in godfather too is a kid being screened for disease as he enters elles island in anycase here heres here is down f i if this were not true title forty two would not be american law title fort you literally alows the federal goverment you turn people away the border if they are suspected of having disease here is nontal from saying the thaying that ever be going craziing combaring him t hitler it is crazy what is going on they ruining our country and it is true that destroying the blood of our country that is what they o they destroying our country they do not it when i said that an i never read mind comthey said old hitler said that in a much different way then the coming from all over the world people all over the world we have no idea they could be healthy they could be very unhealthy they could bring in disease hits cancatch on in our country but they do bring in crime yay again most people o this an the sayle can brannin johns on sayng the same thing wl be's blaming grag abbot down from saying that he is blaming chobidon and suddenly trump is the fashest about all of this which apparently justifies banning him from particular ballats people in the leat circles of media and in leftwing legal circles our playing with absolute fire with i mean i mean almost literal fire with

can a least make the cases at the west was there for twenty years here you are talking abatlic guysan and flatables whe are going up to ships with drones and taking over thion tire ship and the west apparently doing very little about it of course chinas gon to look at thatintaile ca whle i gess that we can exert som pretty significant leverage in the waters around are on coast according tothe walstrejournal ours after the united states announced a multi national task for s to protect commercial traffic through the red sea shipping giants eight people or marisk said it would send its vessels around the cape of good hope and southern africa instead the message was clear shipping firms oil companies enshures remain jittery abou a possible snarl sone theworld's most crucal traderoots iagain totally unclear as to weather the western attemptur will stop what the whothese are doing hoothes have been bulge that pure to have bulging stockpile of missiles an drones annalis had drones the less dangerous than misiles if they slipp through thedefences could prove especially difficult for some ships in the coalition to shoot down onlike the aron arock ware in the nineteen eihties when naval vessels aescorted oil tankers through the region the curn volume of shipping traffic through the straits is way too high to make reloing on protective convoys feasible according to ge maran retired you escinate the captain who commands ed both the destroyer and a cruiser he predice tof the united state would have to strike hoothy targets on land which is correct obviously and by the way wy exactly should the united states andits western allies be shy about striking the hoothes i mean we are not talking here about taking down the entire aranean government or something with a massive military or tom motaking down coostal pirates na men tonge about tane out the hothies entirely you'r tongue about destroying their ability to harass shipping one of the reasons for this by the ways because the the west is has overtect itself in many ways what i mean by that is that for every dum bom tat the hoothes are firing addedded shipping adde a shipping convoy the united states an ants allies are sendin it two million dollar missile you us navy destroyers ar coing to politicl of shot down thirty eight trones and multible missiles in the red sea over the pastumonts according to a defence department official on saturday alone the ust the destroyer you us us carny intersepted fourteen one way attrack attackd runswhich are suicide drones the cost of using expensof naval missiles which can rop to two point one million dollars to shot to destroy unsophisticated who the drones estimated a few vassibout seech is a growing concern according to the d o d the cost off thet is not on our sides to one deo d official their talk about ay be they need use different air defence or may be inset of trying to act offensively against again hoothy pirates you might l ant to actually just destroyd the hoothy pirates this is not all it is a lack of will that leads to this not a lack of resources the united says the most powerful military nd most powerful navian world history and all my

americas politics these days yesterday cafyhokel the governor of new york she says that the state should actually consider slavery reparations in new york which was as you may recall not a slave state i she says that slavery reparations should actually be consider i now because new york obviously has tons of money to spend on this sort of issue amidst there serious crime problem economic turmoil people leaving the stapeicaus ofthe high taxes i ship between her and avanueson my goodness the democrats have a bench we are proud to be home of coradeous sleaders lie carriet togman conduct or the underground railroad buried up in ouber new york to jorner truth frederic douglas an abolitionis lake john brown whos farm is way in the north country we are proud to embrace the deliverange from slavely from the underground railray itself which fran from new york all way te kannada crossthe over nigerfalls where i was yesterday and thet had the strong support of many good and much good will from residence of this state we it is easy for ust to pat ourselves on the back i we did all this lot of othe statestins that but we had the leaders here we took this sin we can say were the heros where the ones who fought against slavery and indeed many did what is hard to emgrace is the fact that our state also flourished from that slavery in a few minutes i'll sign of bill authorizein the creation of a community commission to study the history of slavery in new york state o goty vario oms the reparations and how we can help right the wrongs of the pass is obviously panering it is obviously pannering that they can study any comission they want but the reality is that slavery reporations as completely onworkable as a matter of law how exactly to scriminate on the basis of race a how do you trace back the ancestor mane all these practical questions have been serit who pays do people who arrived nineteen eighty pay descendants of american slaves habout black americans who arrived and ninetn how at hatian americans do they pay exat who pays exactly whare the beneficiars and all this is not meant to actually create any sort of solutions it is meant to exascerbate the probems and exascurbate thedivisions the same thing holds true by the way for this attempt to remove a confederate memorial at arlington cemetery a judge has now loud th removal to go ahead according to the nertimes a federal judge on tuesday cleared the way for the removal of a confederate memorial from arlingto national cemetery just one day after a temporary restraining order had halted the plan to move one of most prominent monuments to the confederacy from the nations most famous burial ground the memorial has been criticized for its anitizes to piction of slavery and its removal is part of the military whide efforts to take down confederates simbols from basis ships and other facilities now why exactly is that happening is not happening because you wish to actually solve the problems of the civil war that is not why because again the reason that these memorials were erected was to effact some sort of reconciliation in the united states post civil war a delicate balancing act that was in part the result of things the fourteenth amendment whic wave bendis cussing earlier in the show a turns out that when you want to keep a country a country youre going to have to require some sort of reconciliation and monuments this weren'n attempt to do that it was not meant to won w obscure slavery as not the idea here the idea hers tha en have one half the contry fighting the other haf the country the only way or gan tand up as one country after all of that is to create some sort of mercy for the loosing sod that is what this monument was about that is why i was un controversial for a very long times to wat the question is wisear controversial in twenty twenty three when it was un controversial in say eighteen seventy when people are watching monuments this be erected and ther family marc ae ben killed by members the confederacy and ye your brothers got shot by a member the con federacy five years ago and nother erecting monument an arlington national why were youoko because people understood that the only way to actually make the contry one again was to effactuate this sort of reconciliation and now if people who are not involved ins who have notpen slaves that parentswere not slaves or grandparent were not slaves yofve people who not have no relatives whats to wetver where involved in the civil war and yohave all of these people who aren'n nout coming forth inting that this memorial offends them now which is about creating conflict in the now obviously that is te gual is not about teaching in fact these monuments as i've said many many times they provide an opportunity for teaching yet tht they provide you n opportune actually have the is cussion bout what was the confederacy why was confederacy wrong why was slavery evil and then why was this monument bilt in the firstlec a geese are good complax nuons interesting conversations you noit is not an interesting conversation whiping away history in orders that you can claim that the problems of eighteen sixty aue the same as the problems of two thousand twenty three which is really the claim the people who ant a ripp down monuments this that is really the gold here alison parker historiant university of delaware said these types of monuments which wee put up in the early twentieth century again there people were still living who had relatives killed im is ofil war whereabout a certain kind of rec if reification of an i stalga based own the notion slavery was not really that bat there is a mis conception about the notion these monumnts neded be preserved as ae representation in some case i thin intocet to take down these contamonuments caus they still carry hurtful meanings to day such absolute tripe this does not make things better in any way shaper form there is no evidence that it does at all an you meanwhile yesterday we discussed at length the catholic church is letter that focussed in on blessames for same sex couples and what exactly that meant and i said that you will for all the talk by hout changed nothing obviously the r pople inside thechurch we are going to take it is changing everything evidence that i am right comes to day curtesy of d and wi vus is out com a peace tadtled making history on a tuesday morning with the churches blessing and i features a picture of reverend james martin a jesuit priest standing and giving a blessing to a same sex couple two men who are holding hands as i said yesterday when it comes to what the church has astorically said what they have said is that you can of course be blessas an individual senter everybody gets blessed as an individual senter there is no problem ot that and that is true by the way for every mainstream religion everyone is a sinter that is not prehebyou from being blessed what you cannot be blessed for is participating in the sin when you have two gamen holdthing hands and receiving the blessing obviously be visual on that is desin specifically to green the behavior clearly and obviously there would be no difference to this and a man divorced and his wife and the very married standing and holding hands in fornal priest was blessing them it would look a blessing of the divorced couple itself that would be the idea as a couple and this was the distinction on's magnestory and reverend names martin is going full ahead with that 'll be fascinating to see what the catholic church does anything about this because if thashle stand by the idea that there should be no legitimization of same sex marriage or same sex activity don me very hard to look at bhat picture and ay that is not a legitimization of same sex marriage or same sex activity if the vadican does nothing that woill be a very solid answer as to what exactly the batican was doing in that letter according t the piest never before was martin permitted to bless the same sex couple not until monday when the pope said he would allow such blessings and announcement that revererated through the church on tuesday morning damian steedl jack forty for and his husband jason steed old jack thirty stood before father martin in living room on man hatton's west side the couple running a bit late because of he subway to lays trust casually samian a floral design or compliment od father martin on the pine smell of the christmas tree in keeping with the vatican's admonition that such a blessing should not be performed with any clothing chestures or words proper to a wedding father martin warno roupes and read from no text there is no blessing for sam sex couples in the thick book of blessings pubplishd by the est conference of bishops well right mean jaw instead he selected a favour of his own from the old testmean he uase depriestly blessing from the old testmant and not let me just tell you as a devotee of the old testament in the original hebrew i can promise you at this a blessing that is not typically bestowed on same sex cuples as they hold hands father martin has frequently met with pope frans about making the roman catholichrirch more inclusive on tuesday morning he was far from the hall's power he was at home making history he said was really nice to be able to do that publicly again this is going to be what wether church alows this this picture is the story is picture is the story and again if if your pretending along with the idea that the vatican has changed nothing it' can be very hard to maintained that in the face of this particular picture meanwhile i do on provide some good news i have to say that the sort of stunming development of last three formonths has been the magic of john fetderman what by living halliun i it is very raree gits to in a bright spot news on the show john fetderman wow in sir john fedderman campaign as an avert socialistic a burney standars acalage who is the furthest left member of the democratic sental battle ground state candidate group by far and then get nanurism and he ahe was not fully functional clearly and wh as a question is to whether he coud even sorve in the senate and now john fetderman he is turning into christon cynima he is sturnings the moderate voice of democrats here yesterday for example john fetderman's criticizin the open emogration policy at the southrn border oh here is john fedderman yesterday ni aly cen very ler that unbenithin on the rigts tat of what hat believe tit is an an been very up fron anotes well to an an i really av been able to ind anybody that can say there is not any kind of an isou writ now on the border than as around two hundred seny touds an people being encountered on the border just in one onth and e pu that in respectid is thats tat before that is the side of cispor and i roughly the sines of cispor is showing up in the border the thuss what you you need say that is find i that is not really an issue i's a progressiv that i just that that is i wouln be a pegressi but i a remain an an always be very verys a o imigration berons which as ben e by te in there okay but he sang his promine te boarder because again john federman voice of reason non sotistcomig meanwhile john fetderman was also ripping on young people inside thedemocratic party who are getting their history from tictock by the wasi statistic recenly thet showed that two thirds of democrats believe there was a historic state of p olistine run by arabs no the answers no that is not a thing in any case here was that john federman sang ya they do not now any history by the way in an office with two his rity flefts behind em i john fettermanman i know what happened but a i'm i'm all for it you have been very clearly arguing that coloss varest responsibility for the tragedy of what is going on in gos o why do you think many younger people especially in your partyes see it differently i i really i really do not really do not know i i do know that a lot of people are getting there prerspective from titock and i think if your kind of getting your prerspective on the world on tiktockets gon it then be kind of worker not reflectiv of the history n an actually the way things atsly are and what is very clear isis that homoss started this and they actually broke the the cease fire and they attacke and murdered i babies children women iat'tacka a musice a concert in everything it its it is outrageous good for john fetterman again it is nice when yoe have some good news here on venturperisha already gis coming op when we speaking with the colorado state g o p chairman talking about this insane decision from the colorado state suprimequaurtes ofre not a

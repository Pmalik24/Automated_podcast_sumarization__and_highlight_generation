w as we did and on the wa we a the russian hee cofters the holcopies were shooting she says to other yourpin was close to one of the big battles and key of that first day ovor a never part in hosto mall russians sent halicoters to sees it hoping presumably to use tit to bring in troops surpise to take the city at one point during the day it was reported they had captured the part then later that you cranian soldiers surrounded them and took a bat at this point the russians seemed to have it again anyway that is what natowin her friends were driving towarits seen this it was not to refine anymore because we o in the constant stead of shock we was just taring at it just tering and o we wese just trying to save ou li its it they got of the riend's house the wome at the sellar too lok around they were close to all this fighting and nadoway decided this is not right she was going t turn round she was going to undo everything she had spend the morning doing go back to keeve wech should just come from he tried to get a train from there to the border hich woud been leaving a place where i we through be some shelter an heading int who knows what the harded aside because everybody wus wes saing no say you just have to stay but i was listenin to my in a was y i i was just a i needed tocaut to bon to get out te country ore at least to west of yo prain we were afraid that may be the borders will be close on o it is my point to you when you move yo stay it is my point i just and also o vety anxious and an i just to better when in ta something when and the move betis and pretecting myself one go decided to go with her somebody who shoud never met before that day but yo see mike a rational guy said you want to stick with rational people in emergencys situations the friends drove them to the train station ocal train they coul take them back to keyve and when theyarrived in ky they hope to take the subway but a keep subways were close cause they incould these stations that or deep underground that double as bom shelters and that is hat they were benguse for and we had to work we gat to wark and we were preaty lose to the aria where mely to wors i can me it exactly because iwis just busy running were you we really running bet say joking they fin i get to the trin station with trains tha could take them west to the border they had no tickets it was mobed now aweyhad money ready in case ie needed to bribe somebody to get on a train but it was such a moment of solidarity the con ductors just selet people on without tickets richard the economis corresponded was on that train with her and he told me he had never been in a refug se situation with many cats e aid if ill everybody on the train brought ther cat eight hours later she ws half way across the country three undred miles away iotef far from the fighting anything exshly may happen and everything changin fast lik it was just two days ago she told me she didn a fo toshot with a friend in the center of keye it was sunny blesfi she bo to me some flowers ad tolise for something and we we just injn han coffe and now i am eic and o less rahege is hard to believe it happen even tose you ar somebody who had thought prudent would invade and she thought that he woul quickly tryd to take keeve she had actully been in the process of getting a visa to get out but she said most people did not believe out told themselves it was not happen ayou know ds lae be to lie yerso doe heell safer i go back on the line with richard from the economizt he is a actually talke to lots of acranians about this and pointed out that the country's media and it is president for weeks have been saying nothing is goin o happen pruden was his postraing ununless you rad the fareign press you pobly would not believe pruden was going to invade ow he says the first thing that any eucranian will tell you wit tthat country has beeng at wof i yes and the idea that this orl that russian battalian coming near that border suddenly means that an invasion is likely they will say the invasion happenes to thous and fourteen do thosn't fourteen is when the russian military took crimea from you crane and pro russian separatus and two oucranian territories seceeded from the country and there've teeng all sl matter of different falsalans and seese fires coming in going thrats in a crazy recoric since then and such a rolla cust toride the idea that in that lines the the idea that an a bunch of troops tutting oup on the bord o changeest the gangs for them ats just the latest chest for the latest drama and an lot of people of work out a great recipes happiness which is just sutting off te you nar the time line and and not reading any of this what did you see three months ago that convinced you that this might happen and you got an apartmen on the other side of the country well the thing that really worried me was it was not any trut movements it was the negotiations on desember the seventeents russia on viled ta list of te mands and ah you read these temands and you touht to say unmik god they do not care because that asking for things that they know they cannot get and the only kind of thurstin who conducts those kinds of negotiations is someone tho does not really care was an a good weather the negotiations succeed or fail and when i saw that that is what i realized that is going through the mosions seeni that that not serious about theses negotiations that they are serious about the troops on the mornin it is crazy that you have an entire country with millions of people who basicly just have to guess what one man is going to do here may be more than just sin intire country that beaholwol to dan't or programme we have an epersoid of our shore that we put together back in twenty seveventeen about that man wadimer pudent at the time it was inspired by news that had people guessing what his intentions were and what he was thinking we wanted to understand him better and a'm there is one story we found the sact one of to day show that i have to admit iv bee thing about for weeks is prudent am asked thetroops around the urcraning border is the story about whether he came to powerin nineteen ninety nine by killing a few hundred innocent russias we have that you geven eard it you really sured and more including what russians think of him stay with us i gone going in with the bang you heard the story tis sone thing people speculated about years ago but now seems mostly forgotten iav been rite whon vladimer pruden was goming to power is s back in nineteen ninety nine boysielson was president running russia pruden was the prime minister not well known not well polling at two per cent as possible presidential candidate and then butdnt only been prime minister for a month there was a series of bobings of apartment buildings in moscow and elsewhere three hundred people died puden blamed it on chechen rebels invaded chechnea started the second chetchen war which he won ite was popular war catapulted him into the presidency when he took office he had fifty three per cent of the boat and even back then when he took office in two thousand there was a question did he bomb those buildings himself to create the pretects for the war and his own rise to power if he did of course a caused the legitimacy of his presidency anto question in a big way murdering his own consituents exactly the kinds of russians that eclaims to be surveying and protecting as presiden whenever produciers robin semian talk to reporters who covered this and reviewed the evidence with them thefore we get to the more mysterious aspects of the bommings a quick summery of what happened the bombings came in fast succession four bombs in two weeks in random locations and moscow and two other cities early september was the first one a bobin a truck went off right outside an apartment building collapsing it ovwere sixty people died days later thousands of miles away another bomb goes off on the ground floor of a nine story apartment building nine stories flattened killing over ninety people within days there was another one and that a fourth theildings destroyed in the night while people were inside sleeping david satter was in and out of the country of the time he is been reporting on russia since the seventies the was in thatmosfere of pamic the whole country was cerified people began to fear that any apartment ocould be blown up in the middle of the night and any family could be buried unto the reb there were thirty thousand apartment belocks in moscow and patrols night patrols wor aniset in all of them to prevent terros from u in bombs in the basemens the governmen immediately blamed the bommings on chechn garillas scott anderson as another reporter who is written about the attacks chechens tend to be more darkly complected than ou topolesnic russians anyone who was darkly complected on the streets of moscow was subject to a rest er being beaten up and a lot of people from the caucasis did they think they would to stay inside they were they were fraed to go out in the streets but this story that chetchand were behind the bomings skind of fishy for starters it was three years after chechney an russia had finished a war the first chetchen war chetchney and basicaly one they signed to piece treaty again scott what motive did the chechans have to start this bombing campaign against russia wind they prety much had everything they wanted there was no reason to fight the russians at this point right they would won the war tat that is right they had won the war why command acts of terror that were big enough to start another war and just legistically it would hav been hard to pull off even in nineteen ninety nine russia wit it was a very heavily police state and serly by after thi second or third bobing there were police check points all over surly all over moscow all over major russian cities the idea of these bobers moving round ind these were concrude explosives every heavy fifty a keelo sacks of of explosives heu need hall around you needed car seure going through check points and with the whole histery against against chetchans certainly anybody who was acan darkly complected going through it a check point was going to be thoroughly search even some people in the government question the official account david sater was in moscow right after the bommings and a friend who had good connections told david there were people in the security services who suspected h at bess b that is the modern version of the cg b basically might be behind the bomings david asked to meet some of those guyes on person and they agreed but this was such a dangerous idea they wanted to make sure they were not caugt they had this very private conversation in a very public place in the centere moscow y do not wone to give away too many detnos byther was in in in a store of some sort in the building not far from the bolshoy theatr and to off people coming and going but we did not give any indication werwere talking muchess couple men standing there talking bout sommen thagent did not proove but some things justed not up for exampl of the simple fact that the buildings were blown up withexigon whiches a very very power from explose of the chuse to talk off artillery shos and is disavailable only in one factory in russia which is tightly guarded by the affess b it is also it military basas how would terras get hexigen at all agent said let alon drive big quantities of it around russia unchecked when you heard thi stuff were ye thinking these arguments were convincing or were you also thinking well i wasten ta completely convinced that this was ta government provocation but what convinced me was the bonb that did not go off the fifth bom the fifth bon and yet another city reazon and this is where the story about the chechens seems to really fall apart and where the story gets truly strange september twenty second nineteen ninety nine two and a half weeks after the first department bom a couple of residente and a building an riazan notice something weird one guy a bust driver who lived in the building saw a car a white citi on parked outside the building mora renalt was a foreign correspondent for the elleytimes bakan living in moscow she talkd to the guy who told her the license plates on the car did not look right they had a local city cut on them for riazan the number sixty two but he told mora when he looked closer he saw that the number it had been written al hunt it had been drawn on by hand it did not look it was stamped in to the meddl license plate with a sharpy or something yet a magic marker on a piece of paper taped over the license plate oh and that was immediately something that kind of he thought huh calls ta police in the meantime two men get out o the car and start turing heavy sacks a of something into the the buildings a basemen a the people jump act on t carley cake off that is got anderson agan the local police show up they went down into the basement and came running bak up sayig it is a bom its bom risas essentially sealed off within hours thousands on thousands of soldiers and police a cort not the city and i begin s massive dragnat for these two men and womanwhos in the car also local effesbe start coming through evidence the det nator was found in the basemeto wat oons wene e eain here is a teatin newscletfon then from a documentary about the bomings called disbelief the reporter says the sacks were discovered by police igie en that a bo belaegi a teeea yo the sacks were taken to a lab that concluded the contents were hexigen the same explosive used to blow up the other buildings the stuff that supposedly only that best b and military had access to one day after the bonscar prime minister of ladimir pugten who remember has only been in the job for a month launch is the second war against chechnea overe the bomings he says quote the question is closed once and for all we will pursue the terrorist everywhere if they are in an airport then in an airport and forgive me if we catch them in the crapper then will rub them out in the crapper meanwhile back in riazon local police find the mysterious white sadan and the two suspects they were not chetchen they were russian russian afespb agents with a fsp ides the head of the fesb nicholay petrucia goes on t v and is there is a totally reasonable explanation for afespagents to be caught doing this the whole thing was it dril this audio of that announcement is from a documentary about the bobmings called glowing up russia the neables oy festofl thit was not a explosion an at explasion was not prevention but it was not good i it was an exercise he goesn't for the cameross he makes this little statement again scot anderson he does not tee questions he walks away is just yooya that was thet was just a biltr exsays as for the hexigen there was no hexigen he says they were no explosives the white powder in the bags he explains with sugar mara renoncs talk to people who lived in the apartment building and riazon back then she says people were angry and they thought their own government had tried to kill them though of course since this was russia they would not say it quite that way what they would say over and over again was in the form of a question whose interests were served by this who had something to gain it does not make sense but who had something to gain would you ask them who do you think yo and what wuld people say who else the government but let me say that some did not were willing to go to say that ot loud they would say who had something to gain and and then there would be a pause an they would raise their eyebrows and i would say who do you think and they would say who do you think at the time there was still something of a free press people could speak out and did tespecian baplasha bape send te wee c this estape from a tde special on an independent channel that endte bin at wor which has since been taken over by the state the special is a tockshel with the host which s mat es be higher aps an people from the buildanksun who are pretty mad again this comes from the documentary dhisbelief easeas an the on oued wil aa which he a eaealy saying if you people everyazon and many other towns just do not believe all these stories i'm sitting here and just cannot believe the story the a besb is telling i myself am a military officer i was a senior officer for twenty eight years i was in charge of countless exercises what these generals are claiming about this called exercise i just cannot believe my ears all of this unfolds very quickly puhton becomes prime minister in august the bommings are in september the war starts in september also puthton is the public face of the war and it is going well this is when is popularity source and on news he at midnight president at te time boraskeltson makes in ano tre asteya abaon he mowe te seet orseltson announceis complete shocking annoutsment and he is going to retire he is going to resign the presidency affective immediately he names vlatter buton acting president buton's very first act is very first presential decree is to stop all trruption investigations into borisyeltson these investigations have been going on the elections weresposed to be in june instead he meves him up to march which gives opposition parties very little time to organize and then he he wins the presency outright in march in this this incredibly short period im about eight months he goes from being a complete unknown to being the present of russia marrenald says when re as on happen she sawid in locally's reports but it was not a huge story hat vesbi mayor may not have planted explosives it was not clear what it meant and itwas quickly drowned out by the invasion and the war only in wretch respect ed it start to seeim signifigant an a wretch respect there were other pieces of evidence that started to seim important i tellyou onmar right after one of the bombs went off in moscow this was the third bom the speaker of the russian parliament a guy named slesnyaff mentione to the bom but got the city ram mind you he was in moscow and the bom was in moscow the he said the bom went off in vulgandots here' scott anderson you coald make it say i well he somehow he said volgodonskinstead of moscow except that three days later an a partment building in in volgadonsk was blown up well raising it the quession of how a it is less enoughrom you ho bout the bombing three dys ahead oftime the next thing the happens is after the bom finally did go off in vulgan donts another member of parliament a gy named zerenovsky confronts the speaker about house suspicious this loks he says you told us on monday that a building in vulgan donps was blown out three days before the explosion dearnovsky calls the act monstrous and says hie'll tried to keep the speaker from being reelected but he is hard to hear because they keep cutting his mikrofonon someone calls the arnosky has commad and then a scoundrel who deserves to be shot finally dearnovsky turns around walks away and gets hit in the back with a folder ewthere was and official government investigation into the apartment bomans trials convictions all held in private not open to the public ar ress people were convicted they were not anvestiagents they were not chatchens either there have been people outside the government who tried to look deeper into the bomans but over al that asn't gonwal most notably an independent commission of human rights activeas politicians and investigators again scott ahead of that commission i was killed was murdered shocto deth in front of his house another member the committee died under mysterious circumstances and a poletkovscota investigative journalists one of russias leading investcate journalist was murdered in her apartment building she had written about the acasting doubts on the apartment bulding bomings a and of course iexander lit fon yankow came publicly accusing the puten rcime of of duing e ponpinbones hes poisinpolonian in londonn two thousand six en dogs radio active poison polonium two ten slipped into his tee a british investigation determined two effespiagents had killed le finianko and that putent had likely signd obonen it is ot a biography which came out in two thousan puten roundly denied any efespi involvement in the bobings writing ute what blowing up our own apartment buildings that is really utter nonsense it is totally insane no one in the russian special services would be capable of such a crime against his own people undavid satar has been researching the since it happened and has written two books about it he is convinced the story went this before the bobings even before puten came to power bor as alton and his administration were plagued with corruption investigations he worried they could eventually point to him and his family especially if some other party or some one un sympathetic to him became president he looked to a pointed prime minister who he could trust he fired two other guies and just three months before landing on puten then he and puten together had the apartments blown up as the pretext to go to war and in the patriotic glow two in stall puten and quashed the corruption investigations scotton more are not sure for mora when it comes to the bombings she gets that something was done by design and that it appears to be for political purposes but as for who was behind the bombings exactly she cannot tell mean if you ask me what i think i have to say to the day i do not know but this is what i would say is that right now it does not matter what do you mean becas whether the government or people around puten pleterol or whether they did not the effect is the same either you believe what they said about the balmings that theye were terrorus out to kill ordinary russians in which case you are frightened and the world is a very scury place or you believe that your government or somuch connected to the government could be bloody minded enough to kill three hundred innocent cevilians in their beds in which case the world is a very scary place and you should be frights this is how it works in the police state you should be frightened and that how the government exercises control been nearly two neckate since the bombings and i wanted to know what a people in russia think about the putene stell their president have a ga deal are they our people walking around wondering if their president came to power by killing hundreds of russion citizens i interviewed four people who live in moscow none of them said they were bige sep porters of puten three of the four had heard the rumor that he was behind the bombings none of them believed it or wanted to believe it i cannot know the truth i cannot say a forty two year old screen writer told me a twenty two year old stunitocti said she did not wanto know if it was true as for rheazan only one of the four a tell communication specialist had heard anything about reazan the sacts of sugar any of that ou kyou all the details thou ride a book about it and he believes reason was and at that spedro the one person who never heard the story that puden might be behind the bomangs with julia a forty year old lawyer i thin y osola ye seit is temoselin hamati its is just not something that people discuss the media does not say anything about it the families do not talk to each other about this and frands do not talk about this each other does it just seem old news upsid you yes absolutely i ran through all the facts with her all the evidence that prudent might be behind the bomings she said she did not care does tit sound our ridi culous theory i asked yes she said most likely some ridiculous theory pobin semi h to mister popular one of the notable things about bat him of puden is tit for years is that stunningly high approval wratings among russians in january noy february of this year as tentions rose with you crane is a prove a numbers rose with them to seventy one per cent from the sixties back in twenty seventeen when we first broadcastodays program the presseras re porting tha it his approv al ratings were someting eighty four per cent which for you est president that would be just unthinkable and we wondered is that real at all that eighty four per cent wer is tat from some institution controlled by prudent back then we aske charles mains to look into this forest he is now impiars moscow correspondent well it is real i mean these are real poles where large numbers of real people really do answer questions russia has two big pulling firm that or sentially statesponserd a and one that is independent and all three of these get basely the same numbers athis month puden drope by two per cent to eighty two per cent and american pulsters gallop in peu youknow they also get the same results in the eities yo edies fut a people to saying that they prudent because they are scared to say anything else well it is part of it i mean especialy with older people athere was a pull done by this lavada senter this is the independent polster in russiow saying that twenty six per cent of all respondents said their afraid to share their views of the government with polsters that probably in flahtes the number but just how much is aretly clear c if eight to per cent is in the rigt number do we have any sense of what a more accurate measure of his popularity might be we will some polster say it is the called electoral rating this is when you ask russians two they actually vote for the lavada senter has this a poll they do where they say if the presidential lections were held next sunday who would you vote for and then only fifty five per cents say they vote for prudent and that is the ganthe an independent polsters the state one has a figure that is a little higher sixty four per cent but you now that is hardly the eighty two eihty four that we seen what a get from this is take the eihty two eghty four percent a privarating with grand asolt but it is true that most people approve of him ye he still really popular a case o to hear of what that proval as all about and what people think of him we aske you to talk to some people who him which you did people across the country and then you put together this story about one of them this is someone i knew would not exaggerate their feelings about the president because they were talking to a foreign reporter some one i've known for decades ye oye and e l mthat is her talking here ogustor gave n th demetri compnis i live with old e ser gam and or two children back in the midnineties when i was an exchanged student in moscow good five years before puden arrived on the scene vor the year she took in several american exchange students similrlylily en we let us her telling me i was her favorite and i tell her always say i of russian ma'm y yeleters tomia that that meti t she says i always say i have an american son who i do not see as much as i segelan yor aceviutyec we took the tram to her apartment building through the neighborhood i lived in with her family back in the nineties and she started pointing out all these changes loga euete an new playground he stores t would be the wu e and just pby the new museum there building a commun ity pool wor busfi now none of this was here back when i lived with them it is all part of the prosperity that is come to moscow since puten came to power and it is why olgu srgeevna and lots of people in her generation shes in her sixties it is why they love putent eo when i lived with olgu sergeevna an her family boris yelson was president and things in russ were really really tough in fact thore's a poll for that it says sixty eight per cent of russians think nothing good happened in russia during the yelson years nothing doveina whi chune usualli belasa isn' tis to besina ogussergeevna says life was hard back then opeople did not have enoughf r money we groca stores were empty and the only began to clear with the arrival of ladimer puten nos the bula togus befor de pute it seems almost hard to remember now but when puten first arrived as prime minister ninetee ninety nine russians had no idea who he was he was this awkward public speaker back the his suits were fitting the guit never smiled yebelon tain bi stedi in paxsi chet hardly says oldgu sergevna the specimen she sees now evon you gunis na she told me putn's appearance was predicted earlier when mistix said one day a man named the lodia would save russia vilodia is short for latimer lots of the older generation will tell you stuf this yo don yo dumoste the moswi put nobody thought that savor would be prutent oa men loks face that she says he is cone to short e bi schuver was the ta go no one believed he change russia that russia would rise from its nees lavas prianes but it did rise from its nees his predecessor bors yelson was seen as this buffoon visibly drunken meetings with world leaders in embarrassment puten was younger he did not drink the fact that he was a former cage be agent it least meant he was disciplined and educated he spoke german practised judo nd he brought an end to the chaos of the yeltson years during which the ruble had collapsed several times government was constantly reshuffled nd a few insiders the called oligarchs became billionaires almost everyone else lost their savings but as soon as putent took over the economy boons mostly because of oyal price is shooting oug and soon he exiled or arrested oligarchs who been running the country behind the scenes a lot of people talk about how puten saved russia yes se bur i tot my seine diin lotectutevorude e the adviti sinaste gutetenobsmena if you

the bigger cities people olgu srgeena became part of something that was happening for the first time ever in russia the merchants of a middle class over time this economic miracle turned puten in the sort of a folk hero there is the side of him we know in america the guy fine jets riding horseis shirtless but in russia he is cultivated this image that he is frugal lives modestly works all the time political analists told me puten scene is the only one who can fix anything or improve people's lives the one who keeps corrupt buracrats and check he is the goods zare for oguss orgavna it was not

wilshe does not buy any of it in fact a lot of ulgusgavnas opinions her things you might hear on state tb but i think with ogus orgavna and the other people i talk to people who love puten the moments i understand them best or when they talk about the past everything they went through before puten arrived it is why sometimes i think the real reason people puten his not because they believe he will keep moving russia forward into the future it is because they fear some one else anyone else might drive russia back to the past charles mans o moscow is past wee he found olga the day thet moscow vated you crane fin dow what she thought he thinks puden mad the right call het es going in hel the separatistinystrn you crane if decried themselves independent of you crane from moscow she believes you cranny an authorities who can no attack people in that territory bwithames they got from the united states president of you crae solensky sdon' charleshe is a crown bidin the dop puten still the smartus to the pack coming out another easin russian see puten the way they do we get to know the disinformation master mind who reshaped the world of russian politics into what it is now that is in a minute chicago bup a gradio when our programm continues to smarican life myer glass today's programm the other mister president stories of ladimer pruden and this around him we arrived to dact three of our programm ac three may be paiyd a little attention to the man behind the curtain is s quit that we heard while we were working on today's programm backin twenty seventeen from writer named peter pramaranziv he said that if the old soviet union was seventy five per cent violence twenty five per cent propaganda nto day's russia this nembers are reversed it is twenty five per cent violence and seventy five per cent propaganda in propaganda was radically reinvented ondivadama puten it is tactics and its methods but this one political operative johnkoll explains the operative's name is ladislov sir koug he was putent's deputy of chief for more than a decade starting in nineteen ninety nine in russia he is what is referred to as a political technologist but those are a diamond dozen at the top of his powers serko had a much more ominous if an official title he was known as a gray cardinal he does not look a shadowy master mine he sort of resembles roan atkinson the actov played mister bean except handsomer and he actually does not manage propaganda at the premlan any more but the methods he invented to manipulate people in information i've even heard them called partistic see in the soviet era the country was run by the communist party and the propagandists pumped out literally the party mine and tried to suppress all other opposing messages and then the iron curtain fell a whole bunch of new political parties were created and it was the messy early stages of a real democracy with parties bickering in vying for power and then when puden became president and obviously skipping over a lot here his right hand man serkov helped solidify the kremlin's power by putting together this party called united russia which gained majority in parliament and backed puten and then instead of tamping down the opposition the old days serkov built a new system were there was oposition but he dictated what the opposition stood for you do not alaw political parties to crate their on agandus you just rite this gendis for them this is vesilly gatov he is been a very high level player in russian media for nearly twenty years these sdasies a visiting fellow at the aninburg center on communication leadership and policy well we decide bonofour parties is left party with som sort of comunism andother parties you were a socialis and the third parties sir deep conservatv kand offi youv even jalicals and the fourth party would be as ar of leberal radicals and tha that is whats sokol actually constructed and he created whole new political parties and wrote ther agendas for example a he created a party colts prutudlywhere i see just russia just russia aye that was a it was a political kadaver are you saying iaver a corpse kadaver a kadaver a melalike frankenstan frankenstin gata created from some sort of pieces of socialists alabor activists more progafroman tipe e flabor unions he also decided that he cannot allow eighty dratrutec tiit is which would not be that ta by kramlin he decided that you will create also yuse movements and ritagande for them and he also tri to do the same think wer angios political angios or those that control e actians consparencs y or exposed droption se writing it gan de for every every one of them in the kremlin it is directing a movy in a way absolutely i would even provide you with a very finny hypotisis in two thousand on i think rassia has being invaded by reality shows ner thinks surviver bebrather and he was amazed how scriptink can improve even those likely spentaneos interactions between people and i know that he was very good friend with all the producers of this er reality shoav actually and actually i think ho was once even present at the filming of the russian versional survivor no way and he is if they can do that on t v sort of fak reality and t v may be we can fak reality in reality in the way yby two doesen three about four years into serkov's tenureas great kardinal thet silly says serkov had built up a whole codrey of deputies that would carry out his agenda with these different parties and other groups i asked vicily for an example of how all this work and he told me what everybody told me when i asked for specifics he said it is not i was in the room with him i do not know exactly what he said to whom nor when he did tell me about this one case that he heard about from someone who worked with serkov in two thousand for vladimer puten decided that governors should not be elected any more they should be appointed by him t's long story but at first every other political party besides putens was against the idea genuinely against it but then serkov manipulated them over to his side it help that he control their funding in the number of seats they got in the duma and then the parties went through this whole drawn out public drama which had all the trappings of democracy the bill submitted their arguments for in against it protest surround the country people announced they have changed their minds r several votes and finally after three months it passes all of this vastily says was scripted by serkov's people the name you here for all these techniques is managed democracy serkov uses the phrase sovereign democracy i suggested to one person i talk to that managed democracy sounds a contradiction in terms he said exactly it just means there is no democracy any one overstate serkov's tower nor his malevolence apparently he was much more carrot than stick in his approach explaining why no you really want to aline yourself with the kremlin here is what is to be gained and he didn' try to do this with everybody he maintained under this manage or sovereign democracy a certain level of dessent itsome actual opposition actual opposition both in society and press and even enjoyed this dessent becaus it was developing nature leaders nevolny that is elecine of alny he may have heard of him he is a high profile actovest he s considered to be the only real opponent to puten except he cannot run against puten because putents people had him arrested and you cannot run for president and russia if you have a criminal record to be ones tevily emerged within this santbokes of fr aloit freedom that serkov created and and it was important for him because it was kind of making hes kameflash of fatocracy much that a loki the more you here about serkov the man the more it makes you understand how his whole trumensho theatrical directing of society developed he has all of these opposing factions inside of him too all working in an unlikely but perfect concert together back in the early ninetis he was a pargy designing ads for the richest olgark in russia and that point serkov said he wanted to be quot the hero and pretty woman that the richard veer character but he is also a huge fan af the anti burocracy gay but is to beat poet allan ginsburg this is serkov reciting ginsburg's pam sunflower suitra from memory and you there standin befor me in this sonset and all the oglomy in your form at notic beauty offisin flown you might be able to tell that serkov studied theatre but he got kicked out of the moscow in situde of cullture aftere a fistfight reportedly ias written lyrics for a russian man called agatha kristy and you marry pr and are in performance plasis time at russha's main state tvinat work channel wine manage democracy was just the natural culmination a he was kind of entertaining himself again vasily gatov was really funny for him to to make this thinks happen to wa chi certain resouts and and there sot of creative build ing all freolity a again as i said it is it is a very much big brother type of scripting he means the reality shopic brother imin you you need to createa conflict and this conflict will create the conflict and than an than we cus arulagowd and people will fout and that would be found besides which he could totally get away with it because not only was he good at it but in serkov's time is great cardinal not very many people were paying attention at this moment apeople were absolutely uninterested in politdics becaus russia had and mayso ekonomy grov of about min prosate here an the ruble was sir kind of taking sang fir a credit was extemely chep the country was booming i easy to biald atokrasy when kantins men gers nobody cares about politics i and i think zerkov was not during this momen because he was and not only kind of far shado kardeno bat hejectury was openly kardenaing the visidation that is after a certain point he would not take very many pains to hide what he was doing which i can imagine the feeling here he is carrying off all these feats of manipulation in secret hou think he would won a little credit on this point there was a moment when serkov seemed to be showing his cards a little bit deliberately it is a story that peter pomaransev likes to tell he is the journalist that i werequoted earlier peter used to work in reality chievy in russia and he is witten a lot about serkov this liberal bloge a litle fetiloga he ad very greepopliplog tooksome fodas of the office af serkov's office th he was there to photograph an official meeting but he said on his blog that he was much more interested in what was in the office and that is what you have the fons on his dask with the names will opposition pinsclpossis literally there is a whole mess of phones and on one of them in particular next to the numbers there is a bank of buttons labeled meranov zurnovsky zugonov all heads of parties and e have the portrait of to the fiso tupacka next o makiavetou something yes two pochic for the rapper it is actually next to a picture of barokobama and a a the time ros i my god while we got seensisirkov's office and that many years lates at when we evere realized the sirklof at ben funding this libera age avras i omer what he leaked that he wants it us to beel his power and he wanted to create an atmosphere where you can never really tell what is true any more everything is suspect that was absolutely intention zerkov himselv has come just shy of saying it openly a he talks about it in his book this is another shape serkov is reported to have shifted into he wrote a novel under the sudinam naton dubovitzky he will not admit its really him but szerkov's wife is named natalia dubovitskaya every one's nody coincidence the books called almost to zero were klose to zero it' about a piargay who grew up in the stik serkov did move to moscow to hang out with bohemian artists szerkov did and is now embroiled in the seedy murdereus under world of the illegal book publishing in distribution oh and it is got an english subtitle gangstofiction any case peter says there are these really telling passageis in which the hero realizes await everything's made up language politics every ideology everything's fake i can see through it all it is an epic kind of cenicism it is nall citizeism as in mi own o blevlything but almost ik olmy got ive burst throug nor the shallow shells of morality an mideology and belief si am seeing behind the matrixkye exact very much i the matric os a superpopular fimin russianan tat but you make sense if you think about russian history and men l this generation circle wr putson the have life through communism they have live through and the mafhia state the misyou fak democracy through as from th religious national socialism an empibling which they have now and it is all the same people and the have gone through through many different modes of being in the losts thats he is in such blistery progression hat that cand ofe left of the feeding that everything is is a moskrate when zerkov says everything is a everythingis controlled in a construct what he is at she saying is not a confession it is af piece of sychological propaganda to say there is no point struggling for anything do not even try to do any of your city protest movements oh sot son away you will killing if you tell people that everything is a conspiracy it does not lead people to revolt it leads people to go give was that i might as well give op yes e but aget we might be overinhepreti but is a books where alasti but yet is lin i said before serkov is no longer the grand manager of propaganda in russia he was sidelined in two thousand eleven after a dispute with pudenn but he stayed a personal adviser to the president andhe was also an organizer of russas take over of the krimean peninsula in oucrane and two thousand fourteen his involvement in that annexation got him sanctioned by the west eaning he is not allowed to travel to the uessor europe any more and he cannot have assets in the west either zerkov was unfazed the only things that interest me in the ues he said or tupokshikor alingen'sburg and jackson pola i do not need a veza to access their work which could come back zonkov s one of produces of oursia zerkov by the way seems to have been one of the people overseeing russias you crane policy nto a few years ago there is am hactemals from his account in twenty fourteen promaskowv separatis croups in yeukran to cry the two territories in the russian border were no longer part of yourkran and themal serko seems to be managing them one of themal serkov received a list of potential weaders for these supposaly independent regions of youkrn with astras by certain names is the best optians he ast om oneame out a headit a statement hat legually came from youkranians living in the separatist tow of terratories twenty twenty serkov is fired by vatemar without any public explanation one hav line about that red puden fires his popin maste at for a m t er principle but sid be ter people in russia who do not vadamer prudent they been protest against the invasion of your cran a cross russia an moscow saint petersburg other cities weeve the monitors the protest ov d anfo said he e just the first two days since the invasion over eighteen hundred protesters were arrested in sixty russian cities byt hin twenty seventeena when we first protestodays program thereware protests all over the country organized by pruden's most prominent credic the carismatic opposition lead eir olexi navalny about government corruption and hears a since twenty seventeene volne was poison fle to burgin for treatmen german authority said the nerve agent the poisondit must to come from the russian government when you return to russia he was arrested is imprison to day but in twenty seventeen ho as turning out huge crowds of young people you showed out because of these great vidios that you doon mine about the issues after the protest aseena yours streaded posting their own vidios to the innernet of their teachers lecturing them about the protest towing them they were wrong about the issues kids argouing back you now you recalled in for a lecture by your principle you think that ver idea of your principal lecturing you on the subject of protest as either unjust or absurd or fond or whateveranc you fhalmenad posted just i think youow a lot of sixteen seventeen year olds might be tempted to do a anywhere joshayafa is a correspondent for the new yorker magazine in moscow and you rote about one of these vidios thete was filmed ton the provincial town of brianxk to win your mous from moscow apparently there was a student there who tried to enlist other kids to go to the protest which led to their principal and home room teacher to talk to them which they folmed i it is it is obvious that it was shon surreptitiously you see a lot of the desk in friend of vyou in kind of half cut off shots of the school principle in front of a chock bord ocen i should say that most of it is just completely black you see nothing and you hear sound and up and that occasionally the camicshit of asa asshe is essentially saying with he tone in her voice suggest you cand of nave juvenial somewhat i am mature in the ways of the world students are interested in the sguy no volny what is he really stand for what is he really offering or suggesting other than just getting rid of athe country's leader is a principle says gui i can see that your looking at this pom one sidedly and that you lack range ing your political view you seen to volny watches vidio boom you believe it all when you rode about this a recorting in the newyorker you described your tone is a hectoring and frustrated i would say that is really the most interesting or striking thing about the whole tideo to me which is to me it sounds kur petrovna the principle is experiencing something between a confusion exasprexasperation anger i think she is really at a loss a she does not understand ther may be in the same way that i do not know five years ago seven years ago there is something more a shared between her and her students i wont point you such defending vadamer prudent saying you cannot blan him for the bad economy that is because of the sanctions of the youropiniunion in theunited states imposed on russia anshe says on the world stage and farm policyes doing a great job which te students challenge gn osin of policpaistis was o ois the studence asking the principle yo case of what is our foreign palsy americas against us europe as against us and the principle says foqet wy is that what is the reason and the student without thinking a says elthat because af crimea we took it almost alo te lolou asand the principle responding with surprise or inignation says wand was that bad because e most of russiaait seen is a patriotic thing to av taken cremia yet but the the enesitin of crimes acredibly popular swidely perceived to have been a good thing basically then the horem teacher jumps in and argues with the kids over crimea did you says did we really take crimea did they bot and choose to become part of russia the kids correctly point out yes russia did take crimea and the sanctions were th result soon the conversation turns to the fighting in eastern new crane russia officially denies that its soldiers are there frall kinds of evidence is come out proving that this is untrue and the principle is he sensare trying to blame the crisis in new crane on america let me read exactly which she says ecause ecause because it is ecause it is aggressive she says akad you have not read anything about this and you do not know a thing and gets im very superficial malledge here s what started ths whole conplict maybe it was cause america stuck its nows in and then they struck to argue right ind the student asks somewhat mockingly of the principl did you see american troops in neu crane wevusily ways othee iicons ta an an the principale says did you see russian troops in new crane and this is this moment where the student reveals just this be sick elementary a non igeological factual knowledge the soonen says yes e there are viniis going round and then comes really madbe my favorite line you have no idea noge ad an that to me gets to the key point of this whole dialogue which is the kids just have occess to this information and just a world view tat they are goe on the in and at themselves information thits not on state sheven and that alone seems con som destablelizing are un comfortable for the principle the kis do not watch teve the way old o russians do the principale tells them ok you do not remember how bad it was here before pruden he country was in chaosiby plad to carry guns and knives n this when i was in comlege when he says this and when you parits talking points that you might hear on russian sta t b she seems totally sincere is american watching this it is one of the thins as ectually most interesting about this vidio you think that these government talking points on crimeo you crane or whatever you wonder if authorities are just mouthing these points and the do not actually believe them when your the principale she seems totally emotional when you runs through tese talking points but those talking points sir in a way emotional couch in the language of a patriotism an appeal to history russia as a great power russia as thes besieged fortress srrounded by enemies who we should harman and the students jest seem less receptive to those messegers one pon the kids openly laugh the country's ruling political party presen pru thes partie u nite in russia ote post or ye dos were againsto nigt to russia the kid saing the studeness everybody to raise their hands who wis against united russia and then you get sense this partisdar in idio gid sens it lots of hands are going oup russa o this meetls su lo tis not onything dits interesting to me about this because i feelic we read abot how the russian government sort of floods the zone in their own kountry with all kinds of misinformation and disinformation to make people feel that prudent is doing a great job and and here it seems a goave a munch of kids who just seem utterly immune to it yen and that i think must freek out atha colitical adviser is in political technologists as hare called here in russia in the cremlin who just seem to have lost the countrye seo they just do not seem a to be able to come up with the kind of message is ain reteric that you one for an older generation work easily and naturally an it flowed with little resistance jaseryafa

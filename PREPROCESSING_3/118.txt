questions mounds about the physical and mental capacity of our leadership glass newdy tells him murge about yorbidans vice presidentially mals with hunter bidin and the legal revolution agains tonal trum well be telivized i venturnare the sis the venshgero sho benchgir ar show sponsivby express if vepian privacy is a right not a privilege dofend your rights texpress te piansi cam slashed bon we now live in a jerantocrasy oure entire leadership class is really really old and not only are they really old they are not even good at their jobs it is one thing to say that the old man on the mountain while you knowt least he is good it is job but if he is badet his job and he is boreline see nile or he is already eratic and he just going more eratic with age the question becomes why as a population do we keep nominating these people why do we keep doing this a mean that there are few reasons why it might be a reality that we keep putting up in positions of power really old people one could just be that that the power of anersha that the person is in power we jus kep le lecting them because it is more comfortable to go at the devil we know than the devil that we do not and that would be true for somebody jobidon who of course is a devil that we know since he was thirty one years old where he burst on to the american public scene whenhe ran for senate at the age of thirty and he has now eighty e's been in the public ey for half a sentury and' meybe the idea is while you nmore comfortable it them we know and we kno everything there is to kow abouthim an sure y's a little see nile but that is better than that new guy down the block what that really betrays is a lack of trust in the future of the united states if the people that you keep nominating to high office our people whave been th public ic for fifty years and the ideais that these are the people who are best poise to lead the country forward why you really saying is we do not know what direction the country is goings we may as well just give it to this old guy who is basically dad and this is true a cross ar i thing that really is that the rashion olt for why many people seem comfortable with voting for people who are no longer with us jobidon is clearly no longer with us mitch man conall is apparently no longer with us dian fine stin is no longer with us is not just by heway elderly people it is also people ore just stands ins for general political parties jon fetderman is clearly not with us and he is sedding in in the senate of the united states right now if that makes three senators out of one hundred who literally do not have full brain function as shut a matter of course and two of those people are in significant positions of leadership ar dian fine sense is on some the most important committees in the senate mitchmac conall is the senate mynority leader and that is leaving aside chucksumer who ise welling to his seventies at this point meanwhile you of the current president of the united states who ise wandering around wobbling into trees and everybody js whele i gess that is totally find and the leader of the opposition party is seventy eight years old wh's a ratic when he was young and has grown more eratic the older that he gots again i come back to the question why is it that we the american people keep putting these people in a position thit is question for us nonquistion for them i understand why old people want power o oh people want power for the semereas an everbody else one's power hower's great power laugs sto pursue the things that we wish to pursue or to maintain are are importance throughout through our life span i'ventunderstand the idea that there are certain old er people who are still fully functional ther people who are well inso their aidies who are doing just fine in mc jag are right now looks a lot bettr in the urn president of the united states which shows that a life of sec strogs and rock and roll actually apparently is very good for you it sort of a for maltohide that preserves you forever but when you look at the jerantocracy that now rules the country what that really speaks to is the beginning of the end of the republic because again if you cannot trust the people who are forty five fifty to lead the country if there is no vitality to the leadership class what exactly are we doing it just a holding pattern everybody knows it jobidon holding pattern is much more attractive apparently to a majority of th american people then anybody who is fifty that he is going to run for reelection not being there yesterday again he was am he excited the cript in delaware for just a moment the door popped open and then he walked into public view instaid om giith and then is going back to delawares the answer for the week end his going back to delaware again can sit on the beach shirtless apparently he has a weird habit of bathing in the newde which man secret service those people have a job in any case accaring round extra suitsfor the present in cases he m in case he poop's one and then now making sure tha the naked old man is protected from the various assassins in the trades hat's a job an ma here it was that jobidon yesterday it fr him a headquarters gin i'm going to i'm going to lo asuretyn wor o hey knhow many different vidioes to we have of the presidents of the united states not knowing where he is going you have tose whom one of to things either of the advand steam work is unbelievably crappy around the president of the united states or the president of th united states literally does not always going at leas seven you persent of the time that seems to be the case unless you think that i'm just ripping on bi nog get s mits mc conall in just one second nowthe media have as taken just covering for the sky tbecause again in a fully reactionary ero which is what we live it it is totally reectionar the normal american is not reactionary the normal american just wants to be left alone the normal american wants a predictable sat of laws that they know the rules of the road and then they want be able to raise their family go to their job go to church pay their taxes and be left alone it is really want most americans wone they just want to predictable way that that life is run and meanwhile you have the people at the highest ecial ants politics who are either utopian or destructive and their bounceing off of one another in a variety of combinations and to this means that you must protect the pressius i mean if jobton is clearly not with us o got the intire left saying the precious must be protected for example glen kestler whos suppose to be a fact he is literally called the facchecker over at the washington post has an entire piece called bidon loves to retell certain stories some are not credible now normally what glenkestle dos he takes a simple a simple claim and then he rates it on a scale of once yo for penochios is it true or s it notrue he does not do that whih obiden instead he just puts all of his dum false stories together in one story and the he is a well he he is really a genial old man but it turns out that a lot of his stories to starm trues i guess i es were done here no pinocchio ratings on any of the things this is what the media do with jobidon meanwhile on the other side of the isle he sent a minority leader mitch mc conall he is obvesly suffering from something he is had too massive freeze ups in from the media inside the last month and let us be clear mitch mac conall is hes single most effective republican leader in the country for last twenty years men here is not there is just note real competition for that mean in terms of if you donall trumps supreme cor pictuce can thankmint's mac conall is mitch macconal ho made that happen that is the reality of the situation the lo promas in tmich macconall yeuan say thathe has not stood up for principle as much as he should have wher they shoud push harder when he had re publican congress but in terms just pure mackiavellian politics mitch mac conall was great at it also he is to old now i'm sorry he is he is not mentally f he is not mentally capable of holding down the sent minority leader position and h should hand off the position to somebody else as soon as possible sancha goup does doctor overtyand and he says well he is can a freezing up an that he is not freezing up his freezing is we should not be analyzing the people who lead the republic as though they are all timer pations we should not be doing that it is bad for america this should be a by partisan colishan saying this by the way but no one's can to say it and the eason nowns can to say it is because for a publicans must effend trump who seventy eight and mc conal who is eighty one and for democrats must effend jobidon who is eighty he used to be thathere is brought spectrom agreement on things hey maybe we ought to you note transition the leadership to a generation that is not in depends but no we are all goin to just go back to a go back to our verious corters heres sancha gup to analyzing the health of te sen my norty leader what did you see what did you make of what happens first fall li me to say that what scod is describing is really important to know because whatever this is it it comes and goes and it seems to come and go quickly and in the world of a a and when you lookhim at the brain that is an important sort of clue what i saw and and this as i think an appropriate term here is the there is the term freezing a that that does that does sort o describe this freezing of his body freezing of his feach freezing of his face his hands were very clenched to the side of the lecturn i can i mean whele no probem mean after all we have many nonfunctional members of our top levell of government in just one second we will get to the people who theoretically could take over for people mitthr mac conal will get to that in just once second anwe will get to more corruption in the bidon administration because jobidon it is not that the argmen nester byn melly is not that he seenile the problec jobidins tht he is been corruptfor fifty years willgets that momentarily first ladmer putent called the ustoller's drop an dominents objective nea reversibl brazil russia india china south africa formerly agreed to use local currencies

that is ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight o kase there are people whoare waitin in the wings from mich mc conald step down and contrary to popular opinion even if mc conal steps down andyo be sure the governor of kentucky cannot actually just appointo democrat beshure's a democrat but they change the law in the tate of kentucky s the besher has to choose from the same party as the person whos step down probably in anticipation of all of this and has to choose one of three people mominated by the state republican party that means that even if mc conalward o step down completely from the senate you would beour place by republican the same thing by the way's truge dian fineston and this is the part owhen it get to the he irritation that i have for the allage is the allegiance the people are having to these these old fuddy dudies what it really comes down twois no one wants to stablish a precident that yo should get rid of an elderly person in a position of power just because they are senil becaus they are too many seenal people in their own party they wan to maintain and that is particularly true the top tho tick it if you get rid of dian finestine for noping fully functional what is the argment for keeping bine he is got a democrat backing m up in comall harris i understand tht you would rather hae the dead old white man running for president than you would have the very very un popular black woman running for president but is that really an excuse giving the jobide is not functional and everyone can see it if they get rid of dian finstin who legitimately cannot write her own name at this point what happens if they get rid of john fetterman what hat now almost people got ar place by democrats by the way but this help perverse and and venal are politics as become ore don t keep those people in place wren't kep those people on the the very idea that the leadership class even matters has kind of exploded all that matters right now is the binary the party bineary you are the republigan earor democrat and does not matter who you are apparently because wen just plug somebody else in orw just leave you there being a dead person we can manipulate your hands you are some sort of weared marionet and apparently we will achieve the same exact result the some the people by the way who theoretically could just freplace mc conall to day are john thoon a south to kodak he is sixty two he is also the number two center republican he is the whip got john cornan of taxas who is seventy one gan at the at this point tha mae towa spring chicken among our leadership class yot john borosso also seventy ones wo the younger generation it is seventy nd ten you ave people jony earnston iwal who is fifty three who is the number four as a char of the republican policy commttee the fact that our leadership classin general has become old is is totally insane to me totally insane ronald's ragan when he ran for office in nineteen eighty was considered by many people too old ok anda ronald's ragan in nineteen eighty he he was som he was seventy two in nineteen eihty it is sem prettymazing when he is in allgrated the second time he was a hu seventy seven which makes him currently younger than both of our presidential candidates thing things are going great it is it is all good meanwhile jobiton continues to be as venal incorrupt as a he ever was apparently we now have news that hunder bidon's rosemontson capartners investment form trated more than one thousand emales with jobidon's office while he 's vice president hundreds of those remined hidden becaue of executive privilege as sorted by the white house documents released by the national archives show that is going to the nork post the eight hundrend sixty one emales that reference rosemonsennica were sent or s by the office of the vice presen between january twenty eleven and desember twenty thirteen according to america for sligal which obtained the messages from the national archits and record ad ministration an release them on wednesday the white house is refusing to allow the release of two hundred emales referencing hunderbiton's firm siting executive privilege nara said quote release would disclose confidential advice between the president and his advisers or between such advisers ah well that seems super corrupt there now asserting executive privilege tod protect communications between rosmonsontaco which is hnter biten firm and the office of vice president well rosemontsontaco was workin with hunter who as working with breesma and jobine

aric shwarn for take ats onshort notice to the wite house christmas tore indicating that rosemontsonticas level of axis the executed mansion was well known byta apparently executive privilege is supposedly going to cover all of this this should be litigated by the way this hould unt up in a cort of law why would executive privilege cover supposedly bee nine emales regarding law being firms including your son it is totally while meanwhile apparently jopy investigators are looking for a boston connection in the jobiton suden of mysteriesis going to the daily wiredok hom a parof sent republicans wanted now if nine boxs of materials re treeve from the boston office of a personal attorney to jobidon contain any sudinums or personal lemale addresses senators chuck grassley of iwhitan ron johnson wisconson sends a letter this week to nera asking whether the agents he had reviewed the contents of the boxs obtained earlier this year from practic morse lawfrom in boston after ledgerly being moved from bitns former thing tankand washington to c and then they asked if any of the is box is included sudinims and nemales addresses used by a vice president jobidon again there is a there are lotmore shooes tat are going to drop here it is alsoture is kimberley strassel writes today in the walstry journal that therewill be more shoes to drop with regard to the americ garlan t oja cutting its sweethard deal with hunter idon according cam ealy strastel merric garland is working hard to present david whises who is the lawyer who cut the deel he is the proscue tr cut the teld hunder bines legletine as operating in a pendently but the record is showing nearly every piece of justice it is political appoint thes its tax divicion senior officials the ef yi had fingers in the wise pro should any one have confidence this will change now the garland has given wise the honoriffic of special council the answer there of course not jor bine was asked about all this yesterday and i he laufhed because why not i mean he is a care free elderly gentleman o yarar you ar abo lar but' stuck about em whet what will you ever talk about this the answer of course is no because then he might say something that would implicate him or his son in corruption in just one second we will get to the fall out from jobitons bore policy his economy it turns out the leadership lassonisis in

only now beginning to be felt according to wallstre jurnal rates ar up and we are just starting to feel the heat and you can see ths in the mortgage markets by the way the mortgage rits riht now are stounding 're talking seven per cent eight per cent it is coming nearly impossible for anybody to buy a house in the near future people right now are holding on to the houseis in their trying to a keep the prices up but eventually that dam ais gon a break and the real say priceer gun a half to come downs that just is no lequittity in the market tax pars are ex posed taccording t the wallstree journal public debt hell by the public rocketed from thirty five per cent of gross domestic product at the end of twenty o seven to ninety three per cent in the first quarter of this year as uncle san borrowed first to bellabangks then to prop up grow then to cut tax is then co cushin the economy from the pandemic and now t's support manufacturing the burdn of the dobt was relatively low because the interest rices were low but now a lot of those intrestrits are not lo sixty seven me per cents of the depmatures within five years g estimates that the u us pays navetrate of three point for per

be in serious trouble because it turns out that people rgest not lending at the same rate that thy were able to lend a couple of years go bcause the easy money policies of the fed according to the wastr journal with market conditions where they are in higher rates ahead you basically have to re finance now because one month from now could be even worse meanwhile retires living on a fixed in come are in serious trouble because of corser on a fixed in come in the dollars ore worth less now than they were before thank ues to jobidon for his bang up economy i i'm glad tha we decided to bad on the elderly generation because they obviously have done us they have done us grate part of the probm here by the way is that because america is in agin country because nobody had any kids for a generation and a half the larges voting block in te united states is above the age of forty five by far i it is not even closhes above the ages of sixty five by the way is the is the single it is right now the second largest voting block in in twenty twenty two sit thirty seven million people voted wo are above the age of sixty five between the ages of forty five and sixty four about forty three point six million people voted which means that if your above the age of sixty or fifty five you are now in sort of the plorality of the voting block now as people age out ofthe population that may change however the upside down pyramid of of our demographics is going tohave a continued impact and how exactly people vote in terms of our elderly gerntocracy a in just one second we will get to

rested well who legally crossing the southern border and august twenty two according's reports who is not return to mexico where he came from wor to hady and said heas given a notice to ap pere and then he was released into the general public and then he showed up again he gave everybody has on mexican drivers license which is at which is great he is living comfortably in mexico apparently at night e anda and then decided to just pop over the boarder and apparently kill a tryold and in injure twenty six other children our board policies ar saster of course but according to the bidamenstration all as well here is corren jhohn pare world's worst pres secretary pretending the jobdon has done a greatchop securing the border the present has done more to secure the boarder to deal with is isyu en mi gration than anybody else he really has june thought the shinkal largest monto montrop in lawful unlawful border crossing because of the poitis this present putting place o ka as bomilugan the fox reporter points out ther're more than seven thousand magrants apprehenid by board patral on tuesday alone afterthey crosse to legally there is a brief lull in the week's after the end of title forty toin may but legal crossings our surghing once again they are jus lawing about it obviously meanwhile cormencjohn pierre says the jobin will not even met with cafy hocell who is the governor of new york she is been talk about the disaster of mass migration into new york ye legal immigrants descending on the state on mass and chlake not jobidn osnthav time for that you' soun vacation or hubof beech bu when the gore new york n by to discuss the er manterte new yore hted not why not as you just thin there is a lot going on and a ischiefeststaff met unmet was part of that meeting at believe affectory myarcess wis part of that meeting a some of his very high level senior staf participated in the meet in with the governor which is as you that a very important meeting to have he has a has a very good relationship with tht governor we have been every time where in new york a the president i in practically every time a the present engages with the governors they have a very good relationship look im at the present has e lottern on his plate im yet he is much on his plat whc has wis boun vacation for nearly the passex weeks with a with minorbrace to visit mally and tell stories about a kitchen fire that he once at ere everything is going great meanwhile on the other side of the io we are preparing for the donald trump trial in george ja apparently according to a fulten county jodge on thursday thev judge scot macofy he says that all court proceedings in the election interference cases against donald trump and his eighteen co defendance will be live streamed an tollivied which is going to be amazing for the country nellison i'll be real about this i'm not against this i think the fact that that we should have more transparent if we do not trust our institutions watching the institutions work would be the only wy to restore trust in our institutions i'm all for more som light and more transparency mi guess onesly is that teem trump i'm not sure how against the telivision they are because the the prospect of watching these people go after trump in the dock may not be bad for donal trump insay apprimaries in an order isshoed on thirsday mackfys and members the medio would be alloweds use computers and sellphones in the cl inside the cortroom for nonrecorning purposes during corproceedings there will be pool covered for tellvigen radio and still phitography as well wrogan gets a watch the a trial on t v is this something that they would contemplated sre democrat in the dock i have serious doubts about that but for those who are hoping that donal trump is welling a running a well calebrated campaign that staking ad vantage of all of this o some bad news apparently his superpack is almost broke they have raised about a hundredand fifty seven millon dollars than spent nearly all vean on legal cost according to your say to day donal trump is running out of other people's money to spend on his legal bills his keep fun ha spent nearly all of the more than a hundredand fifty million dolars it raised and is sttng on les than four million dollars hes aready dung in to his fun for twenty twenty four ads and borowed money to postbell in georgia some of his allis are begging for tonation saying that he is not paying their legal bills there saying that dume his legal bills will total millins of dollars if not tens of millions of dollars but that is blowin through an awful lot of mon a mean a hundred and fifty million dollars that he is blown through at this point and what he spend anon if you see many donal trump adds donal trump has been running this campaign on the basis of these most famous person on earth an has been for for half a century but i'm it is amazing man they have spent almost a hundredand fifty five million dollars since the twenty twenty election and they spent sixty million dollars making transfers to trumps twenty twenty four campaign super pack make america great again but that is superpack ree funded twelve poing three million dollars to save america in in may and june otherwise save a mericat would av been in debt apparently during the same time period may and june save a merica pent twenty one point six million dollars on legal expenses this is t this a lot of money this a lot of money which by the way is not in amazing way to run a campaign once again donal trump is a billionaire if you are given money to trumps campaign you should really want him to spend that on unor tharganing jobidon but that is not where the money is being pent me well donal trump is trying to go after governor bryan camp in georgia he suggesting the bryng camp should start impeachment proceedings again for tant fanny willis whos the d a in georgia there is no ground there is no legal ground for impeaching fanny willis now you can say oh ket wel there is no legal ground for her going after donal trump either butit is not up to i's not up to brying camp the tate legislature is not going to do it which means that can to get done and it is just going t be bunch of political postering and theatre and bryang camp honestly to his credit is what i'm i'm busy running a state here the somebody has to be in adultin th room i mean at some at some point here here is brancamp the bottom line is hat in the state of george is long as i'm governor we are goin to fall of the law in the constitution regardless of whoit helps or harms politically over the last few years some inside an ouside of this buildin may have forgotten that but i can assureyu i have not in georgea we will not be engaging in political theor the only inflames the mosons of the moment wew'll do what is right we will up hold our ous his public servants in is bobelief that our state will be better off for he says we have a law in the state of georgia that clearly outlines t e legal steps that can be taken if constituents believe thatr local prosecutors are violating their oath by engaging in on athical or ilegal behavior up to this point of notsein evidence that the a wills is actions are lacke teir of warn't action by the prosecuting attorney over sie commission gete late again a bad prosecution does not necessarily mean that brancamp has the power or the ability or should use that ability tho do this nowt agait i totally get the reactionary sentiment which has if anuells is doing something wrong violate whatever laws ye have to in ord to get rid of her since shu's violatin whrever law she has to an i go after donal trump the problem is that in the state of georgia the reason of brancamp thoug the princtabale result ofthis and no one has any second order thinking it at ever ever o case let us as som the brancam did what you ann't do let us in the brancamp and the state legislature in georgia which is a very prurple state now thanks to the inistrations of people donal trump let us say that they went ahead and they move for the impeachment if annuellis let' say that they got it what' say they achieve theimpeachment if anyillis haing re publicans rnin do in th election after that wes hingo great for them or do you think that they might run into sommissues bryancamp stood up to the attempts to overturn the results of the twenty twenty election in georgia and theny when an overwhelming victory against stacy abrams who ise suppose it stacy abrums lest we forget with such in amazing goddess according to left that they made her the empress of of all the universe on sartrack thats you stacy abrams was and shofs defeated solidly by brancamp meanwhile in that same exact ras hershal lalker done from chosen vic for sentet lostro ile wornok instead of fighting puric victories that end up actually undermining the ability to wen e lections in the future maybe we ought to use a little bit of political smarts here but i guess up i that is the question are ween the business of puric victories or puric losses of the case man maxy may not even get what you want or are you inte business of una long turm building in order to stop the lefts at genda and it seems everybody is a short from thinker this one of the other reasons why as to get back to the the first topicalwe discussed that the one o the reasons why you you have eight year olds tha had a government is because you can only is buying a short hurbond right that that they the expiration ate on the thing is very very soon and we are uneasy about the longs from future we do not build movements any more we make short term plays in the hope that the otherside wil ake a bad short trumplay which means effectively you are stwaiting for the other side to do something truly agree just ordior waiting for some sort of ground shift to happen some dalsec maccana now the reality is the dayasec maconit and politics rarely arrives what ou should be doing is building long tur movements dow be the thing that we should be doing is that something that either side isnt wile the left it it for fifty years now seems their stuck in a rud the right did it with regard to rovers's waded and they achieve victory in getting suprim cort to overturn rovers's waed but it seems movement building is a lot of hard works lot in cromental work it is not rewarding and a yunisalot easier is to shout at the moon that is that is the thing that is a lot easier and meanwhile on the twenty twenty four re publican at side of the isle the poles continue show donal trump with a massive and durable lead he continues to be leading in the real clerpozix poll average by about forty points the latist economist yougov pole has been fifty two per cent nationally and rondisantis at sixteen per cent again the line up is the same it is been te same for months at this point it goes trump do santis and then way behind the rest of the pack you will have a variety of romaswamy haly pens and cristy and those of the only candidates or even on the stage and all of them or running way the hell behind donal trum at this point in time now in iwa it is possible the summin could score and upset victory if you are looking to polling an ia right now trump is up but e's up by about twenty points about half his national lead in iwa and is henry ulson points out donal trump haza has made a risky movan iwile by pissing lawful lot of the main leaders in iwa henry ulson n the washington poses ou'ld be easy to conclude from the poles that trumpl crues to victory and i was cauxes in january spend a week in the state it becomes farless certain the former present will star off primary season within early victory because i was eventelical christian community is not yet sold on him is that talk to iwa eventhelical pasters an grasserit is leaderse fllunderstand the newants is of their community better than any polster their mes sage was surprisingly uniform i was he ventolicals have not made up thei'r minds as of yet now culd trump lose iwonce when the when the primarshore i mean he absoluly coud the the the real question is whethe field is going to consolidate and wheather it is going to consolidate behind one alternative candidate even then trump still has the upper handicorne to curent polling

ordered to day also this week i got the chance to down with criss rueful for an episode of the benshipiro shoes on his special in this episode we die cus how to creed a free society through duty an responsibility and how left i stideology has evolved and planted itself into our social institutions plus we dall them to how chriss transition from young leftus to a force for good in the conservative movement it is a great conversation everybody should hear it here is a little bit of the trailer ijus started looking at the people around in these a kind of leftwing radical student grups and and political movements and what i found is that these were people who were the sons and daughters of the most eleate people from around the globe these are people who are using this vocabulary cynically to establish their own status to establish their own power and then after a couple years of wearing the cafia are going to go on and take over their father's company and that was really the the question well if these people are utterly a moral frauds maybe there is something wrong with these ideas make sure you check out the latest episode the bencho pearo sho sunday special this sunday on daily our pluss you to and anybod yo listen to potcas meanwhile we ne tok look at the other republican candidates nobody seems to be gaining a ton of momentum ronisantis handled the latest hurricagne in florida quite well everybody's sort of understands that ecemp for of course presedet and trump who is ripping on him consistently throughout the handling of te hurricagne because this is the way we do our politics now o desanis handled tat pretty well according to politico it showed why he is a darling of conserterce in the doner class hat also exposes his vulnerability why exacoly well because no reason i mean they canrally explain why he id a bad job but they are saying that exposed hs vonerability mainly because in our stupid politics if you are good at a job that does not help you at all apparently and the the biggest thing is that other people can attack you with regard too your performance better not to be an office you can attack everybody than to be an office trying to do the thing there is that o meanwhile never back down which is ot which his ronicants is superpack i they are shifting their re sources to the early states recognizing that here gon need to win the early states early if they wish to carry on the campaign beyond that righthere is the simple math in therepublican prime ereis gos iowa new hampshir south carolina the santis basically has to wint allthree if he wins iwa and he loses new hampsire trump trumpis gon walk away with it if he wins iwa in new hampshire and trump win south carolina handaly because the field splits trumpis proliganasweep an th this is this is the math for to santis oe shifting all his resources into the early states he shouldhave done that earlier is the truth he theyve ended their dornocking in nevada and the superto say say some me blessing this is sign of to santis campaign's weakeness maybe it may also be a sign of just trump strength in a lot of these states the cannot diversifier force s youhave to concentrate them where you think trump is most vulnerably got a knock him out of the box right out o the gate that that basicalley's the only way to win these primaries nickey haley is tarting gain some credtability it looks right now as tho the rest of the fight the rest of the field may consolidate down to do santis ferses hailey ot which wuld not be particually shocking romasuwamy is running a self funded campaign he also is i would say the darling of a sort of he leat in the in the twitter verse but he does not have tremendous grasser support he is not really building a grassrys organization is geting a lot of earn media an that ern meedya has nt eesarely translating into heighten poll mumbers especially because he is catering to a particular sub set of people whar on twitter by saying sort of things that i think he knows are not true and then he is and then he sort of new onsing them afterward do it doi think that romaswuammy is that the vague is a a sort of durable candidate going foward in th re publican party may it maybe next time around i do not thnk this time around he is going to be one of the top three candidates it seems right now the field seems to be consolidating a round trump to santis hailey that is trump bilock a huge margin and then te santis and haley after that mi pence does not seem to be gaining any sort of momentum he is still speaking to small crowds in iowa again hthe question is to why pence his running remains at the tip of everybody's tongue the truth is to probably is just a way to to button up his legacy i because thethe reality is the trump is stillvery popular inside their publican party pence defending his own actions in january of twenty twenty one i thing is well worth while whether that has to happen in t a presidential campaign i i am not iam not certain meanwhile in other political news the white house is begging congress to pass short from spending yeall and boose foodate according to the washington post there urging congres to adopt ta short tor messure to fun the federal government a movement to buy time for lall makerscraft a brought or spending deal and avert another shut down at the end of september here is the math an for everybody howe do the shut town rotine every six months in this country here is the math if republicans control the house but not the senate or the presidency the'renot can to get everything they want end of story that is that is all and if there is a massive government shut down and which things just do not move forward the people who are likely to bear the burden of that over time is just the way the political mouth works ar the people whar not signing the chacks jobidon wrongfooted himself last time in the showdown he said i'm not an negotite at all he is said no negotiations there is a huge mistake by him he is a lad mc carthy to come forward and say okay well we are gon negotiate i wahere is our opening position let us neg otiate and bynaes lay i'm not negotianin you ade by look the baggi well these thewair stupid political mount a not the wait listen in ideally in an at idealistically pure world the way that work is republican to say here are the here are the various departments funded as departments ri thet be what we call regular order it has not obtained in washington to see for at least a couple of decades i will fund the defense department that we will fund the education departmnt that well fund thet commerce department that that has not happened we have ben doing omnibuses for last several decades in the united states het the normal way that would work is that they have then negotiate over each one o thos bills and that has not happened becuse tere's to much back scratchang in there' much pork berrel rolling and there is there is too much negotiation with the other branches of government and theother party et with that said if republicans take tet up from position we 're not negotiatin whatsoever the'e gon to bear the political bront if something does not go forward yeu got o get the best that you can get an is it is my job to point out were that trace frm principle but it is the job of people in congress to get the bess that they can get rigd it is all ha negotiation when jo bidn demands a short from spending bill should he be given a short from spending bolt no he should not bu re publicans should lay out a couple of key concessions they wish to win in the next spending battle andthen they should fight for those concessionsand they shuld say lissem were willing to give up a lot ofstuff that we do not want o give u but you got to give something to that is the way that you win a government shut down fight contrary to can of talk radyo opinion the way the when a government shut down fight is not typically to shut down the govrnment for prolonged periods of time it does not seem to redowncet the benefit of the party perceived as being more intransigen now as thi say the democrats can fall in to the trap right the emocrats can say we will not to gotiate at all worgan a be intransgent then they will pay the political price for they are entransgents the chio p demands mark sharpbreake with th deal party leaders including how speaker mc carthy worked ou wit the president tho spring to raise the nations tetlement the suppose to prevents another stale mate over spending this fall now the biht administrations explicitly asking congress to adopt what is known as a sar that is continuing resolution at this point now were can t have that battle next week earlier of this month mc carthy and chuckshume mer each signaled early support for continuing resolution they might offer lall makers more time to craft a full year spending deal i'm but o mitch mc conell sad on wednesday it is pretty big mass he predicted that lall mkers would adoupt to short from dealind to december while they trugger to struggle i figr out exactly with government spending level is going to be the reason that i say that the split government works that that that the spplit government between republicans and democrat's means that publicans are not going to get what they want out of the deal is because they will not joumons can oveeto it this sort of the quixotic quest idealistically pure but politically politically counter productive a tempt by ten cruis in twenty fourteen to d fun the federal government to get chut at to get barockabo mach orepealabomicar it was not going to happen brocklon was not going to repeal abomicar and that there is certain things that may help individual politicions because it make them look purer to the bays that do not actually achieve the thing but that there is difference between that an actively stumping for things that you think you can achievin negotiation rigt chip roy did that last time around he did that with regard to the the budgeting process and he also do that with regard to for example keven mac carthy speakership itself and he wants him important concession that should be something that is is on the table meanwhile jobidon trying to lock up the youth vot by giving them leed apparently according to political the bite admnistrations department of helth in human services is recommending that the d e significantly loosin federal restrictions on mariwana stope short of adbising it hould be entirely removed from the controlled substance is act the health gency wants the drug move from schetural one to schettural three under the sesa thatit is potentially the bigest change in federal drug policy ans decade we already have a huge percentage of american youngsters who are toking and on making nothing of their lives then the first of all we ave now tobunked in very thorough fashion the scientific communic has dobone the idea that mariwan is not addictive that is not true it is just notrue first valt it is significantly more potent than when you workit second of all it is actually quite addictive for a large percentage people who take it the idea that it is completely beenign portulif young people is ae complete lie i do not no culturally got tothe point were to backo products are considered the great rout of all evil becauseyou might di have lung cancer when you'r sixty but marwana which makes you useless if youd if you use it on the regular is somehow considered what' some sort of societal good i man i know people personally who have serious problems ith mariwana addiction and it is a it is a it is a massive issue and meanwhile the bide administration seeking apparently to make everybody fat stupid useless is a is going to move toward mord criminalization on on mariwana na can make the case the federl government is bad at the warrendrugs that that is a case that i'm actually somewhat warm to but that is on a case that jobidnis over made he is doing this on idea logical grounds the ach us letter is part of an officral of iou processnt initiated by bid in last october the afthe a conducts the rof view it sent to the national institute on druggabuse in the h chess the ahet just transments th letter of recommendation to the d e eh the white house is refusing to comment on ther o viewu process this will lead to a federal state conflict becaue the federal low has failed to kep up with mass ove changes of the past decades in state canavas lost by the way s worked out beautiflly for california and for states holerada ere denver is now basically an open air drug market things are things are working out absolutely beautifully h criminalization of mariwana it mighthave been an idea that was sumerable for a time but the the effects of it have been pretty pretty bad meanwhile democrats continue to use climate change as there excuse for pretty much everything the governor of hawa josh green he is asked out whether hawie's electric company had been responsible for the complete destruction of lahinah which is one of the reat tragedies of modern american history really is quite horrifying and it is pretty obvious that probably hoi electrictsior o shut down the electric substations and they did not and probably led to this fire in the middle of this giant gant windstorm and a he was well i'm not gon to say anything about the power company bud om the sun global warming how much responsibility f you think the power company bere here for the fire it is a very goo question to day then which was on the ten i ask my attorney genera l instructed her to do comprehensive investigations she is doing that right now she is brought n outside investigator in i from the mainland that has fire expert sees she is can find out exactly how much we do know that that early fire was sparke as as he got said i do not lat jump ta conclusions just because i do not think its fair for me to do that but we will hold everyone accountable one hundred per cent and will be very transparent about it release all the reports i think that in the end of the day we all have to acknowledge that this is a global problem it was a very very hot dry terrible storm we are feeling with lobel warming here we had six total fire emergencies from nineteen fifty three to two thousand of three and then we had six in the first two weeks of this month cay on it is the is to get out of jail free car for bad governments it turns out the human beings of been dealing with environmental disasters for literally all of human history how you handle that is a good measure of are you good at your job or not and on he handled this about of badles you can handle it soa globel warming is the problem of course meanwhile trobidin doing the same sactrotine it such a get out of jail freecard climate changes now basely the excuse for everything and we handled the disaster badly in laheinot well it was climate change the the economy is having probins whell that that is probably because of climate change th the war is breaking out th mite is climate change everyting is climate changeis is the it is the ultimate political get out of jail free card we still some denie sha tere the turms yo o worther nan climates doit ti is and the workan need a wholl he op more money to deal wis to merse herprations to dea is to all you taking cure oh the answer is a a lop or money and that i did not ee that coming jrobidn calling for more spending on things no no by the way the the notion that hurricanes are dramatically created by the globe warming issue that data is not particularly clear as beorn lomburg points out and lantic hurricanes are not becomeng more frequent the frequency of hurricanes making landfall in the contentual united states has to cline slightly since nineteen hundred airplaines in satelites of dramatically increase the number of storms scientists can spot at s which is by the frequency of landfall hurricanes relibely tok commen to bac to nineteen hundred is better staf than the total number of atlantic hurricanes there are more powerful hurricanes either the frequency of cat three in above hurricanes making landfallsonces nineteen hundred is trending slightly down you her a lot about huricanes getting stronger a study in the journal of nature found that the increases are not part of these century skell increese but a recovery from a deep minnimum in the sixties through the eighties yap i it is it is once again it comes down to governments an ability to governook a time force some things i and some things that i hate to day i begin with a thing that i hate because this is legitimately one of the dummistakes i've ever heard my entire life here it is it comes o curtesy of farhead man jue of the new ar times who is a reliable a reliable source for some the dumi stuy ever heard ka and hundi helps enable a crimeway thay should pay for it wait you ask arkia and hendi hiring g angs of criminals to steal each other's vehicles no that is non what they did apparently they just did not take enough precautions to prevent people from stealing their vehicles i'm not getting this is his case in a recent analysis of data from thirty seven american cities the councl on criminal justice a non partison thing tank suggested a hopeful tren the pandemic ir a spite and crimavf pikes the homicide rade has droped significantly over the last year based on dat ut from thirty american cities but thre's a glaring exception auto thefts according to the council on criminal justice the number of vehicl thefts during the first half of twenty twenty three was thirty three poin five per sen hiher on average than during the same puriod and twenty twenty two representing twenty three thousand nine hundred seventy for more vehicle thefts in the cities that wre worto data thot'd be filly washington you see chicagon warlans buffalo in durham and nor north calina motor f vehicle thefts this year have more than doubled relative to last year according to staffs collected by jeff asher a crime day to annalist why are many cars getting stolen police departments and city officials point to this millions of keeas and hundize are ridiculously easy to steal oh that oh it is oh saids the far it is that it is th's the fault of the car you see the car basically wanted it it is skirt was too short it needed to be stolen that is the way that jus works it is not the criminaled the cars just sitting there and the criminal was not a criminal os just you you ere just walking down the stree lik a normal human never having stoleen carn life ind there you saw it in the pure son summer sunshine a keea ultima and you are ah what is duvist thing the time has com that is the easiest car to steel and you drawn a moth to the flame walked over two the eea you said sure that is non a very nice car shurerally want a keea ow i was not desperate for any of of of keea's brands wy i just they are evy six was not migt was not my bag they are tellyoride was not mything but now that i see it now that i see gleaming in the summer sunshine and i know it supereasy to steal i a lifelong law biding citizen have decided to steal tis keea that is exactly how went probably acoring o far had manju for years now most autor makers have equipped most of the cars they sele in the us to the loctronicimobalizers deviceis that prevent cars from starting unless they detect a radio idicoat associate wit the cars right ful key but hundi and keea which come under the same e south crein conlomerate did not install this basic devicse in somewhere round nine million cars sold between twenty eleven and twenty twenty two a couple of years ago vidos showing hous to hot wire the vulnerable cars began to pop up a line without going into details the hack anvalls jamming a small object into the car starter and turning it as if rekey one perfectly shaped tool for the dob as readily available a u us feplog i'm glad that far had manju is now explained people how to steala cars is grap the resultsin crime it his clobbered american cities were hidnin close to six thousand cars that been stolen s yuare alones at adrian deas sattles police's chief more than third of the cars stolen were hundize and keeas and then therear the follow on accident stolen keas an hundize have been involved in numerous edly crashes armed robbery spreets andother crimes around the country woh idn't expect that from the keeas an hundize that is crazy basically the eeas on their own n we are stolen thereisn'n knownce to blame for this it was their own fault because there easyto steal and then the key a robbed a bank in one on an armed robbery spree or shall we set y u weels robbery spree all by itself amazing stuff from the key t wal i cannot believe they programme these cars to perform armed robbery wild well seatle is one of several city suing kea and hundi they make a compelling cas says far head mantu the carmaker shuld have known they were creeting un safe fo a you are did i guise did that if you create a product an it is stolen it is your fault it was stolen and you created an unsafe product because you knew was problican be stolen the costs of their decision have had far reaching effects on public safety and city resources there is no telling one thefts might abate im that is amazing fire mans yu laments he says it is difficult for cities to prove that the ris an thefts is primarily keia and hundise fault richard rosen fell to criminologist is one of the authors on the council on cronal justice and alsis told me motor vehicle theft is an under research phenomenon but staff's release by some of the worst effected citys strongly suggeft thefts of keis an hundise are major part of the recent spike there is a chance cant and hunti will escape some of the blame for these theffts there is a jucier target for politicians toglafter social medea platforms where the howtuvidios havebeen circulating this strikes me as a bazar blame shifting its keion hundi not tiktock that sold theftfrom cars wait why rwe blemming tiktock or you how about you blame criminals i do not understand theres hi got thord party you are doing all the criming it idnt diktok in hundi itn keya it is the criminals but these people are stuplislic to stupidistic i've ever heard wel there is the knife who as sitting tere in plainsight and you are jus drawn to it you could not stop yourself and you stab your friend in te eyeball probably we should see the knife manufacturer ore alternatively the uch of that youwere you learned that knive stab things this how dum we have become hab out some basic level of personal responsibility well he cannot sey that because you note this might require more police more active policing more throwing criminals in the jail and leaving them in the jail i know this is superbasic stuff but not apparently to these morons i slow clap for for that genius take there that that is some strong stuff ok ca meanwhile let us get to a thing that i things that i today when joroggen had on oliver anthony he is the guy from a rich men north of richmond whos becomes from a national phenomenon he his song led off the first republican debate i he says he is ot a political figure which is perfectly fine i thing most americans he relat usn'n folo politics allthat closely but that his generalized annoyance and t leak class that seeks to control the lives to americans and a in use its power to redistribute as he says from sort o the productive to the un productive that is inherently political even if he does not wish it to be a partisan issue i wel was fascinating to watch him on rogan because as a a sort of blue collar dued ke was able to say some things to to joe that a lot of people need to hear now now i've quoted te bible to to my friend joroggan before it has having a diverenimpack when come from oliver anthonhe hear is oliver anthony on with jorogan yesterday there is there is things it si slike and i'l be very brief r this a promise but one thing ironically it is a proverbs for twenty which i thought cere this anything better it ram prist my son pay attention to what i say turn your ear to my words do not let them out o your sight keep them within your heart for they are life to those who find them and health the one's whole body above all else guard your heart for everything you do flows from it keep your mouth free from perversity keep corrupt talk far from your lips let your eyes look straight ahead fix your gaze directly before you give careful thought to the path for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways do not turn to the right or the left keep your foot from evil but om thit is pretty profound but the whole book of proverbs is that it is not preciit is not it is not what you think it is it is it is good guidance is good guidance that you would want a father to give to this son good for aliver anthony again this is the part of american life and he tells the story by theway and his stories rally fascinating cas he basically says that he was ke was involved in drug use and he was involved an alcohol use and hofs vusily falling apart in your suicide and and then he discovered religion and just a lot of other people who have discovered religion over the course of religious history ke then found inspiration there and within six months he was writing songs that people wanted to hear and basically his song is to plead for leave me alone and personal responsibility that is really what it is let these people not bother me and let me live my life in contonence with walking in the ways of god this is the way that america used to work and and the fact that i it is kind of incredible how basic messages i'ms the book of proverbs is kind of an old book and it is familiar to many of us and in's mishli in in hebrew it is been amound for several thousand years and the fact that used to be the the sentences that oliver anthony is reading thare these used to be the kinds of sentence is that pretty much everybody in america had it to their tongue youcould basically quote the book of juteronomy and it would be a common point of of reference in the same way that in britan you could quote shakespeare knows a common point of reference the bible was the tax that everybody used for literally centuries the taxt that was for many people the only text they knew was the bible there is a reason why the the most printed book in human history is the bible and now if you speaks a regular person on the street and you quote the bible they do not know a damn thing about it and that is a real problem because the bible does carry with it a set of values it is not just a bunch of vague standards that are unimplementable in your daily life as it says in th book of guteronomy it is not far from you it is close to you in your mouth writing that this the the basic notion that the morality of the bible is available to every one and that it is actually fairly understandable and vairly clear and the provides to basic guide to life this was the thing that fell away in favor of its notion tht you can define your own value system in that just follow your stars follow what you feel in your heart follow that that is not what the bible is saying that is not what proverbs is saying and oliver anthony when he move from living in one way to a biblical way of living improved his life fairly dramatically the bible is still the greatest self help book ever written because it is not about you that the whole point of self help is that it really is not about yous that you orienting outside yourself you cannot help yourself if you'r orientad toward yourself you are the problem and we live in a society where you are not allowed to say to people that that they are the problem with their own life but the truth is ninety fie percent of the probles ing your life are you problems mean that the promise that you can solve or that you have to handle and that in handling your life gets better that does not mean that horrible things do not happen in people financially helth life of course horrible things happen to people but the only way that you can solve those kind of promising relifh our army fixing the external circumstance is by how you approach that problem ther's appoing that victor frankl makes even with regard of the holicos he says even when you are put in literally the worse situation that human being cam put into it is your measure of autonomy in dealing with that situation that makes you human being that is what piblical valluys used to teach and it used to be in grain from the time tha you were very very young there is some people who lead that sort of life instinctively joe is not a biblical liver but joe is the kind of person who approach his life that way ifyou uctually no joe i'm friends with joe that the way that you approaches his own life is in this way isthat how can i help myself how to i solve the problem not howdo i blame somebody else you then comes and solves the problem for me one ofthey promise their politics is just that every's waiting for the dayosec maccana re's waiting for somebody come along and solve all the probems for them and the politicians whare those popular are the pie pipers who save this kind of stuff well i will solve your probise i will come in with th power goverment i will fix everything but that is not possible they cannot do that every'slooking as i seit on twitter to day ever i's looking for the daus exmacanameing the god outside the machine there us to be something in greek theatere where basically the writer would run into a proble of his own making they could not fix and suddenly a god would arrive from the rafters apolla which a show op and boom fix the probm that was davs ex mackan out right wats the god in the outside the machine thatwas can fix everything well instead of looking but but now we have basically attributed those kind of powers to our leat and then were surprise when the can fulfilit how boutn't stop instead of looking for a dausex macanam to fix everything or a miracle tho fix everyting how about we actually look to the set of values tht built the civilization that we have garnered all benefit from while giving very little back hoabout that that would be the thing that action makes ma difference it was it was a pretty fascinating appearance at roguean also on during this appearance went after rain wilson rain wilson had gone after oliver anthony and here was a joe going after rainwilson in returned it is it is a subject of discussion everybody is getting involved and and somehow another became cultural and then there is a dwite from the office oh yeh ichive i it if he get a rit acultural and the would it e say something you would not write about over wa people on welfare heu would ride about billionaires in their taxes yeh there is nothing funnier then millionaires talkit ha ha ha ha there is s nothin funny funnier about millionaires pretending these bmillionaires are out ata taie you no take take delight from the office down tho west virgenia now take em take m through those coal mining countries take em through those places in appalatia were people of extreme poverty yoave in pills of ravished those areas take em to there he is not wrong about any of that but but the key there is that if you do not want talk down to people who yourain wilson i want to talk down to people who are living appalacha and in poverty then do not talk down to them meaning they are human beings with equal worth and equal merit in god's view as as just human beings thtthere can t have to earn there cano have to earn you there they are good in front of god but the idea that that they are of equal godly worth that that of course basic lilical val which also means they have equal responsibility is responsibility that that has fallen away here the alveranthony appearance on rogguen is definitely worth the watch if she spend some time with it it is really it is really good ardygoes rest to hall continues right nowyou now con won mister will be speaking with doctor mardy mac carry of johns topkins university if you are not

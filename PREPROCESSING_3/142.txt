jo bidon spent four years pretending his seventh grandchild does not exis but now he is reversed himself the partmen of justice encourages the arrest of hunter bidon's business partner two days before his conrussional testimony and tom trums ventions campaign rolls on i'm benshpere o this is the venshperro sho the benchpir shos monterbaepressve pien protect youre all mine privacy to day expressivepiantocom flashmen were te president of the united states is wildly on popular and a lot of people have attributed that to his policies the fact that is policies are all about gigantic government spending or equity at the centere of all things or weak foreign policy including the pull out from afkaniston but the reality is that the reason tht jobidon has been sinking in the polsesbecause americans do not him personally umlike berokabama her the poll showed they dhad personally that in 's policies with jobidon the co are just intertwine jo bidon is not liked personally and the turning point for him was actually the pull out from afkanistan un till that point there an a widespread perception that he is a kindly elderly gensman was not all there but nassons was a fairly o ka guy but when he pulled out from afkanistan and basically set i do not care what happens there when ther ar people falling off wheel wells an american soldiers getting blown up and his entire administration sitting there talking bout what a wonderful job they were doing that really sunk the perception of the american public about him but he is now under scored that in radical terms tbecause of his association with his son hunter the public mine with regard to hunter bidon has shifted to it' started off with hunter bidon derolit bad guy drug abuser pornography abuser prostitute abuser the gi a bad person but joe ouno decent dad trying take care of his drug ad dicted son tring micture that his son was o ca sympathetic figure and then as all these corruption stories roll out the stories about how hunter was going aroundping of jian bags of cash from foreign sources and jo was in all likelihood benefiting from that the documents on hunter bidon's labtop in which hunerbiden is bbragging i to his daughter about funding daddy the documents from his labtop suggesting that joe was taking part in meetings either by phone or sometimes even tin persons stopping by meetings an saying hullo documents suggesting that hunter bidon was saying two foreign officials that jobiden was sing next to him as he attempted to escentially pri mony out of them e combine that with jobidon's treatment of hunter bidons illegitimate daughter and thing starts who go bad for jobidon interoms public perception real fast lurking in the background of the bidon family story has always been this idea that the are incredibly tribl that if you are a bidon then you get to benefit from the sweethart deals that are associated with the bidon last name if you'r frank bidian go round pick up cash jobidon's brother if you are hunter an go round pick up cash tbecause of course you are member of the corrupt bidon family but if they choose not to give you the name if they decide that they are not going to extend the name to you then you are basically cut off at the knees and who better to apply that logic to then a small baby as we all know at this point hunter bidon had a sectual relationship with a woman in london roberts london r berts was acting apparently as his quasi assistent and by quasias sistent we mean that hunter was basically using her not just for her secretarial abilities but for aparently other purposis and reasons sexual in nature and a she bore a child by him whom she named navy jone navy jon was bay was born way back in twenty nineteen it is curnlly twenty twenty three for years jobidon has maintained that he has six grandchildren he does not yes seven he is had seven grandchildren for four years and there is no real religious objection here emis not as though he has differencis with hunter and therefore his cut hunter off from the family or something that this is some lady that hunter got pregnan and a kid who obviously is jobidon's granddaughter who he is simply rere refused to give the bidon last nme which of course is the improm atoure of not only legitimacy but also of money making in the bidon family literally the onlythng of matters is that last name thas the only thing it is not jo bidons magic political skill said he has no magic political skill said he rean for a for presdent one hundred times before he latched on to the rising star of berokabama and then rode that in his oxygenarian years to the presidency of the united states over donal trump he the bidon last name is the moneymaker and that is explicitly what was denied to navy jon in fact in the paternity hearings about navy jon jobidon prismaly hunter bidon said in the in the final analysis that navy jone would be denied hunters last name the only thing that hunter would be giving to navy jon and an hermommi were some finger paintings that hunter bidon had created then presumably there would be some sort of corrupt teal or somebody buys those paintings off of navy jone's mom and tso money laundering operation essentially on behalf of bidon family yet again by big namedjowners who will buy hunter bidon's paintings from london roberts and then that money will eventually see navyjo but navyjone will be denied the magical bidon last name that has meant literlly tends of million of dollars flowing into family coffers for decades on end jobidon cares about his granddaughter much that he literally refused to acknowledge her existence at the white house there is a christmas stocking for his dawn ouknow the one thoase biting all the secret servitations but there is no christmas stocking for the grandor he refused to acknowledge what over the wek et jobidon reverse that whel the poll mumbers mustgon ro bad becaue the is nothing that changed in principal here it was not as though jo bidon suddenly it dawns on him that maby he should acknowledge his seventh grandchild no what happened here is pretty obvious the american people do not it when this supposed kindly old family man who is entire excuse for his really ludicrously soff treatment of his son has been that he loves his son o much he is the beautiful boy he is never done anything wrong it turns out that datlison hold water when you are willing to dison a four year old ra it is it is easy to make the claime that you love your kid much tho you let them get away with stuff when youre when when everybody in the family is treated with this level of warmth but when you say this for year old ho through no fault of her own was born of of your son is not part of the family but the son who is a crack dictid derelecht who runs around the world picking up bats of cash he is in good with me that appears a lot more corruption than does family loyalty because apparently o get kicked out ofthe family all that is required it is for your mom to be somebody that jo bidon does not very much or five shumiliating but tobe included in all family activities up to an including present day even after pleading guilty to actual federal mis demeaners all you really have to do is go out and continue to pick up bags of cash if you are hunts er bidon or have picked up bags of cash in the past over the we getn jobidon and jobidon put out a statement finally about this missing grandchild wh it is that in just one second first that a company is actully looking out for you when they up greater

slashschippuro hure is the statemen that joe and jo bidon put out to people magazine to people the greatest of all new sources quote our son hunter and navy's mother london are working together to foster or relationship that is in the best interest of their daughter preserving her privacy as much as possible going forward wultomen a great way to preserve for privacy was not to make her the center of a political scandal for nion for years thatm in easy way but if joe had just said seven grand children the whole time would that been a controversy or would we nown would we kno navy jone's name do itdo any of jobidons o other grand children's name i'm put it that way name another jobidon grandchild go quick do no no you have never heard of them right because it is only a controversy when you refuse to name your grand child because your son ciers or office o former stripper or something this is not a political issue it is a family matters said president bidon jo and i only want let usbest for all of our grand children including navy a source familiar with the situation tells people the recently resolve child support dispute betwen hunter and london has dictated how the relationship is played out far ok ka that that source familiar at the situation robably be the bidon family because who else exactly a the sadn quote you have remember there ire some fairly contentious legal proceedings between navies parents happening until just a few weeks ago at's grand parents the bidons are following hunters lead they are and have been giving hunter in london the space an time to figure things out what idn under stand what they held does that have to do with joe acknowledging that navy jone is his gran ked how is that impacto legald's view it it that there is no dispute whatsoever that that is in fact the case and n they literlly did a paterny test and made twenty nineteen to determined that navy jone is in fact hunter's kid if joge jus been saying this the whole time is a gab that a nol i'm not uncomment on their legal situation that' seen mommy and daddy in this particular case but of course she is our grand child and we love er i mean that such an easy answer again the reality is that there is only one thing that jobidn cares about in life and that is the biden name he is made this absolutely clear he says this over and over in public life that the bidon family i swear on the bidin family name the bidon family tand becase the bidon family name again is his only valuable tool and it was only valuable really t everybody who is around him because able to parley his situation as a center into jobs and cash for his san for his brother for everybody else and presumably some that cash came back to him i say presumably becuse again we have documented accusations that that is the case from hunter from his laptop speaking to people the sorce notes the situation is a family ishu quote thousands of familyes to fae similar circumstance is working it out in private verses the spolight know they have not ne how many how many families are there where the grand parents refuse to even acknowledge that they have a grand child unless there is some sort of family dispute in which the parents of the child are stranged from the grand parents truly i it is it is serious question 's this happen a lot where the parents are not a strange not only is is daddy not a strange from grandpa theyve basiclly live together in the same room in daddy is is flying around the world in staying literally in the same room in place ireland with grandpa if he has an iloge in ma child is it is this a commenthing at the centre is a foral girl everyone wants was best for her including all f her grandpares i do not think thats that is been proved by the record but say that it stok until she was four ocase she is four years old she is four is is not a two month matter is a four year matter why dos this matter well because it goes to character because in politics if as thet emcratic party suggests character matters in maters much the donal trump couldnt should never a been president he should never be president again because of his character defects well the fact is that jobidon has pertrade himself in way that dontrup neverdid jobina's pertrade himself as a generous kind hearted family man who only cares about the members of his family above all much that he is purely somepathatic to his drug adicted boozadold son but when it comes to the gran kid well then that is off limits it is off limits until we decide to say something it wich point it is on limits for just a second ti to say once again what a great grandpad jo is and then back to being off limits again and of course the media are lapping this up becuse the media had no questions about this for very very long ton here for example is emasemisi ancher ally raphusan ol they want is to preserve this little girl's privacy again if they wonce preserve her privacy hed bin the easiest way to do that to just to have jobidon say he has seven grand children which he did alic the president has never hared his ras in in her not publicly acknowledging this little girl but i thorfamiliar with the family situation tolthen bethin ews he is a boy in doing until now to give his son and the girls lother the tinans fate tonavicate this the president who is always made his family a very public part of his life now ask hing to preserve thi little girls private thefe at this point it fill un queer why theren't tha family dynamexchange at all sa again it is all that the preservation of the privacy and then if you uction mention the actual situation then members the medoshet you downs usse yet an hos case he hund wat had on a sin and annalistname s cott jennings ans cotcchunnings is going pretty hard after hunter and immediately casey huntumpson shk we have to be respectful do we though to we hae ter be respectal of hunter who undoubted lose acting as a foreign agents of multiple governments and who sired a child by a person he calls ho secretary an who then ignored that child for four years an whois denied that chiuse his last name to it do e have to treet hunter with respect hunter is a terrible person ou fel any necessity treeton and he is a public figure in far as he was picking up bags of cash with his daddy's name on them me come on but here is sheanen going into defence mode and speen mode here it is not republicans with all dere respect wo made hunter bid men to a complete scumbag on this another issues i the ignoring his own daughter the four years and the present united states hanging up a stocking for the dog man th an honor or his seventh grand shy l cannot we an also ar we can allsity sympathy for people who are struggling with a diction let keep this corafision rsi listen i totally agree an on from a lot of fane wits deal with a diction and who ins a picking up the pieces the grand pearene and in this case the grand pearence would not acknowledge this little girl it is o fensive but the botom line is but they have now the po oh what a hero i mean the fact that she says that she jumps in and tries to scop stop scott jennings ffrom doing all this is just demonstrative of everything that the biden family relies upon which is the acquiescence of the media in all these situations which is really what much of this is about wllget's more on this in just one second because again the hunter bidensoga is in fact going to do serious damage to jo in a way that then nothing is going to damagtertrum as i've said before tis beentrue for years donal trumplen it comes to this race is essentially a mud monster the more mud you thraw on him the more he is made of mud you cannot you cannot sully the frock of somebody whose frock is made of mud there is no way to do it but jobiden proclaimed that he is a decent honest hard working family man and it turns out that he actually is a pretty corrupt old politician who is willing to manipulate and use his drug at old son to pick up bags of cashabroad wele ignoring his grand child andan thats that is not quite the same look we it is more o this injust one second first innovation

back go to one eight for three reefuns or get ree funs dot com to get start and see if you are eligible for that employ retention credit to day i'l ge meanwhile the deoja put out a super bazar letter over the week en thedepartmen of justice obviously attempted to cut a sweetharteal with hunterbidon lie a real sweethartdeal much was weed hard teal tht as wo explain last week when i was exposed to the light of day they immediately dissociated themselves from the the swethart tel the attempted to cut basically they had two sets of charges one was the tax charges one wis the gun charges guns hunter bidon in the tax charges they din't say anything about waving further investigations and charges with regard for for example the foreign agents regerstration act which hunter bidn clearly violated who is acting as an and use on bereezma's bord and trying to lobby politicions on behalf of breezma it brismofs you cranian energy company he was doing this also on behalf of chinese companies there is no question thet he violated the terms of the forein ations registration act by any available measure and s the question is are there further in vestigations that are going to bear fruit not only with regard to hunter but maybe might jus touch jo and the deoja was eager to basically get all of these clains off the table and there was this can bezar open battle that was happening bet tween the deo ja and hunter bions legalty wore hunter bins legltin would go on national tellvison and then they would take things well by our understanding all charges are now off the table an the geo jo big na the're not really and he would tay yany now they tey really are whell turns out that hunter bidon's lawyers had reason to think because these tax charges which were publicly available those did not wave further charges but what did wat the diversionary agreement on the gun charge it said that anything related to the tax charges in cluding presumably farabiolations would be waved well the judge saw this and the judge immediately was aw this seems corrupt and bad are hiding the deal and the deogas we never made a deal what are you suggeston and they had to back off f it which is wi the plea agreement is still in limbo between hunter bidon end the deo j and that is really really corrupt stuff oll hy will over the week en the do j also sent a letter two devon archers attorneys doven archer is the former business partner of hunter bidon who is now testifying to day behind closed ors before congress talking about jobidon and how jobidont would get called into meetings and how the big gui was jobidon and all of this sort of stuff it really could be devistating stuff for hunter bidon as well as jobidon because again jo proclaim that yeu knew nothing about hunter bidon's businesses which is werd when you are etting called by hnter bion's business partners on the phone and he is puttng you on the phone with them is line in other words whel he is most to testify to that before congress to day whell literally two days before that happens a letter is send from damian williams you uss a turny san quote the government respectfully request that if fun in be ordered to surrender at date and time to tur nment by the cort to a facility designated by the bureaue prisons to commence his term of imprisonment the goernment is conferred with council for the thefend in about this request in ask the council proposed ate for the defend an surrender council respond with the following position mister archer believes it is premature to set up a report date in light ifes anticipated continuing appeal as well as the newly discovered sentencing error the government has now concluded council for mister archwll put in response the goverment's request by wednesday the government disagrees ofh the council's position reportsdate should not be seid to another words thereis a dispute between the atturniy for devon archer he is been convicted in other crimes and the do ja literally sents a letter over the week en saying we would to set a day for him to come in and turn himself in this was interpreted b interpreted by sommet including he your postmarande divine suggesting that they wanted devern archereturnself in to jail before he actuallywas able gives congresional testimony apparently that is not the case but the letter itself is still kind of weird i mean a letter that you send publicly an's now publicly available a letter these sends to the attorniys of the person wh's about to testify before congress from the doj run by the father of the person with whom you were business partner saying reachin herself in for jelliet what is a story reade t you readeor jail whet whent wen ring an find out that is a little weird it raises tospecivicissues one publicly and again tries to label devon archer an untrust worthe unreliable source because it reminds the entire public at the guy as playd guilty to grimes and second it reminds devernarcher who is in charge namely the doj and a youre member jobidon archer's council again rejected the notion the is any connection betwen archer tif wit the justitce partment is potential imminent jail time he said we are weare of speculation the dogays week and request have archer report to prison is an atent by the bi naminstration to in timidate him in vance of his meeting with the house over si committee to be clear mister archer is not agreed that speculation in any case mister archrall do hit h has planded to all along he will show up on monday and honestly answer the questions puts him by the congressional eft what elsedo you think he is going to say if he is actually being intimitated by jobidon's doj he is cn be outr bing i'm being intiminated by jobiden's goja who has complete control over my sentencing orsingan ga publicly ans hena say wath he is expected to say thus achieving me purpose of the letter we will see what deen rcher has to say behind closed doors but that is definitely superweird meanwhile you have people who were very much involved in the trump impeachmen representative dan goldman saying the process on on the do this this all fully above board the hunter bidon pleadeal is fully above bord n grat we surprise to see the judge in delaware reject the pledial bot rejected woutd not acceptant well this is a fairly typical process that goes through this was an unusual agreement in part because it is a twenty four month aagreement and there is the possibility that don'l trump will be president and we know from his presiden e how much he weaponize the department of just is to go after his enemies and to favor his associates and hunter bidanc's lawyers are concerned that don'l trump if he were to get the presidenccy would weaponize the department of justice and there is tan added calculation to this but the fact of the matter is that this is a trump apointed you est the turney a trump apointed judge this is a very a in dependent and thorough investigation and i think that whatever happens in the hunter byning case we can rest is sured that it was done base solely on the facts an the evidence and that there is nothing else to it othere is nothing to it it is all i's all wonderful according to dan golman ahad of the impeachment management for out for nonal trump yes i i totally believe you dan gullman in just one second ill

chippiro o case naturally the the out come from the media when comes to hunter by ns corruption an yourbins potential involvemant in that corruption is that there is nothing to see here chucktod over ont enmat on b sees as the republicans are ging to go after joe and hunter whether there is anything there or not o it is the first val letme point out you giset the standard you did it is way politic's works well may wish that it worked we are one side acted above board in the other side was scirrilous but here is the reality if the rules only apply to one side they are not rules and if you go after donal trump for four long years bull crap in vestigations o actually who is a member of the russian uligarky and you have adam shift troted out on placeis meet the press routinely 's og byhow they hve a smoking gun hidden behind clothes they cant shots you now the cant chup bet sooner or later they will emerge from behind the priceis right curtain and they will explain to you exactly how donald trump was working hands in glove with lad reputin and turns out all lo be false wo guess what when the shoe is on the other foot things are goingto be kinisnt now here is the reality we currentwe have more documented evidence that joe bidon was receiving benefit from hunter bidon's foreign payos not donald trump was receiving foreign payos that evidence is much better for joe then it is with regard to donal trump we silv y t to see what it what is the documento benefit the donald trump received from for example we rushian government where is it well we know full well huntre a i i keep come back to ecause it is perfectly obvious have you ever texted your trild you'r edul trild f yelet us say theyou are forty fifty years old have you are texted your adult child that youre paying gramma's bills when you are not actually paying gramma's bills hunter bidon literally texted his daughter saying that he has been paying for everything in the family and for pop for years do you think tos jus made up even it even if hunter bidn was high on crack at the time tofjust come up withthat adnin nowhere really a here is choktod proclaiming what is it is just on fair they cn go af from no matter what but here is the thing tha the media will defend jo bide no matter what yah i mean that is going to be havisgose do you think it would be toot to tresident ram ta combout say ay i had no business feelings by by sun issues of u sunse you think he nies to say that wore directly this hit is a lot of people that believe something something elseou's be clar about that point chuck there is been a five year investigation five years i a trump apointed you as atturniy this in vestigation started during the trump administration and they have come forward with not one trud of evidence a tying president bying any of this i am en couraged that in sharp contrast to president trump you have just detailed his mountain of legal problems where president trump is fighting and pushing back and obstructing honter bidons come forward taken responsibility paid his late taxes as you just discuss thit chuck frozenburg i think the hiccup and the dolor district corghouse will get ironed out pretty quickly a i do not think president by needs to say anything more than he has how ry o no on a cevns i arther the're gon to make fact his ationthere an ac hes in all o thays to have the evidente or na heret were they have the evidence to not i love the demacrateting a where they have the evens not for years of accusations that the twenty sixteen election was stolen bi pu not behalf of trump with zero evidence four years bit they still maintain it by the way fairly a mazing suffocan meanwhile donald trump is course using this as the impetist for his campaigns this campaign he got a say donal trump is one of the luckiest asso bes ever to live in politics because when the dice are down they tend to break his way almost always and this is particularly true when it comes to the way this raci shaping obs right now it is shaping up o the republican side as reugh frend him on jobidon's corruption and that has goin to break very much in donal from savor becaus gan donal trump as he himself has proclaimed with the inerrant instinct that he has nd and that this is the magical benefit of donal trum truthfully donal trump is not a intellectual donal trump is not a person who thinks through policy positions downd frum is in a person with polisy positions donald trump is a series of impulses but his instinct are in errant when it comes to targeting people when it comes to destroying political opposition the jude is a genious he really is an he is really good at this or i should rather tak he has a genious for it hecause does not come from i think i cu points as much as it comes from just he as at got level understanding word with the knifein he is been greated this sinc s the twenty fifteen campagn which is why the nicknames that' tony people dismissed as he o domr or a waste of time including me they resinate obviously in he he he does have a capacity to speak to the seventh great side of people that is that is really in errands and it is also true when it comes to con hi capturing he political id when hent when it comes to a person whos sums up the political id and is able to capture it in a way that no other politice ur my lifetime can trump is that gy trump understands the lament him in the republican party with with regard to jobidon is all about the corruptions nown about his policy's not about wha abad politician he is it is about his personal corruption and over the weaken trump really went hard at jobidon on this and in fact trump he loves campagng is an outciderates is favorite thing to do then donal trump l as the president of the united states he is an extraordinary level of loyalty inside the epublican pary and he still campagning as an outsider because at elachim to be as free willing as he wants to be the minute your burden with the feeling of being an establishment figure do not the moment you actually hve responsibility for your own party well then people can hold you accountible for failures ut thi'swhat stared to happen in twenty twenty too after trumping o res to slate of candidate to all last in the senate therris just for brief moment in time republicans r wait does not he bear some responsibility for those losses maybe we should not ndominate him and then he went right back to being the free weelings for a free ratical actor an everyone ali is not responsible for any of that he is only responsible for what he himself does not for anybody else he is is again when it comes the hisage he does have genius with us don'nl trump over the weaken he aimed at trobidon but he simultaneously aims at all of his republican opponents again free fire iso from donal trump always always always no discretion in the fired but to fire in every direction he says that not only should should jobidon be impeached which youn the evidence may very well indicate that he should be im peach i said this last week but he also said that if people do not vote to impeach jobidon regardless he is ong to then primary them which is a way of declaring his tpolitical virtue tue republican members te bays who really really do not jobidon again i made thing this bad poltics during a purple district ing you vote for jobidons ind peach me you may lose your seap e don trumpling care about that again he bears no responsibility for the republican party he is not hat dont from does not care whether the republican party winds or lose because but whether he wins or losis the is been prufectly true since he was runig in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen when he refuse to indorcse the idea that if he losts the primaries he would even vote for the other g on see here is donal trump in eary pensylvang over the weaken they play a different game the is people at corrupt te ell and thet play at different game that play i much troufry game of hard all and the republicans have the play tese to gi an these three people actually four people that we have they have to play tough and they have to be an honestly and not willin an o we gat alatic good tough free publicans around that people ake an a run a gainst im at people ake gan a win an they an h get min in dorse wen tevery single time at they gan a win cause we wen almost everin rays on we in men put aside the fact that that is a hundreresent not true in the major top of the tick et sente rases where his record was a bismal but that does not matter becas again this is non al trump being able to run against any one and every one at the same time which is the benefit of being donal trump every other cand that has to worry about attacking trump trump does not orry about tacking anybody h' glaffer whoever he wants ton from laffor primary opponents inside the r publican party he will go after congretional primary opponents am m he an an again because he channels that political id for the republican party we all feel in the republica brto lot people feel the will do that to the democrats too which is true he will mean long is there on his wrongside if they start to wheedle him if they tart the misochum a little bit than that may shift and that may move can then donal trump continue to aim at yobin overthe weekain he said he is trime mout you crane and now he is makin the suggestion he is traing tocm again s the guy i've said the word junius here a few times but it is true there is a grung sensiment inside the republican party that te war in nou rane is somehow in element of corruption now you can believe several things at once one the craning goverment is corrupt it is it has been for decades too the war in ou crane against russha is in americas interest in the sense that it degrades the russian military prevents them from invading forther countries maintains the reliability of nato against foreign aggression sends a message to china that if they invade ti won there will be actual consequences for all of that and prevents ladmrepoodent from consolidating resources on behalf nanti american lizes right all those are real american interest but you can also hold that with the position that oby'sly all money that we spend over there weaf to know where that money is going if to assume that some that money is going to bad places in all of the rest but trum understands that there is a rising sentiment against the funding of the war in ou crane and now he is going to blame that on jobidons corruption in you crane ses linking twoissues now for the republican base a heavy trunk of the r abooc an bates is you one as you crane which again for a probly plurality of republicans at this point or at least verging on a plurality the u crane war's on populars he is merging that position with the antijobidn position to create a sort of iyon nexis that is very useful to him politically because he is the only one aure seculating it here he was talking about how that the suggestion is that were in war in you crane specifically because jobidn wantto pick up cash but the wepin sto a to u cran to theatei teat iares hand over every scrap of evit ey hav on the bine crine families corrup business fillings we have to know and the epublic deserves to know inidation cowe should imedly o to blo jo bins recely call up a reserve for is wisiting tat troop over to europe ti gat it is not tre by thewy that we are sending troops to europe to fight in ou crane that that is not actually true but again this is smart politics from donald trump now the problem is does donal from actually have any sort of plan to win the actual election to all this place inside the republican primary whereverybody hates jobidon everody knows that jobdn is corrupt and a lot people elect you crane war but in actual election between jobidn an trump that is a risky strategy because the reality is that the cranewar is still a majority proposition in the united states the the realities tho gook n a stack up trump agains jobiden will get to trumps flosin just one second again i've praise is in erant political insthing because they really are quite good but by the same token a lot of the things that he is preparing for when it comes tothe actural general election are not going to materialize willget to that in just one second first not abigvan of the vegges over here as i do not how they taste the just not that vegges are my enemy however i still need the natriction to be got from the vegges which is why i love by balance of nature

order your green tea and citras handso said i o cam meanwhile now again because the campaign agans i jobidon is coming down to not his policy much as sort of personality corruption and all of the rest this really benefits trump ecause this the area wore trum really excells in terring people down for literally years he is spen ragging people down ints the mud with him and the ideas once they are both in the mud then he is competitive and that by the way is what the poles are showing right now what pols ar shwings that he is very competitive with bid not because he is popular but becauses jobidin is unpopular with that said the thing that trump wouth then need to do is run in actual consorted racs with regard to expending resources to get te votes over the wek gen donald trump sugges sted that all of his primary ponis should drop outs people woad stop spending money on his primary pones to give the money to him and then he would spend it on things ballat harvesting any re copliin that does it a on dma crat fron should be immediately primary and det gay and then he came out and he suggested that he is goenty spend all this money that he raises from his primary ponents getting out he is even spend all that on ballat harvesting now there is only one problegis you would be cen a foolish to believem he did not don twenty sixteen e didn dun' twenty twenty he had no ground game in twenty sixteen he really did not me this as well documented his campaign was run basicly from thirty thousand feet and then he relied on hillery clentin's under turn out to actould when the election again my favorite staf from the wenty sixteen election is that in twenty sixteen donnal from one fewer absolute votes in wisconsin than mit romney one in twenty twelve but donal trump one wisconsin amit romneyd lost wisconsin at the twenty sixteen election was just as much ti think more about lack of turn out for hillary as it was about additional turn out for donald trump in twenty twenty he did not have a ballot harvesting operation he actively told people mot tovote early and thn he did that again in twenty twenty one in th sen a run off rase in george a both of them that that he ended up losing the republican sended up losing then handing con troll about the senate and the house two jobidon who proceeded spend six to seven trillion dollars do you think the donnal trump is can spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on a ballat harvesting operation an operation i should get out thevote i have doubts the reason ive doubts is because we now have a story that donal trump has spend from his campaign superpacks or his campagns superpacks of spent on his behalf tens of millings of dollars on legal fees now that is not what you are iving money to he you are not act donal trump is a billionaire now i think that a lot of legal probs thathe trump is facing some thember of his own making the classfied documents nonsense down in florida that is of his own making he could just hand of those documents back to the national arci've none of the severalold of happen but many of these legal troubles are not ofhis own making that' be the man hat in d a going after him for stormy daniels nonsense it is of his own making in the sense that he shuldn'ta stup stormy daniels tan aidher to be quiet but his not of his making in the sense that it is a legally specious case but even assuming that theire tuns of bills thatare being in curred by trump on a personal level thet are' there frivolous and tht should not have to be in curred when you give money to trumps campaign do you think youf paying his legal bills or do you thnk youre paing for the ballat harvesting because his legal bills that did not help you win the election also he is a billionaire presum bly he can pay his own legal bills and then he can use the money that you are giving him the small downer he is tun to smalledowners and he can use that to defeat jobide but that is not actualy where the money is going accoring in theu r times the political action committee former presiden trump is using to pay his legal bills fa's such staggerin closs this year e questoday re fun on he sixty million dollar contribution at made to another roupe suppording the republican front runner according to two people familiarwit the matter the desision signals of pense a potential money crisis for trump who as far refuse to pay his own voluminous bills directly he is also avoided creating legal defence fun for him mself and people have become entangled in the various investigations related to ims he could have created a legal defense fun and youcould hav given money to legal defense fun to spend on his legalbils but no you knows your not can give money to his legal defense fun he knows thatyou are ot you want get money to his campagn he will beat biden that is the reason why you care about donald trump presumably as you do not want jo bi to be president any more not thyou care about how donal trump handals paying his big ticket lawyers the reefund was sought as the political action commttee save america spent more than forty million dollars in legal fees in cured by trump and witness is in various legal case related to him this year alone according to another person familiar with th matter numbers will be part of the save america federal election commission filing expected o made public to day that forty million dollars was in addition to sixteen million dollars that save america spent in the previous two years on legalfies since then of course trump has been invited twice in is expanded the size of his legaltine his two co dofendane in the case related to his retention of classified material work for him total legal spending fifty six million dollars when you do not nat money to trumps you think that is going toward ballet harvesting i i have doubts i am not certain that that is the case and that is a problem because again you can trump in the primaries tdhey is suggest that a lod people do trump in the primaries the current state of the race if you look at the latest pulling it that is out today suggests that donald trump this date neyor time sienna college poll of likely r publican primary electorat fifty four percent for trump seventeen per cent to santis seventeen per cent others thirteen per cent no answer the santsis the closest percen and he is not within thirty points of hem iso the the primary base seems they are cruising tord trump and not just that trumps base makes up more than ae third of the likely republican elector se you have thirty seven per cent saying that they are the maga basen will vote for trump to matter what and then you say therr're thirty seven per cent or persuadable in twenty five percent whare not open trump the magabaseis thirty seven according to the full the not open tor trumps are twenty five that means that theu remaining thirty seven per cent would half to split in favor of one other candidate not in favor of ten other candidates in favor of one other candidate by essentially a margin of two to one in order to defeet trump in the primaries zero per cent zeru per cent of the maggot category say thate trump has comitted any series federal crime only two per cents that he even did something long in is handling classifid documents nothing is changing right there and again when you look at te remaining half morn than ere man o the the two thirds who say that they are persuadable are not open toe'r trump well yew even even among those members of the re publican electrit they dit is agree on the issues they are fractured it' can be very difficult for anybody to consolidate this according to nake come looking at the data over at the near times the santis is supportright nowt is split between those wo are still open trump and those who are not over all the santis hold just thirty two per cent to voters who are not considering trump right's that means that you' have to som that all twenty five per cen who say the're not open trumpet's shiftin to the santus category right now they are split with cris crissy tims got mikepence nickihalion fovague romas wamy each attracting between five and ten percents of that vote once agan it lol the field is very very split trump as an invantige in te primaries no question the promm is does that translate to an actual general electiondictory is anybody even thinking about his trump even thinking about that at this point what what is the case that trump is making for why he will do better in twenty twenty other than jobidons failures by the way that is exactly the same case the jobidons manke by trump the by the case the bidingis mane byt trump is i can be as terrible as i wanto be i meis corrupts om ontobe i meis as foolish an and out of it is i want o be i mean there is a picture of jobidonit is floating around theinternet of him on the beach in rehublet beach delaware over the week in it is not flattering he is an ai year old man walking around in his swim trunks and no shure with the sunglass in a backwards baseball cab and it it looks just how you wouldimagine he is very very old he is very very doterdly he is not with us any more but he is entire cases i am not trump and meanwhile trumps entire cases i'm not biden i mean that that is a that is a hell of id in amic going into a a presidential election hich by the way is why many people of worry about no labells or are of k or coronel last or someo these third party candidates now in the end we will it on a being a binarry vot almost certainly it will but e's tere ny guarantee hw that goes for either side no guarante at all now again i's that the best way to run a campagn i i have serious doubts o came meanwhile there is a lot of un certainty out there about the economy and hou sends the sort of groaling warmth in the press for the idea that we are going to escape orecession because the inflation dato came in last week and it is coming in no kind of close to normal and wwere now back down toward the two pre cent number that people are looking for from the federal reserve and i seems as though the economy is sort of defyine gravity at dis play because the g d p is still clocking in at two point four or two point six per cents which are good numbers right according toe walster jurnal recent god news on inflation as ignited debate over how much central banks intrest rate increases are responsible the answer matters where in flation adnt intrest rates are headed the federaserve in european central bank in the past week lifted their bench mark interest rates to twenty two your hives and left to open the door to additional increases if higher rates were not responsible for progress on inflation to day that suggest central banks could be able to lower them before painful recession sets in this is really the question is whether the reason in flatin came down is because of the increases in the intrest rates or whether its supply chains basiclly healing themselves if it is because the supplycians are healing themselves theoredically if we starts going to recession then the central banks could the eretically lower those intrest rates again without jacking ut the inflation if it is from the low intrest rtes in te first plats and that is what created the bubble then lowering the inflation rates that lowin th intrest rates right out would create another secondary bubble of inflation but there is a more significant problem on thehorizon and the more significan problem is economic stagnation last week there is a lot of talk about the g d p coming in and the g d p stat came in and every was very very excited about how it came in analists had suggested it was can be a lot lower than in actually showed apparently the gros domestic protic grew at a c o point four per cent anual rate last quarter while analisthave been expecting a reading of one point five per cent at's a lot of people were saying that while soff landing might now be possible here is the problem gt peas abad stab the reason g t p is abad stat is because it is about consumption gt p mensures the amount of consumption end usor consumption in an economy you pay a price at the store to buy product thatcoes into g t p the government spend a crapload money on things that goes into gt p well the the problem with that is it does not actually anser for how business dynamics works it is a kansian model of how the economy works it 's set it assumes that the more consumption there is the better the economy is doing assumes tht if yu bi bunch o hambugers the economy is doing amazig ad if by fewer hambugers it is ecause the economy is doing poorly it also imagines that if the government spends a rapload of money lik unprecedented amout of money that that means the economy's to ingret because all that gets counted in the g t p the better statistic is something called gross output gross output has been astatistic that is been in semi wide use since about twenty fourteen there is an econiston mark scoosin rodabout it in twenty fourteen when the bure of economicanals is started using gross output as an alternative for g t p anhy explains it this way he says in many ways gros output is a supply side statistic a measure of the productionside of the economy gt p measures the use economy that is the value of all final or finish goods and services used by consumers businesses and government the measure of an economy's gross output has been around since the nineteen thirties a pet a gross output essentially measures the amount of business investment rit is the make economy the total sales from the production of raw materials through intermediate producers two final wholesale in reteil trade instead of just lookng at all of the product that is bought by you at the store it looks at the product that is brought all the way along the chain it is of your buying a chair it looks it who paid for the wood and then who paid for the planks of wood and then who paid for the screws and the planks of wood put them together and then who paid for the varnish makesright it includes all of that sut's a broader measure of the output of an economy because includes actual business investment sgoozen says why pay attention to gross output for starters research i published in ninetee ninety shows does better dop of measure ing total economic activity gt p isthe useful mesure of a country standard of living in economic growth but it is folkis on final output omits intermediate production and as results crat's mut's mitch much mischief in our understanding of how the economy works in particular it is leds womis guided keentan notion that consumer and government spending drive the economy rather than saving business investment tacnology nouchripen worship if you look a gt p data gt p data always suggests that consumer spending is the number one elements withi's why you get statistics about consumer covines or consumer confidence is lowel the economy must be about to tank wor people are spending lests money ate the store that means the economy is about to tank and then the next biges measures ofthe gt p would be government expenditures and then business investment third hi butt in reality when you flip that and you look at gross output what you find is that suddenly it is only about forty per cent of the economy business outlays are substantially large r than consumer spending in the economy they make about fifty per cent of economic activity in other words government spending is not a giant giant chunk of gross output its a giant chunk of get p and government spending that goes to direct benefits that then is spent that is a huge part of gety p but t's not as bigg a part of gros output and gross up put matters why because the reality is the way the econingorsons en the biggest argument in economics for at least a hundred fifty years is weather economies are driven by consumers by you buying a product or are they driven by people making the product rit the the kinsian demand ciders basically suggest that because you spend money some one makes a product for you supply ciders say you generate new better innovative products and that makes people want to buy them the argument in favor of supplycide economics which is something i subscribed to because number one i think it is its truer and number two it pushes for a more liberal free market yof the economy is that when people are allowed to keep their own money they produce new and better services what a consumer based economy cannot do is create new product it is the supply cider who creates new product the ontropinur who creates new product is also why you se a gap between how democrats talk about the economy and hiw republicans talk about the economy conservtovs very often when the talk about the economy they talk about the value of the ontropinor which is really ou credit to joseph chumpiter the the veanees economist who really talks a lot about what he called creative destruction the ontropino comes along and yap breaks old product tat makes amazing new product it is always some ontropinorts in elon musq or a henry ford or an thomas id is that some new comes along makes a new productovillble to you that you never would have thought of but now you need it twenty years ago would you just as a consumer have thought up the ot even if you had coul you have made the ephone the answer of courses know you see a product on the shelf and then you on aby who made that product t was not you you are buying it what is more in what is more interesting about that the the creation of the new produtor rhubis it ged p tends to measurer economic strength by whose buying the phone as opposed to measuring economic strength by who in vested in the phone whose putting money into the phone whose creating the phone becaue the idea is that supply in essence re'll create demands for a new and better product at is henry forcet ford suggested if i had listend to the consumer just whe t come up with a better horse a faster horse thet's bunsteatinghim of the car because he was the antropinor caso here is why this important when you look at gros output ray now everiling a get peas awe the economy's going gre guns gros output not much cording to gros output dacom theos economy is resisting recession but is flashing red business spending has drop nine per cent and real turms over te pasture quarters to day the federal government released first quarter gros output the top line an national in come econty geo measures spendig at all stages of production real gros out put ros two point seven per cent compared to two point zero per cent in real get p consumer spendin is still robust rising six per cent during the pasture quortrs but business spending is floundering nominal business to business spending has ben flats in september in real terms it is down nine per cent recession is still in the near future s again ilic looking a gros out put i thingit is a much better measure of where' the economy is because how i spend is business person isnit a matter a lot to my employs is in a matter a lot to the consumers of this company and that that is true for everybody who has lots of employs and lots of consumers when you are being given happy talk aby ho the economy is going great because of g d p number one thing to check check the gross out pat number which has ben basically flat for the last couple to three quarters a can meanwhile why dis that matter matters because whone comes to general election ya jobitons personal corruptions can matter yeaguine's personality is going to matter but you nots can matter even more if we are in recession jobidoneis in serious trouble if we are not in recession tobine probaly sails to reelect very very ifficult to lose a reelect when you are conomy is good it looks the economies can be bat youkno be great some resiable to argue against that this is why a oneo the reat frustrations is that many of the things that make rondosant is in excellent governor also make him a politician does not have the pozazor siszle of downal trump namely he cjust does the thing rit j governor ossans is great whin as governor of florida nothers beenall the talk about woke and al the talk abut fighting education all that matters matters an awful lot but he is also really ood t the read and butter florida is the number one in coming state flor tax revenue according to the dailymal californ in york have lost combine six hundred forty million dollars in tax revenue do dh people moving out o state thi be made at's consort of florda and texas see boots of twenty three billion after an influx o movers then the number one state flor in coming money florida twelve point for billion dollars the net in come migration to the state oflorida that is because it is a well governed state is a good place to live it is a well governed state and that is a boring message but it is also one that tends to win general elections the message that is a lot more controversial is the character message especially whenyou have character flaws of your own an when ou'n the middle of legal battles that will likely culminate in actual trials with you in the doch in may of twenty twenty four which is what is very ly to happen right now rontissansis talks you actually want a politician to talk about the things but is that what people want in a primary that sort of titdout sohure is rondissantes for etemple over the weeken talking about the drags on the economy that is the kind of thing that for me is actually greats this is what i wish our politicions were talking about but they are not herego i think the biggest drag on the economy is the adminis strate of state and the buracrasy and yes an i wont lower tact as all go as far as we can on that but when i talk to small business people i almost never hear about that i hearabout the growth of government and what governments doing to choke off their bility to just a run their business is the way they see fit and the burocratic state the ministry state bat gives an advantage to the big guises is the big guis can handle it they about lawyers tha cout anous an the complyn those os a mall small business says mediumsize business iys getting that off a in in addition to the energy that is going to be a huge huge thing the fed getting that raind an anas very important reducing federal spending very very important yes it is superboring and also letme remind you it is super important is the stort of stuff for if you are on the iddle you'e on that fence in the twenty twenty four election and it is somebody tos sances vor som bidin and binds run the economy to the ground n hav somebody else on the other sidesaind here the things i'll do to fix the economy that might actually matter an awful lot because it turns out number one ssue fror most americans when it comes to presidential elections the state of the economy ik a time for a quick thing i and than a couple of things that i hate things that i over the week end i was a reading a relly fun novel by andrew wear andrew wear is the guy who wrote the martian the book is project hal mary and a it is it is a and wert he is delight just as it as an author it is delike because he is actually having fun with the reader nd he is ovays the

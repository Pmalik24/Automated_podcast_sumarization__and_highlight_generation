thy'd been in forty years e democrats controlling the state house the senate governor's office most of the congressional seats yer and why wo big reason was as th republicans had all these candidates who pushing the idea at the presidential election had been stolen a micinganvoters are not into that they do not one aelect candidates who wre obsessed the election being stolen apparently this meeting on february the party needto to elector weaders whos can rebuild adtake the party for word everything about it one logical path that could a taken is they culd pick somebody who renounce the whole election fraud thing riht wel the conspiracy teories bout voting machines just all that stuff that mischican voters are rejecting wbut there are no canidates that at all nobody you said let us drop all this election frad stuff cas a canndidite that would not haf a ghost of a chance of the republicans in this room were the one to actually pick the new party weater in the last tew years

of the michigan re publican party the outsideerist the grasped brutsist not for nothing the christianist and in picking coramo michigan republicans were saying basically what we want is a party is somebody to lead who a bolise he election be stolen and b has no connection to any establishmen political machinery of the past which is all corrupt that kind of purity test is something at you see a lot among republicans right now in the house of representatives in washingtan many political fights ord be exipeen between republicans who do not want to compromise at all and everybody else you see this anothe republican state parties and swingstanes arizona carado georgia but no state party is taking the flying leap off the cliff that the michigan republicans have more than any other state party they have the least politically connected fur this from the establishment most ideological party weader and her followers running things among other things have to say it is enormously idealistic out and by true believers who feel deeply that the only way out of the mess that wran as a country is a total break with what has come before and me coramo on they work camp i sio every things onisans the retears i gepray forher now now a sarts to ana programm when the political party takes ta leap this one throws itself out in an actife faith this one in a major swing state what does that gambol look what happens next today we ging to look at how this year un folded for these true believers producer we chase when man many times to michigan throughout this year nd as the special up close an personal look at how all this played out from w b easy chicago is this american life o mor coss stay with us com a o oon a ta n oo a an o that on the glongly island i can u now befor e jump any deeper in this maybe should take a sec and explain just what a state party actually does espaciacly an organizations set up to handle all kinds of boring practical work that you need to do if you want a win elections they were f canidates they organneze meetings theye are these massive get ut t e vote operations for state elections of national candidates to and above all else there is money to pay for campaigns by ads to do everything else and the person o raises that money usually is the party chair itso to have somemady with no political connections in that job christiana cramo that is very unusual zoy tells the tory from here now christina coramo as elected in february tin the party did not pull together behind their new chair here is tha tine of in fighting stell over the first few months in the first major test of her leadership ferability to get things done keem this fall the maccanal island conference it is a big symbolic fable te van an michigan politics politicians lobias presidential candidates all make their way up to northern michigan and get on a farry to this island for no cars are allowed worst drawn carriages instead the whole place does smell for shit which makes it a perfect setting for a group of politicos they hobnob the gossip they make teal as they raise money and the test for christinawise with all the old school republicans she and her followers have ejected from the party could she rais enough money to even hold the conference would it even happen raising money is probably the most m portant thing the state party char does and christina has no fun raising background over the last ten years the list of reported job she is done are the scraping by kinds sales clerk tribia host substitute teacher ad junk community college instructor she made a christian potcast a plan to fun the party was to get donations from small republican businesses who have supposedly been sitting on the sidelines because they did not think the party was conservative enough but that never seeme to get off the ground and for months before makanav there were rumors lake how would shou ever come up with the cash for this big showboty affair to get a read on those rumors i checked in now and then with john smith as the perfect person to go to because he totally epitamizes what the michigan gio piaz wel come im he is an unabashed conspiracy thearist he started in state politics surround twenty twenty he chartered two buses to get to january sixth bootdid not go inside the capital he says smingling he another stoppd the stealers took over their local county parties johns on the state committee now e r ahe was i doubt christina raise enough money to pull off macanal i ti your min e peopll abo a i o o thet do not have a way to o about a him i think you do not at tat tackama yeu wit that ga tat id that hae a mion fri t think that what what yoe're doing here ta i a ut it in ma your ye that wa that a i ta yer hon literally in the fire festival documentary people show up in the bahamas and instead of blinkuenty two and the instograndmodels they were promise there is no music no food no water and saggy fematents wl we all find ta makana as a quite that desperate when i got up to the grand hotel here was defnly a republican conference eakin place the trumpats red white and blue sparkly pains as promise an grand piano playing a song about how anything is possible if only u belieieve but apparently this her was really different from past years at night i was wandering with a cublatendians including one of the younger vice chairs the sa me and soon in a low founding fathers i poly tail we are headed upstairs in an elevator looking for the macanav parties which iad heard for legendary eniint o ones no ies yer r a ma yes tis is veriously n asy one o them all and is lake once torl an this sosmedintis in what weats how is tat ones as last time we walk on the portions eight hundred people anothers a otin ba in avry even an last time they were around two thousand attendins this year the best guess i saw was eight hundred at the very most last time ted cruws was a keynote speaker the bigany national republican this time cu went on proponent jim cuvezle who made the sleeper summer hit movy about child sex trafficin sound of freedom he allso played jesus passion of the crist out on the colossal porch at one point i talked to another state comittee member whos upset about how things seemed to be going well it is not ins tact wen what we were hoping or tichipatin mark forton is one of those who wanted a complete break with how he used to be and how i used to be was that the head of the party was a super rich michigan guy weal estate mogalran wiser in the last few years the party yearly budget has been something twenty million dollars the trunk of which came directly from wiser and mostly one other rich family and michigan the devases we knew thit if the gresh which to overs te party if the big shooters would go that all but we knew the the vost family would go an a an a mister wiser would go theyare their all globlist ou know theyre ll part of the same great big mass of machigan sim and o bringing in the chinese of battery factories i may we know their globilist and then mark spins owt the first of the many times i will hear the theory that cristina is the globilist plants that the reason things are going badly is that the establishment planded this way yufrom the beginning of her rise to power they knew the grass rot said headenough and there going to take over this party they knew it then now the question is or these globlos types a they gin to sep by o take it ore they gin e ser planming for when the gress wouldh take over what we do next thereafter michigan i's no doubt whit she is the most antie globilist of them all shes the anti glublistist i know a'm not accusing her am saying but who is pulling the strings who i just onl kno what to think them i'm tell me of things yo askd me with on my mind you askd me then concerned about and none of them are facts but my gos you look at all the apfoing on in o cannot come up with the peceent answer and i just do not know y tgus i'm trying to find out anan towthat is not the only conspiracy theory i here about christina in all way i run into some one whose conspiracy theory is on parallel track but going the other way radin jackobisi cand of a frantic little du the is a major christina supporter a chair and one of her committees radan says socristina whois the globilist plant instead thereis secret operatives within the party who are finaca cer out they are doing it by starting all these rumors henist friend can buy er another cronwell loyalist wo told me that af few to day they came up with im a weat e onis as sthe mos ese eens i saw that on twe bwhy mis te that ruben they lie because theding one people to show up and pact the house that is weather just as i rii it the me we can figtness for a while in all they dos li li l li li li lie and the'l make up the most absurd rumors because they know if they do that it will make it will la try to discredit this event tredit discredit the administration and try to discredit basically all of the unitiope why would they wante to it people want power is it is a is an old saying i i do not know where it comes from but some people would rather rule over ashes than allow somebody to bead them o yet and some thin crsin that is absolutely taol for they go ha the ins from game i throwns n the actual business at macanam the meeting of party leaders with a showdown between christina supporters in christina sceptics about party finances this was a closed meeting but i got a tape cristinas tin claimd they would raise six hundredand fifty thousand dollars the sceptics demanded they open of the books improve it for the end of the meeting christina on to the potinghim to defend her a y w w y mal no ywy wy wy w wyol o w y wy people e o wy a wy ars a at the end of the day christinis tin does not agree to quote an quot open the books show them the party finances and every one tridges down to the boats frustrated with each other dodging the piles of fresh horseship i at too another puriitesk just a few days after the conference ended there was something else there really has nothing to do with money they came up about christina's giope about whos welcome inside this party it was an emal anonymously penned by a guy who called himself paul revere and the just was an a slamic takover of america as happening hamisidel islamic terrorus are becoming intrenched and infecting our whole country it concluded to paraphrase sir winston churchill is lam in a man is as dangerous as rabies in a dog this emal was sent out to district chairs and vice chairs of the state party three of the vice chairs are moslem and two of them replied all because they felt attacked by the anotomous emal one of them was hi sign nemi the guy was in the elevator with that macana here is which he wrote good evening christina this emal was sent out to the republican leadership every elected member and all the district chairs conveniently you were not at it i decided to forward it over i noticed that others have forwarded it to you i was eagerly awaiting a response from you hassan wants her to condemn at publicly he continues it took the liberty of reaching out to my contacts at fox a b c and a couple of the detrait news outlets to day with the hopes that you would join the muslin vice chairs to respond to this we need to insure our constituents understand that the party will not stand for thus and that our party stands for the constitucion which defends the freedom of religion you either join us in air and we all playnice and show what our party stands for ere we go on there and talk about how you have sid lined us and that you have yet to condemn any of this retoric hi san says he never heard back from

aiy these lays a hory in te lat their voices and then just to be clear some one stood up during convention to make o motion that someone could declare their candidto great den to stop these muslins from becoming leaders of the party still it did not pass and these guies ented up his pace chairs they were excited lake he would t my budget line what slike the credentials to start emalin people as official state party representatives whuds drive around set ut meetings to whatever it is this new experimen o group of people wants to do to reach out to people cut there were no leadership tean meetings the say no one called them to tell them heres what we want you to do and how to do it and that they were the ones hasan and ali who set up the first leadership meeting for bace chairs all across the steet christina did not show up to it then there was the whole macanot situation the guides wanted to help planming and the by las say that the adman bice chair that is ale he supposed to play a big role in planning it but they say no one would communicate with them about it finally they entered abat a meeting in leancing with christina and some of her team where they came away with the message we do not want people you leading things with this party in hisan an ali's telling this is how the meeting went hasan was lake why ren't you advertising what a diverse leadership we are youre black youave three arab muslin bice chairs heu have an indian american district chair he should be talking about that ye all was back to it sa judeo christian movemen and somehow my face an does

keepe our republican party together in not thisus makes te lon ias truthat tse truth men wats te saan the slatemen no gainst the truth is just this calse much more problems when it comes out the wording that was used it please the render tan hey we were just told that you as are not a part of the plain wo shuldn't say that basically they felt at the meeting in land saying that they were being subjected to a different purity test not one about who was grass roots enough but about whether anybody but christians had a place in christina cromos party e talked to cristina about this and she catagorically denied this person of events she says of course there is a place for muslims in her leadership and she says she did try to include his sin and ilee but they were on responsive i sin shered screen shots with me that showed him reaching out to her about maccana specifically and getting brushed off in any case by the time they got to maccana which they had played no part in putting together his san and aly were feeling salty we got there in we dame an they hey may make us name tags and that is a statement i your knowis to solme that as ofense and they got mad when we aske wers

iwas force to by my least o thes an by aah hem i promised you ar in the same bons i but on the tol prn we hena the word jo that is an interesting question to me these leadershiprolls are vilunteer not peed did the party only work before because there were rich people who could afford to do them how long can the not rich people afford to be in political leadership per of all the people to leave now i'm surprised its john he was one of the first people in michigan to make a show of pushing out the establishmen part of this wave of new leaders who ousted their county chairs to create this grassrout state party run by the new beast disconnected from the orn guard he walked christina could run is for hissan and ale then found the party in especially welcoming place either before or after cristinas take over but they'r gin to keep trying seeing how hard their having to fight to be included it makes me think about how relatively unimportant winning seems to be and postjanuary six purity politics if the party wanted to win you could imagine a world were they be reaching out to guise this instead of side lining them but instead it seems that this new version of the party is winnowing it down to a relatively small and tainted by compromise o principled people not a winning strategy for a political party and michigan in particular o iso he chase coming hot how to topof a republican leater t i somebody said a half century ago follow the money it is about to get reo that is admitte chicago bo bogradio went our programm continues to smark can li from myr a glass as they sher ends noticing the kind of fights happening among republicans in u s house of representatives and ron the country we have this political story though we thought capture something about the state of republican politics this yer from michigan bokind the episode it would not be make believe if you would believe in me he chaste picks up morcha left off the last week of september the plot to oust christina heated up when some one i the michigan gio p sent out a barage of screen shots to a few reporters they were of bank statements of the michigan gio pee it was a little confusing this collection of random screen shots but it did seem the party was almost completely out of money john smith got the texts hen' see any evidence of this thing christinas people said at maccanon about the money they trased he was depressed and yor bi yo tolder e gt te cun ot abos which is a lie ther ly wn the lying t lying tou every one i yet t youk think they are lyin becaus they are corrupt or do you

ther were ging to lose control of twhenty twenty four at thot brings us to act three the insurrectionists insurrect again the guid who leag the bank accounts green shots warring carpenter was a major christina supporter at first wrrn't helped to get christina elected he raised money for her secretary of state campaign he would votes for her cheris an went to talk to him he rens a landscaping business and the suburbs of detrait he wacked me to the back of his offist this is uncomforable is it e ya use oit o ou you fore well its radio that is why warren comes off antagonistic rate from the beginning and a little man what he is just done leaking documents to the press about christina it is a big deal though why ye onat is te get in' read the news or something he says that morning the morning we spoke september twenty ninth the troit news reporter crag marger an eminently fair and lightning fast journalist published a right up of all the documents warren had sent him the article begins the michigan republican party had about thirty five thousand dollars in its bank account an august according to internal records that flash new warning signs about the dire state of the geopes finances this as followed shortly by a quote from a former state geo p official these numbers demonstrate that the party is not just broke but broken warrin is also extensively quoted in the article which is a big betrayal of christina talking to a journalist who in her view is just in league with the establishment trying to take her out warren says he dabbled in republican politics before this movement took off worked down a state wide campaign over ten years ago but not much since then untill trump he loves trump called him big daddy and had that schoolboard come to jesus many republicans did round the cove protocols masking in schools kind of thing he went to january sixth after he thought he saw the election get stolen says he d goinside the capital but he had such an intense experience there that not long after he had a mental breakdown as he puts it that is when he got involved in his local party he is wone of the new bees who got elected to distric chair part of the weave that took over the party this year he d in part of christinis in her circle but now whe would resigned from his position is district chair and was talking smack in the press what happened well a few weeks before the macc in our conference warren get on the foned with christina's chief of staff jewel stuto baker and the rest of rotine the were telling him they needed help to pull off the conference he looked at their financial situation and he responded with what a now under stand to be his typical intensity how sh my ye how sh my n how sh my rou who is been paid i what is the problem what you need why m y the fuckan call with you but jol stutobaker did not know what the numbers ik tiy did not know any of the numbers for anything they were literally flying by the fuckanseet to their pants shooting from the head it was min is the most ludicrous thing iveever heard of my entire life tite there was no budgetary scamatic thy ca share with me and during that initial friday call the only thing they had to share whas they almost had the programm ready to go to the printe a programm with speakers on it they did not have the cach to pay for it seemed warren called campain finance experts who looked at what he had and told him to get as far away as possible from this organization i've looked at warren's documents and what i saw looked a broke party spending money way faster than it was taking anything in i also went over the parties af you see filings though they have not filed since july and all that i looked at i did see some very unusual accounting but nothing illegal warren alleges soch only two ways at this capat this wont you things this scaos would be in my mind i it is either e tros negligents in copitance right i would describe i would escribe inten and say that it is malicious therefore if it is malicious then the have to go to the next conclusion which is then h destruction of the party now can you escribe intent for destruction of the party warren goes on to float his own version of this abbatage theory i heard from other people that christina herself is controlled by some kind of national operation waunched at the michigan republican party and order to destroy it he r an operativ or is affed but its either from the democratic side or its from or is from ears from e an agency he is pretty sureit is anot and thats not just in michigan thow would explain why gopes in georgia arizona an itoho or struggling some one sabbatacing them but even if it is not in tot i some one who helped put christina in office in the first place warren now feels responsible for where she is brought the party and warren's a doer he is also on meka mends ir i find that out myself when he calls me apologizes for yelling at me at one point maybe that comes from his years i h warren has a plan to make things riht i was to christina coranmo he is a whole eighteen point plan to do it that detroit new's article wash the first step now e's wipping votes against her jus liky wip votes for her at the beginning of the year tryig to make surey as the numbers i you you file for the meeting only get the signatures were in to have all the signatures needed to overthrow that a deshows him sover i want psychologically them to be beat before they can go into this thesover o car wady i asi ye sarve ro quick a a wy once on son call a the next time i her warren's voice it is from his zune meeting some one sent me of steete committee members from around michigan warren called the meting he is a spread sheet of the hundred or people in the state committee color coted who is with thim who is against him he is literally counting votes trying to get to that majority to outs christina o get les oo isro quick a everybody in read is in ready o te

he expectedt to execute his eighteen point ilian because as he says he is a vote counter and he has not been getting enough people on the board and last week he invited to a meeting of the mc com county go p to present his documents and make his case he put up a rapid fire slide show for the delegates to convince them that christina was afraud and honestly he sounded slightly unhinged here' some face spogvidio of that event yes ois o es n wa es o o r o o a her ye h fr e a o e e o a but he is raised enough heat that cromwas people decided they want a respond publicly to his claims hence shurprise to dinner and counter presentation for warrant's part he is here to response to the response to his claims and try to keep his cooll my whole my whole moter coming to might was on mas ruing

ball room upstairs it is may be seventy five people cristina's chief of staff jls tuto baker is presenting rebuttle to warran's crazed face buvidio he opens with a bible verse but then get surprisingly detailed show snap shoks of bank statements after complaining that the previous administration left them with little money and some dead which is true you there is this admission eres reow on tesiow in very e o why these things yo there jus reow n we now we do ne now but you got y a ittle work to go n there is nower r to do that if we ye giving wero media ineviews et e ye why tregenization ems is jus not i hapen we need hell an jdre the right way ye declare yes e when chris tina finally speaks she talks about financcis about mackanal and shes frank she admids they would have to make a lot more money the conference there is still in debt for a hundred and ten thousand dollars speakers fy for jim cobeazl for example your minds every one that the reason they elected her is they wanted to run the party differently not raise twenty million dollars and run right through it te previous chairs where di all this twentya dos go whal was is bindol no abut it the sult is to do nothing that is what it was bito a e where did a te letgest people rag about how much lay they raise te degl the off ther frence that e will bego on of for detes ly ges we destructed their system ah ye all he spoke for twenty minutes no pauses for hesitations mostly informing the crowd of mostly supporters that she was the victim of a deep stape conspiracy to take her out a ges this all these ay te is very real it is very real because there ball that these people os to the dot es ere off lik corado cansis yo oer a us the marof or chair then all over these peopla tes tes people fail in the ra we the ras of al theare rar cer at alo on people w tar may now what the ewa ratn te ca win doli tis laf lagh out of the whor we can everdo i she called out the people that she sees is covert deepstee operatives within the current party then she describes them they sound alilike warrin an thik a lody of these people they wer can to be tpan ris ut they can get welt up they we tend to be one abos the we will trusted moving on nexs to omy in his sign not my name may i had too life here foulty you be a be a bige ifbol but a she insis for administration has't ever lie or committed any crine the fighting itself she says is a tactic to keep her from succeeding the fighting however immediately continues back downstairs in warren's room a guide from christina's team swaggers in to confront warrin his names can byer he said he would received a text from warrin seeing him coming after you horen says it just said i'm coming and there is this big wild westy fast off between them thats ery ca your ask questions a why don reat you at all get oter was agon at you room for dressbssin just as you re about that me remove at dre you ros e if you wan for e dus wi i nevr ra you an o e y at mi now a little crowd gathers watching them gorata across the isrid hour mo ca o is mo a ii e ony for drun rivingas years ago ee a asan naggetiv in the account there is the fifty thousand o oca an this is the problem with the crue warrens trying to pull off it is the problem that was baked into coromofs version of the party from the start this croup of people all agree on some besucitions collection frad less emigration no gun control aportion is murder do not tell me what to wear mast do not tell my children what to read and the rent is to dami but whit is brought them altogether running this party is theire lack of trust in any kind of political leadership they are very suspicious conspiracy minded group and that is how they look at everything including each other course they cannot agree on for the real enemy is of the cause they all actually believe in i yor fir r a lir woright before this story went to air this week christina coromo finally agreed to an interview i reached her while she was taking a morning walk i asked her about her year in power it told her it seemd for all her good intentions the party is ended up in disarray broke and ineffective without the money it needs to win elections next year i will say i reject your premise that mi tanga should be defied by flood te that is the problef your premiss off ci your premiseis that i should be defied by mody is the only people that benefit from the premissour potatin is the political class the only people hat benefit are dh you leadit at i will i elected to reject that premit this is what it is to talk to her about this she would not say which she do to get the party out of this mess sho wouldn even acknowledge that they are in amess but not bankrup that is not true drall the think abotited we ar apparate at a povet of cashlow or yet it haw i hit the finht ant eballtet o would not at the level i would but we are at our way will that is why i guess i'm asking just for any example is they are a fund razer in which you tapped into businesses that had been sitting on the side lines you talked about n your clarrying for something that is all any any specific you can gev me yet wet a well i for what yes but i do not know what e if if youre looking for wit my question is why you dogmatic won the notion u people who want ap plishteeld be te naritive that is my question the'v astwerd it motable time ut no question to use a why are you thelograthiv o mat nation i'm not going to go through tha notan bot o every partan will give at a dollar o ten thou te thu o te twenty thou totrimetistration iv an ther were opeready ou a pop of cash lub as e last month they'r bringing in more than they'r spending not because of any fund rasing they got ta pay out from a national committee but there still deep in dain and they could not get any specifics from christina and how the party would bring in the millions they have always used to run elections for twenty twenty four she pointed out again and again that was the wrong question they have cut costs they do of a plan to run a round game and wonce that happens they can judge how that goes over the last few months ive watched er circle of supporters get smaller district chairs have resigned members of the budgec committe resigned upset about the finances and that the leadership would not listen to them for all intend one purposes the partyse splittin to what is it feel to have all these people we lies were on the same team to begin with calling for your ouster or coming after you meking all these claimslike what is tit feel to was they experiencelike for you tat's be trail o it but we you realiyes again the fact that our country's corrup is way it is wit comultet people ofo te politics are dishonest it all pe pali troted to me my character e'll be i dift you gor was talking in john smith was there when th sall began it said seems the year of christina cramo it is been a year of failure party stopped doing most the basic normal stuff any political party has to do nor limping as they go into this major presidential election here and john was no do not write your story it was a wast it was not a wast things are going to continue to be different now we did something we change the party we put a non billionar in charge here is just a first sten may be a missstep but we are not ging a just disappear he chase a p la a a

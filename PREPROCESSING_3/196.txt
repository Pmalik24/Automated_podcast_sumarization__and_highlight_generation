i nis many people who have films that they have watched over and over and i have never really gotin that i was fee tere is many films that i have not seen why would i watch one again but we get to these conversations and there always comes a moment where i'm asked whell what is the film that you have seen the most and then i have to admit it is the besiden adventure which i know is not a good film it is this seventy's movy about an ocean liner that gets it by i sonami flips upside down and the passengers tried to make their way to safety it is part of an entire jonrof films disaster films that v never gottin any respect nobody thinks of these films as ar it but i loved it at the time when i sw it it felt big and i felt important ind serious an i remember it was very ofm emotional and the reason that i saw it many times that this is the film that i saw more than any other was not cause i loved the film itscause o where i saw it is on vacation we did not take many vacations when i was a kid but on one of them we stated at this hotel an flarida were the rooms had this thing where they offered a couple movies all day long anythingis is long ago and the nineteen seventies my sisters and i we had never seen anything that even cable t v was rear back that but beside an inventure wath the film that they offered and my sister cren and i we eat it up that was the iffe we watch over and over again yo as o this was a very importantving thats karen and ers un zac my nephew who we tried to explain this terecent ly we henteed up watching it on t v at night if our parents one ut to dinner or if ere was a rainy day yet we loved it the way that i remember it is that is that the hotel just had this movy on a loop and it would just as soon as it would finish it would start again and the way i remember it is that every time we would come into te hotel room you could turn on the t v and you would be somethe in the besidn convecture et sounds vaguely familiar to me i do not totally remember that but that might be right y and i remember it having a lot of feeling do youemember it having lot of feeling what does it mean having a lot of feeling rlit every metin yellis a lot of emotions ye wit scarry and you really invested in their journey to escape alive i do not think i'm getving anything way by saying that sort ar here the radier shw these last three weeks have ben talking about the random films that people have strong attachments to thinking that might be a good episode the shell and i started to think by the besidean adventure an i wondered what it would be to see it again would it have any feeling whut any of it feel the way it did to me as a kid woutd be away to caren my sister and i we watched it and i invited zac to since he is the age that we were when we watched it back in seventies he is ot thirteen i was fourteen at the time caran was eleven and i when is there i did not expec exact to it he does not i lot of films and right away very foreseen let us know the kind of film we were in for im a little boy visits the bridge of the essess bosidon this ocean liner in the midle of a big storm and the w boy is greeted by the captain who is played by maser nelson who at this point had not made the creer transition to parody characters this captar sho asi lo o i wa go on on li en i wh s ons line what mins does lines si asy i did not remember how winceed the acting gotin some places when arnis porgnin shows at it is clare that the nineteen fifty six osco one of her best actor is not i one of his best rolls oc he angry borgnan does seem to shout nearly every one of his lines in the film when they have gont a done me and i did not expect seeng the om again was how much of the dialogue i remember from decades to go and ivas all susprised realize an i do not know what this ays about me the lines that i remember the most i the little comic zingers i when a creemember is aske to he is marriad i know his corny response bfor he says it no marriage for me missus rose i got a mistress la the see es thenhny i did remember and emember liking from the film was it this is an old fashion enough movy the producers tried to insert some big ideas into the adventure rall means es big ideas are provided by geane hackman who plas a rebellious young priest in turtle mak his big theological idea is a very conveniently helpful one for e wle were about to be capsized in mover the ocean god does not want you to wait fror miracles yet to take matters into your own hands do not prat to god its al your brob is from a sermonhy delivers early in the film at the des the quite for yourself got wat ra sol wat witters nat quitters di you cannot wa at le try awar he comes back to this over and over through the film rowing the passengers to fight arm i loved that is tean ature that there was this ideal is to guy with this principale that he trying to live by and this idea about god that the film is tasting and i have to say seeing it to day i still loved it that the put that end there ey mi he soon enough read at the struk of midnight on new years eve the senomi hits the boat flits the plotma tt n the reckage of the upside down i is

the fact that she justil lets fomme sout of shape after missus rosan the manche gramma an the film dies her husband discovers her dead body e likegies ging to be son i remember this moment hen i remember the tereally well this was very affected ive been really in vess youis meis sortorgid you do feel very invested yet an slake in lont sherwits can a happen nigts onlike most other lodis i wondered if zac was con to feel the same big feelings that i felt for the film at his adge and til we did wlos o dons no o he dies too no the worse closes no by the time ye get th gean hackin's big climactic speech to god qi w e g wao i you it is clear the bside an venture it does is job it gets to you but thin he by the experience tat zac had watching the film and the one that i was having it is different right for me itwas walking into a room for my child tood home and finding it in tact and exactly how i remembered it or we weld get to a scene and i would remember things atdn realize i rememberd is reading a na ng for that whe want to move together we think were watching the same thing but we are not me the beside adventures portal back to that vacation and being in that otelroom with carin an knowing those movy stars from other things they made in just that whole time in my lot i cannot hos that that moing whenn' do be beasy chicago is the samerican mife ofm or a glass to day on our programm were a point in the pend of ic were many of us are still not going out to movy theatres and we thought here it ar show let us nor moving nit thes t wa show about movies nd t e particular we desided to get people who have watched the film over and over you see something that most people do not see films to which they ore an audience of won these stories about how we connect te films sometimes very deep we but some of the very strange and rando ways stay wit he at one many things she ought to understand whan our producers dian wo spend most of her life thinking that she did not have a unique and personal take on the film the sound of music he sound o music after all i've ready loves it what is her to say and then she or now her tig is very different i watched the sound of music all the time as it kid it was one of maybe six we cess tapes we had at home along with banby an hundred on delmacions and a few years ago i wast talcong with her friend about how much i loved to the may be going up and he said me too though the not sea scared me and i said what not sease and that is when i learned i'd never seen the second half of the film he turns out the movy came out in a two v cs bock set and i for somories and had only ever seen the first tape my dad does not remember a seconer and why would you need whon the first half makes perfect sense on it sowm here is the plot it is a movy about a woman name maria who as sent to the country side to ba by set a giant family of childrn with the mean dad the mon traps maria shows up ubbly fun and thee ches them to sing and playind be kitall against the wishes of her father but the singing whenc an over they sing together as a family and finally at a party the kidsing a beautiful song for the guests farewell and after that maria having successfully fixe the family laves just mary popinstid and she fixed that family and that is the end of the moveme i had very clear fone memories of the goat heard puppit show and the scene in the gazibo were leasel the oldest daughter secretly met with the mal man she was in love with and they sang and danced and it was romantic i had no further questions about any of the characters when i learned that there were seventy more minutes to the film i did not bother going to look for them the sound of music was a full complete and wonderful artifact from my childhood i dadn't want a taint it with not sease but when my chael orker lena who is producing thes week show and is a musical theatre fan which i most definitely am not when she found out i still had not seen the whole thing it seemed heretical to her she could not let it stand we watched it together over the in her net one sunday afternoon and i prepared to have a childhood memory either slightly inhanceed or completely ruined tefore we started she had me predict what was gon to be in the second half i why base ot and this is base on my childhood memory and just what i would to see is it is the second half is just fokus ah in my favourite two characters lesel and the hot mal man i want to see their cort ship and and then they get married and that the end of that the moy we had play and started at the very beginning started with a part io know and the first half was more or less the simple sunny movy i remembered seeing the kindly and dower nuns come on screen early on was recognizing teachers i had in elementary school reper mote shest a bevy i simply canot fin oby there is that gazibosian when the malman and leasell sing to eachi other in staxten oy on seventy ni ta i ni then whirl around the gazibo dancing oi gat this still lix lix mat awatching now though i saw a lot of things that i had completely missed as a kid because as a child it apparently ignored anything that adults who were not maria said to each other literally none of that dialogue registered was the mumbly grown up in charley bround my kid self had edited full characters out of the film i barely remembered the baroness who once to marry the dad this really is exciting folmy gale be here wit you treesword mot rushe wanter otable that is not what i mead you do it any of their plotlines that were not resulved in the first half wut i also missed of course how maria and the dad supposedly fall in love the dad by the way was even meaner than i remembered just cruel to maria o what be tru at o se bust ooonon webi tru but at an ha ano one and because of that i still had a lot of troubles squaring the idea that anything between the two of them was remotely remanted he thinks shes cin' half wif you but tit is not true al they really spell it out abody youyou must cet oalat shurly eve noticed the way he looks into nie and you blashed in i tin en youda i justthe one romanst that still sparkled was between leasel in the mail man tho watching again i have to say the malman was not as cut as i remembered it is the male mad o he canalec lic an matsy ralph the mal man comes back later in the first half to throw rocks on leasel's window that moment i remember again dreamy but the one that followed was completely over my head as a kid i didn see i mean it didn dol your hil hitler hil hitler ye hill hitler the hero of my version of the sound of music who i'd hoped the secoand half would center around he was the notsy also not the male man yes he was wearing a uniform and delivering messages but he was not employed by the postal servis as my child'self had understood he was some kind of military messenger the first half his peppered with a humor hince this that things are ging to take a turn historically in the second half of the movy uneasy talk about austrian flags and something called an onsluce but all against the backdrop of a glamorous party the kind of easy to miss if you are seven the last thing i miss os a kid the big title card that is says intermission in yellow scrit that comes on screen after maria closes the door maybe was on a second bagges lena and i fasked forard through the music at intermission and the second hav tar mi dadly ai ges a lais ai e i eee for you a this really beard you havent thing any this fe sexcept does the second half starts i suddenly feel i have seen all of thest watching the tildren play bal on their back yard felt strangely familiar six it spent much time already with e on traps at their home that this new seen just felt part of my memories this confusin dasao sticks with me all the way through the scenes of maria back at the abbey its not until the dad goes to meet mariat the gazibo and declare his love for her that i am certain i have never seen this before you no won i u sot i loving you at not of e en ther when you shett on the porticulous pon co awat i knew the fist time you beetcity wissl o my guide o this is gross they basically just stared at each other three times an amari was letting this horrible man marry her i could not believe just as i'm settling in to the newness of the second half gocking at mari is wedding dress everything in the movy shifts the nots sees wollinto town it is incredibly abrupt e cut from literal wedding bells to a bell tolling over a giants wastic a flag on the town square lines of soldiers march across the plaza ominously the caller seem to drain out of the me the children show up next in drab brown close against the stony back drot instead of their perkey curtain outfits from the first half the characteris meanwhile ire dealing with their own with lash ralph surpriseis leasel as she is getting into a cart resel rasel o ra i'm basically as exsited to see ralph as leesel is right here because maybe this is when we get to the version of the second half i'd been wanting to see ralphin leasel's courtship rai'm cad to see you e igrotan youw'll take this place and to liverto your father as soon as she comes home ouch ralph he standing in front of a noxsy flag weasel is clearly disoriented but still hopeful as she holds the telegram and coily asks do not you want to come over to night dde ricesip i'm not occupied with a more important batit and your fallthe bet of be too be knows what is good for but ra alwes sa you chos a bad one this was the only relationship in the movi that interested me at all is a child and it sobering to see the whole realistic ark of it as for the rest of the second half it is predictable their first escape is not can a work out it is obvious thill wen the singing contest great songs from the first taffar just resycld in a weird way the one moment that moves me though does not have anything to do with the characters i was attached to from the first half it happens surprisingly when the dad start singing a love song to his country on stage he is doing it as an active gentle defiance that makes the nots see officials mustache twitch and as the crowd joins in with him i feel my throat cutch a little they remind me of people all around the world tho summer in honcong they roote bellaroose here in americot weare longing to hold on to somethit as their own countrys change rapidly excruciatingly around them the darkest moment of the movy is perhap s at the very end when the family has almost escaped but then ralph finds them in the abbey he raises a whistle to turn them in but the dad stops and reasons with him you do not rearly belong to them stavry wal come away with us wac toi ralph looks scared and voyish he really crishes his gun and leans over relieved but then the dd takes at one step too far you will nov up be one of them ralph chooses to betray ton it such a sinisster and to senencsene held up against the cin can be first half the family still makes it out in time but in spite of him not with his help an that is the actual end of them ias far as i know tan hereis my conclusion having seen it all he do not need the second half tt's actually better without it the second half just takes one of my kidself's favourite characters ralph and makes him a villain then takes the worst character the dad and makes him a hero there are barely any new songs maria disappears as a persom weasold just looks uncomfortable the whole time trying to act a child for another hour everything memorable and i conic about the movy my favorite things the kidsinging good night doh a dear that will happens in the first half but then i was at the beach this we gen with her friend staring at the clouds in the kids thering sand and he said a thing that canges my feeling about the second half he told me that lately he can last about three minutes feeling everything is narmal before he remembers it is not it made me understand the urged and clear the dark end of this story and the movy about the singing family be cause once everything in the world o his changed he cannot really will it to stay outside the frame thand will is one of the produces of our show coming out your ects wife has few thoughts about your marriage and she makes movy about that that is not sound that is going to be a good experience for you that is in a minute from chicagobobagradio when our programm continues tis mac life my reglass to day in our programme at this point in the pandemic were many of us are still not going out to movi theatrs we thought here at our programme let us do a movin night a show about movies the stories by people who see something that most of us do not see in some film to dasho is a rerun we have arrived at at two of our programme at two putting the ease in disease soback when they pandomic first took hold a lot of people were watching or rewatching the movi contagion which originally came out in twenty eleven maybe you have seen this it is about a deadly and fastspreading virus that is spread by resperatory drop lets goes round the world governments fail to contain it and i think when we watchfulms that or read books about the nineteen eighteen flew cause it just an scratches this itch were we once some way to think about what we are going through writ now and it is just nice to see somebody else go through some version of it on of our producers a chancol has never seen contagion bt be fenisopturning to this other movy a movyou better virus you'e probably never heard of it is a very different smen on the subject truchan you will not find this moving on net flegs or you toob or anywhere that at least i could not find it that way i finally had to order a d v d from an online vintage movy store it is clear my copy was pirated off cable skips a lot and all of the contagion gakes i was floored by some of the parallels to now especially given that thes movi came out in nineteen sixty eight more than half a century ago for instance in this movy instead of a bat the vector of the virus is a bird a two can that stowed away aboard a greek freighter somewhere near central america then the boat docks in new york harbor for inspection and the first mate alerts the military that a lot of the threu is sick u a oa a an par a a a ao a a a aa i e o a you a o oon you ta o o ho oa a i on ebat the two can is still on board held in a makeshift chicken wire fence but then it gets loose lies straight into the city and starts infecting people just a few at first the mayor of new york an empty suit motivated mostly by money and pull numbers holds a press conferencpy speaking into a microphone labelled w andwi see the public radeo station in new york where used to work weired there is that pluly no cars roar only porty seven cases of the reportit o car ut we u however make or o recomme but you were i ertical ma wyou are

masked panic business is suffered the presidential envoy fast tracts the development of a backsene if it ware not for the twenty footlong cob cars and aline mod dresses it feels some of these scenes coul have been shot in manhattan last week end except there is one major difference between this film and the steven soda burgi and contagen reality were all living in because in this movin the virus its not fatal it does not even cause a fever or cough instead the main and only symptom is absolute euforia that is it every one it in facts experiences unbridled happiness and elation it is victims began acting kindly to one another deferential in just a couple days the city is transformed from this i yo ya ii g g i a a i o o a gan ou c i a a a a o yo yo on i yo a i walk to this e moni a i ipa me i elp you the movi's called what' bad about feeling good it is a commedy rom come really and it is not a good moving which is why you likely have not heard of it even though the lead actors are george papard from breakfast at tifanies in the eighteen and merry titler more from merrytitermore and they do a good job pretty much every one in the cast is really skilled but the full production is out landishly campy an caricaturistic here are few very awkward choices cartoon word balloons emerged from the two can's mouth sometimes when it squacks sso what it is thinking oh and there is a schmals a m radio themesong kind of a knock off of bird back ra on ra happyentatian ta en yation what s baabo an yo that is said it is also a great moving n the way that silly be movies can be satisfied especially the ar came one that make you feel a ki d watching a duls mess up for the first time ive the greatest hits list of them in my head wild in the streets about ages tippies waging a cho against the west government a invasion of the be girls about a race of murderous women we were also bees both of which you can watch on line for free but since it is hard to find a copy of this

the country and he presidential candidate running on a platform of law an order and also courting segregationists and given all that you might ask what is bad about feeling good which is what the mayor in the movi wanted to know in one of the first crisis management meetings with his cabi ent they are running down the symptoms for him until the virus stops people from brooding but it is worse

felt every other part of the movi had been an escape from was going on it is funny that one of the most ludicrous pieces of dialogue as also practically a quote we have heard in the news in twenty twenty and not as a joke much more of the story left but just to a brig they finally managed to isolate the virus amazingly because it is movy they develop a vaxine that day but they still have to test it out they spray it in pete and lizzes nuptial bed in the hotel room of their spending their wedding night fand set up a hidden camera behind the air van everybody in the bunker the mayor the

too wa we do that rom com running thing and just that thei're back together the city spuws the baxine into the air by a factory chimneys and exhaust pipes and most of new york lives miserably ever after but some people stay pleasant and uplifted because major plot twist fifty per cent of the people who seem to be infected actually never got the virus in the first place the joy just rubbed off on them and liz was one of those people which is why she did not get quotin quote better in the hotel room which is actually the moral of the movi that happiness is a choice but watching the movi during this pandemic i drew another darker conclusion somehow that wigly weird jolt of recognition i got over and over again what it felt waz this is how it goes when face with ha crisis this governments will ninimize the severity of the danger thel value the wrong things focus on the economy over people's lives and blame foreigners in an ugly zenophobic way i'm sure there is version of america were all that magh not happen tbut we are not living in that america right now and pete and liz were not living in it either if it is possible for human beings to do the wrong thing we will figure out away we are resorceful that johnkol is one of producies of a show m ereia atre rectors cut shortedays by people who have a very paticular take on some film and the person in the s next trry finds himself in to situation that not many a servican to bein his ex wife decided to revisit the part of the wives as their marriage fell apart and make a movy about it anyway about a couple whose life seems very very parallel to theirs in wots of ways this fictional couple gets married really young the tring to make it in a way the woman gets a big brag she leaves the husband at that point sa happend in rear life too the guy's nameis willwelden on ta baker explains what hppened next will heard about the movy from some friends when his ack's wife started working on it the very thought of it made him anxious his acts rebecca e ventually brought et up with him she said the film was only loosely based on their marriage which deffinally did not help he tried to put it out of his head a year and half later he was scrawling around on mine and i saw on face book people posting the trailer for the movy and being ak go see this movy if it is in atheatrener you cause was made by rebecca atlman and she is grat and funny and i saw those popping up an then i just had this moment where i was oh the moment is here and that was when i was filled with the most ret what were those thoughts for me i was the thing i was the most afraid of is that the movy would portray me accurately wills camted about his fas admits he was kind of a dot as a husband willin rebecca that when she was twenty three he was just nineteen they were to gether for eight years married for almosts five during that time he was mustly on im playe though he eventually started doing part time work walking dogs and house sitting he did some stand up but not very often mostly had spend his time refreshing gocker or i was playing plac station or i was literally just sitting there thinking about how i should be doing something i was not really i had no actual golls and i was not striving for anything that was i think the defining quality that anded our marriage because she was the ambitious fun and disciplined she wanted to be a tvy writer she would wake up early to work on scraps and when he watched the trailer that was in it nd she is the harder worker and actually wants things i got the dop y they tire me as a writer sing the trail i made it much worse now he realized the filmans probably returned him to some very painful times he would rather not relive liked the way their marriage ended to me at the time it really fell it came out of nowhere she got home from work and and she just head a very very strange the way people will start they will be then she set me down and she was just telling me about how she was unhappy and the relationship an she had been for a long time on they me being she iht just i do not know why this has not awhy none of this has come up befork i just loved her and i did not i realy fell we shoe tryand give it another chance and she was likei do not know and at a certain point we were talking and i was who will we fooling here it really seems you are done and this is done and she was looki well mived out after just a week started crashing on friends couched he was devistated didn' understand what i'm wrong and there re other seems from their lives that he would hate to seen i movy i'm sure there will be conversations with her mamor her sister and her frience i do not know if they were come on girl you get it dump im those well probably be the toughest parts cause i imagine those will be things that will be very base in reality t film which is called paper year came out in early twhenty teen it is got seventy one persen on ron tomados critic's comment on how authentic the couples love coming on don feels for a while well could not bring himself to see it but a month ago he suggested we watch it together and i was into the idea i'm going through a divorce criht now it is a very strange time of life i go on a lot of long walks i stoped watching tellivision for a year i would not avoid my feelings all i read eurself help books and when i go to parties i corner divorce people and badger them for details about what this was for them and how they got through it divorce is my own personwill disaster porn watching in movy about a divorce with the person who hald happen to it is all i wanted it and well thought it would make it easier for him to see it for the first time this is a better way to view it whith aother people in just it is three in the morning i'm alang the torafs i've gotten up in secret and i watching it in the middle of the night li au just deny having ever seen it if i want to i met willwern he was staying he is stok sitting at a sleep lost ngeless home over looking a canyon furry throw a pillows and open lay out pomegranite and lemon trees framing your view wif the valley all really expensivewill is on highlart any time i move anything he is careful to put it back exactly where it had been are we ready hhhhehsure a ci min a flagh you veurrimwers the movy opens with the couple dan and franny getting married in a court house which will an rebecca all to day dan lifts franny and carries er out the couple starts out really in love having lots of secks laughing kissing in back is your ash ye a i never had a rash sno ra sho o o it the taging bell the guyds job in the film dog said earles he is gort the rascal orn't you hhis good with can i just point out the dog that your house sitting in this movy is literally the same breeder dot that is sitting under the table arat now ye it is a jeck rustle chuawa mix that he is dog sitting and i am also dok sitting a jeck rustle coal er mix in fact the house in the filmer dann framing dou their dog sitting is a lot the house will and i are sitting in at this very moment similar lay out in do core same view this complute now i want to finish us in another scene franniy is sitting at her computer working on a scret dan is trying to get her atention just you why you do not yo gon w sater the real lifeersion of this would actually play out a little differently less fun and more sad i well says he would do everything he could to get out of her way when she was working i would just disappear i'd wheels a t v into the bedroom and watch it in there just it would not be distracting the movy which i'll ad mit i'm the targadadience for i liked it marriage made franniy unhappy in the same way it made me unhappy my life had ended i spent much time thinking about whether or not i wanted to be with my husband but i could not tell him that we had nothing to talk about because if he asked me what i was thinking the real answer would have been i'm not sure if i love you any more the scene that well feared but frannin confiding in her mam an friends about all her husband's terrible qualities and everyone saying what they really think of him that never happens there is no seen where anyone bad mouths him none at all no one tells anyone to dump the loser instead what happens as much more interesting late in the film franny sits down to talk to her mamm about her marriage in the scene she is trying to convince herself to stay with him bat everythings pi well sits forward in his seat the day is marriage fell apart well came home and rebecca was on the couch crying she said she would been talking er er mamm but he never knew what their conversation was about he felt he was getting to see it now in the scene franny played by epuson talks to her mamm played by andy mc dell maybe it is jus lit the first year fe marriae just hordas yo thit ld saying it can a few years look back in in la they look at me that' sns bethe first year she be past thet was not on of us ul stick around because it only gets horrder muh charter it is ah it is just sucks seeing how upset she is that sucks she felt really bet is just a bad feeling for some one to have to go through you are seeing how hard it was for her what just i i do not think i was incorrect to focuss on my own struggles during the whole process of splitting up but it did cant of prevent me from sthinging about hers as well i just did not have as much of it appreciation for the difficulty of it the misery that goes into that choice it is sat it also is a little bit of a relief that was hard for her if it had been very easy for her to intings i would have felt such absolute trash am if just one day she come on be yo what nat for me by pal but that is the story you have kind of been telling yorself a yefor years will had been telling himself the same version of their break up something he would sand paper down into this rebecca got her big brak and then she dumped himout of the bloe he was heartbroken she was happy and thriving moving on was easy for her be watching this it came flotding back at least a year maybe more when rebecca was sad before their break up it was time travelling through all this pain that he deleded from his memory bwe asked rebecca to come talk about her movy with will she met us at the house where well were halt setting it is a little awkward the talk about the weather and traffic in the six years since their marriage ended they have never had a conversation about it and for her understandably this did not seem the best way to begin one by talking about her movy it has a they mean this son certain sense it has nothing to do with will it is is own movy it is not a documentary i a kind of object to the idea that were in a read into this movy we are to use it of some kind of secret code understand this real life relationship that existed but also i felli the way you say it thing i was it just meed a move was just a movy li whyre you reading into the fovy but i fee there are it is more it is more specifically related to an experience that you had sure but i'm not mnot the a first person to do such a thing yad i ot dog walk well bu i i said that is thy i kno i was he is going a dogs it andou can i have no ambition ye i i also i guess i always thought of that character as not some one without ambition but someone who was afraid and i'm not that that is not me looking at you going that was thit that is really who you are well tells rebecca what he told me how the most emotional part of the movy was seen har side of things how how hard it was for her to decide to break out ar and then to finally do it it it felt bad because it was just her trying to justify not ending it or trying to convince herself it will git better and that was a very emotional thing for made and the most affecting part of the movi hard to watch is it because it reminded you of that last big conversation we had that was emotional it it felt bad because it reminded me of you having to do yourself kind of all of the recognizing of the problems in the relationship i had i just had not ever considered the journey to coming to that point in that conclusion and how difficult it is to do that isclear rind the mixsions think i mean is tha now the part of the show we just talk ot a bri that you want me to respond ye i i mean do not really want to get into it but that was a really tough periodes were really kind of weirdly dark confusing times and i think that is what i wrote thist it was not i was trying o rite this you would understand something oi was doing it that i could understand something i feel i mean i i obviously relate to this secause i i'm going through divorse i left my husband a year ago and o more personal mfou my marriage seems really similar tires my husband was mustling an employed i was tand one who was working all the time neither was were happy and i had to be the one to call at or if knew and i have to say i wish he would give me credit i it was really awful and hard and hartbreaking and i was tormented by it in who as the hardest decision iv ever made 'm and i just i this is my dream realization that my partner could ever have which is to say o my god you it was hard for you too desdi are you getting mat er you getting my projecting no i mean i'm it is just am we have been broken up forhowlong now over six yere ye i mean that i have not been bending much of that time going thinking oh i hope will understands my perspective some day i i think i've just i think it is really nice that that that that maybe there is some kind of mutual middle ground that we are seeing it from but i think that i just it was a ave for me to let will have his own pat through it well had a story of how things anded that was cemented in his min and without the film he would have gone on thinking it cherry picking the moments that made him fill the worst rebecca ays if he win your acto understand your break up the best way probably is not to make a movy about it it is away too much work and money and the most likely out come is that they'l hate you for it a a down the baker is one

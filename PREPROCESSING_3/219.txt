i nis many people who have films that they have watched over and over and i have never really gotin that i was fee tere is many films that i have not seen why would i watch one again but we get to these conversations and there always comes a moment where i'm asked whell what is the film that you have seen the most and then i have to admit it is the besiden adventure which i know is not a good film it is this seventy's movy about an ocean liner that gets it by i sonami flips upside down and the passengers tried to make their way to safety it is part of an entire jonrof films disaster films that v never gottin any respect nobody thinks of these films as ar it but i loved it at the time when i sw it it felt big and i felt important ind serious an i remember it was very ofm emotional and the reason that i saw it many times that this is the film that i saw more than any other was not cause i loved the film itscause o where i saw it is on vacation we did not take many vacations when i was a kid but on one of them we stated at this hotel an flarida were the rooms had this thing where they offered a couple movies all day long anythingis is long ago and the nineteen seventies my sisters and i we had never seen anything that even cable t v was rear back that but beside an inventure wath the film that they offered and my sister cren and i we eat it up that was the iffe we watch over and over again yo as o this was a very importantving thats karen and ers un zac my nephew who we tried to explain this terecent ly we henteed up watching it on t v at night if our parents one ut to dinner or if ere was a rainy day yet we loved it the way that i remember it is that is that the hotel just had this movy on a loop and it would just as soon as it would finish it would start again and the way i remember it is that every time we would come into te hotel room you could turn on the t v and you would be somethe in the besidn convecture et sounds vaguely familiar to me i do not totally remember that but that might be right y and i remember it having a lot of feeling do youemember it having lot of feeling what does it mean having a lot of feeling rlit every metin yellis a lot of emotions ye wit scarry and you really invested in their journey to escape alive i do not think i'm getving anything way by saying that sort ar here the radier shw these last three weeks have ben talking about the random films that people have strong attachments to thinking that might be a good episode the shell and i started to think by the besidean adventure an i wondered what it would be to see it again would it have any feeling whut any of it feel the way it did to me as a kid woutd be away to caren my sister and i we watched it and i invited zac to since he is the age that we were when we watched it back in seventies he is ot thirteen i was fourteen at the time caran was eleven and i when is there i did not expec exact to it he does not i lot of films and right away very foreseen let us know the kind of film we were in for im a little boy visits the bridge of the essess bosidon this ocean liner in the midle of a big storm and the w boy is greeted by the captain who is played by maser nelson who at this point had not made the creer transition to parody characters this captar sho asi lo o i wa go on on li en i wh s ons line what mins does lines si asy i did not remember how winceed the acting gotin some places when arnis porgnin shows at it is clare that the nineteen fifty six osco one of her best actor is not i one of his best rolls oc he angry borgnan does seem to shout nearly every one of his lines in the film when they have gont a done me and i did not expect seeng the om again was how much of the dialogue i remember from decades to go and ivas all susprised realize an i do not know what this ays about me the lines that i remember the most i the little comic zingers i when a creemember is aske to he is marriad i know his corny response bfor he says it no marriage for me missus rose i got a mistress la the see es thenhny i did remember and emember liking from the film was it this is an old fashion enough movy the producers tried to insert some big ideas into the adventure rall means hes big ideas are provided by geane hackman who plas a rebellious young priest in turtle mak his big theological idea is a very conveniently helpful one for e wle were about to be capsized in mover the ocean god does not want you to wait for miracles yet to take matters into your own hands do not rat to god its al your brobe s from a sermonhy delivers early in the film at the des the quite for yourself got wat ra sol wat witters nat quitters di you cannot wa at le try awar he comes back to this over and over through the film rowling the passengers to fight

still loved it that the put that end there ey mi he soon enough read at the struk of midnight on new years eve the senomi hits the boat flits the plotma tit n the reckage of the upside down i es party

g wi i you itis clear the besid an venture it does its job it gets to you but thin he by the experience tat zac had watching the film and the one that i was having it is different right for me it was walking into a room for my child toant home and finding it in tat and exactly how i remembered it or we weld get to a scene and i would remember things atdn't realize i rememberd is reading a ne am for that we watch im movin together we think we are watching the same thing but we are not for me the beside an inventures in portal back to that vacation and being in that hotel rum with caren and knowing those movy stars from other things they made in just that whole time in my live i cannot shose act that movi hotn't oby beasy chicago is this american life i'm mire a glass to day on ou programm after months of pandemic when many of us ha been staying home and seeing way more movies than usual we thought he would our sho let us do a movy night a show about moves and in particular wedecided to get people who watched a film over and over we see something in it most people do not see films tor which they are an audience of one including somebody went to teep with the veelong line in somebody watched ta classic gidsfilm over and over a film that many of us have seen she loved it and only wearn years later is in a dull that which heu'd seem was only the first half of the film stay with us that on putting the ease ind disease back when t pandemic fors trok hold ot o people were watching or re watching the movy contagion which we jonly came out in two thousand eleven if you have seen it it is about a deadwy and fast spreading virus that is spread by respiratory dropwets goes around the world governments fail to contain it and i think we watch films that or read books about the nineteen eighteen flo cause hes at t is just scratches this itch wel we just one sum way to think about what we are going through right now and is niceto just see somebody else go through some version of it one of our producers shankol has never seen contagia but he found himself turning to this other movy movin by to virus you probably have not heard of it is a very different spen on the subject youshon you will not find this movy on net flegs or you tob or anywhere that at least i could not find it that way i finally had to order a d v d from an online vintage movy store in's clear my copy was pirated off cable skips alot and all of the contagion geeks i was floored by some of the parallels to now especially given that the movy came out in nineteen sixty eight more than half a century ago for instance in this movy instead of a bat the vector of the virus is a bird a two can that is stowed away aboard a greek freighter somewhere near central america then the boat docks in new york harbor for inspection and the first mate alerts the military that a lot of the threu was said o oa a a on a a a o a a a aa i a a a nou a a oonnew tan o o o o a i a a the two can is still on board held in a makeshift chicken wire fence but then it gets loose lies straight into the city and starts infecting people just a few at first the mayor of new york an empty su motivated

for year soon every one is scurring around the city in a mask panic business is suffered the presidential envoy fast tracts the development of a backscene if it were not for the twenty footlong cop cars and the aline mod dresses it feels some of these scenes coul have been shot in manhattan last weekend except there is one major difference between this film and the steven soda burgi and contagen reality were all living in because in this moving the viris it is not fatal it does not even cause a fever or cough instead the main and only symptom is absolute euforia that is it every one it in facts experiences unbridled happiness and elation it is victims begin acting kindly to one another deferential in just a couple days the city is transformed from this i o ja ii i a o i a o i or you on i yo a i walk to this e mon i i a me iep yo the movies called what' bad about feeling good it is a comedy romcome really and it is not a good movig which is why you likely have not heard of it even though the lead actors are george papard from breakfast at tipanies in the eighteen and marry tiler more from n marytilermore and they do a good job pretty much every one in the cast is really skilled but the full production is out landishly campy an charicaturistic here ware few very awkward choices cartoon word balloons emerged from the two can's mouth sometimes when at squaks is what it is

the air by a factory chimneys and exhaust pipes and most of new york lives miserably everatr but some people stay pleasant and uplifted because major plock twist fifty per cent of the people who seem to be infected actually never got the virus in the first place the joy just rubbed off on them and liz was one of those people which is why she did not get quotin quote better in the hotel room which is actually the moral of the movi that happiness is a choice but watching the movi during this pandemic i drew another darker conclusion somehow that wigly weird jolt of recognition i got over and over again what it felt was this is how it goes when face with ha crisis this governments will minimize the severity of the danger thel value the wrong things the focus on the economy over people's lives and blame foreigners in an ugly zinaphobic way i'm sure there is version of america where all that might not happen tbut we are not living in that america right now and pete and liz were not living in it either if it is possible for human beings to do the wrong thing we will figure out away we are resourceful that n con co is one of produces of or show moming oagat five ofclock somewhere

turnoback to the meeting the attorney trying to knock west off the ballad goes through several other prognencs with west petitions and then it is time for the tenment response from the west campaign you may begin your times targu i thank you good afternoon man charry wechis commission staff n fove o council representing the west campaign its not the lawyer who filed the petitions but a lawyer name mi cal currente guess he looks unnervingly billionaire mark cuban and he appears unfortunately backlit his face shades and kind hard to see i when he gets started attorney currene makes but i supposes the arcument tat he haskternanthat walking in fourteen seconds passe the five ofclock deadline as that is not actually lateon when we are talking about tintrees no later than includes the time franed the referde thevereuses for example no later than tuesday tit is not mee prior to tuesday no later than tuesday means oll tuesday and to make five pan fort o court late the proper language would be e four five pim for prior to find yem or not later than for fif te nie pim but no later than fve pim does not include the tet four minutes the questiong the wester lawyer is posing in a you iis five ofclock a point in time ant or is five ofclock all the space between four fifty nine and five or one tit is not actualliy such a bad question hapril fifteenth as the taxk dead line he get all day on the fifteenth five right the next clock to his happens when the first republican takes his turn asking questions of tho two lawyers that is a republicaname deen co newson he is a former state lawmaker is a veterinary anime tonewsan sitting in front of this folksy painting that makes it feel he might be in the waiting room of his veterinary practice and he is noticeably sceptical of the west campaign's atturneynin five ofclock at's five ofclock i i understand your trime to make an argument the five ofclock ats five or won but it just seems to me that everything that starts with the for is in four or five ofclock and five ofclock for deadlie maybe i'm just time and sence o not a lawyer but thats swed seens e turney turny if you seven time or on your fall te go off at five ofclock when would it go off it should go off at five ofclock shark as soon as the clock turn to five five s teros eros eros ero on yes f af we at seven time or a goou at five would the papers have been in on fime or nok but the first respose wu be that is for the fiving offsearh to decharmen but to danc your question directly i but if conuwsan does not seem to be towing the party line the next republican commissioner to ask questions he seems more than ready to do the opposite we a a it is your flor o thank you in camera commissioner robert spindell he looks hese being held captive in a sup flie room somewhere his against this white wall that has nothing on it inny mam pretty quickly he goes really big on the west campaign's argument that five ofclock means you have right up an tail fival wontim ou kno on your point abot i sa just five ofclock five ofclock i de a lot of a sy an try an to flinp something and there is no real e fealet of act over the next few minutes spindl makes a member of creative arguments trying to help the cina west lawyer thing yes lik he says since the petitions entered the building at five ofclock and fourteen secons well ifourteen seconds since fless than half a minute that really rounds back down to five pian sharp bray the man hat's just somethin ma in in around a round you ti fers sos pindel also questions whether the lest campaign tanis actually had to turn in the petitions in order for the petitions to be turned in as y nder stand thesee in er sustan got on th ellevater a were the staff pirson just the three on i which you ack tho sirt of the tat could be sramps fer a a a documents it that time thet once the door close to the allby to be clear spindell is contending that being in the elevater vet the staff member and not handing the staff remember the diumens is the same as being in the office and physically turning the men can i say there is something about how the action of all this plays out on zoome with all the normals whomhe interruptions it feels intimate one commissioner keeps dropping off the call at one point there is a cat but thet pops into a frame next to a commissioner asking questions and also when people go at each other it feels more personal somehow because you just see them and they are in their homes and jacobs the chair a few times she gets in to it a spindell and you see her and what i think is her living room she is wearing pearls and she' sittig in front of a fireplace and what looks a silver teaset eye it is way less a debate in some brandom government building or whatever and more family members getting in a fight on the pone or something i to make fom rer member i do at you can you lihe think at ince i i to make a femte emotion that we motion at ir a i that is that i good im sir no just wait but i still have been got into the most memorable parts of a spindell speecefying he started when he talked about coveti which you sir i e gree the the pandamic eas made why and everything else much harder yes te situation this were the ban dac makes things harder and ere everything elsei there is great efforts to in yelechin frocess is to try and make the proceeds our uaser for all ofos then you are wic yourgery ther we e should try and make it loe euser spindell's essentially making in argument that democracys takes more time wearing a pandemi and people should get more time to do san with somebody which mam that is just pa aspindel for a second here because the wisconsin gio p has systematically staked out positions to do the opposite this year wisconstin conservatives hae fought the idea of giving more time for early voting an absentea voting in april republicans also made it very clear that they opposed postponing an election do to covet including robert spindell who said covid was no reason to postpone and election still spendell had one more argument tes caps an dama raps which is which is the people o bringing the a challenge i my mi worson why they gain stops question the back f a her they wish to take away fom wet by topuwation on opportunity to tak a black wwas the manchal canof the obthe gal yo tbu choice ubs o who they want bot fors an all whats labsan terns of try o toexpressly the blak choice this is where the meeting truly bent my mound as if it would make sense for democrats to suppress black voters nationally eighty seven present of them identify as democrats i could not help but think watching this that here we are in the throes of the sizemic elections i go one in which lots of people on both sides argue that the people on the other side the're out to destroy the country it feels huge it is we are to think that the legitimacy of the election process over the coming weeks well hinge on what happens in many rooms this un tiny screens this wit public servants and volunteers and campaign workers will be wrestling over rules and dead lines and signatures and postmarks this vidio it is actually kind of a neak preview and honestly i think will be lucky if it looks this meeting absurd is a got at times i respect this much these commissioners are paid a little over a hundred dollars a meeting after we hundreds of pages of documents to prepare for this and they went around and round and round splitting this fourteen second hair every which way for the vast majority of the time people were thoughtful and they were willing to step across party lines if that is what they had to do to get to what they thought was fair mostly they seemd they were trying to do what was right and in the end a very simple argument ont out thet was precedent now lots of many people had missed dead lines in the passince whether by lot or little they just could not accept it i thought i the motion is carried five to one tand just that an kiny west was off ful wisconsin ballat the remainder of this vidio is worth mentioning if yuljust give me one more menute here i'll summ it up for you will ciny west campaign made the headlines the next day the wisconsin elections commission also made another decision that night one with the power to affect the outcome of the presidential race also on the agendof that evening was a challenge seeking to bump the green party candidates off the ballat on something that is really pretty technical see during wis consince signature collection period the v p candidate for the green party seems to have moved her address at the beginning it does not matcher paper work at the end re publicans were that is in the picky b s but the democrats would not budge and the end result the green party was gone just west remove from the ballat and you do not have to look far to see the enormous stakes of that decision you remember how in twenty sixteen donald trump one wisconsin by twenty three thousand vots that year the green party candidate josteine she got thirty one thousand vots and was cons bancahen is one of prices of ushow after this meeting the conno west campaign in the green party candidates both su the was consant elections commission trying to get on the allat the grean party went to the statesprane quiet and lost no green party and the conna west campaign's lost suit a jodge also rode now judge johns coskay give final word on the debate overthe meaning of time and has written decision quot the court believes at the cimeo grandfather cack rings out five times is the moment it is f p what usy now it youf midnight there is significant difference between eleven fifty nine fifty nine pi and one second after midnight the passage of a second after midnight e first an entirely new dagy nother words quot the cort finds o basically five ofclock is five ofclock a three many thing she ought to understan what ar producers dian wo spend most of e life thinking that she did not have a uniqueand personal take on the film the sound of music e sound o music after all if ready loves it what is her to say nd then yhou or now her tige is very different i watched the sound of music all the time as it kid it was one of maybe six w chss tapes we had at home along with banby an hundred ondelmacions and a few years ago i was talcong with ha friend about how much i loved the maybe going up and he said me too though the not sea scared me and i said what not sease and that is when i learned i'd never seen the second half of the film it turns out the moy came out in a two v cs bock set and i for somories and had only ever seen the first tape my dad does not remember a seconer and why would you need one the first half makes perfect sense on it som here is the plock it is a movy about a woman name maria who was sent to the country side to babys sat a giant family of children with ta mean dad the bon traps maria shows up ubbly fun and teaches them to sing and play and bekiall against the wishes of her father but the singing whence im over they sing together as a family and finally at a party the kid sing a beautiful song for the guests farewell and after that maria having successfully fix the family laves just mary popinstid when she fixed that family and that is the end of the movy i had very clear fine memories of the goat heard puppet show and the seen an the gazibo were leasel the oldest daughter secretly met with the male man she was in love with and they sang and danced and it was romantic i had no further questions about any of the characters when i learned that there were seventy more minutes to the film i did not bother going to look for them the sound of music was a full complete and wonderful artifact from my childhood i din't want a taint it with not sease but when my cherker lena who is producing thes week show and is a musical theatr fan which i most definitely am not when she found out i still had not seen the whole thing it seemed heretical to her she could not let it stand we watched it together over the inner net one sunday afternoon and i prepared to have a childhood memory either slightly enhanced or completely ruined before we started she had me predict what was going to be in the second half a why base sot and this is based on my childood memory and just what i would to see wis it is the second half is just focu ahin my favourite two characters leasel and the hot mal man i want to see their court ship and and then they get married and that the end of that the movy we had play and started at the very beginning started with ea partin now and the first half was more or less the simple sunny movy i remembered seeing the kindly and dower nons come on screen early on was recognizing teachers i had in elementary school reper noe shestevery i simply canot cin are there is that gazi rosian when the male man and leasel sing to each other in six te iy in seventy ni oi ni then whirl around the gazibo dancing oi a the still lex lix mu i watching now though i saw a lot of things that i had completely missed as a kid because as a child i'd apparently ignored anything that adults who were not maria said to each other literally none of that dialogue registered was the mumbly grown up sin charley bround my kid self had edited full characters out of the film i barely remembered the baroness who wants to marry the dad this reall is exciting fommy gale be here with you tres wod mo usho wontutable that is not what i mead you do it any of their plotlines that were not resulved in the first half wut i also miss of course how maria in the dad supposedly fall in love the dad by the way was even meaner than i rememberd just cruel to maria o what e true ha o bus oon webin tru but at an had anon oneand because of that i still had a lot of troubles squaring the idea that anything between the two of them was remotely remanted he thinks she can half with you but that is not tru all they really spell it out abody ou you must cet aal a surly you have noticed the way he looks into mive and you blashdin i tims en yo da i just the one romance that still sparkled was between lesel in the mail man tho watching again i have to say the mailman was not as cute as i remembered it is the mal mad o he canalecs lice an matsy ralph the mal man comes back later in the first half to throw rocks on leasel's window that moment i remember again dreamy but the one that followed was completely over my head as a kid i dn see i man it did not nol your hil itler hll hitler ye hill hitler the hero of my version of the sound of music who i'd hoped the second half would center around he was the notsy also not the mal man yes he was wearing a uniform and delivering messages but he was not employed by the postal servis as my childself had understood he was some kind of military messenger the first half is peppered with a humor hince this that things are going to take a turn hiistorically in the second half of the movy uneasy talk about austrian flags and something called an unsluse but all against the backdrop of a glamorous party the kind of easy to miss if you are seven the last thing i missed as a kid the big title card that says intermission in yellow scrit that comes on screen after maria closes the door maybe was on a second bagtess lena and i faste forward through the music at intermission and the second have stats i dadly a ias ilais ii si eerre for yo a this realy beard you havnthing an tis fie icsi sept does the second half starts i suddenly feel i have seen all of this watching the tildren playball on their backyard felt strangely familiar six i'd spent much time already was afon traps at their home that this new scene just felt part of my memories this confusing dajavo sticks with me all the way through the scenes of maria back at the abbey it is not until the dad goes to meet maria at the gazibo and declare his love for her that i am certain i have never seen this before oyou know what a o sto oloving you a not of eeether when you settln the conticulous pon co cowat i knew the fist time you beentcity wissle o my guide oma this is grouse they basically just stared at each other three times an amaria was letting this horrible man marry her i could not believe just as i'm settling in to the newness of the second half gocking at mory is wedding dress everything in the movy shifts the knots sees rol into town it is incredibly abrupt he cut from literal wedding bells to a bell toling over a giant swastic a flag on the town square linds of soldiers march across the plaza ominously the collers seem to drain out of the vy the children show up next in drab brown close against te tony back drot instead of their purky curtain outfits from the first talf the characters meanwhile are dealing with their own with flash ralph surpriseis leasel as she is getting into a car rasel reasel o ral ime basically as exsited to see ralph as leasel is right here tbecause maybe this is when we get to the version of the second half i'd been wanting to see ralphin leaseles cortship ralphan cad to see you an gdoctin you will take this pleace and to livertoy your father as soon as she comes home ouch ralph he standing in front of a notse flag wesel is clearly dis oriented but still hopeful as she holds the telegram and coly asks do not you want to come over to night di de ricesi i'm now occupied with more important matit and your father better be tooibe knows what is good for but ral alweys sal euchose a bad one this was the only relationship in the movy that interested me at all is a child and it sobering to see the whole realistic ark of it as for the rest of the second half it is predictable their first escape is in can a work out it is obvies thel when thi singing contest great songs from the first taffar just resycld in a weard way the one moment that moves me though does not have anything to do with the characters i was attached to from the first taf it happens surprisingly when the dad starts singing a love song to his country on stage mhe is doing it as an active gentle defiance that makes the nots ee ifficials mustache twitch and as the crowd joins in with him i feel my throat catch a little they remind me of people all around the world to summer in honcong they rote bellerous here an americout we are longing to hold on to somethit as their own country's change rapidly excruciatingly around them the darkest moment of the movy is perhaps at the very end when the family has almost escape but then ralph finds them in the abbey he raises a whistle to turn them in but the dad stops and reasons with him you ont really belong to them ste re wal come away with us ac ralph look scared and toyish he really cushes his gun and leans over relieved but then the dad takes at one step too far you will never be one of thm woa ralph chooses to betray then it such a sinister and ti sinet scene held up against the cotton kandy first half the family still makes it out in time but in spite of him not with his help and that is the actual end of them iy as far as i know tote here is my conclusion having seen it all he do not need the second half tit is actually better without it the second half just takes one of my kid's selv's favourite characters ralph it makes him a villain then takes the worst character the dad and makes him a hero there are barely any new songs maria disappears as a person weasld just looks uncomfortable the whole time trying to act a child for another hour teverything memorable and i conic about the movy my favourite things the kid singing good night do a dear that will happens in the first half but then i was at the beach this weekend with he friend staring at the clouds in the kids tering sand and he said a thing that changed my feeling about the second half he told me that lately he can last about three minutes feeling everything is normal before he remembers it is not it made me understand the urged to incleare the dark end of this story and the movy about the singing family because once everything in the world his changed he cannot really will it to stay outside the frame

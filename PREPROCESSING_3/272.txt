b b easy chicago it is the samerican life from ir glass and will not tell you about two police investigations one of them as done inspiringly well it is the detectives in it are detectives on a tellivision shol smard and resourceful and great judgment and just police at their very best the other case the same crime lots of the same facts is the opposite goes terribly and theinvestigation that goes wrong gaes wrong in a very unusual way it is a game of telephone where one misunderstanding begets another misunderstanding begets another until something that is not true spreads to an entire community of people and somehow hardens into the truth and happens incradibly fast and appens in just three days and just tin on front of this the crime that going to be talking about the sour is a sexual assauld if that is a trigger for you consider this warning and one f the first phone caus in this chain comes right after the crime this is back in august too thousand ade a woman named shannan was standing on her balcony and see outle supperb when she got the fon call was from an eighteen year old she knew name marie who told her she would ben welken up in the night by a stranger he raped her and i you knon ask her are you kay and she ou knowt said she was a kan that she was going to be staying i think with er frond that night nd when my husband got home i told him whan it happened but i said i do not know that a happened thereis something about how she said it that just made me question whetherr not she would actually been raped it was that tond of her voice there as just know we moction it was she was telling me that she would made a sanwage i just made myself and chicken sanwine shanna felt awful douting marie je now marie for years marie was a foster child who stay with shan an her husband very briefly just a couple weeks when she was younger and that a'll hit it off an she stayed close with marie even after marie went to live in another foster home they hang oll together cooked together they give up carbs together for a few weeks shanan gloved marie she saw herself in marie they were alike and lots a waes there is actually part of her doubt mari was emotional she did cry wat channo if i had been mara i would have been hysterical i av been fryine welwe upsad as i was sectually obes is a child anna was sectually assaulted ha's not dalt and i never told for her sent meers and when i did tell some one i was hostericall ho mol in crying ad shame betchanna was wrong about marie marie had been raped who is proving later beyond a shadow of a doubt and the way her case went wrong we have all her stories about police not believing women who come forward and say that they were sexually assaulted but in this case the doubts began not with tha polices but with people much closer to marie people who love her and of the best intentions towards her bet caus wrong in this case of something personal it is people exercising impathye and getting it wrong and then that mistake spreads t officials and friends and acquaintances until it is impossible for the alltest ty the truth even when new proof comes to light ive one it is all right there in front of them a reporting today is a partnership that the martial project of propublica the first part of the story takes place mostly in winwood washington near seattle marial project investigat ove reporter ken armstrong and oneof our producers robin semian will explain how all this unfolded strurting with cann wholl explain a little more about marie marie gets a l ong with people she is good at

immediately the police were there and mari a siting in thor hing i sat down next to her and she was telling me what happened and i i got this i'm a big a woan r er fan and i got just got this ealy weared feelu was thi i felt she was telling me the script of the lod la order story she was detached detached and mostly detachhed sramn what she was saying it felt that just what is this drama going on it that still there was a pirme that as i gono god i mean if it is real ant o respond remember being shock and shaking and blankit the corner a they they asked me a few questions about what had happened that i had told them ad left my door unlocked in that some one had broken into my apartment and ranped me again this is mary she is twenty five now a quick worning what she told police is difficult to hear and definly not ferkids here is what happened mari was home by herself she was awake all tiht talking on the fountain with her expoy friend jardan ah my gon off the thone and went to sleep a tenopen my eyes and ther was somebody in my house aa nif in his hand and the laing a mast he blindfolded me and gagged me and tied my hand fin my back he raped her he went through her staff he took pictures he knew her name mari prayed he would not kill her and then aftera was done with everything he said si left my door unlocked a i yessles i must have left at unlocked the slightin glass door amri just said that he was sorry and thi wall looked better in his head than wont he did it to me he sat if she went to the police he had put the pictures he had of her on mine when the police arrived at maurie's apartment they did what she 'd expect they processed the crime scene ta crime seemed technician snapped photos of the place iy did not look much and eighteen year olds tidy barebones apartment a sofa a bite a death toppe computer on the floor in the corner the bed was unmade green comforter on the floor a messy shet mrie w s blindfolded interattack her worm mask there was not a real description he wore gloves to avoid finger prints he wore a condum but there was physical evidence the police got finger prints off the slighting glass door just beyond the glass door on the back port it looked some one had brushed off a dusty reeling while climbing over it police collected the bedding hoping for deoney maybe fibers her hearers there was a rape kit in a report noting bruising on both of marie's wrists pluss other bruising in a brasions consistent with sextual activity when police searched the apartment they found the things marie had said the man had used the knife the make shift blindfolding gag the shoelaces used to tie her up with that is when marie realized that all those things were hers to begin with the knife was from her kitchen the shoelaces came from her sneakers out in the living room peggy remembers hearing about the shoelaces and adding them to her list of things that just did not make sense an i just i just that the whole thing with the shoelac es i was lie first of all is a shoelay strong enough to ti somebody is riss with for peggy this behavior if it into a begger picture she had of her foster daughter thet mary was attention seeking loud you ther not caring or not being aware how she was coming off in public at the grocery store writing round in grocery carts with her friends gegdin mearely silly peggy said peggy was often telling mari tone it down be aware of how people see you peggy saw this as part of her job as a parent to teach this to mary part of her and o is to be really really outrageous and to say thingss that make people reactyou this picnic that we wint on there was soden guy that was watching her because she was being outrageously flounty flirty and i tried to have conversation with her about tony at down little bit becaus you are t drywing a lot of but attention to yourself frightnin i told her think cit kitchen in trouble too said peggy marie calling everyone she knew and saying hey i got raped did not seem rit to her she wondered was this rape story one more way to get attention mary meanwhile says sure she was calling every one she knew for what she thought was a good reason i think i did that because i did not you no wantt to happen to anybody else i swane to let people know that there was somebody out ther hurting people it was not the first time i had been raped tas little on i was living with my malm i never told anybody about that stuff that had happened to me when i was a kit i just held it all in did my whole pretending stuff did not happen and on't know if that gui ever got away or and in at harting other people cause i never told anybuty never talk to anybody about it but i tidn't want this time to be that i wanted to be able to try to talk about it get it out somemari was calling around and later that day or maybe it was the next morning peggy made a fond call of her own to shannon the other main adult in marie's life here is peggy i just said i do not know what the hellis going on i i cannot tell she up as lit go my god she is telling me that she got rabed but but i felt i just felt horrible i felt horrible that i did not believe her and i think shannon must a just picked up on that and then she she was peggy or not the only one that does not believe her she is acting very strange she is tell ing everybody about it she is cally everybody that she knows and telling them this dosn't seem what you would do she anan remembers that fanca with peggy too well peggy also did not believe her looking bat we may have fed on each others doubts about what hid happened the day after the ribe she had not held marie move out of her apartment mrice kase manager who was helping her transition from foster cere was also there and she hadn says that whole day she kept noticing these things little things and each one deepened her suspicion marie would not look her in the eye she would not hug her she did not want to talk about the rie instead she was giggling rolling around on the grass being flirty as she an saw it with the case manager for me the thing that se mentad my doubts was she was given a a a visa card to go pick out new sheets and bedding because the police had taken them for evidence we went back to the place where she would goten the original ones and she was furious that she could not by the same sat cause she really liked at i'm thinking why would you want to have the same sheets and bedspred to look at every day woel you would been raped on this bad sat i said why would you want to have those sheets to remind you and she gas cause i liked them i just thought i was such a strange response that was the only time i saw her get mad the whole day de think you were starting to look for things that did not ring true do notknow if i was looking for them they just kept popping up i meanit i flirting with the manager and rolling in the grass and giggaline she had not confronted marie about what she saw as her odd behavior i did now is i told her that i had doubts about her whether or not sis telling the truth and how did she react she would get up sat and she would say i'm not really a liar whi what i lie about this thing here is what i thougt again this is peggy peggy had her own theory for why marie migt be lying about this i thought oqet in my mind marie got herself into trouble she got carried away with some kind of secual encounter and she let somebody take pictures of her and now they are going to get out on the in an end she is trying to back track and maybe i did not trust the police and maybe i did not think they were understanding the nature of my daughter's personality i mean it is more a its strionicsena histrionic personality it seem her her next tactic to try to get my attention one day after ther rate peggy called the lead detective on the case detective jeffrey mason she asked if she could a meet with me in person and i agreed i went to her residence met with her am she was having questions about the story that was being told wether i was a truthful or not she sem yoow sincere she jas trying to pass on information that am and maybe maybe sincereis not the the crect herminology but i mean she was just she expressed m a lot o concern m and and caring for marie but also ad a lot of questions on whether she was reporting the truth or not sergeant mason did not have a lot of experience investigating sexual sault marice was only the second or through case that he would worked on how wouch weit did you give peggy's opinion of mari'e credibility er or of the ad did the tentral truthfulness of what marisent had happened i gave enough wait to steer the investigation twer i ned a talk to mari forer was there anything thatyou were using that is evident spaced to get you to this moment of lanting to talk to her again about her credibility know sergeant mason says there were a few other elements to mari story that it cased him to question her but it was really the call from peggy that changed everything he talks to his partner in three days after the attack detective masom calls marie and they said they needed to say me and i just all the send outjust likeo my in trouble i was my first for i said anything else onto am i in trouble one of the first things she said was am i in trouble and that just well in in the twenty five years am in lonforsemen amn my experience has been people to ask that or usually in trouble they sombos astanger to come into the police station mason and his partner detective jerry ritgarn took marie back to a conference room to talt ner was a very different conversation from the first time police talk to marie now it was an interrogation she says the first thing they did was tell her it spoken to peggy and the spoken to her expoy friend jordan and neither of them believed her about being raged peggy was one thing but georgean was a friend he and marie spoke all the time hetalked about me be getting back together and he would been supportive and sympathetic about the rate marie suddenly had to try and figer out what these detectives meant the police for very closed off on telling me anything that peggy or deordon set thet would not tell me anything that they said ab s he wanted me to tell him and i could not a he was just ya is there any reason why he would not believe you and i said i do not know we talked to jeordan and he says he never doubted marie and he never told the police he did in any case both detective throughout in their reports that marie seemed unsure of her story detective ritgarne wroute that he found marie to be making quote deseptiv statements to include that she thought certain things had happened rather than she was positive this happened ricgarn noted that she did not quote take a stand and demanded that she had been raped detectives made it clear to marie they needed to be convinced years later there was an outside review of the case by a police investigator e sex crime specialist named sergeant grey grinta his report said quote the manner in which she was treated by sergeant mason and detective ritgarn coald only be labelled as bullying and coersive detective ricgarn declined to talk to us sergeant rent has review went on quote if this had not been documented in their reports i woul havebeen skeptical that this actually happened the victim's credibility quote became the focuss of the investigation and all of the strong evidence that pointed to a serious fellony crime was completely ignored here is marie there is the really some guy out there that we need to be looking for it yo just makes us up ther jis start asked me all these questions in this grilling at me and i justri crying i was crying and i was upset i an't understand was going on really o i jus an and still an shock they did not believe me i ad was mad too at it pound my hand on the table and suff that and the only way theyud leave me alone is is i wrote a statement saying that did not happen she did she first wrote quote i dreamed some one broke in and raped me the detectives then insisted that she rerite it and not right that she had dreamed it but that she had lied therre lots of reasons a victim of sex abuse might consciously choose to say something different from what happened shame fear of retribution but marie says that is not what was happening with her she started having moments where she actually could not tell if she ad been rate and i was trying to be really honest a about everything and possibly maybe i had dreamt that stuff that first statement may be that i had dreamt it up and that it maybe did not happen and stuff that and those doubts were coming out when i was talking to them and they justarted disbelieving me even more and then all the sudden i jus started thinking i was did this did this really just happened to me an the soul thing in my mind i was second guessing somebody coming into my house and doing all this t stus is it possible that i just imagine that is why would something that happened to me i ranhow marie describes this not being sure herself that the assault happened by an expert on sex asault trama and how it effects the brain she said that this kind of cognitive separation she called it whill not comment does happene that it is directly related to the sheer shock and assault has on a person for example being awokened by a stranger with the knight and at people who have been sexually abused before marie ire it a much higher risk for this happening ad foster care to that and the risk is greater get the end of that day i was just slight to find it did all did not happen because now i have nobody that believes me is wanted to be over with marie did something familiar to her she has a way to deal with terrible things happening to her that are out of her control which she calls flipping the switch that feeling switch in side just i turned it to not really caring about the emotion ti was turn off that switch i'll have to deal with om rigt now jus i want to get out here what is it look one you kind of decide to flit the witch and stop caring much what is that how does your demeanour change when your speaking to the police officer well i'm not crying any more looking at them when i'm talking to them when i think i was gaggling which ist something i do when i'm nervous i just just pretended that din just really happen ye knone awhen in bathrom after that and claned up and just con acted it was fine both detectives noticed the switch ritgarden wrote quote her visual appearance and body language became remarkably different she appeared less dtressed stopped crying and even laughed a little marie wrote her final statement for the detectives at their insistence quote i made up this story she wrote fo o tor not tri riecls polyon then would now say a woman who claim she was sexually assaulted by a stranger made up the story this nes were yoring one day or after reamit with detectives and ruto statements earlier this week the eighteen oill told e sect as a man had broken into her apartment raped her and then stayed for an extended period of time but upon further questioning the woman admitted the assault did not happen detectives did not know why she made the story up at least ethree other stations and similar stories reporters chased it li i had to hide i i had to where slet sher over my face an snake out of my apartment seert is many howtin mydard the backlash was immediate marie got hate filled my space messages angryphone calls one of marie's best friends from high school put up a web site attacking marie warning people she was a lier et had the police reports with the statement shead written about making up the storie it had her name and her picture for marie it was too much police did not believe her her foster mams did not believe her and it was all over the news it felt the world had turned against her and remember she was eighteen years old trying to figure this out she wanted a lawyer and she hadke suports sistem that could have helped her find one she lived in her own apartment but it was subsidized by a non profit that helped tean aters marie transition out a foster care project latter it was callt they taught life skills how to usocredic cart how to shop for groceries they were there to give her a hand she asked them to help her find a lawyer instead her case manager called the police who told him there was no evidence that a rape had occurred they did not get her a lawyer then they set o calorgan to go to the place stationican to tell them that youre going to tell him thait really did happeneer to be honest when they got to the station detective mason the lead detective in her case was not there he was out that day detective rickgarn grapbed another cop to help out here is marie i told him that i wanted to recanton that it really did happen they should be out there looking for a rapist rickgarn did not believe her the other cop did not know the case and which his following ricgarn's lead marie says one of the detectives told her that if she kept insisting she was raped she might have to take a polygraphtest he told me that ea i tookt a li detect er test and it came back that i was lying that he was going to take me to jail himself using a polograph on a rape victim is a mistake a big enough one that the federal government can withhold money from states if their police departments do it tetesther seen as a deterrent to women coming forward to report sectual assault pluster famously unreliable especially on some one whose tromatized rickgarn's reports as it was actually marie who brought up the polygraph not the cops but what is not in dispute is that once the idea of a polygraph came up detective rickgar used to to threaten marie its detactive police use when theire interrogating some one they suspect in a crime detective rickgarn told marie that if she failed the polygraph he would rect i men she lose her housing assistance n get jail time well that scared ma side in wante do that an salas ocan ever mind arly did not happen ani wante go to jail wthat night the project later managers call te meeting it was just an emercency meeting and he din't tell anybody why in tell everybody got there this is elizabeth another farmer faster cad in the praject later pogram she was there at the meeting along what is nine or sel others musley girls and the program managers sitting in chairs in asecl marie remembers that is the lowis maman of this holardea thoh in time she thought about simeside tan here is elizabeth a marie sit ap an she is crying and she said that she had lied about what had happened to the group to the group a everybody i mean it just felt she was just forced just say that and that it was she i mean there was nothing in in her words or actions that she meant i mean it was more of if defeat is what it sounded just kind of giving up ofn trying to prove herself she just seemed jeff estated and lost actually sounds really confusing from mere perspective were you wondering whyis she being made to say this i mean i i really was cause i did not i did not know her and i i mean it first i did not really know what to believe its just kind of an odd thing to say oh while i made it up i think mabe my own personal experiences kind of came through when i when she said that and and i kind of what kind of personal personal experiences im i've i mean i ah was secually ssaulted and i mean ah being afraid of of saying anything n an ind the not having anybody believe you and then just kind of trying to forget about it i guess trying to re you move on move on ye elizabeth felt for marie she says ther were a couple others who looked they did to but they were in the minority mainly marie says people are angry theyre pretty bad about it one of the girls she was calling me and making a threats at me thought i was a lotter and bysically mental you for making up something that i spoke to one of the meetings angry girls she did not want to be interviewed but she told me she thought marie had lied and it did make her mad but she also said and elizabeth told me this too there ise something obvious and transparent about the premise of the meeting was a message to everyone we are making her tell you this none of you think about doing it if you do you will lose your housing elizabeth described the woman running the meeting as a fuming we reached out to the project later managers but they never replied elizabeth stuck by marie and one aother friend frundwise that was about it elizabeth says marie was avoided the plague ya i mean that is exactly how it was people treated her she was they could not get far enough away fror her a people they were very cruel to her of course the phon calls and nascy sufferancle from medi i mean i i even believe when we would walke through the parking lot or we would go somewhere somebody would say something er calling her or diing just a lot of really horrible staff i mean i even remember reading one of the comments on tha it was it was on the entrinet but i do not remember what exactly page it was or anything that this bitches the reason that nobody believes when women say they get rat well yah i mean there was a lot of that even sheanna who meant the world to marie she told marie that she could not spend the night at her house any more because her husband worried she might make up a story about him and if all that woren't enough about a week later marie received a summons in the mail police were charging her with false reporting the false reporting chargem an the mari's rape case would be officially closed the physical evidence police had gathered at the scene was do stroyed except for a single finger prank card that was left behind everything else the rape ket the beddang the danaslabes they were never even tested in a krimlat never analyzed further evidence that could have been gathered neverlest two months after marie was charged with false reporting sheamon was sitting at home watching the local news with her husband when on came a story about a woman in kirkland another seattle suburb who reported being raped by a stranger who broke in threatened her with the knife you shoo laces to tie her up and who took pictures and threatened to post them on the inner net right away i thought i mwon she id i id ack toly appened she was right cause this is too similar i immediately wen in and called the kirklan police departmened and ask to speek to the le detective on the ripe case and i explained the whole situation about what had happened to marie and that the linwen police did not poliver but it was just too similar and it did just happened i asked them to call the linwoid police then he got back to me and said he did talk to them but they had determined that she had made the whole thing up in the case was closed and that was it and was over i talked to the li detective that she haned spoke to and to another kirklan detective on this case both remember talking to the linwid pede but when they learned the linwoid police did not poleave their victim that was at they did not look any further one detective said she figured the linwoid police knew their case best she trusted their judgment even one thing they both told me they were surprised by was that the lin woid police had gone far as to charge marie with false reporting one detective remembers hanging up the phone thinking oka hope that works out for you guise shaman grew up in a police family she usually figured police knew best not this time i was upset id i thought there should have been more investigation that it was just too similar she amen thought something had to be done she thought mare should get in touch with the kirklin police herself she told marie if it did happened then here is a second chance to go talk to the police about what d happened to you because this just happened to another woman that she would not go and that than mad me doubt igain why would not yhou want again involved to try an prove that she was innocent marie did not wanted talk to anybody else about the rape especially not police agait the very thought terrified her what she wanted more than anything was to put this behind her in march of two thousnan nine seven months after she was raped marie went to court to except o polea deal on her false reporting charge under the deal to get the charge draped she would need to meet certain conditions for a year she go on supervised probation pay five hundred dollars in court costs and she get mental hels counselling not for being raped but forlying about it im not the das bugn was about two police investigations of the same crime the second investigation were the police do a stunningly grat job in a minute when a program continues this marcan lie from o reglass to day's program anatomy of doubt we are the story of two criminal investigations one goes great on goes about as badly as i possibly could we now turned to these successful investigation it happens in a suburb of denver called golden colorado the we detectives in this second case were very experience versistly detective in the first case when we had done one or two other rape cases this was stated earlier but i'll just repeated here the contenplaty's program probably is not right for little kids heere kenarmstrong and robin simian two years later january two thousand eleven detective stacy galbreath got a case a grad student midtwentieth had been sectually assaulted in her home rape dic gom point to coveris tracks her attacker took her sheets with him an made her shower to wash off any deane and when she went to interview the victim detective galbreath sais the victim remembered an unusual number of details about the guy way more than any other rate victim she talked to before the victim had basically chatted him up and he told her things he spoke four different languages and she was able to can erattle off a few of those he travelled a lot he talked about math he told her that he has no problem with finding girl friends or having girl friends im that he jest doesn'n the consentua lastnect the girlfrin relationship the victim had a good guest of his height and wait i knew that he had a distinct mark on his leg a birthmark she told detective galbreat the size and shape of an egg he' dhad a camera with him and she remembered the color and brand of the camera she described it as a pink soney tective galbreth noted that the victim was not crying should not seem upset she was very can a stowic hin her report of this incident you could even say she had more of a flat affact actually was there anything unusual about the very unusual typically i mean i encounter somebody say in the hospital or on a seeing thats im crying upset much more i would say visibly tromatized than than this victim was she talkt about this guy and the horrible my word is horrible things that he did to her for a number of hours and in relation to other victims they probably would have said horrible they would have beand i'm revealing the horrible side of the things that they would don she i remember we were walking outside for some reason i do not know why we were outside and she was talking about an that he was a gentleman a calm mild manerd ndi just reevergis thinking how can any one after this happen call his person a gentleman detective galbreath at this point had worked dozens of rape cases maybe fifty she admitted she did not totally get her victim but that it did not get in the way of her investigating the crime dtective galbreath talked to her husband about the case that night and her husband a police officer in another town remembered a case just it in his department in westminster the detective galbreath contacted westmins repety the next morning to look at their case file details omist identical the lead detective on that case tadn a hinder shot says there was one striking connection in my assault myke victim was the victim of a theft also of a pink sony cyber shot camera that was stolen from her and i'm stacy knew that herd victim was pholdographt using a pink sony cyber shot camera detective hender shot also said there was a third rate in another town near by which made them think their could be a serial offender the thre departments did something that does not always happen with different police departments they started meeting working together each department had come up with some kind of tracety ane associgated with their victims not the definitive kind that can positively idea suspect but not nothing either the samples were tested for similarities and the results showed that they were connected paternally meaning a three dona samples had to be the same guy or men in the same family babout five weeks and to detective stacy gallrests of investigation there is a big meeting federal state and local investigators er there and a fourth local department too and in that meeting some one new to the group a female crime analist stands up she done a search for suspicious vehicles in the vicinity of an attempted ryte detective hndershot says at the very end of the meeting she happens to mention just the group knows i came across this mos e truk that was near this crime seen just the group knos what when stacy here is that stacy's wait a second what did you say i tell him is shaid that is a truck on on our surveillance fidio that was not very relevant untill right now it just all came together one second it was just at detective stacy galbreath had only seen the truck on a fuzzy survellance fidio but this analist had the make model and licen's plate those registered to a guy named markoleary detective hendershot always reluctant to get two ahead of herself remembers thinking well that is a pretty big piece of evidence potentially but they needed now was a deona sample for markoleary to see if it tied him to the crimes ef buy agents stake out mark's house the plan was to wait fr m deleev then they would split up have a few agents follow him while others put up surveillance cameras outside his house while he was gom hen mark leaves his house agent's trailim what they did not know is that marko leary had a brother who lived with him in the same house the guy they were following was not mark at all but is slightly younger similar looking brother when other agents go to the apartment and nock on the door expecting it to be empty ther shocked when mark ansers the agents think quickly say their informing people in the neighbourhood about a burgler even have a flier with a phony suspect foto to showm the conversation ends markos inside meanwhile mark's brother is eating in a diner and when he is done agents wudben to get dona off his glass which brings them closer to their answer but still not all the way there because while done from the brother does link the brothers family line to the crimes does not tell them which brother committed them here is detective galbreath this point werelike crap it could be either one really we need at see the lag of both of em for a birthmark they need to see that birthmark two days later detective galbreath in our team go to mark's house and mark comes to the door and we have weapons out i tell him that we are search wornt for the house and i pat him down to make shure does not have any weapons he is got roe baggy clothes on when he comes out and when i'm pat him down and lifted at both pant legs i saw the mark which you think we sold the work he is he is the guy ne needed to be in hincuffs he was a very surprised he went almost blue she arrested him galbera says it is the most satisfying case she ever worked on ywhen the police searched the house they found sho laces and other bindings lock picking tools a gun the pink sony camera and stowed away in the back of an amplifire underware he collected from his victims also computers hard drives thum drives media cardes which produced hundreds of images fhotoes a victims detective gaubreth went through them all their pictures of women from the towns and colorado and a picture of another i woman with it washington drivers license on her chest that was gagged and bound it was marie thi'm thinking thank god i do not have just an unknown victim here that i may knever know who she is i know who this is let me i'm thinking he probably did that as a form of intimadation to her i know who you are i'll have your name in your addrassan but it helped as actually detective gaubreth contacted the linwid p d hoping to wrap up their case she had the case file facts to her but what she remembers is the cover page of that facts which read false reporting my heart sunk and i was shocked i was ou cas word because i knew thi was wrung after police filed their false reporting charge against marie marco learie went on to rape at least four other women the three women and colorado plus the women he raped in the siatle suburb near marie he poleaded guilty to five or apes and over twenty other falonies he was sentence to over three hundred years in prison and a pose sentencing interview with police he admitted tocking victims over time sometimes breaking an entering an the weeks before an attack to plan and make sure a woman who was living by herself did navadag he also said he knew police departments were not gratat talking to one another he planned his attacks deliberately indifferent cities in march two thousand and eleven two years after maritook a ple deal for following a false police report she got a visit from the head of the linwid pdise criminal investigations division commander steep rider who rivited in no told me who we were they asked if i had somewhore quiet thiy cud you kno talked me en ii just remember it nat noone what i'm going to say as much as i i thought about this moment i dodo not i donnot i say this do not nem the words i use they said they found the gat they have this little piece of evidence they said that they had found a picture and the picture they foul was with my idea and i just broke down they paid me back the five hundred dollars and told me that they rere to get my record explunged dis she just looked stondon we were stondon who was he was hard i did not really say much after that i just i did not really have much to say after they told me that they were just we are sorry where deeply srry about what it happened to you did not mean much to me at all serceant jeffrey mason the lea detective in the case and thought about marices case in years he was sure she would lied we just moved on and then he got a fom call telling him that a serial repist had been arrested in colorado that marie had been reaped by this man that marie had been telling the truth yes i's driv ingto my office it is one of us times that you are not enough for get it was shocking thet oh this has been a the one thing then yow right eriously step back in oh question that u i shoe continued to in at undoing marie requested a personal apology for mason and she got one in the same police station were two and half years before she had been interrogated as a criminal suspect instead of treated as a rape victim marie says he seemed sincere and ashamed he rubbed his head he looked a lost little puppy as how she puts it and then there were she in in in peggy the two adolts who muttered the most temory as at tea nature they are both still in her life to day the sheshenin it was very complicated noin te'd cught in at the same moment knowing that it did actually happened that she was ecually brat and nobody believed her as pesly the people in her life that ad been supporting er and had been taking care of her and tryin to men to her and help her and we did not believe her and i told her that i did not i did not ane is it was sorry over the fon that i wanted to yo would imprison she came up and we went for a walkand it is tok her shoulders an i sa one a look in your eyes and tell you from the bottom of my yart an sorry i do not in to la to believe you an we an support you and she sait that was ogay it may be come again and i was just shork that she who people leav to forgin for thot tas it was such a huge thing went on for long that worst horrible part of this whole thing for me is that i did talk to the police and i regret that of course this is peggy shannon and peggy have thought a lot about what happened and the rollin it they doubted mare because of something normal and human they trusted their intuition about some one they knew really well it is hard not to do that they ha had got feeling that was round but felt utterly tril thet trama works and complicated ways he cannot tell if some one was raped but how they are acting they can be subdued and detached but they can also be hyber and laughing then go back and forth sometimes they tell no one what happened sometimes they tell a lot of people sometimes they are not sure if they a sal thactually happened it this point peggy knows that but even now she cannot shake the feeling she had that letter to call place in the first place obviously we sha had not but on the other hand eithere as all these other other things i mean the police and the way that marie was acting an men i i she on some level needs to take responsibility for that too i'm sorry but that is true and what ou mean she she needs to realize at some point and i think she does now that im he i hate to say this but i'm i mean can now is gon sound really bad i'm blaming the victim bt some one n the way that she was acting was part of the reason why it had the outcome that at did and i am not the only person that did not believe her that also it sounds everyone who as doubting er did not have much information about the way that rapetroma confunction and is this about the way that she acted well it should not be about the way that she acted but im unfortunately the reality is that that did influence an tat at sounds really harsh for me to say that it is not her faults because i think it is a totally a product of what she went through but on the other hand i d i do not know what she does now is that she never expected her feelings to derail an entire place investigation she mad place let that happen detective mason takes full responsibility for what happened command a writer mason's boss head of the priminal investigation's division calls marice' case quote a major feeling on his department things of often he says the detectives should never have given peggy's call the weight they did the lind would police departments own internal review of the case said the same the reports at the call quote calls the detectives to change their focus towards investigating the victim for false reporting no one was disciplined in the case marice sued lyndwood in its police officers and wont upsettling for a hundred an fifty thousand dollars she also sued the project latter managers and the non profit that oversawl project latter cacoon house cacoon hlse issued o statement at the time saying quote our hearts go out to marie in her family we strongly believe that cacoon house in its imployes acted appropriately on behalf of the client the client meaning marie cacoon holse settled the lawsuit reses her conclusion and her advice to any woman who wants to report a sexual sault bring proof i just thank that all of the facts and everything needs to be laid out that they cannot go back and find something did not tell thet i know bat you are not on trial i know nouri i'm orrally sure how to answer that just just seems that is how everybody is really sucks that you have to be on trial after you go though something tramatic that but sus hou it is nhow people think and that is what happened to me the story was put together by canarmstrong robin semian robin is a

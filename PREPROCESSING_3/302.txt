con tokrim's progress we are a nation whose national holidays usually more about getting together with family and friends than actually commemorating the past when laberdy ros around i do not think that many of us review the history of haymarket square or the flight for the ight hour workday even in this crowd i will confess that i was actually well into my twenties before i fully understood that veteran's day and memorial day are actually two separate holidays with separate meanings and not just one holiday that comes around the lot this does not meang that our big national holidays do not contain deep commemorative meaning to us is us i think that the meaning is often personal sirvow was one of our contributing editors she says this year her family broke with all its traditions on thanksgiving i wanched into an entirely new era as a family when i invited my maman dad to come to new york city to have thanksgiving at my house i never expected them to say yes not only had they never been to new york they had never been east of the mississippi nor had they ever visited me i've always had these fanasees about being an enormal family in which the parents come to town and their adol datter spends their intire visit day dreaming of suicide i'm here totiyou thit dreams really do come true i was terrified we wouldn have enough to talk about in the interest of harmony there is a tacit agreement in my family the following subjects are best avoided in any conversation longer than a minute and a half national politics state and local politics any music by any person whew never

how unknown that was how strange and lonesome i read a letter in a display case that says and i never saw my mother again and i think of my grandfather how we just drove off leaving ind behind waving to us in the rear view murror and here we are in new york because here i am in new york because ever since llen's father brought her here every generation moves away from the one before it is curious that we amaricans have a holiday thanksgiving that is all about people who left their homes were a life of their own choosing a life that was different from their parents lves and how to we celebrate it by hanging out with our parents it is as if on the fourth of juli we onoured our in to penens from the british by playin cricket and nibbling on crumpets thanksgiving morning my parents take owen to see the macies parade while amy and i start making dinner let me repeat that my mother leaves while i cook specifically corn bred dressing a dish my mot here has made everythanksgivings ance before i was born to her credit she has not in cuired about my process since she fowned to ass me if she should bring corn meal an her suit case as an oak keep my mo m only uses quite corn meal process by the shawn me compane in mi skogy she does not even consider my corn bread to be corn bread at all because i mak it with yellow corn meal and herasy sugar you do not make corn bread she told me in the same deflated voice she uses to describe my hair you make johnny cake i'm standing at the cutting board chopping sage and it hits me what it meas that she is letting me be in charge of the dressing i am going to die being in charge of the dressing means eura grown up for real and being a grown up for real means yeur getting old and getting old means you are deathanitly finally todally going to die my mother is a grandmother and my sister is a mother and i have decided the dressing well be yellow this year their for we will all be dead some day happy holidays i have invited to my new york friends to join is for dinner and i was a little nervous about how everyone would get along to my delight the meal is smooth and congenial my friends and i talk about the west nile virus killing birds on long island my father count ers with a lovely anicdot about and open copper pit in bu that filled up with can tamineted braing whater and killed to under fifty ges and one day there is nothing eating one dead bird an talking about abunch other dead birds ilin bring cpeople together the next morning rite about the ti own starts to cry while imee tainiously my mother jams the bathroom door and my fathers on his hands and knees crying at open with a penknife a cloud passes over me once or twice a day i am enveloped inside what i to call the impenetrable shield of melancholy this shield it is impenetrable hence the name i cannot speak and while i can feel myself frees up i cannot do anything about it everybody in the family goes through these little spells i just happen to be thes spooky one at this particular moment when people ask me if i'm the black sheep of the family always say that no were all black sheet every few hours there her i look over at my dad nervously crunching his fingers together if yew were at home for thanksgiving he meignoring us and spending all is time an his shop the thing that unites us is that all four of us our home body clostrafoks who prefer to be alone and our suspicious of other people the trait that bines us together as a family preferring to keep to ourselves makes it difficult to be together as a family paradoxically its et these times that i feel closest to them that i understand them best that i love them most it is just surprising we ever breed the next day we do the most typipal thing we could possibly do as a family we split up by the time we all recan bean on saturday eve meg my ragged mother become ambitious with her sight seeing that i can tell she is decided that she is never coming back you gos one to goo to rock

preserved a person's body for week or sell you ship them home from the battlefield but drains of a wor became wide spread and a popularized this kind of funeral the kind of we know to day with the

day taped on our fifth anniversary tour of new york boston chicagoing of sangeles and i have to say we are honored at this point it to have a special birthday greeting for the shel recorded by one of my radio heroes terry gros of fresh aire which incredibly you celebrating it is twenty fifth year on the air of this here it makes us just look little kids up here she recorded o this special message for us from her studio at w wa oy wy in philadelphia five years itsuppose after five years i was still all bright eyed and opto mistic yu kno kid after twenty five years and this crazy public radio gam you see a few thing you see a side of people you sometimes wish a had do not get me started the boos the druts the crazy parties the unras ers five years weave that a lot to learn still i guess yea congratulations whatever begecake egahat three birthday present thi's a hotel in solic city called the anniversary an before this building became an institution devoted to commemorating years of marriage the building was the salt city jail incert your own cheap joke here that de ar the hotel is on an anniversary or a birthday or other big day what we want is fantasy there is a room with a drawbridge and a night in armor design to look sleeping beauty's castle here is a hayloft room and a swiss family robinson tree house and a treasure island sweet that one has a ship's mass and a crow's nest and sails stretching across the room you walk the gang pint to jump into which acusy i brng on this up because i think of the anniversary in as a testament to the difficulty of introspection its as if when a big commemberative day arrives the notion of using that moment to look back take stock try to gain a perspective on who we have been and who we are that notion is inherently difficult and possibly painful that many of us we prefer to leave reality completely looking back though can be what we need more than anything russl banks has this story hereis the ather of numerous bok we ortat havem wes wolkon him it is about ten p m and i'm one of three faceit middle aged guyes crossing south main street and light snow headed for a quick drink at the greeks we have just finished a thirty second degree induction ceremony at the masonic hall and the old capital theater building and need a blow i'm the tall figure in the middle war and low and i guess it is my story i'm telling although you could say it was gale fortu notas story since meeting her that night after half a lifetime is what got me started i'm wearing remnants of mak up from the ceremony in which i petraye and arab printe red lips streaks of black on my face here and there not quite washed off because of no cold cream at the hall the guy's tease me about what a terrific nigger i make that is the way they talk and i try to the fleck their teasing by ignoring it because i'm not as prejudice as they are even though i'm pleased on the less it is an acting job the thirty second degree and not many guys are good at it we are friends and business men colleagus i sal plumming and heating supplies my friends sammy gibson is in real estate and the other rick buckingham is a shevy dealer we enter the greeks a small restaurant and fern bar pass through the dining room into the bar and back regulrs because we are regulars greeting the greek in his help small comforts sammy and rick kik uselessly and one of the waitresses the pretty little blond kid and make a crack or two about the new gay witer whose in the far corner by the kitchen door and cannot hear them wy's guys the greek says to me what is with the greese paint theater group i tell him he is not a mason i think he is orthodox cathlicer something but he knows what we do as we pass one table in particular this elderly lady in the group looks me straight in the eyes which gets my attention because otherwise she is just some old lady then for a split second i think i know her but deside not and keep going she is a large baggy bright eyed woman in her late seventies possibly early eighties old sammy rick and i belly up to the bar orderd drinks the usuals comment on the snow out side and feel safe and contented in each other's company we reflect on our wies and ex wies and our grown kids all elsewhere i peak ar ound the divider at her thin silver blue here dolaps at her throat liver spots on her long flat cheeks wut the hell an old ladi shes with family some kind of celebration two sons they look in their forties with their wies and aboard teen h girl all five of them over wat dull dutiful and contrast to the old woman who despiter age looks smart aware all drastt up in a maroon nit wolfs suit clearly an attractive woman once i drift from sammy and rick asked the greek who is the old lady what is the occasion the old lady's adieth says the greek we should live long right her no i guess not the waitresses in the gay waiter sing happy birthday making a scene but the place is almost empty anyhow from the snow and everybody seems to oit and the old ladye smil serenely i say to sammy and rick i think i know the old gall from some place but cannot rememb beware customer says sammy munching peanuts rick says the same customer and they go on as before probably an old girl friend sammy adds aha i say back a selthixs nixs game on tevy has their attension double over time finally the nix wan in its time to go home guiss is nows piling up we pull on our coats pay the bartender and as we leave the old lady's party is also getting ready to go and when i pass their table she catches my sleeve says my name says it with a question mark warren warren low i say yeh hi and smile but still i do not remember her then she says i'm gale fortunata warren i knew you years ago she says and she smiles fondly and then everything comes back or almost everything do you remember me she ask sure sure i do of course i do gale ha've you been she is it is been a while she nawd still smiling what is that on your face make up yel been doing little theatr did not have any cold cream to get it all off i say lamely she says i'm glad you are still acting and then she introduces me to her family that this is my family howdy i say and start to introduced my friends sammi and rick but they are already at the door sammy says long warren do not do anything i would not do and rick gives a wave and there out it is your birthday gale happy birthday she says why thank you the others are all standing ou pulling on their coats except for gale who still has not let go of my sleeve which she tugs and then says to me sit down a minute warren i have not seen you in what thirty years imagine ma the sun says it is late the sno i draw up a chair next to gale and letting go of the dumb pretences i suddenly find myself struggling to see in her eyes the woman i knew for a few months when i was a kid barely twenty one and she was almost fifty and married and hese too fat geyes were her skinneighteng age sons but i cannot see through the old lady's face to the woman she was then if that woman is gone then is the boy this boy she looks up at one of her sohnson says dicky you go without me warren will give me a ride will not you warren she says turning to me i'm staying at dicky's house up on the heights that is not out of your way is no i'm up on the heights too all in woods just moved into a condo there dicky says fine a little worried he looks he is used to losing arguments with his mother the greek in his cruw star cleaning up while gale and i talk a few minutes more although her eyes are wet and red rimmed she is not teery she is smiling it is as if there are translucent shells over her bright blue eyes even now when i look hard i can glimpse her the way she was slipping around back there ind the shadows she had heavy dark red hair clear white skin smoothest porcelain broad shoulders and she was tall for a woman almost as tall as i was i remember exactly from when she and her husband once took me along with them to a vf w party and she and i danced while he played cards when we knew each other warren i was the age you are now yel i guess that is strange to think about is not it ire you divorced you looked it yeh divorce couple of years now kid's three girls all grown up i'm even a grandpa it was not want your happy marriage is not by a longshot i do not think i want to hear about all that oh ke what do you want t hear about let us have one drank in one short talk for old time's sake then you may drive me to my son's home i say fine and asked the greekis at the register tapping out if it is too late for a nightcab he shrugs why not and gale asked for a sherry and i orged order the usual vadka and tonic the greeks sgoots back to the bar poor as the drinks himself because the bar tender is wiping down the cooler and returns and sets them down before us on a house he says and goes back to counting the night's take it is odd is not it that we never ran into each other before this she says all these years you came up here to conquer and i stayed there inportsmith youven after the boys left frank's job was there yeh well i guess fifty miles is a long way sometimes i as frank i asked realizing as soon as i say it that he was at least ten years older than she and is probably dead by now he died frank died in nineteen eighty too oh jes i'm sorry to hear that i want to ask you something warren i hope you will not mind if i speak personally with you no shoot i take a belt from my drink i never dared to ask you then you would have enbarrassed you thn i thought because you were scared of what we were doing together un sure of yourself yeh no kidding i was what twenty one you were well not scaried but let us say impressive married with kids a sophisticated woman of the world you seem to me and i was is apprentice plumber working on my first job away from home a kid you were more than that warren that is why i took to you easily you were very sensitive i thought's some day you would become a famous actor i wanted to encourage you you did i laugh nervously because i do not know where this conversation is going and take another pull from my drink and say i've done lots of acting over the years all local stuff some of it pretty serious no big deal but i kept it up i do not do much nowadays of course but you did encourage me gale you did and i'm truly grateful for that she sips her sherry with purse lips a bird good she says warren were you a virgin then when you met me oh jes well that is that is quite a question is not it i laugh is that what you have been wondering all these years were you the first woman i ever made love with well that is hagale i do not think anybody's ever asked me that before and here we are thirty years later i'm smiling at her but the air is rushing out of me i just want to now dear you never said it one way or the other we shared a big secret but we never really talked about our own secrets we talked about the theatr and we had our little love affair and then you went on and i stayed with frank and grew old older you ware not old as old as you are now warren yeh but i'm not old well were you what a virgin you do not have to answer if it embarrasses you i hold off a few seconds the waitress and the new kid an the bar tender of all left and only the greek is here perched on u stool in the bar watching night line i could tell her the truth or i could lie or i could beg off the question alltogether it is hard to know what is right finally i say yes i was i was a vergin when i met you it was the first time for me i tell her and she sits back in her chair and looks me full in the face and smiles as if i've just given her the perfect birthday gift the one no one else thought she wanted the the gift she never dared to ask for it is a beautiful smile grateful and proud and seems to go all the way back to the day we first mat she reaches over and places her small crackled hand on mine she says i never knew for ture but whenever i think back on those days and remember how we used to meet in your room i always pretend that for you it was the first time i even pretended it back then when it was happening it meant something to me for a few moments neither of us speaks then i break the spell what you say we shove off they need to closest place up and the snow's coming down hard she agrees and i help her slide into her coat my car is parked only half way down the block but it is a slow walk to it because the side walk is a little slipery and she is very careful when we are in the car and moving north on main street we remain silent for a while and finally i say to her gal thare's something i've wondered all these years myself is there yes but you do not have to tell me if it embarrasses you worn dear you reach a certain age nothing embarrasses you yeh well i guess that is true what is it oh kay i wondered if excep for me you stayed faithful to frank and before me no hesitation she says yes i was faithful to frank before you and after except for my husband you were the only man i loved i do not believe her but i know why she his lied to me this time it is my turn to smile and reach over and place my hand on hers the rest of the way we do not talk except for her giving me directions to her son's house which is a plain brick ranch on a curving side street up by the old armory the porch light is on but the rest of the house is dar it is late i say to her it is i get out and come around and help her from the car and then walk her up the path to the door she gets her key from her purse and unlocks the door and turns around and looks up at me she is not as tall as she used to me i'm very happy that we saw each other to night she says we probably will not see each other again well we can if you want to youare still a very sweet man warrn i'm glad of that i was not wrong about you i do not know what to say i want to kiss her though and i do i lean down put my arms around her and kiss her on the lips very gently then little more and she kisses me back with just enough pressure against me to let me know that she is remembering everything too we whole each other that for a long time then i step away and she turns opens the door and takes one last look back at me shes smiles you still got make up on she says what is the play i forgot to ass oh i say thinking fast because i'm remembering that she is catholic and probably does not think much of the masons othello i say that is nice and you are the moor yes still smiling she gives me a slow pushing wave with her hand as if dismissing me and goes insie driving home is all i can do to keep from crine times come times gone times never returning i say to myself what is here in front of me is all i've got i doside and as i drive my cars through the blowing snow it does not seem much except for the kindness that i've just exchanged with an old lady i concentrate on that

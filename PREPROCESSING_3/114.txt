a new sianan poll initiates total panic among democrats as jobidon flat lines against to bethy of republican candidates former trump eight peter nofvaros convicted of contempt of congress and the w cho issues another covan warning a benchver of this is venchvero sho the bench viro shos sponsor by express it v piani talk abut them every single show why have not you gotten of vpianyet get expressit vpan rit out expressive pians i com fleshmen there is talk now among democrats of pulling the rip cord on jobidon it is time to paris shout out o bidon land the reason of freaking out is because there is a pole last weet from the walzer journal thotse really bad for jobidonat showed that he had approval ratings in the third es it showed that he is rnning dead even with donald trump now there is a second pole out from sianan showing the jobidon is indeed an extremely weak candidate agains sian and is polle youud imagion that generaly be pretty friendly to pressentet bidon this pole certainly is not according to sianend there is no clear leader in a potential ree match receen bidon and for preiden trump whois widely ahead in te geo be primary nearly half of registered voters forty six per cents say literally any republican presidentiral lominy would be a better choice than bidon in twent twenty four meanwhile hypothetical matchrops also suggests that would be no clear leader should bidon face one of the other major go p contenders there is only one that notable exception against governor nikey haley of south carolina former yu and ambassador he would lose forty nine forty three according to the sianan pole all the rest of the republican candidates are running either dead even with bidon or within one point of bidon either up or down since bidon announce his reelection been earlier this year his approvalratings have remain mird in the low forty similar to donald trumpss standing in twenty nineteen well below ronald ragan barokamum an buill clinton at this point ahead of their reelection campaign thet the fact is that virtually every metric four americans about jobidon is bad his joba prual ritingis that thirty nine per cents according to sianan fifty eight per cent say his policies have made economic conditions in the united states worse that is up eight points since last fall seventy per cent of people say that things are going badly in the country fifty one per cent still say that government should be doing more to solve the nation's problems which again thtose fifty one percent of americans to look at our government and see how in truce of our government is and how large it is temich menty wer spenting ithing the government ought to do more to salt my problems honesto god j baging banging your head against a wall repeatedly is not a good strategy for solving problems on biding personally fift eight per cent a voters say they have an unfavorable impression of him fewer than half of americans only forty five per cent say biding cares about people them that is a terrible number for captain empithy over there only thirty three per cent describe him as some one they be proud to have as president of the united states u they really really low number two thirdsof americant say naw not to pere proud of it only twenty eight per cents of americans say the jobidon inspier's confidences only twenty six per cent say that he has stamina and sharpness enough tu survefectively is percident meaning seventy four per cent say he is not he is not virol and sharp enough to be precident those declines are notrof my republicans the are diven by democrats an independance is well seventy three per cents of americans say that are concern the bidon's age might negatively effects is culled his curnent level of physical amental conpidence seventy six per cent are worried that he will not be able tocerve out another term sixty eight per cents say that they are worriedabout his ability to understand the next generations concerns for people younger than sixty five that seventy two per cent old people not he under stants the young people but you would imagine uts what they say because they are older most a democratic voters at this point are hoping for nall turnd of debidon sixty seven per cent of democrats and democraling voters says either very or extremely likely the bine will again be the partyes nominee but that same per centage sixty seven per cent say the party should nominate somebody other then jobidon that is up from fifty four per cent in march now they cannot name who that person should be there jus saying we are very dissatisfied with jobidon we do not him very much now they are been serious propen y insideth democratic party for jobidon strong majorityes of democratic in democraticallyine voters say that bidin cares about people them ut that is at eighty one per cent that shuln't be at eighy one per cent if you are democrat that should be ninety per cent ninety five per cent you'r support bas inside your own party souln't be at eighty per cent seventy five per cent job aproval among democrats that is on very good frea president of your own party only fifty one per cent of democrats say that he inspirers confidents and only forty nine per cent say that he as the staminon sharpnesses are effectively is presidenc a minnority of democrats think that jobdon is up to the job as far as the biggest concern with bidon forty nine per cent say his age his mental acurity seven per cent health semen per cent are also top concerns of my mouth is cract that sixty three per cent of the american public or rm sixty three per cent of democrats who say that dom they are deeply worried about basically his his ability to functiont nother seventy another seme per cent say theire wored betti ability handl the jop seventy per cent of democrats are at least widely concernd about these perticular problems only five per cent say they have no con cerns those are those are really really awful numbers as far as the choic is in a twenty twenty ree mats registered voters are curently splip beteen trumpet bide the have got trump up forty seven forty six over jobidon in these in this pole now through the real decline for bidon there is among mynority voters and this is why i think this pole and a lotipoles it ar cind of a chimera i think that thei'r lot of polsrght now that ye're showing bidon at bad numbers becaus their lot of people are saying that they are wavering about jobidon but i do not believe that those voters are going to stay on t e side lines or flip to donal trumple explainer i mean by that in just one second first is your sulphone industperatnen of replacement the battery is dying every five seconds if to give it plugged into the lall which defeats the

over to purtock get greay coverage and save money along the way already back to this sianen pole the numbers tat are showing bdon at forty six per cent there is some other numbers baked into that cake that i'm not certain are going to maintain up until the election in othewords he is certainly running week he is certainly a very very week reelect candidate i think thar a lot o voters out there who are going to quotinquote come home pure's what i mean bidon right now see's a majority of support among voters of collor at fifty eight per cent heis not going to in voters of color at fifty a per cen he is going when voters of color at seveny per cent the reason i say that is because if you look at the last election cycle un twenty twenty he won ninety two per cent of the black vot he lost thirty eight per cent of th his vanic vote he he won the his vanic vote fifty nine per cent of his panic vote he one seventy two per cent of the ation vote in t e last election cycle none of the subgrups are coming in at fifty ight per center below two assume that all of them are going to comin collectively at fifty eight per cent i find that very very doull to believe no democrat has lost more than about thirty per cent of my nority vote for probably two generations the notion that this is goin to be the time when th numbers to shift dramatically in favor of donald trum i've a hard time believing that that is the caivvhn ther a lot people ar sang nat that atarontoll pollstrm e vote for bitin son at him very much but if force to the joris i think there can be a lot of voters who quotquote come home which is again why i think that counts er in tuitively one of the things that is that is strengthening bidon is donal trumps candidacy man it is pretty obvious that that jobidon cannot turn out voters for himself nobody chobinor caresabout tobiding jobiding literally ran a campaign as a corpse last time he isgoing to do the same time this this time except he is an older corps in a weel am out he is going a go from his face hole and then thereg a reel in back down ofthe basemen in delaware an that is con be is entire campaigns i ckan is batetrump he is not cin do it monoe mono combat woith trump not nothing heis going to sit on the sidelines and wait for donal trump to be the centr of a tention it' gon ebe exact cem campaign as last time now do you think that fully ten to twelve per cent of my norty voters are going to shift t over from jobidon to donal trump i've a very hard time believing those dafts he still sees a majority support among college grabuets at fifty six per cent fifty five per cent among voters younger than thirty five fifty three per cent of women donald trump has majority supportin the sian an pole among white americans men fifty three per cent voters with out a college to gree fifty three per cent independent voters are still breaking and bidon's favorte forty seven to thirty eight to suberban woman fifty one to forty four again i'm having a hard time seeing the path to victory in those numbers because it seems s to me that if i ndependent voters are splitting forty seven to thirty eight and all the democrats are voting against trump andall the republicans are voting for trump i i do not know how trump is able to pull out of victory under those circumstances again trump's high water mark is this pull at forty seven per cent could he winan election with forty seven persent him an he did in swo thousand sixteen but it was the tightest rumthing ever men he literally he lost the popular vod and he was able to win the votes in precisely the right places is that history going to repeat itself in the selection cycle ironically again jobidon's bad poll numbers are actually helping him in sort of a practical cents they are elevating donald trumpin the republican primary because it is making trump seem very electable against bidon sa lot of republican voters who love trump on a personal level ther'e lik on't have to choose between winning and votning for the guylike in the primary look at th boles that is totally understandable i get it in make sens riminlight trump in this pole is actually running the same as ronisantis the sansis is is running had to had against bidin at forty seven forty seven basically of the same numbers if you are a a trump faned hihd love the guide and somebody says tou will is not electable the're no look at thespone ther can o go well i mean who is he is running the same as all the other re publicans he basically runs dfallt re publican i cant i have my cakan eeto to a vote for the guyjuy lovan is entertaining and did good things for me last time around and is a giant middle finger it is the left and he can win just as easily as any other republican when i'm telling yous i do not think that that is actually true but i certainly understand the date of t it is being presented on the other side and that is actully helping bidon because if you believe as i do that jobidon's large advantage and voter turn out comes solely as a result of people hating donal trump well that is good for bidon the other thng thits good for bidon about these bad pole numbers is that one of the tings that realy hurt hillery in twenty sixteen against trump the first time one of thngs that really hurt her was an assumption by literally every one that shos can walkway at the election that was the basetineis sumption of virtually everyone you remember tha the famous new york time's needle that showed the beginning of the ight a ninety nine per cent publability that hillery clint was can be president and by the end of the night of course on al trump was president yourmember this because every one thought hillery was going to win no one shut up to vote for her all these voters in wisconsin pennsylvania michigan all these voters wellike hiller isk in a win anyway and it is it is cold outside and i do not or that monch i'm sken a stay home and donal trmp was able to sneak by my favorite staff from the twenty sixteen election that that proves this out is that in wisconsin which donald trump one by a fair ly decent margin in wisconsin donald trump in twenty sixteen one fewer absolute votes than mit romney did in twenty twelve but men romy lost the state because borako bama got the vote out for his side an hillery clinton lost the state in which in which yhofs runngaginst to persent got fewer votes tham it romney did in wis consen it it w the the twenty sixteen was election was reflection of two things people din hiller clin and they thought for shirshos can win well the first is still truter people do not jobidon but they are certainly not sure that he is going to win and that means that if you aren' un certain and sike get your ass out of the chair on voter day and and i go do the thing the voter turn out is not on to be as lows at what is on can to be as high as it was last time because last time was in saying with all the mailand ballading and all of the hubob and the bealemriets in and the covi n everything but is i can be as low as it was in twenty sixteen alot of these places either frm democrats nate what is this utthi this is giving reason for democrats to panic bytho ashould as shul give you the actual stafts here with regard to how how bidon runs gans various of the republicans trump is u is running as we say forty seven fort six overbiden in this vol which is margin of arr effectivelyther tide they are forty he is a forty seme per cent to forty some perscent against ronosantis he is down two to my pents forty six to forty four he is down two to tim scott forty six to forty four he is up one against the vake romasuamy forty six to forty five and he is esuue down two to criss christy forty four to forty two christy over bidon nicky hayleyis dealing with a clearlead she has a forty nine to forty threelad n a hypothetical match up between the two accordig to seanen tht difference is driven at leastin part by broughter support for hayley than for othe republicans among white voters with college degrees which which makes him censes right all these other candidates a running for the exacts him crab that trump got nicky hayley does have some sor white coll or appeal than many of these other candidates do not the democratic coalition is white college educated voters and mynorities that is that is their coalition and the republican coalition is white non college educated voters and a bevy of s crisor parshal parshal legions from various mynorty groups that is higher than it has been under prior republican candidates if if he can carve away some the white college educate a group or some of the women or some the independent voters republicans have a good shot ad victory right now republicans are saying he are more deeply driven to vote in twenty twenty four seventy one per cents they e are extremely motivated democratic line vote or sixty one per cents shay the are extremely motivated and this is again why i think that this pole is con vachimara i do not think that gap is going to exist on electionday i then when he get to elections day after month and months and months of demotrump is on trial donal trump is a fatios donald trump is going to destroy the world democratic vototurn out in twenty eightteen in twenty twenty in twenty twenty one in twenty twenty two has been very very good democratic votiturn out has not lagged in any elections since donald trump has been on the ballat or in the shado wabeen on the ballat do i think that a lot of democratic voters are jus goingto get bord en stay home i i have serios tots put again these poles conter in tutively may be actually helping bie not a practical level democrats however are panics andwi get t that democratic panic in just one moment first i've been on the road obviously thet means not as much sleep as i need now i am home to night i cannot wait to get on my helic sleep mattress and go to sleep for hours and hours and hours it is the thing i most need in life my helic sleep mattress makes my life possible head on over to heliks right now the have a brannuwhi and collectioncal telixiley he liks as harness years of

something to last long with hulics better sleep starts right now of gate democrats at look at this pole and theyare freeking out you can see the members the media or basically begging the democratic party please run somebody else now again bizarly we now have agreement betwen the two parties on one funamental principle there is noway can lose to that that is the fun mental principle repellgans no way we lose to this dottering old jerriatric more on no way we oose tothis corrupto crat no way an democrat tor loking it down from it no way we lose to a guy who is under four separate invitements before the election and a goit who participatein the events from the last election to note to january six and g who cant whose whose main campaign activeity involves going on trueh social an saying stuff in raising hen he for his legal fun no way we could lose to that seve both parties in agreement mean style the the preditor mem of the gripping fists saying noway we lose to that git the promise one side is going to be wrong right someone is going to lose the election someones gettin have to lose the election you'e assume or maybe this is sarch no accent and we will just keep runningthe sim election over anover nover democrats are are actually panicing first which is interesting and again i think indicative of the fact that when we say the democratic voter turn out is gin to be lower i iam not sore because if they are panicang that means the actually wont to win the election here is ern burnett with tha katy porter the representative with whiteboard and a she she says should bide nd be re place on the ballet with this can obrutal polling does the democratieparty meed to start seriously looking at some one else president by has done a terrific job on te economy and i thik this is a matter of jus people wanting to teell sort of dream up what they could imagine for different kinds of candidates that this plate but the truth is jobidn has a terrific story to tell o the economy but do you really think ultimately congress on ten that if people tost saw the economy in differently they would not care about all these other issues that they they seem to have strong a put pans on the stamina the age i whether they are proud to have in this president all of those a frankly pretty damning nonverse well i somebody whos run three tough races i have read a lot of poles an my day and there is always cross signals a men i think that some of what you see here i ting at the end of the day you look at the biding a ability to win independent voters particularly over trump o you i think this is shaping up with some of the exact same demographics going the support president bidi as thet last time an i think you hear if anything even stronger con sons about president trump i mean again y you se here just going trump that is her only defence and as you will see that' the defence mechanism forbidon always in frveris going to be trump jak tapper was asking similar questions to jobidons campan cochair cedri richmon saying essentially these are really bad poll numbers what yu can do about it do you not acknowledge that the perception of his frailty perceive frailty is huring his campagn is hurting his real action chances now about the president's age you'r going to voters will see his vigor voters well see his accomplishments if you just look at a his scajeris traveling around the world over the next forn a half days to continue to show american leadership on the world stage when they can par president bidens travel to that of a republicans even republicans that af running for president he is travelling almost thirty per cent more than there wow he is it ther defence is the jobidon goes in cars sometimes and on plans again pretty we dealisabeth warrn was also out trying to defend jobidon yet you can see how weak the defences are and as we will see the real defence is that we hate donal trump as always has the only defense the democrats hav for jobine's presidency why do you thanke there having such a hard time getting or mestee trou oya coony why ye thinks many democrats wor party the teest tolhat i'ls be their standard barres shere ye knowt what i i cannot do poles i'm not good at this but i can tell you this presdents lean a great cho he can and how do i know that i just look an what he has delivered i look at thirty five dollars l and wal and well sen to hit t two thousand dollar cap on what seniors ay poupocket medical care i look at tunkes and the number of people rechos out wen to get blad for thirty five dollars here an fifty dollars ouver there i look at the fact that he is pass the biggest clim at package in tot history of the world and everybody is wait i'mspost of a fact i cause you spend money on windmills really in in inflationary cycle and and i'm paing a lot of money for gas everytime i go to pill up and you you are telling me he spent the lot of money on windmills wike that is that that is your case i i when elizabeth warrn who as a harvard law professic i do not know what pulls ar what is a pole how do i read them i know elizabeth warrn ie met elizabeth warrn in fact choose one of the people who woas a recruiter a at the harvard law party i wen to when they wre when theywr doing groupmin unless anchels and om elizabeth warn is marn a freepole this this this is absolute nonsense but again the final democratic pitch is goin to have nothing to doito jobidins can to have to be entirely to do with donald trump which is why if that is their plan if their plan is we run against tonald trump then the epoor pulling forbidon actually creates kind of a bazar sweet spot in the eye of this hurricane for him ll get to that momentarily its very weird first have your invested in a nice jack choos made a

exclusionsupply see sight for details o gat again the democrats case it is always and fraverign to come down to we hate donaltrum that is all it is and comala hrs makes this clear right an't shoe shoes asked this question yesterday why what makes you think tere nin when the selection set well democracy is its sticknout those of us who live in the national world oure deeply annoyed by this kind of language tthe reason i say this is because democracy is always at stake mean what when we talk about what democrats have done using executive orders for example to cause ocea to try to force eighty million americans to take a acceing the dey dof wont a day or when jobidon decides to relieve student loans simply what the wave of his pen or when members of the democratic party try to under mine the credibility of the supreme court wor when they refuse to acknowledge elections in georgeo for example stacsy abrams when all that happens that apparentlies good solid governments when republicans do any of the above then that of course is i is a threat to democracy but the reality is that are democratic institutions are pretty durable and hey've prove themselves pretty durable the is whi the this sort of language annoys m i i talk obu yester an the sho when people say this is the last selection they' line to you i know their ling you becase he're not out in the woods training with he militia right now that is how i know people do if they think a war is coming they start preparing for a war you now they do not do sit by their computers in an air condition t office in tweet about it that typically not what they do but again this is the campaign stratetye the campaign strateties can be jo biden in front of a blood red in a pen ance hall talking about how fashism is is about to break a wave upon the contry of donal trump we are to be reelected to the presidency this their entire campagn here is comelharris making that bazar case you were dustness that e some of the republican critics thats om of you and the present and when you look at current pollane ronder for republican nomination is the former president the forty fit president we elects we we wll bala there 's e tomecit tay and the american poplo there is too much at stake is coed for if my opponent winds fahism il rain and many americans by it but if they do the only reason they bidies beause the media are wiars on routine basis and also because wearganispend the next year talking about donal trump and genuousex and if it isittle entire elections about donal trumpin januor six and not about trobidons crapic policies that does give thet democrats leg up if youren'n independenvoter an all you hear day in an day out from the media is thrats democracy donal trumpson court today because the threats democracy donal trumps on court today beas the thrats democracy january six threats democrity if that is all you hear from now to electiondic an've donal trumps on truth social tweetig about that stuff all day well i mean that is not going to be a good pathway to election wat would be a good pathway to election for any republican worth is solvt is jobitdiness a terrible present he is really bat tho jobicaus what the vast majority of americans agree with that and by the way tobidin's getting worse according t the losantialist tinds the bidin administration is now considering forcing some migran families to enter the country without authorization to remain near the border in texas while awaiting asylum screenig effectively liviting their ability to travel within the united states administration officials ave ben considering that idea as a way to stem recent increases and the number of migran families crossing the southern border which reportedly reached an all time high last month they are calling it the remain in texas pland which is it is clearly motivated by an attempt to stop all these people f loing to new york and chicago and blue on claves where all the mayors are geting increasingly pistoff soi love this basically jobidon has an open bor policy that is being greenlet by federal judges by the way because taxas tried to build a barrier in the middle of the reo ground to prevent illegal migrans from crossing border and you us judge ordered texas to move those buies from the middle of the reo ground this is twe an embankment on the texaside ofthe riverwich of course makes at a lot easier for people to illegally enter the country the bite administration is facilitating the entry of people into te country legally and then they are saying and by the wy you haveto kep them in texas they cannot go to any blue areas we hat you have tokeep them right theire in texas you have to suffer mean this is just youren't o about malicious governants malicious and nasty governments that would be the peak of it and by the wy it is clearly response to democrats are becoming increasingly agitated about the fact they are perfectly happy with open border salongas there hafto pay the cost of it just evorybody all thse rich white democrats ore in favor of dfun the police because they live in protected areas of the united states living gaty communities and favor of deefun the police it is just that allthe people in blue cities and the i love open borders this a sanctuary city please do not come here yeydo not want a at you sanctuary please do not come here my favorite side by side of the day yesterday eric adams is a flash back two thousand twenty one eric adams talking about the magic of illegal migrants when youve think about it tho goo days us spent a werg always sentral inplois a sustanstrog number of them or undocumenta ben wor deliverin otwes a beworth stockin our store they were il in the streets keeping all city run and we ave thixpan a in wa sley tere to make sur every one has help tere woen it to make sure we have proper translation services in all schools they keep our or city running says ericadams circut twenty twenty one u fast ford two years hers eric atams yesterday waited i no sumport on this nasto ne criss a wer receive in no suppoit and let me tell you something new york is never in my line have a head a problem that i did not see in indi to i d'n' see indntos i don'l see indts this is you we will destroy new york ci guys that is that well this this issuald the migran crisis will distri thought that this was oamazing place from idany nothing more fun than watching left twing policies actually have there predictable consequences then watching the same people who advocated for those policies realize how bad those policies actually were now meanwhile the economy continues to slow i know that they are telling you that is not the case again if you operate the business tere yard this every staff that is coming right now is a staff that is rooted in consumer spending consumer spending is not what drives economic growth what drives economic growth is people producing new products new inovations things that are cheaper and easier things that are better and more efficients you knowhen that happens when business is in vast you mot business are not doing right now becaus they are scare where the economyes going investing money is tightening up it is not as loose people are being a lot more maticulus about where they put their money and by the ay that is going to have downstrom iffacts walmart according toe walster journal is now paying some new store workers less than it would have even three months ago a sign that employers are seeking to cout labor cosses the once hot market for hourly staff cools the country's largest private employer changed its wage structure for hourly workers mid july according to documents reviewed by the walster journal and walmart employs under the new structure most new hirs will earn the lowest possible hourly wage afore that stor in the past some new hiers such as those who collect itoms fr onlane ors wheld made slightly more than the other new staff members such as cashiers the wage structure change came after walmart and other large employers have for years steadily rased wages n ato benefits to attract workers in a tight labor market the market is starting to flat n out people are not kin to pay as much but those price there still inflated which means that the price igon a start then at have there can have to come down when that happens people gon to start losing jobs a the the gravity still applies here meanwhile health and turns costs ire taking the biggest jumps in years according to the walster journal health an turns cost our climing at the steepest rating years with some projecting the biggest increase in more than a deckade wel wallup business is and their workers in twenty twenty four costs for employer covers aue expected surge around six point five per cents for twenty twenty four he is aure bad economic numbers and they are becaue of jo bidon and his in flationary policies what would you rather run an election on that stuff wor would you rather runan election on whether donald trump is mean and nasty or weather he is the greatest patriot whoever live the more your talking about trump theless our talking about bidon it is a simple it is a simple matter of mutually exclusive time use you cannot talk about both trump and by there are not the timein a campaign heu the people are focust on one candidate or there focust on the other candidate which again brings up the fact that the legal troubles unfair as they are that democrats are now leadling on top of donal trup there des ins have n effect and they will havean effect just because they are bat justcause the're unfair does not mean thay will not have an effect that absolutelyill have an effect hus people are talkingabout the suff as they will then you knon the're not talking about jobine being awful at his job is it t taken incredibly dum example now peter nevaro who is a former white house official he was found guilty of contempt of congress charges for refusing to cooperat with congressional investigation into the january sixth two thousn'd whenty one attack on tyou us capital there is a short trial for nevarro he is the second trump ade to face contempt of congress charges after steve band an bandn was convicted ons who couns hom sentene to four months behind bars he is been free penning appeal nevarro has vowed to appeal the verdict you as de strict judge i mean mata found that nevaro did not hav anough eveidence to show that tum trump had invoked executive privilege thatas the claim that ark holdser made ar colder you remember was the turning general for brock abot mac he also was found in contempt of congress for not shrowing up and testifying in font of congress he was not actually formally charge tbecause he claimed executive privilege and barocchamo ma backed him trump has not really made a statement about with the navarro was utilizing executive privilege and the evidence is not there or the jodgus well if's not executive privilege then you have to show up and testify but here is up peter nevaro explaining i said from the beginning this is going the suprim cordi said from the beginning i am willing to go to prison to settle this issue i'm willing to do that but i'lso know that the likelihood of me going to prison is relatively small because we are right on this issue ckawup he i think he actually is right on the sissure meaning that he has a couple of defences one is executive privilege because he was working for trump and therefore whatever he said to trump was not he is not compelled to talk about that in front of congress executive privilege applies and and too even if he thought executive privilege aplied it may be enough because you hav to show beyond a reasonable doubt thate i was not accident invertence or mistake that he did not show up for the for the ceering in congress nowlic he wroth wrong get on is calender butlif he thought he actually had a rational reason for not thowing up in that he thought executive privilege have ben invoke but he is that the story that anymas can be telling that hav the entime the legal in and oute first all if you

president trump is a preparing for his legal travails he suggested the other day thin the classified document's trowle he is doctrig an a testify in his own trial which would be the worst legal strategy almost literally ever it would be that is a terrible terrible political stragy her's presiden ent trum talking abat hou absolutlese gomn to take the tand spoiller is ing i tagthe sand e tho you you have to go to trial will you testifying your own defense oh yet that telet u ol te ta hiand i i wu te that i look fora you tat yu lit you i yo that orte ak i o re e ye netr in to do ye came out at everye a o a e o up an did it ye dot to be with a politic a report pu ot by e i yey i do not know that has to do than yn thing actually but i'm that is tha is a very bad political strategy but here is the thing wlet say he does less he takes the tand waithing the new cycle is gin to be about that week that month that year what ything is going to be about meanwhile that classfits document's case i continiung maintain his the strong his legal case against president trump because he did the criming on tape which is always first rule of criming do not do anontape according to sean end marloglikes ye worker ouscul to veris has now struck a co operation agreement with the special council's office in that federal case the veri struck the case with prosures after being friend with prosecution he is the person referred to in the filing and superseeding indactment is trump employe number four he is agreed to testifight in the classified document's case ind exchange will nopy prosecuted he has not been charge with any crime at this point the filing marks the first public acknowledgement that special council jacksmith has wone the o operation of key witness s as part of the prosecution of trump long time valat walt nouta and marloll property manager calos to oliviera proscures of argue that woodward who now r presents nowti could face confoct of interests if he is representing trumpetd also facing walt nowta yagain this is going to be tha the story of the campaign unless donal trump is a very meticulous campaigner and that has not been his history in the past meanwhile dol trump is sounding offon who he 'd most likely to make the answer is o magan markel the reas i bring up ninety million people watch that ninety million people and the only thing i think that might draw an audience to the even approaches that would be if you were to sit own with the docers of susex megan markll and prince herry theyn him much would you do that for the raitings i to a you go w te cueen i te ca e ely te qeen ou e cedible woman ninety five you to sop i tit thik it er not a ge te yoa ou gon on wi a youa a but i didt now li ombody i wut they would not be the only one but i mean that would get raitings would not it i you want o et et u e atet a e a o yo a o o i let e to do e i wuld oi that he heres the thing down trump is much more entertaining than every other person in the race that is his draw it is also it is his it is his blessing his cur spider man i the the fact that town from is much more magnetics much more carismatic much more interesting than every other person tharice means yoeu'e nin me talking about him if you'r talking about him you are thinking about him if youthing about him and talking about him you now you are not thinkin 're talking about the dead guy in the corner of the president that is that is in that is anenotchel the problem in the selection cycle i can meanwhile the w acho is now sounding yet another major alarm over colvid wo o here we go get ready according to the express world helth organization has warn of concerning trens for covenineteen a had of winter as a dangerous new strain runs rampans across the northern hemisphere here is the w tro chief tetus at honum get brasis explaining that i it is time to i get prepared for lockdown s again the cisidwas beternas is is shos o tha choovit is h to st an that we'ld con t to tools scientude now ckat gregg well meanwhile they are lot of schools resumably led by all the seasurgunians that are trying to mask up again according to the express schools across america a rein stating mask mandates for kids in response to the surging cases again i will remind you that covit as a general rule the original strain which killed a ton of people who are seven years old killed almost no one in the youngest age group kinteroverse junior hig and alabama has asked all students staff in visitors to tart whereing face masks in glassrooms despite the absolute failure according to all data of mask mandates to actually effectuate a a reduction in spread of disease alabamas talidaga city school district which is home more than one thousand seven hundredstudents has also urge children and staff to whear masks they said they are encouragebut ot required mariland elimentary school became embroiled in contversy this week after they said the studens must a dawn and en ninety five masks for ten days despite justy smattering of cases your c celt officials are ramping up their messagin around masks as well fori g ho new mask wars again which is just delightful meanwhile creen chomp here i shos asked about the c d c and o apparently they are going to ignore their own masking advice which is exciting stuff we are 'n indifferent place than we were two r three years ago but emen bu no into be refinding t than d ofait and yeaturning about schools thinty t they are the experts there the science o to come to to come forward with their guidline and it is important that we allow them to do ther work oh i yap gregt s i guess we will be talk mat mask mandates in school again literally the least useful intervention of pretty much all time ere goning do that again in the name of tuscience now would not that be a good thing fur the republicans to talk about when that be a good thing for them to run against it might be i ayn't do that meanwhile controversy continues to suirrel around this in sane gambit by the democratic party to basically got the american military sthat we an pay for abortion their basic idea is that you must allow the american military to pay for people to travel to other states for abortions or we just wont even put up for a vode leaders of the military and then well lame re publicans for not green lighting that that is the goll the crated crapsand which the crapsand whichis all of our military appointments pluss abortion and repoblicans lly ha out this you put those gueyes up individually and we will say yest to them individually and we will not say yes to the abortion stuff and demicratsy why ae you gutting the american military tommy tubbervill the senator from alabama hea he is pointing out how ridiculous this is he he says on switter senator shumer culd put these nominations on the floor when ever hy wants to which of course is exactly right it is not stopping demicrats from ling about it elizabeth warrn who i mean lust be real t when we talk about people who are deeply concern about america's military readiness elizabeth warn does not list in the top hundred here is h lis with warrent explaining that tommy tubberville is undermining american national security i'm sure you spak to somthen yoar republican counterparts on the senate your frands but sone of them how can they allow the sky to continue with tis what is going on a s to lat start with the first part and that is what senator topervillas doing is undermining our national security this is what tetaryo defens tes this is what all of the defense exirt say and thisis in fact i sure you have heard the story about the chinese diplamat who racetly wit laughing and making fon it is american calerpart becas we cant even ca our military promotions in long yet they care deeply about the military promotions we will know what they care about is making you pay for other people's abortions that is o they really car about and violation abasically common sense rules that senate has abided by for decades rigt that federal funding should not go toward abortion tdoes mean the federal goverment has not fun to planparno they have but then it were not spost to directly pay for abortions until we are now doing meanwhile the rest of the republican candidates are still out there it r tungue lout about trump ecas trump is far and away the leader front runner in the field what the poles are showing right now is some movement on behalf of nicky haily in particular states particularly in iowa you seeings to movement for nicky haly nationally trump is still fareign away the leader he is eas ahad aby thirty four points in layto see an an pole that is impole showing the bidon is very week is showing trumpet fifty two to sant at eighteen nobody elseen double digents for all the incoming that te santis has taken he is still the number two candidate in this race by a fairly long shot even in iowa the latest poles are still showing that de santis is fareign away number two it is got trump at forty two and de santis an nineteen that is going to lates t anbisynews to moin registerpole in new hampshire it is basically trump and then a scrum the latest emerson pole has trump at forty nine and then has tosantis at eight christy at nine scott at six romaswuamy at three you have got a trafolgar group pole which got t tick with grain of salt with trumpet fifty tsants tat eleven christy at nine scot at eight ro masuammy at ten sugjs to bunch people hor s are congregated there the santis still remains the most durable second place candidate despite all the incoming that he is been taking and despite facts he has not really had a lot of cand a break ciny moments in his campaign far yesterday some more on in the crowd suggested that he was responsible for a a mass killing of black people in jackson bill and i and this is where this anis really is the bast the sancis really is quite gled at fighting back against his smeer i hears what sounded or the sing yov lad weapons to fill the stret into immature heteful people an have cause the deaths of the people were murned a couple weeks ago first of all i did not allow anything with that wel listen exceuse me i'm not going to let you accuse me of committing criminal activity i i any a i with mayour ait he should have been he should have en rule intelligible but they ddnt involuntarily commit him an they were no no i do not know know there is not true there is something about o true you doncome here n in in lame me for some madman that is not appropriate and i'm not going to accept it ga it issa then that is what thie cances get out more of this more of thes dissansis would probably help him in the rasic a time for some things i and then some things that i hate sell things that that i to day jorogan of course has been good on this issue for a while now because gerogan operates in a very masculine world where men fight each other in a cage and that you's talking with bilmar recently about called genera affirming carring he went directly after it hit is a terrifying that there that they are calling it gender affermant care when it is really childhood mutilation before you have the ability to figure out what permanent means you are seven years old you cannot get your face tatu thou you cannot go to war you cannot get married there is reasons for all that stuff you are too young and this idea that you should be able to make alife changing choices hormon blockers run which are a not reversible no mater what the they say they say it is reverse will know the changes happened to your body during puberty and if you stop those changes that change is you cannot reverse that you are gong to have a micropenus your youre taking astrogen while your bodies developing your blocking at tostostron if you are doing all that stuff it is going to have an effect on your body nough you are happy without effecting you do not care o ke but how many people are and how many people young and how many d transitioners are there who have horrible stories and and you are a monster in a big it if you ven bring that up he is right obviously the fact that ou one of the great ironees about this whole demage and bilmar obviously on the retat is tomate tim is it forty years ago denispry was on bill marshal and you will recalled then is prager literally sad thereare people who say the men menstrura it an bilmar and his entiring usponal laughed at that us thos four years ago and now bilmar and jorogan are having to say the samething with dennis was saying it is amazing how fast the the culture change is and moves in time with what the radical left wants e time for a couple of things that i hate hillery clinton has a new job is exciting she apparently is teaching a corse at columbia university which makes perfect sens since she was a terrible secretary state of failed presidential candidate and a ranascam foundation that that makes that makes perfect sens again the places where retired democrats goed pasture they they go to pasture in academia and on amasen me see that' that is where they go accorning to the ner times who is twenty minute since the first class of thi smester when a professor af forein policy columbia university halted lectur i see the phones an i se the camer se said this is not a tailor swift concert to avoid further destruption the professor carronat yarkey milo offered students a five minute reprieve it could raise their phones to photograph the colebrity cot teacher standing on

secretary of state you a senator and firs laty was setting up her officewhich overlooks the campas from the fourteenth floor of columbia's international affairs building studying her binders of outlines and nots i feel good she said but jittery as is the case with most enterprises embarked upon by missus clinton who is long been a sort of national roarshock task beloved by many lod by many others her newgig carries greater meaning than simply a return to her academic roots the new job at columbia may allow missus clinten to reemerge publicly as a foreign policy expert after years of being depicted in the press and the publics imagination as the presidential candidate vanquished bi donald j trump i'm yes she is gen oposes a forign policy expert she presided her frm the worst foreign policy decisions in american history under barokobama but not a particular shock they are now establishing a new institute of global politics over at columbia what is the inogro group while it

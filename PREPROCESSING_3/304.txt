direction at some point and can a wondering where our parents were oh in the morning when we got ready to go to the beach i would uni the tent and yelling to the tent by mom by m dad going to the bea seeu later and hope that we be over herd doing this and my brothers con a picked up on thet one of them when he would see a man in the car driving out the camp ground he would if he was alone he would yell after a by dad do not forget the popical as is t bekind the car were going to get as some groceries we were pretty obsess with groceries a on a wek later my mom came back we would called her and

fact fake indians has been a part of camping in america since organized camping began a century ago one of the cofounders of the boy scouts of america ran a camp an nineteen o one in which he organized boys into a make belief tribe called the sinaways the red man is the apostle of outer life he rote batan his example in precept or what young american meets to day above any other ethical teaching indianis an a real connection to nature an appreciation for all that was being lost with industrialization urbanization just one generation after costor's last stand fake indianmis wit an integral part of the early boy scouts and girl scouts organizations in this country by nineteen ten camps with names campmen a walwal camp miromichi camp aocanoket which bringing up everywhere from mittle class and upperclast children it is still a big part of camping all across america and after a year without powwall camp lake in the woods brought the powile back most of the simply has to do i tradition the special songs and ceremonies ore a part of many american camps and it is not just because they are fon i camp direct dor in wis constant told us as we were putting together to day's program i financially you cannot run a camp without lots of repeat customers these traditions bring kids back year after year you have the consinging constantly about the royalty to their cabin mades in the camp ou let them know about all the extra rihts and privileges and honors of the gon togat if they return as older campers it is part of making the business run and in addition it is part of what makes camp thrilling it is using all of the stage craft wat all the world's relegeons always used the ceremonies the chanting the repeated words the official honors and offices but for an entirely secular purpose to thrill children to make them feel part of something big and special i i it i really impartn parti camp i mean i is in thake i the chason licaus it is what it is gon a hap en and you you can make chottane that its i ye i i come back for the tisans i expect everything a a the way was last tercast teres an i come back i geve everything chans i do not thinkg i lie get i newer what coming up war what is it good for answers also the second mention of the israilly army in one radio shol that is in a minute from public radyorinternational man our programm continues is american life fom myr glass it you gon ou program of course wechose a theme bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day's programp notes on camp summer camp you now lot of the pleasure of being in camp is the pleasure of being part of this team this group you just feel loyal to which also happens to be one f the pleasures of being in the military s in changing times while adam davidson is half as railley grow up in america and when he was fifteen he went to a camp run by the as railly army in israel on their own training facilities the camp was round the same drills they shot m sixteens was all design to convince these american jews to move to israel and join the asraely army some day it is exciting cause you really feel i mean that at that age when you are fifteen and you are in is railly army summer camp there is no one in the history of the world who is cooler than in a leat army unit soldier i love the fact that we would go to the bath room and the toilets would not have a seat because that is a place where terras could put a bon and it just foso moncho crouching on top of the see and showering in this freezing cold water because what the silet month god would nee hot water what now for me for the first few weeks what was tough about this was that un i was really an nobody there and i'd always be bringing up the rear at always become a slow and i was not showing myself to be moncho even thoe there were many opportunities in a given tay to prove yourself moncho i mean we were always for no apparent reason running crazy from one tree to another tree or up some mountain every few minutes there something you could be the best and i was never the best but all of this changed my geek status was completely transformed one night am the different units would put on plays and we were supposed to do take off fairy tals and this was some kind of a competition there was voting over who did the best job my group lugatberac our fairy taile was steve white in the seven dwarfs and i would be steve white this fabulous gayman who lives with these seven dwarfs and the prince who comes to after me would be rambo this was one of those moments where i just knew that i was i was in the zown i was in my element i mean i was from grunwage villages i've been a an actor all through my chowdhood my dad was a acter but more than that there is a way that americans can be very free that is railly cannot be precisely because they have to be masro and no matter what they'r doing even if they are mocking themselves they have to maintain that studliness and i had no complications in that area am i dress myself just i tried not to be too outrageous but i had to be kind of outrageous for them to get it a little bit of ruige a little bit of viliner am my hair con a slick back with moose and do not sort of ridiculously short shorfs and i'm lying there and i her a knock on the door and i just stand up and i remember the entire crowd is howling just howling and and i'm i just do the most awful mincing gay voice just who is it and my friend who is a skin head from torono whose parencs happene to be is railly says it is a rambo i said oh rambo you sexy beast and every one is freeking out just laughing mad maniacs and of course tho out at all in making jokes about the camp members themselves saying oh i think commander alon it is just the thing and everything i said the entire crowd is just with me is just laughing hysterically and what hapvens te snow white to steeve hint i eat the appl to pass out and i need to be resuscitated rambo comes to kiss me and what we would worked out if be put his hand in front of his mouth wand i put my hand in front of my mout and we just touched hands and were kissing our mouths but from a distance at looks were making out and i me at this point thicamp is their standing up their haufling men i have transgressed every bountry that whe is railly man sets for himself and am and they are laughing te other side and from that point on i was no longer the unknown american bring up the rear of the a obstacl cornt i was a movy star made every one the is rally guises particularly the machoist toughes is raily guis constantly wanted to do this make out thing where we put our hands over our mahunsan make out we would be were laxing after some really long height in the negtive desert or something and ma or chatwouler whatever would come up to me and say it is very funny well youd luliys to make out thing show me do it let us do it and the first retens i would do it i mean i gus pardon me was flatter that the macho future si eet mot colgis or into me in any wathing but after a while it was just weer i just be toloo chel i'm just not going to do thi do not do that any more i'm just no cinint doing they be onces o boy tit is veally funny that is all it is not fo anything but just the funny noi've been a plenty of campand ten every camp your somehow a part of a team i remember in boyscelt camp when iws at horse riding camp it was the people who wrote horses in the morning says the people who rode horses in the afternoon and i jslove my gises and i would look in the lunchroom at the other bunk ingusti i just an understand how you culd even live in that bunk but it is really ar my summer camp is the purest dissolation i've ever sean of this joy in being a hart of the group i just every week i would do things t i did not i would not have thought i could possibly do and that was in credible and i knew that was because of the girl i know that was given me the fors and it was there was never a moment where i to ask myself can i do it it was just we are doin this that but a is going to do this atam lee tends now member of our planet money team though we intended to join the as really our me when it is fifteam neve worked out now on't cam'p nember six holor days it is impossible to overstad whut a big deal color days is at the campan michigan julie

all your years at camp there are legacies your brothers and sisters would be on the same team as you are being man to captain of te color days teams is considered such a big deal that many older campers can name all the captains of all ther color day teams going back years two girls and two boys ware named is captain each year for each team only camp pers from the oldest bunks can be captain brinmars for girls mohawks and blackcawks for boys councillors who were once named is captains if you talked t hem about it they get all choked up when they tell you about the moment they were chosen

as in ame is not bigus doner in my life julis nider watched the girls color days this year just to give you a sense of the intensity of color days a months before it all begins and eleven year old blue team member tells me color days is in all that competedit i mean chee talk to a girl on the white team and everything and all i could think was if you have to say something that there is ging to be trouble the speculation about who will get the honor of being captain at the color days team the biggest honor at camp its intense that weeks before color days begins linsey say wat and some friends and brenmar eas decide to consult winsey's wicy bord tem her e as as e e eh i i larold fi c o wes cata a do youi do the kind is captain's africa culd you name oa e eh ell i as as eh o les a as

younger girls and older girls split off they dou track an field events swimming an boding events scavenger huns an an all camp song fast both team seam pretty evenly matched and for the most part the girls win and lose with grace most the girls i talk with all say colordays is their favourite part of camp they the cheering they the games they feeling a part of the team but one night after an

hair get out and passes baton to the next runner who goes to the water front where a little girl will do twenty five jumping jacks of the life jacket on wethen passes the baton to another girl who goes all the way back to the other side of camp to a cabin where camper un makes and makes the bed all along the way the girls are geling for their teams jumping up and down and trying to control their nerves l i au sho carrer down i i am an an here but on that i' loike somewhere else go blow ya as an outsider watching three days of all of this i have to say what was shocking was how gung how everyone was camp is this unusually safe bubble where kids can let themselves go crying and screaming and singing they all buy ind o this none of them stands back nobody thinks theire too cool for it backat school the rules are completely differen everywhere the rules are completely different down at the water front the white and blue team stand side by side with dueling cheering waiting for the final leg of the relay race when the last baton is passed the two captains from each team have to build af fire under a rope that suspended between two sticks about three feet off the ground the first team whose rope catches fire and burns all the way through wins the race some brim ar girls have been saving word for the ber in the rope since the second day of camp to night the blue team has about a full two minutes on the whites as the runner hands off th baton the blue team captains carley and dana drop to their knees and begin with the kinlin there cat only one match a minute as they had twigs and sassafrass to the fire soon the white team starts on their fire the cavtain's hands are shaking both teams are jumping up and down cheering and hugging the first pile of sticks to be come a real fires the white teams and the moment it catches tears start sccreaming down carliand daneis cheeks on the blue team both look close to hyper ventilating as they lie down on the dirt their cheeks on the ground blowing on their fire crying and frannically moving sticks around but the whit teams fire rises their rope starts burning and once it snaps the race as tining ach over gols ye jumping up and down colapsing andrewhethers arm sobbing and laughing the younger girls it is almost as if their little bodies cannot take all this emotion i watch one girl about eight years old who stands off to the side begins to tremble and her face get's redder and redderis tears pour down her cheeks i tea make tries to comforter it is o cay she says we won it might seem strange standing in the middle of a hundred crying girls that most of them will tell you this is the bast day of camp but it is the best day of camp precisely because it is a hundred girls all crying together it is the poin of camp is to feel this comrodery to feel hou belonged to something that feeling is that it is mosts concentrated during color days this is also the last day of camp it is strange it is ist whole thing there is

as america prepares for yet another brutally fought close for an election the potential censors increase their volume jill bidans has positive for coven and we examine whether donald trumps old colleagues are about to flip on him i'm benshver liss is the venshvarro show to day showsponterbackexpress vipian do you your rub history being seen and sold to advertisers now me neither gat expressby pian right out express be piandi com flash men well in the last election cycle there is an awful lot of talk about disinformation and misinformation remember there is a conflation that occured between twenty sixteen and twenty twenty first in twenty twenty the story was disinformation this was the russians were main lining a bunch of foreign propaganda into america's election and thus twisting the election against the wonderful and innocent hillery clintin and for the evil russian stuge donald trump that was the narrative in twenty sixteen twenty seventeen and then a kind of bled away beus it turns out the data was not there to suggest that it lookd the russians had a bunch of crappy facebook pages thet not all that many people saw tand instead the media turn to their new variant of disinformation which was misinformation misinformation is just stuffed the media does not because sometimes it is true and some times it is false but ye cannot tell the difference in the way that the media treatmens information and thus when it came to twenty twenty the argument was for example that the hunter bidan laptop story well tet was not quite disinformation could could not tell if it camefrom the russians but it might be misinformation and by mis information they just meant something we do not really want you to see and eversince twenty seventeen there is been all tis talkin social media fears about the stuff that you should see in th stuff that you should not see all this talk about the vast panoply of misinformation that i's going to be cram down upon you that you will not know right from left you will not be able to know right from wrong you will not be able to know what is true and what is false and this invariably ramps up just before a presidential election because what the media really want you believe is that they are the arbetters of truth they are the once we will tell you what is misinformation and what is not misinformation f it does not come courtesy of the washington post or the york times if it comes courtesy instead of shows it this one it must be misinformation and to prove the point the media and it is various allied intrest groups they will lobby social media to shut down other outlets to reduce their reach they will use the slogan it lut ukno it is not freedom of speech it is freedom of reach and tht there is no such thing as freedom of reach suff we just down grade the daily wire while up grating new york times while we have fought back against misinformation and once again misinformations or hate speech remains an undefine term there is certain stf tat we can all agree would be misinformation if you say for example that the world is flat thet' be misinformation but also that is fairly easily rebuted to here is the beautiful thing about mis information it is possible to rebut virtually all mis information with actual good information the probem for the left very often members themainstremeta it' they do not want their bad information or butted they do not the community notes feature on twitter because it might smack them once in a while wel the starting to ramp up inanticipation of twenty twenty four because again if you look outside the boundaries of traditional media you might notice for example that jobidon is not an empathetic older character with a sturling history of wonderful honor in his office instead he might look a career corrupt politition who is plajorized everybody in sight and used his position of power in order to enrich himself in his family he might look that if heu look at the quotoquot misinformation sources and now the media are ramping up the calls the huean cry for sensorship in advance of the twenty twenty for election and nothing new under the sons o the same thngis twenty twenty their just replaying it the latest indicator of this is a long piece from christiano lema from the washington post tiddled why a perfect storm of misinformation may loom in twenty twenty fort this also by the way a builts an excuse for whyjobidon loses bidn looses the answer's going to be not that he was a bad candidate not that you ran a jerry atric dodtering fool who cannot spew sentences from his face hole a person has a terrible economic record a person who has all the empathy of a come clot that is on gong to be your fault did cloing be the faults of all the mis information it is the the corrupt situation would not allow jobidon to win the aready setting up for that narrative as well here is what the he says a majority of researchers expect globalmis information to worson an twenty twenty four but politicions and social medio posing vemo serious threats according to a new survey released tuesas first of all the me just point out are you are you sying the politicians lie sometimes that they are not wholly truthful no no speak not of such evils honestly stupid the pole which surveyed almost three hundred researchers across fifty country's found that only a small fraction twelve per cent think the information invironment in their countries willimprove next year fifty four per cent said it would deteriorate the international panalon information invironment said the swiss if the swissbase none governmental organization behind the survey said the results demonstrates significant pessimism among the experts a ol the experts their passmistic hes would be the same expertswho declared that hunderbion's labtop was actually just a russian plant or something the finding's arrive is platforms including metta and elon musk's acts roback policies and scaleback teams dedicated to combating this information a head of major elections in the united states europe in india now is worth noting at this point that authoritarian states for example venins uhela or borerline authoritarian states say mexico tat a rule by members of the left the the rule of lula disilva in brazil these people are very from the tward shutting down quontin quomis information is the information nvironment in brazil getting stronger or reaker over the course of last couple o years everson's luis election by the way at the story of course was that bosinaro is the real authoriterian while lula has not ein shybout shutting down his political opposition in brazil is just the mediate un't care about that as they lula philip howard says he is the professor university of oxfort and share of the i piie said quote this has the potential to creat a perfect storm next year he says that staffing cuts to tect company's moderation forces posed a huge risk according to the survey two thirds of researchers said the inability to hold solciomedias compaet's accountable over boch conten moderation efforts posed a significant hurtle fifty five per cent reported poorly done audimated moder ation was another another words they want to be able su governments want to be able to sue social media companies in order to get them to do the thing that they themselves are not allowed to do the goverment of the united states is not allowed to shut you down on free speech terms butyu what they can do they can pressure you tube to do theng pressure facebook to do they pressure ecs to do while a thord of researchers globily flag social media companies as one of vemost serious threats to halthy discourse those that specialize in recions with democratic goverments set politicians themselves posed a bigger rists and of course here they just mean right wing politicians i theve these are the things that they care about this is that that there wer iht about right wing politicions hint hint they meet they mean trump ther'e worre about people horgan a sayve false things in the meantime they will maintain their position is the arboers of the ultimate

what the media would deem to be good in formation fphilip bum is a fact checker for the washington post i say fact checker with u with a ferrbit of scorn because im he is not exactly in unbiased sores is is philip bum of the washington post and dum his a national colomnist for for their newspaper he a pured on a pod caststo the personamed kno om dwarman the comedy seller podcast and known towarman asked him a pretty simple question about jobidons apparent corruption his suggestion was that jobiton has been involved in hunters cruption petty obviously for the past twenty years again hard to imagin that that is noctic case given what we now know up to an including the information from hunter bitons lout tot talking about ten per cent to the big guy all the money that was obviously flowing two hunster because hunter was using daddy's name jobidon phoning into meetings even if only to talk about the weather just to demonstrate hunters connection two jobidon apparently members of the upper staff at bresma openly talking about the kind of corruption that they were able to effectuate with jobidnan office eh but nums worman that is the biggest question of all right this he one i've asked as well which is there is an actual taxt from hunter to his own daughter niome literally saying that he paid half of his dad's bills what is the deal and philip bum agan philip bump is a is a columnist for the washington post he doesnat alisis and om he literally just refuses ilic he knows what the question is but he refuses to even alow it to compute it is an amazing spectacle here we go what do you take from the text message to his adull daughter huntersec tas that i have to get fifthroug sent ofmy income to pop i'e no idea what that means i do not i've know ady wha they means what is it is it is it is i know it is circumstantial evidencein you prefer that what what what could i ive no idea but does not do not know we i preciate our is anybody has anybody asked her i do not know i do not know do not you think somebody should ask her o i i'm n i just said i do not know and i do not knowhat to make f its i've nothin hpic say got it ye a dother dof mits i ye you say the is no ether do evidence but then as a tex message where he says i give pop fifty sent of my money that is that is evidence o cannot well what ok i fi i sell evidence i precite hav o g and then he tries to walk off to show then he tries to walk off the show now was it i've walked off if shows before where somebody was being personally offensive to me ti's a bad mivishon to done it but i've never walked off a show becaus i was to askd about a piece of evidence the controvened by argu ment that isthat that is a wy old thing right there philip bump just prefers not to see the corruption involving joe and hunter and thus it does not exist i do not what to make of that we l you do not know what to make of that we all know what to make of that the honest an sir there would be wel you are right that is suspicious it is weird that hunter would text his daughter that he is paying half of his dad's bills there could be verious explanations ranging from he was paing literally half his dad's bills to hus exaggerating to his daughter for a fact to huse high as a kite we would have to await more evidence from actual bankreckers to prove whether it is true not but yet that is a weird thing for hunter to say but got be an honest take that still leaves the door open to joe not being guilty but he is i am willing to humor that i do not know i liteally do not know e inif you have ever seen the ach pio sho west world for se'son is really good secon season tomast in that show it is a basically i it is basily about these very sophisticated robots in a in a made up world that is a a western land write this wite's west world the robot's are programs s that they cannot actually compute data that is not with in their datis tat if they see something that is completely out of place it just does not compute for them they do not see it and the cachphrase of the robots is it does notlook anything to me i every time thy see a piece of data that does not match the world around them if they are in west world and suddenly they see a card driving through and some he says did not you see that car they'l say it doesnt look anything to me that is phlip bump he is the he is the robot he is left wing robot that text message does not look anything to him he cannot see it it is right here and he cannot see it it looks nothing to him thanks for have me on and these are the people hor policing mis information these are the people we have task with policing ye flow of in formation in our society which says to me that they are not that worried all about misinformation what instead there wer deeply about it is information that they do not getting out their in public fear by we fill bumprights routinely about qhen qt misinformation he wrote a column just wlast week titled wide to republicans just proportionately believe helfmess information a month and half for that youre another one a deeply ironic reinforcement of rightwing misinformation he is constantly writing about misinformation it is i is his favoritething to write about and yet there he is not even bothering to make any sort of legitimate argument about why the thing that is right infront of him is fak he jus pretends does not exist it is in this world that mis informtion truly does flourish theys a used to be that it the very least we could to have arguments over what was trun what was false an the we bring evidence whom you marsial that evidence and thn we would agree once you kow the overnencs hin been marshalled that something was trewn something was false but in the world were heu just ignore the opposing argument utterly where just it does not even comsuit it just reseedson to the wall paper how the hom is mos to believe anything you say and this brings us to covit will get to that in

crept he he spends most of his days wandering around alone on rehublic beach with his shiret off horrifying the natives come and an they are aready setting up the predicuat for what his campagn is gen a look likenisscan to be he is too old and he is too scared of covit to gord o the basement again were setting up for that again in order to maintain that narrative however we must make everybody feel very scare of covid because if as it turns out covit is not killing massive massive numbers of people in the united states if it' urns out the risk factors that first attended to covit at the ver beginning are not even the risk factors that attends to the latest bout of cova the people are experiencing if it turns out that a huge for sentenge of te population either has natural immunity or vax cimmunity or that our standards of care are we better and to the dath rates are significantly lower thn te oricinal varient then people can a look at jobidon wearig a mask around belic what is he doing is not this just an excuse for him not to be in the public eye han well yesterday jibidan tested positive for covin according to axios sheis experiencing only mild symptoms she is n remaine at home innerhublith beach delaware president bid intested negative for the virus he is going to test at a regular cadence this week and monitor for symptoms he is supposed to leave thursday for a g twenty summit in india the first ladies positive test results is axios come a mit a surgin covit infections across the united states after the emergencs of new variance over the summer now i mean we are also getting back into fall terri tory gets roing back to school e gan i he see as surgen a lot of irus an awful lot of iris over the course of the summer and also the fall fort for example mi kid recent ly bes ive kids and ma kids are constantly sick basically is the juggling actus to which one of them is can be sick in any given time when mi kid came down with strep last week whent into the doctors li yatsa huge per cenange this yeare is that because of the evils of covet or 's i just because kid ther satting with one another freely again the immunity is low down cause they spent he last couple of years bubbled it depending on where you live in all he in any case there already setting up the predicut for jobidn to hidein the basement o her's corren john par world's worst press secretary explaining that tat jobdon is now going to mask up indoors because you should mask up indooris an it dangeros kuis president bidon teth that negative last night for cova nineteen and tetht negative again to day he is not experiencing anytentems asbar it the feth heis taking the president with with te pirth lady yesterday he will be masking while indors and around people in alinement with tetyfe gidim and as as has been the practic in the path the president will remove his mask wen sufficiently diftant from others indoors and while outside as well much sciencing happening right here insane levels of sciencing happening jobidon is going to he will be socially distant saying and he will be wearing his mask on accasioand a surgila mask ise whom non nan ninety five which would be the thing to actually protect him a man his age or any of the rest all this is parton parcel of a broader covet alarmism that is about to spring on to the scenes e can have this culture this stupid culture war all over agan thanks to o left that that continues to maintain that they did all the right things during the covi panemic according to n piar theos is seeing a late summer spike in covi cases prompting some schools hospitals and businesses to encourage or even required people to start masking up again the most recent c d c data from earlier this month shows nation bide covet hospitalizations increase by nearly nineteen per cent in a single week and deaths by more than twenty one per cent now this what we call fun with base rates this is where you have a pretty low rate increases slightly and that looks a twenty one per cent increase if i make a buckaday and then suddenly i make a buck twenty one a day does not mean i got rid that is twenty one percentingrace it is a twenty one per cent that that is the ennig what your baserate is that might mean a lottera might not mean very much at all according to sedysy direct or mandy coen she sad up to ten thousand people we c ben hospitalized tot coverd but that its far fewer than the forty thousands such hospitalizations a week the united states had the tigest point last august she said word a much different better place at this august of twenty twenty three but she says coveremains risky for people who are unvaccinated now ther can st are pushing the vaxes again apparently the latest version which is nicnamed eris right it was o mer crod but omacronis now been dispanswits annouce eris it is become dominant in the united states apparently it is more trans missible but it does not cause more severe disease for the vastmjorty people it looks a cold for the vastvas vastvas vastmajority people looks colld done matter wer thn to talk about however ben uses to mask up again speaking of helpmess information this is pretty amazing stuffs anthony fouche was finally asked about masking and he was asked by some one on no see anen believe it or not is michael s mercanishwas ot un you notice that those giant mask mandates tdid not do anything to lower the rates of transmission and fouchy just tries to futs is wet this is not miss information when fouche says it because he is of course the science it is also not mis in formation when he overtly size to his colleagues at the beginning of the pantanic that this might hav been produced in a chinese lab and the immediately reverses field an tries to get them to a task to the idea that it was natural made in any case here was that anthony fouchy distributing misinformation if in fact we get through the point with a volume of cases is such and organizations the sedy se recommend se he does not mandate anything i mean recommends that people whem ask i would hope that they abide by the recommentation taken to a count the ris to themselves and to their families and again when ot tok can gessforcing anybody to do anything may they always say they are not tig mout forcing anybody do anything than the next thin that happens is an a tempt ad force i also love that he is he was asked actuly by machaels mer conis the mask mandates to nactually do anythings hit what but for individuals they might ah this is tiresome that is not the only piece of bad sins going out the dor you have doctor ven gupton a missan bes he' doing the same rotine he is now claiming that if you are above the age of six months he should get a covedacs these things are untested on infants they are not to all of u thiger ser sand soi a thation at wegan havostus by the ando this mont o tlly an gos wel porbece le ger strongly a these ne versons of the vires oh tiresome tipes him again remember trust the experts trust acer if we have learned one thing over the past few years were the experts have screwed the pooch in every available way from economics to health policy to electornal policy it is trust the experts obviously and do not believe any of the misinformation ind just one second will gets the latest in the twenty twenty for campaign first we

i cannot believe that we are still being subjected to the idiotic idea that secretaries of state across the lander can be able to simply deelist donald trump from the ballet baste on the fourteenth amendment o the constitution baste on what susy beast on what the ideaty violated the insurrection act you have got to be kitting me there is a crime in american layes called insurrection the're not charging donal trump with insurrection jacksmith is not doing it tanny willis is not dong it nobody is doing it it does not matter the left his decided again because they are our moral arbuters in the arbuters of our truth thhe can simply band donal trump from the ballat and magically he will just go away and what is really driving that of is of course how much the hat trump i mean the idea here is that if we band from from baut we neverhave to think about him agam was not matter what the actual law says that at least is the prorspective of sunny hoston f of the view again one of our resident geniuses over there here is what she had to say i think the larger question is he is gon to be con vic ted of somethin ma ie sed it all the time federal or defendence get convic te oman e havin pe time the time ta te tan and that tor to case he is on tin for one of the charges a he is con to i convicted the larger question as why as hee en alou to run and c bout it earlie there are consermen an regal o mine from tan experts thetter sa that an of the fourteen teman men he is not even alou to run even though e hasna ven convictin yet becaue the fourtee temn thet tas that he qer tas te paned an public offis at ten taking en ot to this country an a in an insurrection you are ineligible to rah i od do not oragis that is not mis information she is just shes just being a legal analist the tony hoston was the ssenior legal correspondent in analist for abysenes which sh shows you the quality of of legal analysis these days donall trom brightly was rancing about this yesterday on truth sociallis has almost all legal scholars have voiced opinions that the fourteen themendmen has no legal basis or standing relative to the upcoming twenty twenti four presidential election election interference is just another trick being used by the ratical left communist marksis an facious to again steal an election that their candid ite the worst most incompitent and most corrup president in you a histery is incapable of winning in a free in fair election make america grate again now he is not wrong about any of that he is not it doesnat matter wergana see articles fom now up to electionday about why he should be removed frum thebout by theway that is also going hough th pry to get for why tobidan is not going to ebate him jobion will not s mate donal trump just waide for it it is going to happen bank on it put thet put honestly take that bat put in the bank right now lock it in meanwhile on the legal frunt donald trump is facing some pretty dir legal paril apparenltly some of his co defendants are starting to turn on him according to politico as a four colonel cases march toward at trial some of his aids allics ing wen to fennts are pointing at the former president in court documents in hearings lawyers for people in trumps orbit are starting to reveal glimmers ofva trid in trough strategy in cases with many defendants per tray yourself is a hapless pon while piling blame on the apparent kingpin then they go hin quote michael coan which again not a mis information when you quit michael coen but michel coen is a convicted liar i iued point out at this at this point but it does happen o be the case that there are a bunch people surrounding donald trump who have started making motions they might turn on trump last week trumps former whitehouse chief of staff mark meadows signals his defence is likely to include blaming the former president as the primary driver of the effort by the way would not be surprising to me if while nouta did the same thing while not is the aid in the in the classfied documents case who was moving around trine boxes of classfied documents af donald trumps bahas apparently trump actually put it out on truth social the walt nowton never would ae done that he neverwoud have moved if he had known there were classfied documents in the boxes he never would have moved them which of course suggests that if the re classfied documents in the boxes well not is to blame again i'm not sure what trump strategy there is with regard to the people who actually have to stand up for him in order for him to escape criminal liability here during a hearingin the lanci defence o turning for meadows called attention to trump's prominent roll and what as certain to be a crucial elements of the proscutor's case there that infamous january second twentiy twenty one fone call an which trump demanded that george secretary of state brad raffins burger a re publican finds enough boats to to clair trump the winner it is a strategy the could sharpen is the george case moves a closer to a jury and again would not be a giant shock that it is one of the risks of donald trum not paying the legal bills for all his ade if you are donald trumpaid if you'r somety who worked with donald trumpit he is not pang your legal bills and you now face jail timewhile trump is out their defending himself ir know yoornspen the ext ten years in jail well donald trump lames you for all of your problems john larot trumps a turning in the federal lection case signals recently he intends to file a sweeping immunity claim to attempt to do rail charges many of the defendences and george have alredy gon maneuvering for individual advantage trosecuers are also rais in question about funding that trum political comittes are providing for defendans as well now again things are gon t get messy for trump before thei'r not kon o get messy for trump but with all that said if trumpit nelligible for the ballet of course not meanwhile jobin continues torun an unbelievably wee race basily this entired twenty twenty for race is the meam from predator you kow the thebicep flexin g can gripping mem where the two arms gripping where both sides are whater that what democrats an republicans ground there is no wavorgon to loose to acki for democrat's that eyes from noway we losed him for republicans is no way beregng to lose to jobidon jobin's pall numbers continue to be absolute crap sen ends breona keeler she says he keeps trying to say the the economies could nobody as she believes him yet not everybody is sold on biins plan in fact he is struggling to convince vters that his administration has been good for the economy a new pole from the wallstree journal fines fifty eight per cent of voter say the economy has gotten worse over the past two years just twenty eight per cent say it is gottin better which is why to day president bid in pried to hammer home the point that he is better for jobs than is predecessor and petential twenty twenty four competitor iti will tell you is not a whening strategyan politics if everybody feels really bad about a thing stopd telling them that they are wrong to feel bad about the thing now tat mad be the truth i men theire many cases in life wor somebody feels bad about a thing n they really should not feel bad about the thing but as a political strategy when sixty five pecentin theamerican people are the economy stinkts for me and dro ms ik as because you do not understand theyr gon to miono room hireal clas joon it turns out that people do not buy that line very much and yet that is the line the're using there is the white houses jured burnstine of the council of the conomic dvivme people are wrong the connmies amazing it is your fault if you'r mad now my point is that ou can arly get amarian a persat ove aran toa gre n anything and here they are lin after line a gre abot thein port to the con pollancs ba o by nomits i thin get sinac cura na a no and inaccurat nari tan to te claer thet somehou by nomits is a workin or that its not i i tav wen erse by cobe wen you treal tow to what it actually is well no actually the stuff they are polling is would you if the government spent money on acts it turns out that everybody whn the government spens money on acts because people think the government makes its own money but people do not would you the government to take money from you and spend it on ats then all the numbers go the samething happens to be true when it comes to the thet people are living right now where they have experienced wage two in flation actual declines over the course of the last o couple of years in very significant ways every day things are costing much much more money the washington post in fact has a piece to day togmout auto insurance cost the sored across the united states these are real world probis people are having and a lot of it has to do with in flation premiums according to the washington post hafe kept climbing even as other typesbeen flation of cool according to the bureauf laborstatistics carinsurance for yous drivers in july with sixteen per cent more expensive than in july twenty twenty two seventy per cent more expensive than in twenty thirteen frank palmer the chief insurance officer at rood in turencs us caer pair cost bodyshop wages use car prices have all had significant increases the entire industry has had to raise rates to keep up with these friends motor vehical manance costs ar up thirteen per cents from july of last jer lon f your carbric standright now it cost you an absolute ficken fortune to fix the thing thevid woodal a machanic at meturo motor says it is more expensive to dagnos ner vehicles the parts are not to hold out more expensive but the frequency of repair on them is more than it used to be if an air bag goes off ats thousands of dollars a new car might have eight air bags in it this is also in attemp by in sure to make up for big pay outs driven by floods and natural disastrs which insures categrize as catastrophe losses as well and there is no escape from the higher premiums because again when comes to carnturns your man dated to get your carinsurance or you cannot drive on the public roads all of this people are tributing to bins a conomy which makes ens because even as all this is going on jobidon is spilling billions of dollars hundreds of billings f dollars into green bundaggles as the wallstree journal points out according to our aport late last month by the york state energy research and development authority large offs

production coming to is screaching halts jobidon again really a wee canit butt there are couple things the biton has going in his favor thing number won the bid nhas going in his favor he is absolutely stone dead boring he is absolutely boring even i get i can tell i can look at our umbers every time i mention jobidon everybody who is watching or listening to the show immediately goes in okoma is a coman is iif you say beedle juice three times than he appears and if you say bidan three times cars fly off free ways all over the united states as the drivers go chomatoes their foot gets the the steer thate their foot hits the gas and steering weel carens to the rights mass carnace every time you have mention jobidon just be cause people go narkoleptic the minute you mention the guy he is old heis boring and that old an boring is a real asset for him i've been saying the since twenty fifteen by the way then the jobidon if you would run in twentse sixteen wored ben formidable candidot be cussy's boring the same thing is true n twenty twenty he literally did not run a campaign his campaign involves him being dead now his campagn involves him being double dead how can you tell because it again all the metric say for example no one wants to buy a book about jobide according to politico enbyse uses jonathan allan when on a multi stop national tour when he coro to book on how hillery clinton lost todonnal trump during the twenty sixteen campaign shattered inside hillery clinton's dume campaign more than a hundred and twenty five thousand copies but for the pandemic ira book that he rone on jobid an allenson you van get the satisfaction of seeing a copy an stores he did not go on a tour lucky how jobid en barely on the precidency never made the new york times besotolist it is sold youer than ten thousand copies that is not a lot of copies foks the bidin has bee the biding yourup whorn to political has been a bust for the book market that is not just the case remainstroug journalists a custom to chronicling the presidency in book form conservtive readers arn't all that interest in reading hundreds of pages about a president they think is seenile eric nelson my former editor over at harper collens really god etor said bide never does anything interesting the hunter biding stuff has done pretty well because he is appropriately interesting but hunter is not the president if your neckname is sleepy joe yets the kind of simultaneously say this person is ruining everything and also is supremely evil but also he is anepts tha sort of a challenging commidation adted one major conservative publisher and other books about the bidins have been doing terrible business and some nhg's books by the way are very good i've mention before politicao as ben shrakanger and his book dobidings inside the first families fifty arise to power it sold us than five thousand copies that is as opposed to michel wulf's garbage book about donald trump fire and fury which told im hundre a almost a milliong copies or woodwords book peril about trum that isold four hundred thousand copies and the great the great irony of of jobidon is that his bordam and his and his sinility is blocking out fac tat h's unbelievably ratical and batted his job his advantage continues to be tha he is much less interesting than nonal trum in just one second we will get into what that is hiding and it turns out is hiding some really unbelievably bad policy first in a world filled with uncertainty's its crucial to be ready fortever comes your way wellher tog ment a natural

and law makers at various levels government are demandsing the administration do more to help a comminate migrants they are frustrate by what they say is biden's lack of responses senter dic durban who is a very strong allied to tubidan sespuot i wrote him in may it is been four months hi've to find out what is going on aain this pretty amazing stuff ye you have seen mayor aric adms of york city an your governor cathy hocal publicly futing with adams demanding the rest o the state receive migrants and hocal being nat it is bidansfault governor milt fillmurphy of new jersey shot down the bide administrations reported idea of relocating migrants to atlantic city international air port ask for politico gedernal officials view many of the mans as political postering not realistic solutions because they willface legal ar practical challenges now here is the thing nobody ever considers the possibility may bou should work on closing the border because that would you run up a gans all of the favored left wing nostrums about give me your tired your poor yearning masses desiring freedom and all of this then the reality hetston o ie god what heu do with all these people i'll tell you what massachusetts is doing masthus officials overwhelmed by a riving migrans if now activated the national guard is they scramble for more housing governor maurick hely mobilize two undred fifty members of the massachusetts at natural guard on thursday national guard to help transport the latest wave of asylum at seekers which is again astonishing masschus sas nowhere near enough housing or resources currently available to accommodate the influx i'm bad policy running directly up against reality remember that time when al the demicrats were shouting about why whyse tecis wining much thy've hundreds of thousands of people arriving every month why they wining much when a tiny town browns viltaxas just gets overwhelmed how dare they why they racis nat'skiing ship to masschuceli col the national guard we need to do something about this protesters claim the state has prioritize the need of migrants over the need of its own homeless residents including veterans many at arally were flashing sines the red fets and cape homeless first apparently they are about six thousand families more than twenty thousand people currently residing in massachusetts states shelters according to officials amazing amazing stuff all of this flying well under the remember alexandra cosocortes the greatest and n most wondrous a sofresh face fresh faced mc face fresh alexandero cosocortes congress person from twitch she she she does stuff with the instant pot and than she also does social media you remember she went down to the border while donal trump was president and fate cried inan empty parking lot directly to camra yoremember that now she is a sh not doing any of those things i noticed which is weird because i thought that choose truly committed to this to this bit meits a real bit by the way but apparently the commitment ended when thes strusts began i love this this is really funny she was she did not interviewed the yur times where i'm the nyer time to asked her speaking of our closest neghbors i want o talk about emigration under jobiden more sylum seekers are being held than private detention centrs than under trump families are stillbing separated the bidy dministration kept trump your apolicies that is but up deeportations a made her harderfor coild make claimants to come to the uus what grades youd give the ad ministration on emigration and she answered emmigration is arguably this administrations wekest issue it is one area where our policy is dictated by politics argubly marso than any other this is where she startsing arguabliolot becaue showes mutshes talking about the're very clear recommendations and suggestions we made to th administration spred relieve on this issue it is my believe some of the hesitation around this has to do with the fear of just being seen as a proving are providing permission structures a religioust the republican narratives that if surrounded imigration o cay that is a lot of verbiage that means na thing no thing whatif i just thrown a fhraslike permission structure is man we elsen't you to examine the rute cosis an migration and address this prom does not start our border it serts that farm policy anda the ner times frporter ses why have not you use your considerable cloud as lateena leader to visit the border and hilot the on going issues there and sdoes it well this is something where actively planning on i've done toers byr new york airia facilities likewe i'm i noticed where you warnt the border i noticed it is it is of an s is funny the the ner times reporter to theyr creditsis quort under the trump administration you did make the southern border in istiue shud yes and again i will be visiting the barder when jobidans can be visiting east palistine ohio cause it ii nortice suth a thing that you are not doing is is just something that i notice ow can meanwhile china continues to be on the on the edge of a of an economic cateclism according to the your times china's biggest home builder is now reeling as the economy slows when country garden the biggest developer in china's increasingly troubled real estate sector published its anual report an april the coverd is inin juted hope a phenic spreading its wings alas wishful thinking shortly after their ports release chinas nasonts economic recovery lawsteam and already sluggish real estate market started to collapse a country garden presails of unfinished dapartments a crucial indicator of future ofe new plunge more than fifty per cent in june an july twice the rate of decline in the preceding five months for the past three years as dozens of major property developers defaulted after years of excessive borrowing country garden was an outlier last month in mist tue interestpayments signaling that it too was at risk of financial cllapse with one hundred and eighty seven billion dollars in debt that is a lot of debt folks that is a lot of tat country garden has staved off in immediate crafth it told creditors hat made the interest payment of twenty to one five million dollars within the grace period before default on friday the company won lastmen a rapproval from creditorsopostpone rypayment of five hundred thirty seven million dollars it is been a dramatic fall for country garden the company's im probable rise from regional home builder to a nation by behemouth trac china's own medior of medioric ascent now it is claps reflects the speed and severity of the country's real estate miltdown which threatens to do rail the brouder conomy by the way why this happened the reason that this happen in china is because they 've one metric for success and that is gt p gt p isthe measurer of final and use sales it can be jogged by borrowing and spending if the government borrows and spends on empty apartment buildings to developers country garden well that is counted as gt p grot it does not matter the nobody's actio buying those partments in just continue to jack up the gty piecitistic by borrowing in spendig in borrowing is uthere isonly one proben at certain point to carasol stops the same thing is true in the united states which is wide is puzzling an stupid that the united states continues to follow china down the primrose path on this one it really's kind ofan amazing thing ook a time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i to day bill mar was on with jo rogan and again i'm frindly with bill frindly with jo bill used to be a main stream left winger he is a main stream liberal mainstrom democrat and now as people on the twitters are saying he sounds me and tht's not because i have moved and reallysing as am ours moved it is because everybody else who used to consider themselves on left as move radically left that margot left behind here for example is bill mar speaking about wo culture got ripped up for this but of course he is exactly right here he was you can be woke with or e on sence thet that no empris but do not say bhut somehow it an extension of liberalism e ecause it is most often actually an undoing of liberalism i have always believed as liberals do for example and a color blind society that the goal is to not see race at all anywhere for any reson yes that is what liberals always believed all the way through abama going back canedy everybody marn't loote the king that is son what the woke believe they believed race is first and foremost the thing you should always see everywhere which i find interesting begis that used to be the position of the cucluk's clan that we see race first and foremost everywhere no aso again you can have that position but do not say that is a liberal position you are doing something very different the ract he got ripped up for this how dare hy now of course he was not saying te bealone is doing same sort of stuff as the cucluk's lan ho samey ideology the race is the grat to french eater and that is the first thing he shou notice about a person he saying that is bad whit gan i thought you when i grow up that was just what everybody got thought and i'm confuse the ag rup in the nineties then now long e no and i remember i when public schol and this was what you were thought it was considered a good thing and all the sudden it is the reverse mar also slammed black lie's matter pointing out it on it is always tern black lites the matter to be alone in minisota for example i think was many aplis after the george floyed murder and the riots i think there was a movement to just paned a lot of the police and they did i think a lot of the police were let go or somehow the police force was was a lesser force than it was and what happened was course crime went up in certain areas and a lot of the officers who had been fired or let go were quiter for whateve reason they wen't on the force any ore they were hired as private security by who the rich people who could afford to do it their neighborhood state sir that was not exactly i thought a victory for liberalism murders have been happening way out of control in chicago among the african american community for far too long and not really reported in this same in the way that they should be it is rat amazing how black lives do not seem to matter when they are taken by black lives but but id they mean now chicago my friends o live their safes not safe anywhere yets very sketching very sketch and that chicago a om see he saying reasonable things the left is not this white thin a the first party that shows that it can be sain rationals can win broadswas of the electrit i mar speaking for pretty much every one at this point on this left right that ling if you are inreasonable categories you wil greed wi tle moon esouf the left is ignoring it and the right is too busy playing with itself over here on other ishes that that it is it is beles are right there for the picking just they the thinks by them but apparently that thou'd be too good for the united states right now oo a time for a quick thing that i hate gay om apparently austin police are now urging robbery victims not to call min when one that seems bad according to fox news austin police and texs are asking residence to call three one one if they get rob near in eight t m as the department struggles amidn increase in urban crime three one one is a number usually use for non emergency request nd ine when one is i'm being robbs three one is yes somebody rob me three hours ago what can i do about that i'm apparently they now do not want you to call mine when one even if you are being rob rite the second because they are just overwhelmed austin police department wrote quote even if youare cautious and follow ausafety advice you may still become the unfortunate victim of robbery youre next steps should

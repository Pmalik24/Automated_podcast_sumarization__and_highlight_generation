menshpershosponserbackpressive pian protect our almine privacy to day at expressve piantakam flashmen we seena lot of disturbing pole results over the course of the last few decades but i've never personally seen a more disturbing pole result than the result from the latest harvard herrispoll out over the week en now to be sure this pole says that the american public are basically in the realm of sanity ore leaset most of the american public are the olds are o kay it is the kids marty something is got to be done about the kids according to this latest harvard terrispote while a strong majority of every age group agree that the october seventh terror slaughter of one thousand two hundred is ralies in the kinnapping of another two hudred forty was indeed a genecidal terror attack some sixty per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty four said that genecidl terr attack quote can be justified by the grievances of palistinians that is correct while two thords of eighteen to twenty four year ld degree the comassis terror taxs were geneidl and nature sixt in ten still say it can be justifide that is a crazy number and it gets worse every age group in america except for eighteen to twenty four year olds sides with israel against komas the older you are the less crazy you are as for usual arrangement those above the age of sixty five side ninety six to four against comass for the youngs however the numbers are split right down the middle fifty fifty fifty per cent of people in this pola eghed eighteen t twenty four support comass in actual geniecidl terrogroup over the state of israel just way it gets tougo worse when asked about whether students on campus who call for the genicide of jews should be punished for violating university rules most americans of all age groups say yes again the older you are the more you agree with that proposition that is not because americans oppose fre speech it is because they realize that literally every element of speech on campus is police for mikro gressions and of fencetaking why precisely would genicidal juhators be exempt everyone agrees with that except again for the eighteen o twenty four year olds who believe that well such speech is hatespeech they believe that seventy to thirty fifty three per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty four believe that students should be told quote they are free to call for genecide that is correct a majority of people eighteen twenty four believe students should be told they are free to call for genicide long as theire calling for geniecide of jews yes we have discovered finally the one thing fragul young people are not fragil about saying the jews should die you think were done this pole gets even whorse while a majority of young people seven and ten agree that israel is trying to avoid civilian casualties and fifty eight per cent of young people agree that comas would to commit a genecide seventy six per cent of young people think comass can be negotiated with to create peace despit the fact that again the same young people will acknowledge the comas is a genecil terrogroup here is the kicker fifty one per cent of eighteen to twenty four year olds think quotes the long trm ancer to the israel palestinian dispute is four quote israel to be ended and given to comass and the palistinians that is correct a majority of young people admit comass is a gen icial group use is human shields rapeswomen commits evil atrocities on the regular all that was pold a majority of them believe it and they still want israel destroyed and handed over to commoss fifty one per cents say these solution to the arab is really conflict is for israel to be destroyed and handed over to commoss why do all these young people thing all of these truly evil things will et to that in just one second first if all this puts youin mine the future is uncertain and that there is a lot of trepidation about what is going to happen at the very least you might

herspoll believe israel shuld be obliterated and commoss should take its place that say majority believe the commoss is a genicidal terr group that committed mass rape that targets scivilians nd the wants to kill every juw what the hell is going on whell thankfully this poll actually spells out the answer the biggest question and answer takes place on paye fifty six of this pole this is where we learn that americans were asked a very simple question quote there is an ideology that white people are ppressors and non white people and people of certain groups have been oppressed and asaresult should be favord to day an universities and flor employment dou support or oppose this ideology pretty easy answer right i mean that is a really really bad ideology of course you cannot simply assume that white people are ppressors and non white people are victims that is morally imbacilic some white people ar oppressors and some are victims and some non white people are opressors and some are victims the claim that white people are by nature oppressors and that non white people are the oppressed is ridiculous on the merits after all here is a partialists of ethnicites who earn more on average than white americans do indian americans philopino americans tolenese americans stree lonkanamericans japanese americans malasian americans chinese americans packstand americans thelist goes on and non none of those people are white well as you might expect most americans believe that this interosectional idyology iss quite terrible sixty five percents of americans over all believe that the ideology that white people are pressors and non white people and people of certain groups ha ve been opressed sixty five per cent americans believe that that i ideology is bad and tey oppose it now young people they supported not only do they supported they support it at a rate of seventy nine per cent two twenty one per cent eight two two only a bare majority of twenty five to thirty four year olds by the way disagree with that sentiment forty nine per cento people aged twenty five to thirty four believe that white people are oppressors and none white people are victims you want to know why the younger generation hates israel because they hate the west according to those same eighteen to twenty four year olds jews are part of that oppress or class some sixty seven per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty four two thirds agree that qul jews as tay class are oppressors and should be treated as oppressors that is astonishing the evil of critical race theory are as we now call it more inocuously diversity equity and inclusion d e i the sef the hereon campacity or corporation it rears its had in all of the ugliest places now we should not be all that shock by these numbers among young people for this oppressor oppressed white people verses every one else evil binary the barocobomic holition of the supposedly marginalized which for democrats always meant racial and sextual minorities is an americally strongest among young people just fifty two per cents of eighteen to twenty four year olds are white in america similarly about twenty per cent of generations ears proport disproportinatlely white say they are l g b t ku plus mountits vided by sin if you believe in inter sectional ideology they are a lot of people who fit right into that intersectional ideology now heres the thing demographics should not be destiny his banic voters in florida for example are voting increasingly republican it generally matter how many young people in america are white or not white because theyre all individuals and thy should stop thinking stupid crap no matter their efthnicity but the left corps oppressor oppressed philosophy is that all that matters is your group identity if youre minority but not a jew or an atient seeking to get into cologe you are a victim as the radical left winds ideologically it is no surprizse that group minority identity a demographically growing piece of the american pie is driving anti white hatred in larger numbers and by proxy antituish hatred as well because young people have been indotrinated by three generations of this trash it is becoming part and parcel of the democratic party playbook right now tere is a battle for the heart and sol of the democratic party itself between the moderate liberals and the ratical left the moderates still thing the system can be changed and shaped in order to accommodate the supposedly marginalize the demands of the people who feel excluded but they do not actualy believe the system oughto be obliterated the bid administration is supposedly on this tem they wave their hands lot at equity but they do not actually seek to implement it in the ways the raticals woen most love which is why see the ratical left for example very angry at tobide in these days the raticals think the moderates are weak and foolish and there are more than happy to use them as their tools that is why for example the york times is suddenly all in favor of free speech but only when it comes to sunes chanting for israel's obliteration according to the york times over the we can quote universities are under tremendous pressure to stamp out antisemit sm but some say that is causing fear and curbing free expression freesly chin campas has never been much of a priority for the neror times needless to say the same weaken the new york times ran this rather longpiece former up at paeteror jim's bennet of the yor times wrote a sixteen thousand word essay for the economist slamming the times for their own sensoriousness they destroyed his career for this great sin of platforming senator tom cotton an sitting senator who advocated in twenty twenty for using the national guard to put down violent riots here is what an arote quote the reality is that the york times is becoming the publication through which america's progressive eleetes talks to itself about an america that does not really exist the times is problem has matastocize from liberal bias to illiberal byas from an inclination of favor one side of the national debate to an impulse to shut down tebate altogether near times in other words is a font head of sensorship they are antiphre speech but this is the same times suddenly concerned about free speech when you are chanting from the river to the sea or they are lying and they do not care about free speech they just are ratical my hunch they are ling what the radicals wams is to use the tools of liberalism in order to push radical illiberal evil designe to tear down the west that is what is happeng with young people are now suggesting that in the name of diversity and tolerance and equity in inclusion israel the only tolerant and diverse country in the entire midaleast ought to be destroyed and replaced with the chereal law terrorists of commass tht is why young people are preaching diversity equity inclusion in te united states what they really mean is anti white hatred in the name of reparative justice quotin quo this is by he way why we seep piece after piece in the mainstremedia talking about the generation gap among young jews who seem not to understand their foolishly liberal parents who spent decades telling their kids they re all for a variety of viewpoints no judghment here while kids were indoctrinated with hatred of their own parents and their own civilization take for example a story from todays walster journal about a family called the workshafters gramma work chafter lived with her husband and children in jerusalem during the nineteen seventy three war the uncupor war she is azionist her son david one generation removed is ha reform rabbi in lexingtonkentucky who calls himself a progressive zionist this is coed for a jewish gy by birth who cares more about progressivism than anything remoli jewish he then maried another progressive zionist who herself quote has studied right wing religious movements and such she is troubled by ethno nationalism in all of its form she is a rabid left winger and is happy to label horoponents ath no nationalists both of them consider themselves believers in the definitionlists mush of ticoon olam at from frequently use by jews by birth who do not really believe much about juteism but are looking for a hebrew phrase to hang their antiblibical left wing social justice politics upon tecoon olam has no preticate in holacha in jewish law it is literally a phrase in one prad that as been blown into an entire ideology that has very little to do or nothing to do with actual jewish practice how did these progressive zionists raise their kids whlaccording to the walstrat oronel they imparted that jewish concept of pursuing a social justice to their two children and encourage them to think critically and speak up their daughter and son emmanuel an zacaria now hate israel and wish it to be a stap thisestablished as a jewish state emmanuelele saic you would not even a tend post october seventh events thaet featured is railly flags now problem is not unique to juse it is degenerational problem across the west liberal parents breed ratical children who use the cowardice of their parents who refuse to stand for any principle other than openness and tolerance they use that as their leverage to tear down the entire system meanwhile their milk sop coward parent sit there and nowt their heads weekly as they explain as the workchafters to quote i do not agree with e manuell on every political issue including aspects of this current crisise but i'm tremendously proud of her for standing up for what she believes in but what if york is believe that white people and jews are the oppressors what then are you still supposed to be proud that they are on thinking for themselves or have you idiotically turned your own children into raticals who hate you and everything that your own principles were based upon radicals have been playing this game since the nineteen sixties and quietly they have been winning and thy will continue to win until disaffected liberals realize they have been played for suckors and stop mathing platitudes about the joy of tolerane and diversity as their own children prepare their defenistration in the name of weaponized social justise in just one second whe will get the latest from israel were again people keep trying to create some sort of momentum for a pesteel that does not exist with an actual honest to god terro groups insane gets that momentarily first are you traveling for the holidays well if pure

this pole should be deeply deeply troubling to any one with half a brain because what it saids is that an entire generation of young people has been endoctrinated to believe that one sagment of society is responsible for the ills of every other segment of society and it can be divided by race it can be divided by group status well that is the death of any functioning republic that is a destructive impulse by the way one things thats truly insane here is the same exact poll that shows that seventy nine per cen of young people actually believe in this terrible ideology forty nine per cent of young people believe it is bad for the united states it is almost what fifty fifty on whether young people believe this ideology's bad for the united states but eight to two h they agree with the ideology anyway which suggests th 't the united states very much if that is how bad things have gotten with the younger generation and again that is because of their parents tat is because an entire educational system that has been driven by the notion that you do not have to teach your kids what to think you teach them coin how to think well no it starts with teaching your kids what to think only afterwards are they qualified to think about how to think it turns out that if the only thing you teach your kids is all thoughts are equally good you have taught them nothing you are a fool if what you have taught your kids is that the essence of any good society is simply the amount of descent that takes place in the society rather than the fundamental principles upon which the society is based you should not be surprised when descents is then used as a weapon to terr down the very thing you tressure this been true since the nineteen sixties hermarcusa was a philosopher from the nineteen sixty is frankfortschool philosophere taugt among other place the columbia and harvard and in the universy of california system and he coine to term tht he called repressive tolerance repressive tolerance was the idea that all ideas that oppose the left ought to be repressed because after all there was this conspiritorial system in whch a very powerful group of people at the top kept everyone else down and free speech all the liberal principles were actually inventions of the powerful is the post modernist de constructionist ideology which that there are no principles there is only systems of power set means that free speeches a system of power propery rihts is system of power all of that said marcusa have been manipulated by people at the very top level and that has to be torn down in order to reestablish some form of equolity or equity or social justice and then he said the only way to do that to tear down the system is to repress people that we disagree with that is how you end up with people who purport to be on the left ore supporting comoss which throws gay people off roofs that is how the gother it does not matter that thoese people from comoss would throw the gay left us off the roofs that does not matter is queers for palestine only exists as a group because of this ideology that you are either member of the oppressor class or a member of the oppressed class andthat is all that matters in life that is also how you end up justifying the myriad evils of comoss cause it does not matter what they do they are always oppressed enough that they can do whatever they want your level of oppression now justifies literally anything and everything over the weaken we saw a wide variety of comos human rights violations israel for example released tape of a of an entire terror tunnel that was built by comss this is in insane insaintape hay comss built a terratunnel that is large condrive tructs through it it was built down to fifty meters underground and hundred fifty feet undergrounds void bomming on top of it thi s ectually tape of yach ha sinuar's brother mohomed sinouar driving through the terratunnel in a truck ey look look a the size this tunnel thes tunnel looks it looks at a tunnel in california underneath the loks likeit will sake they they use boring equipment t's actually bor holes into the earth in orders that they could tran t i means this thing is colometers long four kolometers long this is where they spent all their money but do not worry comas is a pece pardner come oss by the way woodwin an election in the westbank right now if n election were held in lwessbank right now meanwhile what is comas doing with the a trucks is een a lot of prushron israel to ship more aid into the gza trip israel has not eploit extra resources in order to allow shipment of aid into the gozas trip the problem is is nopting distribute on the other side of the gozestrip israel's ready to clear more aid to going to the gozess rip what actually is happenings that aid whi here it can se prety clearly what is happening to that aid the u a e sent in aid it literally seys on the side of this giant truck yu a aid for those effected in gozap who is riding on top o the truk why look at that it is members of comms with their faces cloked and they are holding weapons almost as though what israel clane which is t every bit of humanitrianad would be stolen by commas what is true because they stole all of the commanitarianade and theyare using it to continue they are terror war that is ended with th completeh destruction of the gozas trip things are bad in the gzes trip that over the weekan when most tragic stories of the war occurred israel accidentally the idya accidentally killed three of the hostages who were taken i'd apparently escapes they'r captors and they had attempted to paint a sign on a sheet that is tat he selu i't help us in's ad three hotupim meaning three hostages and israel thought that i was trap why d thy think thaut strap zetrocomastas cmost literally sets traps with fake hostages they wavewate flags hen they do not mean it they literally put dolls connected to crying sounds theyv the polic recording next to a doll and then strap with explosives that is rally soldiers wi'll die israelly soldiers did not know what to do and they 'n up shooting three hostages who are tempting to signal them for their help israel's investigating israel's going doan ap bi would assume doing something about the officers who who were involved in this shooting it is a horrible tragic situation and it is entirely the fall of comoss because those people would not be in goza in the first place if they would notpen taken into goza and meanwhile members of the left wing are whell that is obvious that israelis comitting human rights violations you literally have eighteen nineteen twene year ol guis were going to goza and getting killed by the dozens in order to preserve the life of civilians in these areas and meanwhile the west continues to maintain that the real ownes is on israel in just one second well talk about what the united states is doing ain the're giving all these mix signals when it comes to israeles for the usual arrangement first there is a lot to be strussed about during the holiday seas in stress leads to sleepless nights sleepless nights causeless pesky

to the nework times the united states is now pushing israel to conpuot skale back the war the fence secretary loid astin who has been one of the worst officials in the administration on this was traveling on sunday inte midleas for visit to israel and three persian gulf nations as bide administration officials push israel to end it is large scalle grounds and air campaign in the gozistrip within weeks andm transitions while more focus phase in its war against commass while all offers open i'm sure israels ike okagot you want a way out your plans really lek if you have some magical plans by which israel can make the gozistrip safe and quiescent i'm sure israel's going to hear it considering they currently have tends of thousands of troups deployed iven the gosestrip right now doing heavy hand to hand urban combat astin is supposed to meet with priminister mentomantongaho and israel's defence menister you ove galan discuss in detail what and how is raily forces will carry out a new phase that american officials and vission would involve smaller groups of eleat forces you us official said goes forces would move in and out of population centers in gaza conducting more precise intelligencstrof an missions to fine and kill commas leaders rescue hosages and distroy tunnels according to those u us officials now realistically speaking the fact is that israels can have to continue the heavy ground operation for at least another couple of weeks presumably the united states is not going to continue to to push for the idea the israel should preemptively and it is military actions against comass but i have it say there is nothing more tiresome in this is true bet the we are talking about american troups inharm's way in foludjral where you'r tung out his raily troups in harms wangaza there is nothing more tiresome then lis tening to politicians jabber about civilian casualties while armies are doing their best to protect both their own soldiers and civilians whore being used as human shields cris van hollan senator from marylan he says we are seeing to many casualties again i'm sure that if you had a magical waid to avoid that israel would be all ears sad er venon you heard present bindslessage quite clear there jake sollovin was obviously it israel o delivery a silor message now we have learned over night the defense secretary ostin is on this way to the region is the message getting through welli do not think it is getting through clearly enough i because we continue o see unexceptably high levels of sothiian casualties aand what accomst maniterrin a crisis am we still havin thear total sees whet question what would the will the acceptable level of cevilling casual tiese be given that isral's ratio of terroris killed a civilians killed dectiy lower than in any modern conflict ever in a heavy urban erea it is it is its all ridiculousness it is all rediculousness but what ire really under scorse is that for the west there is still this sort of base line liberal belief that if you cave to intransigent terror is somehow this makes the world ta better place while the by administrations fining ot the highway that is not the truth when it comes to yemmen the hoothes are holding up the shipping through the bob elmandeb straight which is place wore about ten percent of all world shipping goes through and now there is talk about not even using that particular area for shipping because of whoothe pirates in the area whor coming from yemmen the hoothies youwill recall are a deelisted terro group ther re terror group that the bidadministration cam ban immediately delisted as a terro group upon entry in attempt to placate the arronians because remember the bin administration one to make a deal with ron as they spread their terror temtacls oliver the midle east well now according tothe walstr turnal the press is reporting that the bid administration is contemplating the use of military force in response to continu attacks on commercial shipping by the hoothy militia in yemmen it' about time the hoothy missil attacks pose the most significant praticglobl shipping in decades they will continue unless a global colition unites to stop them the ussas carnea destroyer operating in the red see shot down no fewer than fourteen attack thrones launch from whothe contral territory nemmon on saturnay alone abrish worship shot down a hoothy drone after a dispatch to the region to protect commercial ships this follows weeks of similar attacks use worships have felt obliged to intercept to protect themselves and other ships the hoothes have said that teir attacks are ainded stopping is raily vessels but apparently the're not just doing that thei'r targaning commercial ships willinilly they struck at laburian flacks ship in the red sea on friday and they waunch too belistic missils one of which struck another commercial ship as well this is making the red sea non navigable major commercial ship lines ofardy announce they will seeze sending ships into harm's way mayorsk which is the shipping gine has stopped sending vessels throughthe bablman tob strape between the red s an th gulf vadan has become a hothe firezone let us be real about this the united states and its allies should be taking strike options against the hoothese to stop them from pursuing tese sorts of attacks thomas jufferson was was willing to use american military power against the barbary pirates waiy back at the beginning of the nineteenth century the united states has a massive military advantage over pirates ay you are not tongu outing over yemmen a come out restructuring it notime outnation building not blowing op a few coostal bases for the hoothies that is what you are talking bout here why this even a question is beyond me of course t united states should take out those who thebasis of course the shud or or aid the souties in doing it top byi administration officials apparently a coing to political are actively weighing those options to strike back at the hoothese in yemmen the have been reluct ins respond militarily against the who the attacks on commercial shipping for fear of provoking aran fear of provoking arn seriously this this is the game now you'r afraid of i notice that aran seems rather angry and they have for several decates this point a ron is responsible for the death of thousand o american soldiers in rock around is responsible for the metasisis of terror in lebanon they responsible for t metasiv terr in the gosa trip in yemman in syria all over the damn place and tht this this bizare notion that its it is all blowback at talllike eyou want't talk about bigotry the bigotry that suggests that the only reason bad people all over the world do bad things because america is mean that is idiotic it turns out people have their own interests and they pursue those on interest with alacrity particularly in the face of american weakness and let us be real about this if america cannot guarantea the freedom of the seas against a a few rag tag pirate dolts in the babell mandem strait what they hlp you think china you you worn't talk about what chinas thinkings hase bee a lot of talk about hav the pull out from afkanison precipitous pull out from afkanistanin collafvafkanistan to the talaban how that inscentofies ladmerputen to take you crane or attempt to take yau crane and how what is going on neu crane is then going to have knock over a facts and follow on h facts with regard to china looking at tiwan one of the reasons why china would be concerned about taking tiwan is because american economic interests would be threatened i want is the producer of ninety to percent of the world sophist get a mecrochips not only that chinese naval activity in the south china sea threatens the free shipping of the world and radically change the globeleconomy well china might be thinging pretty seriously do i want to take an deep water blue water navies the united states even in my own back yard doat is thiis that a conflectoin to take on if the united states is really actually confident about trying to protact global shipping if the united states cannumen protect shipping in the red se against a bunch of pathetic pirates who the pirates illiterate jack asses why exactly with china look and america's naval power and shutter there would have to believe that going up aginst the chinese the united states is whible to be a lot more wary and careful tan they would against vawhoo thes but still everybody everybody continues toam to futs around crispan hollan tane person who sang i'm very worried about civilian casualteeas in the gosrom same idiot he says i wory about escalation in the resy oh do you you worry about that escllation i notice the escalltion is already happening from the whoo thes are attacking ships i worryed orry you that this is about to escala and anactually i mean should it askclaven terms of the united states actually attacking these whothy positions in yerm well i worry a lot about escalation i both in the red seaaria with with the who tastein tas you say we shot down a their droants we all have to keep an i have the nor their front i wif hespul this is why hy president by n send two aircraft carriers a groups a to the reachons to prevent that kind of escolation to send a message to eron to haspola and others look i think that the administration has been smart in terms of howits responded a to those attacks but but clearly the risk of an american a being killed a in the process a it is high and that would obviously prete a a a big response fror the united states or the united states could not wait until namerican is killed and just evicerate thehoo thes without again engaging a nation building you are talking about whether the world most formidable military most formidable military in history is capable of tamping down a small kitchen fire that is what youare talking about right

very concerned about the state of the united states senit because of course that place is basically kindo useless at this point all they seem to do is aff around well then that is apparently all they actually do in the worst story of the day and there a lot o bad stories im it turns out that there is a democrat staffer ithis person's name is adan mace jeropski a staffor for maryland democrat sentor ben carden he was terminated over the weekand because he was identified on line as a legedly one of the two participants in a very graphic porin vidio filmed in a sentat hering room tatvidio was then shared in the chat of a private group for gamen an politics according to the daily caller in his ot linkdon page mase jerropski claim to be victim of prejudice ah d i man ah there is many jokes i cannot say it now many jokes i cannot say right now he said he was being attack for who i love to pursue a political agent and no i'm pretty sure its cus y a bang to dud in the sendat hering room on tape you took et the american people artaking it from congress every single day according to bad political remarkd thou we definitely advised finding a lawyer he said he did not say he was in th vitio he said any attempts to characterized my actions otherwise are fabricate he said who never disrespect my workplace i will be exploring what legal options are available to me in these matters what le ya yur the victim youre the victim the subhad line by the way from en b s red quote conservative news outlets allege that the aid to center bencardn appuredn a leaked vidio showing men having sacon a sentat hering room a a juisial high republican a act miller has also identified this person this is the same person who said free palistined et him last week ah it is all one story it is all one big story all f life one big meta narrative yes indeed a charter member of a gae for palistine happening over here and bout a line is this this is what am congress is now good for in it the wer guis could you you kno rain in the national dat ano build up the military an best we can do is been give you an aid who bangs i a gadud bangs in this room amazing stuffo again i i where is all of this coming from wers i mean it is coming from an entire culture the basically says that the chief form of human intellectual development is sax there is a wit there is an entire article from political magazine about the nations outgoing astidy chief here is the tetaquote sex is a normal activity and part of our human experience and this idea that all over america people are s deeply ashamed of sex thon will not talk about it have you been in america lately in the last few decates i'm pretty sure it is all americans talk about for last several decades doctor leandromena has plenty of reasons to lie awake at night over the two years he led the sedy se's division of estity prevention he is seen sexually transmitted infections het recon levels including the highest number of civilist cases since the trueman administration sovistha he is doing an incredible job he is doing a really really good job but he says the biggest problem he is really our culture we as a society have a tremendous difficulty talking about sex and recognizing that sex is a normal activity and part f our human experience with much stigma around sex it bleads right into the general population and acts a wall that prevents them from accessing the services that they need yes america's giant esity break out i's because people are too shy talking about sex nailed it that is probably it or alternatively we are a godless culture that has champion the animal insthingt above it every part of what it means to be a meaningful human being and this is why you can do a gay porn bidio in the senate and then act a victim in ori culture you are a member of the marginalize you are only a senate staff for you are member of the marginalize now jostor ridiculous well t whell speaking of people i getting screwed at the senate the senate continues to futs around on this border slash ucrane slash israel lshed iwan funding bill apparently the democrats are still attempting to hulb up negotiations with regard to border provisions on this giant one hundredn five billion dollar spending package democrats art are not really making clear what exactly there negotiating position is publicans arent making clear whith there negotiating position is on the border representive torning in ils repubican antexis he says lis not were close by re publicans the they cannot wait on making a border deal that is why we are putting it in there in the first place if this is an emergency you wint intheory want thus to move quickly has the speaker giving you any indication of a time line if the senate can get the steal he has't and i do not think many people have even on the senate side an mean the easiest thing to do in politics as just a way yet al wait for somebody else to pop their head out and build a frame work and and and put it all together and time is runnyn ow we are we are at a national security crisis point now i mean think back to bei director testifying and saying every every ate i'm looking at is blinking red and meanwhile senera linsey gram he says guys negotiations are not that close to resolution oids am nothin's happening let start with the borders ar negotiation there is much focus on that you have been foce on that can you bring us up to speed what is the very latest te thing t there is going to be a deal before the new year ih no i think ca this will go into next year i've been talking to the people at the table am the white house got engage five days ago they sent over a supplemental what border security provision that tid nothing to change policy wemen talkin tom since september five days ago they founally sa thi table seral an ers doing a good job ah the bottom line here is a we fill ot we are being jammed we are not anywhere close to deal to what exactly our democrats doing here because again as thiave said before this ould be a big wind wind for jobide if he passes a bill and gets as you crane funning and is israel funding tis ro funning is by partisan popular and borda security which aster would be good for him what exactly is he waiting for the answer is that this is a twenty twenty four election ploy the sentibil that is what this is that is why they are jamming everybody up on the border here is the calculation the jobidon and th democrates are making the calculation is that americans we will want the ou cranade and the israelade but the democrats cannot make a border deal with those crazy republicans because the crazy republicans our bunch of racis trump that is the deal that they would rather kill the bill theyn't claim at the donal trump is of racist basically that is the logic it is being carried out that involves two prongs one is claiming that republicans are propooten that they will not just pass the clean ou crane bill this is a gan senator crisvanhollan idiot for marilan suggesting it is a pivital moment for american leadership in history not pivital the t e latlisho passa bill be pivil enough to to gran stand about it thing it is essensial that we a provid military sistance as you crane this is a pivit old woman a in american leadership a and history a and we need to make sure ah that we help are you craniin frands against putens aggression not just to protect their freedom ah but because it would send a terrible signal around the world ah to our allies who would no longer trust us a and to our advressaries i would be inbolding if we are not doing that i do love the mix signals from van holland when comes to israels they got we got a stop this is that is to stopen comesto grinsic o man our allies will will just be theugt they will be afraid if we abandon you crane it is allmics butt why will not they ja sign the borderdeal there 's the once on the borddeal is they need to keep the border issuealive they thing because they think that f they kep the borderish alive there can be able to pullorize the american population around the borderisshue whih again is a very weird calculation being made wht are they counting on there but if you look at the poles what you see is americans trust republicans on emogration way more than the trustrant democrats which is why you would think that if this were nineteen ninety eight an dick morse running the clen administration there would be some sort of tryangulation were democrats would sign on to border security provinsions they are not doing that why the answer is they believe the donal trumple stick is footdentis throde that is they believe they believe the donal trump we will make even the right wing at mogration position thet most americans and ure sympathetic too unpaladable that was the story over the weeken with regard to the trum campaign right now the poles are kind of fascinating y what trump seems to be way i hadbt agin i was a weird state to pulkas to cocestate it is not just a straight up democratic boots state it is a place where you get together in little rooms ith groups n then tyour first choices and second choices if you vie for nickey hayleinchis make the run off that you can shift our vote tha to santis somethnglike tat still a possibility that te santis could win i wa'l it t latest poll has trump up over thirty points in iwa things are getting a lot closere in new hampshire however the latest pole trum new hampstur has trump up only fifteen forty forto twenty nine over nickey haily an there still none of ther twenty one per sent out standwichin cristy and santis in ne hampshire things are starn get a little tight in new hampshire for presen end trumps comfort donal trump was back out on the stump and this is goin to be the biggest problem in his campaign is that he is just con to say things that set things on fire here is donal trump over the week gen and yhou's tag metemogration now i think that this comment is being rather de liberately miss red by the meta because is the usual arrangement however es donal trump ap you say things that set things on fire yaw that is literally is not hir creers o houre is trump ralling in new hampshire plenty of the other ligt right we have gat plenty of the otther let we get a lot of work to do they know when they let i think the real numbers sixteen sixteen million people into our country when they do that twe get a lout of work to do theyv poisoning the blood of our country thats whit they don they poison ment to len sifteetions and prisons all over the world not just tinc south and mor camnot just tet three o for countries tho we they com ba but all over the world that coming in to er tountry trum afric ca from a o all over the world that pouring into our country nobodies in looking an em they just come in that the crime is to to be tremendous tet terrors an mis con to be terr iso is tgoing to bein and we built that tremendous ty tof the world and then we ge to build more nay this is why jo bidon and democrats are gambling i'm not passing a bill that incloose bord security becaus wit they are hoping is that they will be able to play comments one that trump just made there and say that what trumpis trunt trumps imogration policies racist get the ot ofthe colition that dis possessed to stop frum that is o their hoping now in get to what i think trump actually is saying there in his words in just one second ius th again i think this is deliberate mistreet first in a world filled with un certainties you nee to be prepared

entire democratic line of attack with regard to migrations that trump is races they ben using the since twenty fifteen it did not work then i don things can work now it is part and parcel of their broader trump is laring in figure stick trump again he makes this comment where he says they are poisoning the blood of our country and he is talking about democrats it jus to analyze the actual verbiage that donald trump uses right the win plate again because the one the big promise that trum talks is that he never makes his antecedents clear in anteceden is the thig you mean we say they if id say they inocentence they re firs to some people you do not know which people i'm re ferring to if the antecedent is unclear trump does not make the ancedens clir in this particular clip he usees they to refer to two separate things without actually switching the ancedents weared play the clip again and rashing n a stopit i now it is this appruderphone but that is true everytime oe try to decot trumpism he hear i hear is trump wat's playwon mer time whenty of the other light right we have hat plenty at the other let we get alot of work to do the know when they let i think the real numbers sixteen sixteen million people into our country when they do that we get a lot of work to do they poisoning the blood of our country that is what they'v done they poison men had to loncitin to ook iht when he says they who is he talking about clearly democrats riht he much as political opposition he saing they are letting every one into the country they are poisoning the blut not imogrants they meaning that when you have a brand open border nyou are letting in anyone up to an including people on the terrir watchlest when you are ltting people through who do not have any job qualifications when you are lettingtrough members of amus thirteen wel then you as the person in charge of them magration system are poisoning the blood of the country now i do not that phraseologyes again it is deliberately vague and hit is very inflamitory if red in a particular way which is have meediar reading it obviously he does not mean emigrants are poisoning the blood of the country he means that the people whare leaving the border open are their by de grading what it means to be american which is true for any country by the way that has completely open borders country's generally speaking with welfare states should not have completely open borders everybody is figuring down europe by the way again if yo just stop tho clipright dere what he is talking about is democrats then he moves on he starts talking about imigrans but he start he use the same what he sas they right but that they he is now referring to are emogrants ishosan prisons all over the world thot just in south and ther can not just tat three or fo our countries we they can be but all over the world that coming in to a country from afri ca from asio all over the world that pouring into our country nobodyes iin lookin anf they just come in that the crime is cun to be tremendous the terrrs if this con to be theyre s hes washing nows which topics right he is not talking about the emigrants themselves he says they are coming ito our country that pouring in from all thse different places the crimes gin to be tremendous an lthe rest ther's no different from anything tht he is been saying by a legal imigration the whole time what the media are doing is there saing tha whnhe says a there poisong the bood of our country that is the quote that is the big cathquot they are using that to say that he means emigrants a supposed to democrats setting emigration policy an here is sianan doing precisely this routine yesterday the sean ens guess at ruth benge out whos now she she is getting a second life as a commentateor here because she wrote some books on fashism and now gets to say the trump is one witisina this is faciis treteric awers about leading the blad a superior ra a a is the standard not sistem it is natcust the nacys is oso fachios and itly a wisliny rirly taabot cilling ra ticabatotrump isi teminin an earlier speech he talked about hering rat to i bingin a infectiis titetis and conlinessn into italy again he is musoliny he is killer tbecaus whenhe says there poisoning the blood he means imigrant again read the comments or listen to them he is talking bout democrats setting open borders policies that is what hes talking about just to be clear chris cristy of course his jumping on this why chris christy's stone mraces beyond me chris christy is going to be the rasionall for why down trumpwin's new hampshire if he stays in right now his membership in that race is keeping mickey hailey from being neck and neck with trump but he' saying in anyway for no reason that anyone can discern he is curnetly running by the way fourth in new hampshire afteronisantis sauthenaca africa asia emigrants poisoning the blood of our country the words of the leading republiconpessineuncs o candidat your response again that is not ra he is disgusting and what he is doing is dog wistlin to americans who feel absolutely under stress and strained from the economy and from the coflicts around the world he is dog wist it to blam with our people from areas that do not look us and look cake the other oioi itis isn altright and the by administration to the same thing they said quot to night downal trump channels his roll models as he parodet at of fit lor praise com junglan and quote of lood re pooten while running for president on a promise to rule as dictator and threaten american democracy riht this is going to be the strict this is the reason they are not cutting some sort of bor deal because they continue to believe strongly tat if they run against trump then any deal they caght with re publicans will look a deal with trump they wofld rather tget nothing done in the senate they wofld rather let ou crane and israel anti wan aid all die then give some sort of border deal apparently to the republicans they would much rather sit aside and let all that tiyes that they can yell at trump and suggest that the republicans our fashos trumptools that is the basic idea that that is the only logic that i can di cern for why jobiton has not just cut a bordeal by now that is what literally the only rash now i can think of for why they have not just cut a borddeal which would be a net wind for him if he did it would take himigration partially off the table cause he could say he trangulated on the issue already in just one second we will get too

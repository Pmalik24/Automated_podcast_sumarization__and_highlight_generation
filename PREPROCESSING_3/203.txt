peaceful until a stranger comes to town buys up smland the neghbours are an exactly show what to make of the sky and then problem start an things escoate and he pretty serious and intense way probably because this new guy not only des he not played by the rules he bact he seems to feed off breaking them the strice can be the rest of our shoteday or put him i gigliel tells what happen it all started with a gate a man named daniel bonier but a wooded thirty acre property between some farmland and a slate quarry back an twenty thirteen the neighbors sidnce he much of him for a while they know his construction vehicles rumbling up and down the road and the figure ing was building a house mandy huet and her husband rich on a farm next or daniel's property here is mandy a good friend of ours ustown that property and he sold the property to him and the very first time we met him he came down to the farm and he was actually he was o cay om but the next thing renew is two weeks later he was erecting a gat on our property daniel's land is actually surrounded by other people's property it is kind an island in order to access it he has the right to cross the hule's land there is a long driveway daniel put a gate at his end of it but his gate was on the huelets property many in richer in their forties they have two kids the own lot of farmland an a trucking company rich grew up there his familys been in the area since before the civil war rich approached him in said yeu do know that ye put te gate li an a ten feet on to our property and he is ull but my gate wherever i want u for my gate and richte woin in for mot we yon't we put a gate on er own property or on the propery line not on somebody else's property and you have i think he gave him two or three weeks three move it if ye do not om tin to come remove it and he is your never getto getting get that o the ground he gave him two or three weeks and he did not move it ri t went up with a payloater and o brought a witness for them as well and just piks it up off out of the ground and tossed it onto his property back goun to his own property te that things wereof to abaut start daniel was ae new comer to the area he was from ut state new york but other than that he was guarded about his backgroundhe told one neighbor he don in the army then there was a rumor around town that he been a navy seor or federal agent or something it was not clear and just a word about the place he moved to this part of paulit it is bit isolated up on a hell thereabout doesen households all spread out along couple of roads there are the hulets john davis of the atnound that in his wife bow then down the hill is bact to cat a former librarian in her huseband ray paulm ma shell to lander a grandparent moved the areal about ten

day the woods erupted with gunfire hundreds and hundreds of grounds this is bath mosed to cat the former librarian i mean it was just shooting on a daily basis de e de d d de d de de de de de d i want a point out paula is not a gunshy tound bat told me that gon fire is the sound of for mound she is a long time and aray member the areis mixed politically some of the neighbors bo ter for trom others went frobiding but none of them has a problem with fire ans farmers have their varment guns and hunters have their rifles d no one abouts an i at a neighbor doing some practice with an air of fifteen this was different we did not know what was going on whe li sonds get now this is mashell tolander the grandmother who lives with her husband paul ye earn for mit you expect to hear somebody out there ponkin away at their targets getting ready for turkey season or hunting season or wer just keepin their their fire rarms in to o we do that that is expected but not what we heard that was totally out of his own oh did you did you try reproaching the tepoint no at that point i was to afraid to approach anybody that was firing that much wepinry because that that is just not that is not garmal certainly for this area oh i do not think i would want approach anybody that was firing off you do not thousand rounds that is carry daniel had ope up a gun range he john davis to be at nonbat whic tept off about it by a friend jon got in his trot and drove up and down the hill knocking on doors to alert everyone he told me it was paul rever's ride mandy hulet and another neighbor walk the property line around daniel's place he peered through the trees and saw some silhouette targets in dirk burns maniel worrid that some one would end of shooting towards the road nwand the trajectory of those bullets is actually right to my brother mos house and men right to the schoolal rigto in th hel the neighbors did not ant a shooting range in their back yard daniel had filed for a permit not t open a shooting range but for what he called a school apparently where he would do class from fire arms instruction in order to build the school on his property daniel need permission to widened his driveway through the neighbor's land he asked the culets if they would give him the extraspace hulet said no his neighbors on the other side said kno as well daniel perment application for a school was denied but he would a ready put up the building and he just kept going he also did not have the right permit to operate a shooting range on his land fut of course he was doing that to bhut he was developing was a sprawling facility the kind that military contractors or lawnforcemen for a self styled militia might use he called at slate ridge i reshout to daniel he did not want to be interviewed but he laced the whole thing out in the shoo to bidio slate ridge is one hundred per cent predicated on the practicion mot gon fidters professionals that use the firearm as at tool in the line of their employment danielis six feet tall and stouts if he bushy beard lot's how he talks nots to jargon si sothe vidio was shot by a dude named adam mc clean who associates himself with the boogaloo boys an arme movement that calls for civil war his twitter handl is who jahaden this is tis is range wantniss is this is whats started go slate rige right i built this first and i you do not continue to froseeo enough to proceed on ma drain he shows adam thes wriand is surprisingly fancy bunk house in two shooting ranges one with the rap round burm that sintended to lett people fire in multiple directionises the more closely mirror veolite combat ithere is a spot where people can practice entering and clearing a building and a place where they could detinate explosives after the tour daniel adam sit down for an interane your proper contractor is ir hollow we bout comfort fr for several years sever years s er years yesir in the vidio daniel's wearing green military style cargo pans in green rap round shades he tells adam the origin story of slate ridge ors he says the idea came to him on his first overseezs employment as a private military contractor i remember that day he was yes yesterday a bunked up with about twelve guies that i had no idea who they were i did not know much about them i i tried out with these guyes i i i made it on the team and then we get we get ther right wereout of the not as tiys of america and were worthe and that night when we hid our bunks i watched with all do respect because some of those guys i'v become very good friends with some of those guies are arm abautlebodies now and some of those guyes a i would leave for them but a lot of then turned into a totally different person o here we had men prying shivering and second guess in themselves and i sat there and i watched these men and i said wile what did i get myself into the problem was they were not properly train he dside to start his own training facilityhe tells adam he put one point six million dours of his own money as building the place to daniel slatebridch's more than the shooting range the place for people who defined themselves by owning gons he refers to himself as a professional gun fighte you kdo not in the military we ha the three es the misi te man in me i always tat the last i'm an army guy he tells adam daniel talks about his service alot at one town meeting where he made his case for the school building he described himself as a veteran whose passionate about gons he paints his work as a private contractor in patriotic terms in cort he tells state judge a a a a an to iin on fore i a a e la we s in o travel for ca te ta t sto shan the neighbors wondered if even the most basic part of his biography that he would been in the military was a lie john davis to be at nonbat was not sure he bought it he fear of vetr its nothing more this reputable somebody claims to the something he is and ga i have no use for people go around in act likter something they as after site ridge opend at the end of twenty seventeen is face book page racked up a few thousand followers daniel stard referring to them as the slate ridge family he host to class is unshooting and tactical training and feeld for st ade the neighbors would see strangers driving up and down their sherider road sometimes the shooting would go on all weekan the neighbors had been all that close before the started just friendly in that small town kinawy but the conflick with daniel brought them together they stard meeting an john davishis workshop sometimes a couple doesn people would show up their weapon of choice was as american as the winchester rifle theszony laws those most base ook rools for how neighbors o going to live next to one another this arrea was owned residential and agricultural danielwent back to the town and argued for avariance in this owning laws hecould finally get a permit for the school building forty six peoples find ampetition opposing this they showed up at the town meeting in force here is ma shell yen i thought maybe de town would step in and we would go to couple board meetings we thought for sure it would be brought into control i'd say within six months there is no recording of the meeting were daniel asked for theiszowning varriancs but there is official minutes this kind of captures the feeling of it quote darry hadtoca addressed aboard as an abutting landown or an interested party mister hadtica explained that as an owner of a horse table they have a lot to lose that they do not want to live through a war and that they were there first he expressed that he wishes to stay on their property and his entitled to peace and quiet but the towns owning board descided in daniel favor said he was right he could have his owning variance for the shool building the neighbors appealed for the next few years he would applied for permints they trid to stop him sometimes they want sometimes he wan and made appeal to the town or the state court ventually the town ofpolit took the neighbor's side and fo the case against daniel too for violating itszowning las but this kind of thing can move really slowly bat the former librarian knew the states environ mental laws and looked for a way to use them against daniel she peered into his property from a neighbor's yard one day and notice what looked whetlands those are often protectin in vermant which is no small thing because the state contrack down on people for even small seeming environmental problems manure they now we were farmers we are allowed to spread manure april fifteenth we start to spread our manure and december fifteenth is are cut off december sixteenth comes along and you spread agency of natural resources would be quick here on a fly on why and we would be fine e that is an of our mentors she was ona local conservation board at time the beoutiful she contact of the states department of agriculture and the natural resources board trying to get some one to investigate there was no quickeres pins nobody stepped in to stop daniel and it was all falling upon dath ers whod'll we go to who do we tell whoo we talk til daniel fought back in not just in the town hall on the courtz in the winter of twenty nineteen the neghbors got holiday cards with the slate ridge local printed on them each one had the hand written vessage here is mishell

meeting in his huge plassic ben the kind youe storyol close in wthe reech label carefully with label maker thereis pallit his owning regulations and slate ridge facebook postings and odds and ends slashed unfinished business w re this was the moment i realized how much the conflict with daniel had taken over the neighbors lives there is nemy twenty of these binders inside ore all the pieces of information that the neighbors had spent the last few years obsessively documenting about daniel in slate ridge me shal wiss wis to saynd inside this blinder here threats post of cards and an n also

dissiples posted oh really there awayse we caut our visit short last fall the slate rige face book account posted a photo of an as u v and said they were looking for one it to use for something called

the count posted o vidio that is a gentleman of tes is a nine milli meter a mettal jacket hundred and sis sein grain bullet while daniel narrates the vidio shows a close up but the bronze bullet then pans to the drivers side of the silver car that went through this door through the car the door has been shot through mouthful times right for some one has written the words or hulet trucking down it that is named one the businesses the hulatone if you think you can hide in your car me think on the door from a bullet you are ong mandy huwilid aventually got a no stalking order against daniel and the slators face woit pages down now but the neighbours say was not just threats but accusations smears and that slaterage supporters would then and comment on the posts it is just a traginates idle threats and it is it is just once again psychologics my or er i swon if h has nockle heads it is bee going up there takes it a different way and takes it to another level yes they worried about daniel supporters a few of the people training at slate ridge suggested on line that they were affiliated with the national miltin groups the threeper scenters or a small local outfit with the grandios name of the remont state militia some of the eighbors did go to the police but non of the things that daniel and his supporters were doing seemed likely to bring criminal charges at cu beu really hard to proscute threats these unless are very pacific daniel din jus go after the neighbors he may nat souned the town itself was conspiring against him they were al on league with hulets who he saw as his main opposition here he is at one town meeting accusing the board of treating him unfairly i bely tistemo os is t colf it te interest i suppress my ri i misis is inis duty in three pass nodaniel points out that jons a board member has work for the trucking company owned by the hulet family then he pivots to a different and very surprising attack further furmore ti man has n' tende a landi you y te ro the meeting he talking about is one of the ones the neighbors held to stratagize about shutting down daniel slate ridge but daniels calling it a clan meeting as in the cuclux clan he saing the

included a picture of polet us town hall and said no alarm no security camera single pan windows no dead bolts thirty to forty minutes police response time dad's owne for all sell service no safero people wrote in the comments that it was as soft target and noted the women on staff often werke late another post urged supporters to assemble at a town meeting with weapons and tromicats though none of them actually showed up there were other problems to an two thousan eighteen daniel's bannd from pace university were he would been studying for a masters degree in home land security he would allegedly sent a deen death threats over tex message that led to a judge's orders spending his pistol permanent in new york requiring daniel to surrender his fire arms when police search his house they found a handgun which sled prosecutors in new york to charge him with two fellownies for criminal possession those are not resolved yet according to a prosecutor majority of daniel's pistols were transfered out of state resumably to vermnt up on the hll and poulet the conflict was threateng thes firal a sign posted on daniel's property read trest pass here die here one night two boys were beau hunting on the hulet us property here is what happened next according to allegationis made to police they shot a deer and trackes to daniel's land as they approached danel came down and threatened them one boy called his dad thengs descolated when daniel asked them to identify themselves they refused and then daniel sad oket you wanto play that gan i'll shoot you nobody got hurt in an daniel disputor that he threatened anyone no chargers were filed coming out whut a my giglyo looks into daniel's back round to tra ti figor at who daniel really is and just how worrie the neighbors should be that is in a minute chicago bublicadie whent ot progem continues tis mercin life my re last to days programm do not you be my neighbor what betdy must t the hour to day to the stoy of pollid vermant and what happene when one new person moved in itthis next part of the story but wht a my giglyo tris to answer the questions that last of people in town had about their new neighbor here is my i sawred writing about malicia groups and civil violence last year ever since i beengetting emals from people who were afraid of their neighbors there was a tennesse woman who suspected that hers were getting ready for quote a blood bath a michigan man who asked me if he should report a high school friend to authorities because of his face book posts people wan me to help them figure out how dangerous was their neighbor that was how i heard about slaterage and daniel some one who lives in your polet sent me a message aski ng if i might want to investigate you can drive yourself crazy these days wondering if everyone threatening violence as serious or only trolling when i was interviewing people in militia groups last year for example often had the feeling that was all just posturing that all their talk about civil violence was just a mask for other anxieties then some people of filiat with these groups according to te athe ey at leas to puart in the attack on the youas capital people consee m they are not really serious until they are daniel bonier's neighbors do not know howse gared they should be of him ti cowmandy hulet said in one moment that he is probably just full of hot air but also has that no stalking order against him and she wrote a facebook post saying she warntet people to know about dniel's threats in case anything never happened to her and thor all their researchen to daniel in the end neigbors really do not know that much about his background i spoke on the fome of than couple times but he would not let me record him and he was a fasive about almos every question i aske i spoke to the head of public safety in vermant the major from the state police who was their point person for daniel and some one from the rermant telligent center in ages he that coordinates between local and faderal lonforcemen i heven't sent his you to vidia with adam the boogaloogay to a recently retired agent from the ef te ey but in the end the person who knew them mose about daniel was his ex's wife jenhim a hard daniels they met in nineteen ninety two when she was sixteen and he was nineteen at our local mall there is a petzarea called roman delike and im dan was the petes o man there he you said pets mam you mean os his jon i'm literally the pets a man he was the guy that was making the pies jenia told me se and daniel both corrup and up state new york he had half siplings he did not really talk about he was close with his dad who died before they met daniel eventually quit his job at the petzs's shop an enrolled at the colinary institute of america but he dropped out right before he finished he had job running restaurancs for a bit jenia gop pregnant and soon after daniel decide to join the army and i thougt tht was a great idea good it is that is good work on a settin ourselves up were young family im good idea as he gets wor nand he leaves for basic training im men calls me a few days and to let me know that they found sists on his nack and that he was gotinto be coming home with a medical discharge pretty much two weeks to the day that i dropped him off at the arport i was picking him up again i because he had been discharged from the army for supposally thessists that he never did anything a bout m supposea ly medical discharge im i honestly do not know if that was the truth or if that was not the truth but im he was not in the army the national personal record sent or confirmed that daniel's time in the army last at all with two weeks wat ways the needin in joing to nilitary honestly h was security just strictly financial security not because he had any sort of calling to do or sense of duty or nothing that literally just o you theu for ridus wit the house to live in money security helth an shurance that sort of thing was he patranice you im not particularly know in talking with people close to daniel i got the sense that he did not believe in anything very strongly he is not an ideal ot he is not really maliciau type those ns w warn for hours about the constitution but e does to present himself a some one with a mysterious past me be even a dangerous one from the time he met jenat the petz's chop she told me he was sa jast tht he was connected with the moffia when john goty died d two thousand to daniel said he was distrau that he had to go to the funeral she says he did not go in

important to you fine and later on in years it was came up in conversationn he now i think i think some one was asking us together and and then he was going to know i made that up is are you serious you mean that ap you told me that as own an an aal now ye s guess te col name i just needed you to be nor you atyet i was not happy was the moff yie thing ci was it important to his present ation it was honestly i mean he he meeds to be the toughestky in the realm after he was discharged from the army daniel eventually starged landscaping business he called it two tiano bogante excavation also fake words he had an ack for landscaping i actually found an old article about him winningin award for stonewall preservation but his record concludes at least a dozen court cases people he old money to who he never paid the car re possession a mortgage nefo e two thousand six he plad guilty to making of bake porkman's comclane e the landscaping business fa for bankruptcy into thous in the li jeniu said daniel was abusid she said he hid her monthbl times she said she did not fau police raport about it but told her terapist and her best friend who both confirmed this once they were arguing the car and daniel reached over in bashure had against the window rody was there he said he remembers it and in there were periods when things would be oke he could be hard free in his own family to know t to make of thim daniel and embrody did not speak for several years the reconnected when nebrody was eighteen daniel had an entirely new personner he was just different he had a different m way if carrying himself he seemed more military life style then he was oh ym im executive protection security and i asked him to explain it and as ike your scurity garder it a contractor he was lik tit thit the exact words this cas is such a stupid statement i i remember it he says a i escorted essential and non essential personel through the theater of battle am and i was a oke cool and then i remembe him saying it i remember him saying it to other people as for daniel's claimd that he is a private military contractor he did starsecurity company called garmdynamics in twenty fourteen with a gi name eaenspurgeon a former officer in the sweedish military the two of them met and an executive protection training course denmark heinsaid at the training daniel rally impressed him he said looked he had real experience did he say hed tt what are not he tells the worklic had it been over sees had at been in high stress in vironments ike anything thet y i said he had a oversees contracts and a a with he was government and also bit the provesector a and again it frfrom my background im i'm proe not to and ask questions as really its if if it is not my need to know that i'm reallyed on an ask any questions the idea was that garm dynamics would do security contracting and train people in military tactics the garnwebside had seals from the department of homeland security in other government agencies on it but hen told me that the never actualy work for any of them he said daniel had assured him it was o katy used to logos the wetside also said the company was quote established in facility by lea military and government personnow was there aning alse that was a lhe militery overnen person on his iz you o wa wa there was only the too iut i do not know how he it how he had but but aganiel o enhancsing the market abilly of tethe company yewease a you mot you moly fasten tues of instry expirts frends ic analists a tel is exferts on the ground sources provided towgens to misicessn is that else just tat markerin ehyeh and ithere is a a picture o lik e this wont is n't a picture of his dues in the allcocter and their faces ore worrd ow ye i thats a stock foldow i think it is he insaid guard never got any contracts never did any trainings at least when he was there thentually daniel seeme be getting sucked more and more into his problems up in vermont and the company died daniel also register a second company that is still active but i could find only one person on linkton who sed he would work there and when i messaged him about this he toleave it from is profile it is hard to say for sure of daniel ever did work its private military contractor or if he did whether really intail dodging bullets in a rock as he once claim to me you cannot check that kind of thing through public reckor's requests and people who do private contractor work also usually have to signd on disclosure agreements the other work daniel says he is done his suecutive protection which is the business of guarding the rigch and fayments we were able to confirm one aspect of this daniel work for a time on a detail protecting bench a pero tcon servative commentator though he was ultimately fired from that jop oi spoke with a few people who consider themselves part of the slate rige family they see a thotally different version of daniel in the neighbors to sa mant the shum way is one of the cofounders of the vrermont state militia she says their survivalist they 're prety small group about ten members they train once a month she thirty two has four kids who called daniel uncle daniel she told me he is not dangerous at all he just some one who wants tha share is knowledge about guns he taught them all fire arm safety she and the other milish remembers drive about two hours to get to slate ridge you have know they are much closer ranges because the fasility is nice and because daniel is warm and welcoming she does not believe the eighbors are really a scared as they say she thinks the're exaggerating their fears because they do not want a noisy shooting range in their neighborhood and they are afraid of change they haven' even met us she told me she did think the face book threats were over the line after the he lot trucking vidiel she in some others in the slate rige framily told daniel he need o stop it was all part of wha she called a battle between neighbors which she did not see how coadand at this point but the think she was more worried about was the government taking daniel's lant it is a piece of him she told me in any community they are basic rules and laws we agree to live by it is how we are able to cose this butin pallit daniel was clearly not participating all that and the state agencies that are meant to enforce those rules do not seem to be able to do anything about it it is he is manage out maneuver them simply by creating chaos for instance with the states natural resource sport daniel might be inviolation of the vermont land ue slaw but they need to prove that he is running of business he says he is not that everything at slate ridgeis free and far the natural resources board has not been able to prove otherwise and take those cases in new york one of them is a restraining order against him which required him to surrender his firearms i asked long forcemen authorities an vermon about this could they inforced new yorks order go and sees his guns it said yes they could but here is the ironing yeuven know the eighbors have been hearing all tha shooting for long even though daniel talks about all the weapons he has there is no hard proof that he currently has any in his possession if you look at his face bok posts bodos mivios he never appears with gon for a while now some the eighbors have had this feeling that is new to them that the system 's familing them that the protection that they tought it provided is not actually there i think this can create the special kind of anxiety ant led them to take things into their own hands this is my caveller tast to this is this underneath your bedroom window te bath show me rather house with no machineray have weapons hidden everywhere just in case this is my favorite weapon yo shok on leading against the window this is my two forty three instraviton my beautiful camo flos two forty three i bought on he win because it was pretty it is got a

for the sallo rather thin the hollow a well normally i would er hollow point if i have to shoot a armen outside but these people up the road here they all wear armor plated yes with meall metal plates in him to and the penetrating power of a hollow point is much less than a solid point s i do not nlike the idea of having too be prepared for this but i think we have to something did happen from neighbors recently it actual looks slate rage might get shut down and he no ite ded it it was not the governor or the terney general er the eight tab wor the states natural resources board or the state police it was a tiny town of paulit there is only case fonaly worked his way through the courts and after years of delays in march a state superior court upheld the town zoning laws and ruled against daniel the neighbor say the shooting his stop for the most part but they still here construction noise from time to time they think he is building another two ranges the judge ordered daniel to dismantale the buildings of sleate ridge and pay a hundred dollars for each day he has not fixed his owning violations which came to forty six thousand six hundred dollars and his ruling he detailed how daniel has refused to comply with the town since two thousand seventy yeas he wrote quote mister baniais recor of compliance has been herendus daniel has a peald the ruling of course this is soldrd gon for abit and the is one thing that will not change even if the range get shut down even if the buildings get knot down daniel sto own that land and paul machell when everyone else upon

their parents knew for about a year when alks is growing up in sinsanatty these have the things that i remember about susan jordan me and her sittig in the back room and telling about the day camp i went to that summer i cannot get myself to shut up and they had alligators and sninks i can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the councillor had to catch it and on and on that me an susan flipping through one of thos time life books rockenrall through the decades the sixties she 's long brown hair she is incredibly skinny it is nineteen seventy five she is wearing bellbottom levus a faded jene jacket she points to a picture of a bloated man in a powder blue rinstone jump suit sitting cross it on a stage before a crowd of crying women that is my favorite picture of elbos she says this in formation seems somehow personal and im portnme an susan writing in her car i'm going through this pase wher i'm trying to notice things when we poll to a stopligh i stard trying to notice the guy in the motorcycle next to us he apparently does not want to be notice especially by a peculiar nine year old staring at him through the passenger window what you looking at he sneers i turn around fasted and face the dashboard did he say something to you susan askes what did he say to you nothing ah he din't say anything it is fine look greenlight tell me what he said what did he say to you i stay silent enough i tell her what he said she will get out of the car try to kick his ass which scares me but comforts me too ttt susan jordan swas our baby sir she watch my sister and me every day after school for a couple hours untill ar parents got home from work we did not know any adults her nd we loved her thi summer before i started fift grades after being with us for a year susan got another job the last time i saw her was christmas eve nineteen eighty two 'm sixteen a cashier at thriftway foods super marketan since an anni where lived the place is packed i'll twenty five registers are going people ar lined up half way to the back of the store i look up and there susan jordan she smiles we talk she does not have many items i check them through as slowly as i possibly can i cannot recall one thing we say to each other although i remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she is married she hands me some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems happy meanwhile there is a line of last minute christmas shopper is mounting behind her i tell her to hold on i'll try to get my break we can catch up she says great and steps aside i keep signalling to my manager but there is no one to relieve mefive ten fifteen minutes pass i keep glancing behind at susan making apologetic gestures i can still remember her standing there holding her one bag of gurseries smiling back on me finally she tapsmen in the sholder i have to o she says but i come in here all the time i'm sureill see around i worked tot thro toi for two more years i nevber sow susan dordnan he is me crazy that i never saw her again if i had not run into at thi tore i do not thing i care but somehow having her play with to me seemed a huge roll in my life when i was a kid and then getting just the taste of what would be to talk with her as a peer i've never forgotten that momeni know it is ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she is up to wondering if she ever thinks about me i decide to find her i start with my only lead the one former employer of hers that i know i'm om i oi i doyou ont know i'm calling i do i you remember susan jordan wright an curt curit ye ri a bout but i cannot i i she was our baby sait her o i a cicin mi an my at one of the many ideas that susan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname i think that is all i want to say about chicken legs in my ped i'd gone to my mother to fillin gaps in my memory of susan but she did not remember much more than i did a ae he a really hat or e reli qit yi o a i i wi i he in have a fery meanin oerli i wi you o me te i e rel ci it you i have wit an at her at a avi a bout e an it an a ever at round en i came home he out e ere whe talking to my mim did do was make me look at my childhood memories from an adult prospect of for example what i remembered about her living situation i di ga imn aan an e i i i her hanly i go a peton ery mi in ut on her ery er young i i can mi a en i areaking wi her on harin gri a cim that is that is what yes he that is that my memory is that i she was an hi school right she went to way out but but i also remember her living on her for somehow i remember her own house ye and i'm the reason i thougt that she lived by herself as we went we went to some we went to her house or her boy we had to go picked something up somewhere and we were in her card this big blue dust or i think it was and im her boyfrend was there and her and her boyfrent had let the cats out and therwer they were gone and she was furious and and i got in the car and and then she slam the door and i think we peeled out and he was srt of standing he was he was sort of standing there and saying trying to trying to reason with her and we were out of there what di yoi it made me i think i felt sad for her i remember thinking in this is sort of in retrospect but i think i had some sort of inkling of this idea at the time i'm just i'm just sert of now realizing of it but i think iemember thinking that he was one of the few people that she had in her life and she couldt even realy depend on him yo oue omly ri i o an o wa you you mi a in now a tat point a tat moen her only en o my mind did not have any idea where i could find susan which made things difficult because a susan jordan is a very common name and be it is prawling on her name any more i called the county court record's department to find all the susan jordan's married an sincinatty my ma masked a friend who worked for the city to search all the since natty birth records i contactat high school along my associations i asked friends at high powered newspapers to run back ground checks finally there was one former susan jordan who stood out she seemed the right age she was married living at a since natty suburb shead a couple kids her husband was a lawyer i got her number from information and it was not until i sat down to caller that it hit me a phone call from some one you baby set twenty years ago might not be a welcome surprise but in fact strange and creepy here i am practising sounding benign one too went too susan is tis susan jordan is is susan jordan finally i made the call well hello i this this susan ye i i'm my name's alex bloomberg and i'm i'm calling from from a radio programm i caled this american life and i'm this is a privery strange funk call the receive but i was wondering first whald you do you remember me it turns out there are a lot of susan jordans who do not remember me a lot one got even called his ex wife a former susan jordan and then called me back to tell me she would never heard of me i was getting nmwhere by myself i contacted a professional one irving bot winnock a sertified new york city private investigate er three days after puttng him on the case i got a message saying he would found her i called him back i calle it it mornyerlyor av a derty i you god morti oi i gi you orkat i lii a some one i you oitit ary i wi la pparticulargole aa a wit a ti wi you jorn oybody i wik pumberg right awayi beg a ou ceri part about the hoday ou she aly you remember you an h got a carl you hello is this susan this is alec bloomperg i o inly i'm toing o ka how are you i yi tin i men me i got your ee mal yeali i an i i called you a workin that i realise that i i'd also gotin this number from the from the private investigator susan and i talked for ever three hours on the founds is catching up comparing notes ishe asked about my sister and kids that yued to lof in the street and oure old family dai how are you going i'm doo ke it was amazing how much she rememberedand how much we remembered in comment even small incidents the time that we were stopped at the traffic light and i stared too long at the guy in the motorsecle i think i remember that wi thi goin eury atin meoter probably probably and you said did he say something to you and i said no he did not say anythng to ma you said ut he said something to you did not and you were bout to get out of the car i thin ti agiza as i'm sure i think i can remember your he i think you were thin ery you wul you in in you lat wer you afrad i was terrified a ei did not know that he would noticein ma but i i dot worry i i wul hakin oin i had no fear a till in ye do you remember a time om wed os maybe six or seven or eight years after you baby st us om and i was worring yourdor yo y i ry o fer i norwa ey nor way rigt at the thrift away yet i re member i get hou were you bagging my gr try ad e but i did not reckon mi hou i do not and when you told me her you were an than i did right ni i think you said my pead t o my go i did wor yeu te people do all you at susan got married when she was still in college and went to work for the phone company as a repair person she spent the next twenty years or hanging from a telephone pole she said she hated about the money was good and round the time of her t marriage ended she finally got up the courage to quit and find work using her togree she now teaches at a special school from ment tilly ill childran she lives in florida with her second husband and she seems happy of course when you got back into the pass this you find how partial and in complete your memory is first ther are the facts you get wrong turns out susan had been a college freshman when she baby set us not in high school i thought my sister remember she ridden the motor cicle also not true and the guy who she gott n the fight with over the cats whoen my mind was her harry seventy's boy friend turn nout to be her room mates boy friend but besides the facts you change though the facts you completely omit that fight ove the cats susan had forgotten totally that i'd been there and it was a little strange because my presence was the only thing she would forgotten other details she remembered fine even the names of the cats themselves cot them an calm we were hil butwy remember that i and no ut i can'd a mad to what i could you ofit for i'm sure it was for you no think we were just running errands be e liky it is it is funny because when i when i i remember these very particular incidents and that was one of them an and probably the reason i remember it is because it seemed very significant to you i think i sense that is a kid that that you were that it was really upsetting to you because it it i think i felt at that time that you did not really have very many people in your life at that point you could trust o i did not have i did not have hardly anybody my whole family moved out a town i had no family gome i e i moved out the day i gratuat from my and i would dedn't in darted year early i had i cu when ow e ad i ound ot that i got tcollir shid i packed up that night why you wone t get out about could my family woul be cuntionel tut my mume it would pretty bed oomothe girl that i live wit i ad ad time hou woul taken ald i drod and her boy frend and every time i would come home tit would alway tri to get me ad drut woul and and i i really idn't do it i yat all and no it would really it would it wold cov to come home an i i ged i m i on i itle fed i mit i really mi my little brether and my little der and e were con yo nand no i would i ged may be trined at i think may be that is one of the reasons that i remember that we remember you fondly those because i think it worked both ways i think that we felt if that did make you feel closer to us i think that we we wesponded and if well i would ted for wy i tibookin for a family really bhut i mean it if only you knew you prombly wen ir me that i mean it tu keep were complicated now what i really wante to o wou in my time mit your momman did but i would terrified i mean i i could not i could not do it i shy no a lot of time they i dt would i thought they were i tin me e longer and calk and i would ju run out te i'm sure they were in i o wu know would to wuld carbit i ud could not do it she have talked to us instead sond yet i would comfortable round kid becau you no i had kid o my family every time the subject of her hard times came up i hear suttle hasit an see an susan's voice thet first i though it was embarrassment but that was not it exactly it was not until we would been talking for hours that i realized what it was she was waiting for the other shooter drop she had not forgotten that her passed it happened she just forgotten that i'd witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that had been knawing at her our entire conversation was that i was calling to say she damaged me by exposing me to it i do not think i would to kind back that becau i there was ta wo a turmil in my life and in my family and i that what my feri that i my a had an con an nekative in pack do not people and i know pobably i did on a cut keeple wut they were my ay but i be know you jut when i remember yet i would te bay be her t kid lof me loba bla bat i i would be tevi cn it if i heard any thin different o therre parts of your past you do not wan to go back to a parts of your self you doft wan to go back to and for susan jordan the ear for life that i remember is he ar she just te seen forget and to turns out i'd also done my best to forget what i was thager i did not think of my self this way at all but susan jorden reminded me in the gentles terms possible when i was nine i was anxious and bookish as kind of up tight not in mi then in tought that i cud ket think in me kid do not know had a play when i went to your room i did not i tidn't thin mi you had a whole lot of poi i i hope i got tu tri but u in li i there were mo we book and were educational thi i mean't i remember you had plan it thin your room and a canit dree that and i did not remember that kat had hardly any dalled you did not mean i quite a wi fol at thater kid that i had bay be that you didn bin more heried than general no manwy i think tad what i did wou trid a play perhaps the most amazing thing about the whole story is how little our memberies had deceived us about each other even if they had to see us about ourselves as susan said it one thoint each of us remembered what we needed to about the other i needed to remember the part of susan that she does not think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said she mustly rmember a side of my family that i just take for grantite that ws calm in our house that there were books there was not much fighting it would the first time in my life where i had ever bean that pe people lived differently in the w ay i le what i i did i wanted from my e you can try to return to childhood by looking at poters or visiting the old neighbourhood or

years back a couple of those new songs heven became number one hits on the uc charts is that his daem westof wherever comes at november coming out a fascinating day in the life of a future prime minister maybe that is an minute rm cigago buba gradio when our programm continues tis mar from mi from ir glass he' we can aprgrm of course we choose some theme bring you iffrent kinds of stories on that theme to day sho returned to childhood stories if people were visiting the past woud they find there would they do not find there wefers there to day show a few years back we have arrived to dat three of our show at three ariel scherom chimon paris david ben goryan and me sundos hen we re visit our childhood it is not very pleasant what we fined take for example our next guest when yoeu's a tean agor he istarted reading the biography of david bengorya the first prime minister of israel one of things that he arned is that all of his life david bengoryan kept a diary an woll package seem a good idea the job the diary december third nineteen eighty six wednesday another fascinating day in the life of adam davidson i've a mathtest to morrow i'm going to school early to tutora girl in my class for the aforementioned test my math class a joint precalculous and calculous class consists mainly of seniors not e specially interested in learning i guess that i am the quote class expert on quot and thet i always do the math problems which no one else can and for this i'm disliked i guess that because i apclime myself think clearly and do a little work as well as some intelligence helping out i am a geek in truth i am far from it when you first i read that to yourself when you first saw it of your reaction was it was pure horror wecently adam davidson an occasional contributor to our programm found his old high scol diaries adam's mamas is railly is tat is amarican adam grup in new york is body was in new york is brain asked the diaryes reveal somewhere else entirely i remember when i was writing it i remember very clearly although don i do not say this in the diary that it was very clear to me this was the diary of the future prime minister of his me im that that i would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the deep thoughts of a young zcionist as he prepared his way to lead his nation that are a regular listeners here in this american li can might remember that that you have been on our programm describing a your experience in is rally army summer camp that was right before i started writing this diary reat rea me another sure esee im there is much wrong with jews and israel that i'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing is the lack of any strong jewish identity among most jews this attitude sickens me you jews of the world stop worrying about money and well being i do not know what exactly i'll do but if this situation continues when i'm a bit old er then watch out world jewelry here comes adam and whash out whar l jenryhere comes adam was all in capital ent wow its inderthing that you actually are a dressing a readership no that is at that is its kind of mazing and that readership is is world jery ye the jews of the world will one day read this book and will say if he knew this at sixteen how could i be living badly could i tend to jus read one of the passages where you talk about israel sure e see i mean i have this thing from january fourth nineteen eighty seven i memorize the hope ho tikva which is the israelly national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in israel i amazing that here i am the surepoin minister israel and and what dad the things i need oll got i need to know the national anthem i i a dried upon to recite that itsom ore to be avagamers antist ap a thing your right exacjanuary fourteent nineteen eihty seven wednesday i am getting more and more angered by the effects of arab propaganda they blame the jews for everything and the world including jews go along with it entirely ridiculous i men i really thought this was this was a testament for the ages i really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and any one who would read it would immediately become axionist at sixteen i had such an inflated sense of myself there was much going on in my life then that i can remember and i was not recorting it instead i was creating this ridiculous fanasy of i'm not just as sixteen year old kid who havein crushes and a hopeless gee who cannot get a girl a kiss oment being scared and confused about growing old i'm i'm the future prime minister of israel and everything goes through that but i do not know i mean wause it maybe but may be keeping a diary wher one tells the truth may be that is a luxury of being a certain cond of person in a certain kind of situation it it maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy ye i think on i did not have much anxed about being the future prim minister of israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and i had much anxed about every other aspect of my life and i now seeit is just kind of maybe it was a good solution it was a good way to deal with this with with what i was going through to have this space where i could just be one of the greats i wont to what out the sixteen year old adam davidsan out would feel it knowing that finally an audience of a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary i think this would feel small to that sixteen year old this would feel nothing i mean i remember i was very disappointed and very sad about my parents mean i was reading biographies of course of all the prime ministers of israel and and i would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions will not effect millions of people l how is that enough motivation just to have your petty little craft in your petty little family in your small little apartment it just seemd tot en an me they have the tindolighe t a mee basically i i want en for myself for your saying those is that the sixteen year old you would be crenching an your thirty year old i think just as your thirty year old version is crenching at the sixteen din that is very true ye he would be very very disgusted if he heard the this race for peace it would seem i had settled in a pathetic wey added davidson these days sthe staff fider fror r a i when we were angels the story originally came to us from a graduate student helry frank was

on sunday and active duty are forse member set himself on fire in front of the is raily embass in washington d c to protest the war in gaza and this of course has unlocked all of the worst hords of the internat who have decided that apparently this member of the ar force was a disturbed anarchist was some sort of hero and that has some really bad implications for politics and for morality and for virtue let us start with the simple facts in this particular case the person's name was eran bushna arn bushonal was twenty five years old and he was in fact a disturbed anarchist how do we know that he was an anarchist well because he said first of all this should raise some serious questions about how we actually screened for the american military in the simple fact of the matter is s that the standards for the american military hade been dropping pretty radically this cius in ity specialist and he been i the military for several years and he was in fact an active anarchist now that the military has been targeting called white su premacy in the military if you are conservative in the military nou'r open about it that may call into question you are loyalty to the uss military apparently you can be a radical anarchist publicly and that has no implications whatsoever for your military service apparently yo can also be a disturbed person beags it turns out ye have to be kind of disturbed who set yourself literally on fire in front of these raily embassy to protesting non existin genicide which is what this person did according to the washington post quote less than two weeks before arand bushnal walk toward the gates of these really embisy on sunday he in a friend talkd by phone about their shared identities as anarchist and what kinds of risks and sacrifices were needed to be effective bushne mention nothing violent or self sacrificial then on sunday bushnall texted that friend who describe the exchange on the condition of aninimity to protect his safety quote i hope you will understand i love you this does not even make sente but i feel i'm going to miss you and thn he sent a friend a copy of his will on sunday in which he gave his cap to his neighbor and a fridgeful of rupe bears to his friend and then twelve minutes later he dows himself with liquid and set himself on firewhile shouting free palistine he died seven hours later at a hospital now what is amazing about all of this and we we know his passed we know that he was raised apparently on a cult religious compound we we know that he fell alt of that cult apparently and then he immediately went into the military and started associating with radical groups radical anarchist groups according again to the washington post bu pay bot boza thirty two sanch he meat bushnel and san antonio in twenty twenty two ad an ven for a socialist organization she said the bonded over their politics and started working together to deliver clothing and food to people experiencing homelessnest he was outrage he knew no one who as in charges listening to the protestors out ther every week barboza saide he knows that he has a privilege as a white man and a member of the military and in fact in the public statements that he released to the media before comitting suicide by burning himself to death this person included for example his pronounds in his suicide note the final post of erand bushnal said quat many of us to ask ourselves what would ie do if i was alive during slavery or the gimcrosouth or a partide what would i do of my country was comitting j enicide the answer is your doing it right now big anarchist symbol as this person is a a far leftist when not just a far left us but a disturbed far left is because theire lots peoplele are far left to do not set themselves on fire actually and when he says in his suicide notein is final note that he was cone cal complicit in genicide the question would be exactly how considering the united states air force is not even involved in the war in the gossip strip not only that there is not a genicide in the gossips trip i know that he is become common place for morons in the media to suggest that a targeted operation by thesraelies in the gossip strip that has killed according to the sraelies upwards of ten thousan members of commoss ware hiding among civilians thet that is somehow in example of a genicide but i can assure you that is definitionally wrong israel has complete air superiority for the one thousandth time in the gossip strip if israel wish to kill hundreds of thousands of people israel certainly has the air power to do israel has not done that in fact i know multible members of the military who been injured in israo going dor to dor in order to prevent civilian casualties in highly populated areas in which terris are extremely popular bushnell sent a note too one of these antefo violent extremest propagandicides called crime think and that note sad quote to day i am planning to engage inan extreme act of protest against the genicide of the palistonian people the below lingks should take you to a live strem and recorting recorded footage of that even which will be highly disturbing i asked the you make sure the fotage is preserved and reported on and apparently that group then said that they consulted his twitch account the user name displayed was lily and arkiddy which again sounds that totally sanirational person the usre i con was the circle a which of course is the anarchist movement and in the vidio arrand begins by introducing himself when my name is there in bushnal i'm an active duty member of yhou as airforce i will no longer be complicit an genicide about to engage in an extreme active protest but compared to what people haf been experiencing in palistine at the hands of their colonizers it is not extreme at all while mo actually turns out that setting yourself on fire in themiddle of the united states is tretty extreme says this is what our ruling class has decided will be normal while kno again that is a lie and then he says if your heart is brokn by the horrs in gossi nd youare prepared to bear significant consequences to try to stop them we urge you to do everything in you power to find comrades o make plans collectively lay the foundations for full life of resistance to colonialism in all forms of oppression that is what the the group says and then they acknowledge that the person sent he him in his byline on all of this the left has decided that this person is not a disturbed anarchist this person is actually a hero many people on left have decided that he is in facta hero for for foolishly and tragically kelling himself in the most terrific possible lay predicated on a complete lie that actually helps a geniidal terrorius group as it turns out sthe left has decided that this is an act of true heroism and and this is major names who are doing this sort of stuff for example jill stime put out a tweet saying rest in power errand bushnal may his sacrifice deep in our commitment to stop genicide now just personalbly you should not celebrate disturbd people burning themselves alive on the street in order to protest a non existent genicide you should not do that that is a terrible thing to do cornal lest doing the same thing by the way i notice that if they think this o the highest rom of virtue they are ot setting themselves on fire they'r geting disturb people to set themselves on fire apparently cornal les tweeted out let us never forget the extraordinary courage and commitments a brother arran bushnal who died for truth and justice by pray for his precious loved ones let us rededicate ourselves to genuine solidarity with palistinians undergoing genicital attacks in real time tand then burney sanders put out a statement of course burney sanders of course who who likes to siht his his birth as a jo as some sort of excuse for his idiocy but hea he put out a statement suggesting solidarity he said it is obviously a terrible tragedy but i think it speaks to the depths of despair that many people are feeling now about the herrific humanitarian is aster taking place in gas eye share those deep concerns the united states has got to stund e u u u o ababam a they are a couple of things that that all this reveals they the first thing that all this reveals is that there is in fact a tendency among radicals in politics to suggest that the real problem with ratical and terrible actson burning yourself alive is a radical and terrible act i is a bad thing to do just on a raw level disturb people burning themselves alive terrible thing to do but there is a suggestion than this extends to all sorts of crime tagainst your self and others becaus i do not thnk that you actually have a right to kill yourself the the basic idea is that radical acts suddenly become good if you agree with the motivation that really is just over zealousness thon' people ryot and they burn things that is truly an overzealous commitment to the cause and that is the language that yofre hearing here whell aran bushnal may have been over zealous but he was speaking on behalf of a good cause that of course suggests tht what they are doing is actually quite virtuous because they are overzelse they are passionate about it that they have to do this terrible thing which of course incentivize is peoplewho are disturbed to do terrible things that is not a good thing tat is a very bad thing in any coherent and cohese of society you do not want to insentivize people to take terrible acts or praise people for participating in terrible acts because they were just set thy were vers he was too good h as too use too over zealous too too virtuous gess that is number one number too victimizing yourself is not insurance against being called foolish it is foolish to burn yourself alive on behalf of a cause that is terrible that is a foolish and bad thing to do it is they are too problems here one is the burnt thethe actedself which is inherently terrible horrible for his family horrible for his friends i've the horrible for him that is awful and tragic and then the celebration of people who are mentally ill doing this sort of stuff disturb doing thi sort of stuffies beyon lig that sympathy that is compassion how explain but that is that is om ortnumber too there is thes tendency among people who are defenders of what happened here to suggest that if you point out that erin bushnal happened to be wrong on the merits that this is somehow being disrespectful to to eran bushnel are not not acnowledging the tragety of his death self victimization is a trachety no question it is also a tragedy as the name might suggest that is directed against yourself it is terrible and it is bad and it does not relieve you of the moral culpability for engaging in a bad act on behalf of a terrible cause and let us be clear right now when it comes to the gasa strip israel is engaged in an attempt to exstrpate in actual honest to god horrific terror group that committed the worst terrorise atrocity since world war too effectively speaking if you are taling about percenteng to the population in certainly since nine eleven in the west the attempt to extrpate that group in a highly populous area with heavy levels of civilian sympathy for the cause of the terrists means that israel is putting people in harm's way on a regular basis going street to street and house to house the fact that many people on the left our committed to the belief obviously this sort of frines phanom belief that any sort of violent radical action is justified in pursuit of quoe decolonialization and that therefore any response to that is an act of genicided me evil that is a lie and it is wrong and somebody doing something terrible to themself based on that wie does not mean that the lie is not the lie it is still a lie and it is still in act of foolishness the tragedy of aran bushnel does not obscure the fact that he happened to be wrong on the merits andtht sort of defense mechanism that you see out ther o magoch that o what how could you say that no he was he was wrong and the fact that he was wrong means that we should not in fact glorify his actions for why variety of reasons whic shuldn't glorify the cause that he was speaking on behalf of cause it happens to be morally in becilic and then you also should not glorify the act itself becaue the act itself is a bad act burning yourself alive is a bad thing too the fact that our society fails to see this is is amazing it also speaks to a a society that is deeply in need of some god because as we see th this sort of attempt to create heroism out of foolishness is amazing vulture has a piece today about a personamed victor cosaris who apparently is a playright and i'm on december want first instead of taking ther daily dose of the hivy medications ovada you nor this is going as soon as you say their dailydos unorthis is going the playright victor cas ar is films an instrogram that yo of the pill's funeral they burned the small white tablet on a ministure pir instead a geode their grand parents had brought from ellap hachy a mountain in towilla mexico across the border from their hometown of el passa texas that give their second pill a barial with the flower on top of the parents back yard the third r eceived a drop of cazerisis own blood while lucea's mendez is a more tenadi the themesong their favorite tellonovella growing up played as the sound track they are planning to do a final vity in which their last for pills get kidnap by pilgrim barby and turned to dust it has been almost three months since kazaras last took their meds a strike the say will continu until the norc theatre worshop workshop calls for a cease fire in gazap is tha sort of per formed of idiocy that we now s on parts to the radical left that if this i get's non byine ary h i v positive person dosn't take his hive pills until the local theatre group condemns what is going on in gaza somehow this is going to make the world they better place foolishness remains foolish no matter how dedicated you are to the foolishness the fact that this stuff is being given widespread media credibility speaks to why many people engage in t by the way mean why not youre doing it for the attention you are doing it for the credit you are doing it because you have engage in this far left sudo sacrifice if you are talking about kazaras in case of bushnal you was sacrificing something it just happens to be a sacrifice on behalf of a terrible cause and im and a sacrifice that actually is in act of wrong it is a wrong to burn herself alive again a what why thits has to be sed over and over is beyond me but that is whate we ars a civilization yes it is wrong to burn yourself alive to promote a lie that is a wrong thing to do it is tragic and also wrong but an order to understand all this what you really have to understand is the incensive structure that has now been created and that is that the media will cover you the way you want to be covered if you happen have the right political precepts if you are on the far left the media will cover you as though you are a hero if you are ashlly babbit an american military veteran who gets shot to death in the capital building well protesting slash rioting over the election then the media will treat you as though totally deserved to get shop you what you in fact our fool you are fool and it is your fault that you got shop and you are engage in a violent act and youre stupid and you deserved it that is according to the media if you are ashly babbit if you are arrand bushnal you are you are icon of military service who is a marter too correct causes because again that is the media narative and the media narrative rules above all and should understand that right now the media is not rule by people horsor main stream main line democrat liberals from forty years ago those people all got asked an destroyed the legacy media that size the narrative in cases this that legacy meda is dedicated to absolute raticalism hre's an amazing piece by a person in atimae rubenstine who worked at the new york times over at the atlantic and he talks about how he was hired to work at the oped page and then he was basically destroyed for it the beginning of his story tells you what you need to know about the political culture that has been created in our media and oure media of course then create the insensive structure for people in the public here is what he says in the atlanti quo on one of my first days at the you are t onts i went to an orientation with more than a dozen other new hirs we had to do an ice breaker tpick a star burst out of a jarn then answer a question my starburst was pink i believe an i had to answer the pink prompt which had me responds my favorite sandwich ros and daughters super heabster came to mine but i figured mentioning a nineteen dolar sand which was not a great way towan new friends ie blorted out the spicy chicken sandwich from chick filag and considered the ice broken the h ir representative leading the orientation chided me we do not do that here they hate gat people people started snapping their fingers in acclamation i had not been thinking about the fact that chick fillay was transgressive and liberal circles for it is chairman's opposition to ga merriage not the politics the chicken i quickly said but it was too late i sat down ashamed and that is the environment in news rooms all across america first of all it there is many layers to this particular idiocy onion and's an onion of iticyet you remove on layr this another wayer starwit the fact that chick filat is a chicken sandwich company and that the founders perspectives have no bearing on whether chick fillet wool for example surve gay people who walk and shic flay spoiler aler they will never mind the fact that saying that you a sandwich from a company with whose founder you disagree says nothing about your feelings about the founder of that company i lots of products from companies where i wildly disagree with the founder i is nan apple computer does that mean i agree with steeve jobs politically tats ridiculous and then ad on to that the fact that everybody in the newsroom starts with the silly snappy fingers thing pa that is a college mem can no one in te real world even knows what the hell your doing if you are in a room anywhere in america and peop'll started snapping their fingers in approval an acclamation no one wone kno what you were doing unless they were all gender studies majors a bround but that is your taffs armedia and because they staff armedia they create the narrative and because they create the narrative they create the insentof structures see wonder why people are getting more radical you wonder why people are suddenly finding it interesting to treat as a martyr disturb people burning themselves alive for far left causes say comoss that would be the reason ecause thadn sense of structure has been promoted by the biggest institutions in our society now meanwhile speaking of the conflict in the gossip strip the bine administration as always wonts to have it both ways the bigest prome t bin administrationmen comes to form policy is always and for ever jobidon cannot make up his mind jobide's pathologically incapable of taking clear positions on any issue anywhere this is true from new crane or he as not made clear exactly what his engule is or whetheri'sgin a slow walk the aid or a cin ovate ie once to give he is not made clear what the war is fory says its four democracy but that sort of will soni and language is almost always empty at's explain in real politic terms why exactly it is in americasentra interest to be involved by the way i think thaare very strong real politic reasons that i've articulated on the sho repeatedly why america ought to be finding you crane to prevent to take over of keeve by the russians but bidon is never articulated those reasons he does not find it necessary when it comes to israel bidingis doing the same thingis trying t split the baby and the reason he is trying to split the baby is because he understands that overwhelmingly the american public does not commass and is pro israel and on the other hnd he has a radical wing particularly the young people in his party the snappy fingers crowd or very into people burning themselves alive in front of the israli embassy an washington do see and jobidon is trying to plit the baby here by trying to get to an offram that does not exist that al fram is some sert of negotiated settlement with kommas israel of course has no interest in a negotiated settlement with kommass what bidon is trying to do is he is trying to cram down some form of seas fire that he hopes will turn into a permanent sees fire between israel ancomass and thes qon't qut end the war whole muskomass is wiling to surrender and go into exile for example that is not going to happen what is even more mazing is that jobiton reveals the internals of the actual foreign policy negotiations while eating ice cream with southmiers you won riht jobidn is unpopular this would be one of the reasons he is an incompetent boob whos spills the internal negotiations of complex foreign policy decisions involving literal human hostages including american citizens sitting in captivity well eating ice cremoun south mires who does that that is insane n encroaching sinility it is incroach the little's much here he was hanging out with a very old looking south mires here im eating ice cream men talking about the goza war that he is not out o touch at all folks ir el i ho y the van to we o eanelis my mi atre ie tell me theres wer corse r cose not gon my hope we wi thex for ils is far a first ruel of negotiations shut the fog up ein seriously that is the first ruele of negotiations be quiet why are you broadcasting out loud the conversation especially whene it is not true now again he wants to play ot both ways because on the one hand he wants to show that he is support of israek's te american public is support of of israel and is by the wy the majority the democratic party and he also wants to sho that he heres the concerns of his wild left wing basin what he is attempting to do is also wishcast s ther two wish casts that jobidon does when it comes to the mitdaeleast whish cast number one is to suggest that the war on israel's part is somehow the reflection of the quon't quut extreme governments that is a lie they have a war time a cabinets says he goes on southmirs and he says well i do not now israel might be losing the credibility the moral icitimis because o an extreme gon o heros that south mir's trying toblame israel's government for the ongoing war and saying that it is extreme it is a war t ime government benny gaunts is not a right winger benny gaunts is in the war cabinets is he unity government i said thi's a thousand times yef to be either ignorance about the workings of his raily government or deliberately lying in order to come to te conclusion that it'to mour ben gaveer who is the interior minister wa's very little paport in its rael right now that he is mor bengov ere is in charge of the levers of power in this war not true but he do nt say that anyway because again he is trying to establih moral equivalenttine israel ins enemies and in the mean time theur twomininisent people that are being killed and an israel slo down attacks on rofa they have to and thad mati commentmi to mather ana se toi that thers o vileevacuate significant portions of rofa before they gont take out the remander ommass but but it is a process and look israel has had the overwom i support of of astmajoritanations if it keeps usup without this incredibly conservative government they have and bengavier anothers mosi've non every major fon polisy leader an isryol since coom a her the're going to lose support from around the world and that is not an israel's interest i' get again the attempt to blame israel's warst strategy and it is mour bengavier is totally crazy is ral is currently governed by a war cabinet bengavier is not a member of the war cabinet the war cabinet is beebing is ting now o the elected prime minister of israel yoof golan the minister of defense and bennigons the leader of the opposition there are two other observers one is gotty eisen cot whose a member of benningonses party and whose son was killed in gaz already and ron durmer whose a long time form policy expert who works with baby he just lying a micus its it is a whi but against the're two lies thei're being told by number one is that the war is a reflection in israel of a right winged view that is not true there is widespread support in israel for extrapating commass because no one in israel is going to live underground two weeks a year awaiting the next burst through the border in which twelve hundred is railly citizens are murdered in two hundred forty are taken captive i in the gosestrip a li number two that that biton has been promoting is the lie that the palistonian people ars are are completely non support of a cmmass and that therefore all is rel has to do is grant some sort of legitimacy to a palistonian government in magically peaceful bloom that is a lie it is a total and complete le not only is theire nodated to support it the all the data is te other way seventy five to eighty per cent tof palistonians in west bank support commass and in excess of that support the october seventh terrace attacks in the gosistrup a majority still support commass despite the fact that they have been bom out of the places that they live because of commas is activity an cmmas istilling their humanitarian aid commas is still the most popular party more than the palistonian authority what biton is trying to do now is wish cast into existencs in end to this conflict and he sangle were really really close well are they becaus according to the israilly officials who involved in the negotiations there saying that there is not necessarily a caus foroptimism apparently the delegation says theire a telephone calls all the time but commass has been rejecting pretty much every proposal put on the table because every proposal says youguise nee to surrender and leave again there is a pos sability of a sease fire butt even if israel were to sign off on a sease fire israel is not going to leave comass in place what exactly is biden's plan biden's plan is to li and that that is the plan for large parts ofthe west is to ly about the nature of the new palistinian governments wat they are going to say it is amazing that they chan chan get away with thus or that israelwill go along with it nosral ly goernment tht goes along with us left right or center is going to be the government for very long over the cors of the last couple of days the government of the palistinian authority resigned nomachmudbas the actural dictator but the rrest ofthe palistonin authority government theire fate legislature in such i say fake becaus they have not had an e lection since to thasn sect in any case the palisinia authority government resigned and the alstrgernal called this in early step toward the over hauls the usan midileastern pawersy as a condition for the body to take charge of gaza after the worse agan this has been a stick the bid as been pushing is the idea that post war the palistinian authority will govern gaza thre's only one problem the palsinian authority is unpopular and has no power and has no ability to govern gaza what exactly will that mean well it turns out that the lastergernal let us the cat out of the bag what exactly is happening here it turns out that what is actually happening here is that the palistinian authority government resigned as to make way for a new palistinian authority government what exactly would that new government look well apparently abasas told arabanuus officials he is working on forming a new government with mahamman wasstapa former palistinian economy minister and world bank executive as the likely candidate form prime minister but what would happen in reality comass would simply quonn quot dis band and form the new governments all the top members of commass would simply call themselves not comas any more and then just enter the government quote one plan for postwar gaza being formulaterd by five arab states could see the is lamas coms movement being folded in too the widely secular piello ending the years long split buld tween palistnian factions apparently comass said that it is political leader is malhonea met with the catari amer tamima been hamad afhani in dohan monday to discuss roots to end the war in gaza and the organization of palistinian affairs senor members of pata the ruling party of the palistinian authority are still seeking re conciliation with kaomas another words jobiden's plan for israel to quonn quot to feat comas involves comas becoming the new government natchest of the gasastrip but also of the west bank outhin israels can go along with that that have to be out of their mind is to go along with that not only that apparently as readly officials believe tha they are very close to finding killing yahyasinoir who is the leader of comass whois still hiding in these tunnels beneath gaza there is still trying to to find him but apparently they are closing in on him and should israel stap that is can be a problem for them one of the most astonishing things about the current discussions with regard to the sease fire is that the americans and the arabs are suggesting that what has to happen here as tha sease fire before romadon because after all israel has to have respect for the aslamic holiday o romadon the month long romadon holiday because jeish holidays have rutinely been respected by his lon ic terrogroups for example som cot torah which is the exact eight of the october seven massacre or say jum kipor which was the want of the yum kiplor war astonishing how religious respect only supposed to the only apparently applies one way p and all of this confusion from jobdon these mixed signals that israel should be able to defend itself but also can we have come ouf sip part of the new government and also that really be means o the civilians and also all of that sort of confusion is just one reason why jobidon remains deeply unpopular as precedent no one knows what the hel any that this guy stands for except that they do not it and all attempts to reabilitate him our failing will get to that in just one moment first we hve a great deal here at daily wire plas the deal is a simple one thirty per

to fail he does not have the corisma of say a beroc obama thot's in painful display on south myers last night south myers is doing his best to try to misize jobidan back into some form of life behavior and he is failing dramatically last night for example mers had him doing the dark brands and mean by wearing sun glasses i'm sorry an old man eating ice creeman wearing son glasses just looks we can at burney's you legin't wit with the sunglasses he now looks e non animated corpse being wheeled around on comedy shows it is it is pretty incredible herigo i the very it just faxes to the air

plater with the dark fren un a me no resent the hello nooilof that that he cannot even do the joke gright has put on the glasses twice hes is nor his eyeballs are any more i irison tot of it o mis mid wit this on glasses o come come back around oh and then he lost the trando vod the middle of the enterview which of course is pure jobid an that dude is no longer with us and but i think everythinks everything wee gotn done es jus friendly state he wants to do way w fo select an i really think his view son we are to think a marica are older than anywhar i mo and the crowd lasts becase the trying to bail him out anm gowas it any of that english well man i can playe some that was it english there is another clip of jobine yesterday in which he lapses into some sort of pre historic earl language not legitimately no clue what he is attempting to say here but he is bucking all conventions of traditional language i guess that he perhaps there are aliens who one day in the future will show up and realize what he saying but they they do not live among us now o stand er coof this porter te man behind mere ye he said an wen we ure i get the cortexactry rigt he said w the better ater we said we must address consel an just the better es of our nature we doan we do well to remember wutels he say we not inmy but retrains se middls in the port of the civil war es sa were not anys ran we must not be enemies folks i o i no o look atat e an on wel te i mea is i sud we got palter is got throh bitter ah h a well i think that things may be becoming to a crashing hall for jobin i do not mean that he is not con be president to morrow in we all praye for the helth of the presidents of the united states because he still th presidents of the united states an we wants anything bad to happen to him i will say that the knives are out for him on his own side of the isle jola abramson is a former executive etetr of the neartimes and i story the really is not very important but is kind of she is now basically suggesting that jobidonis to blame for the behavior of of his dogs tere's at an entire piece at the washington posttitle do not blame bidins dogs for the blood on the white house floor and thentire piece about how the bidns are responsible for the fact that they have a bunch of dogs that bi people the reason that this is important is only because if you have any sense of of political history a few election cycles to go twenty twelve the democrats made the claim the mit ramy was a very bad man because he had put a dog crate on top of his car when he was traveling an hofs mean to his dogs and this became one of the means of the campaign was the mit ramy was a bad evil mean man and that is the theme is that is a charict this is a character floow in mit rawmy the mit ramy the most milk tose human being ever to walk the earth dull is ditch water mit mit ramy that that i was somehow a cruelty to animals torturing puppies in his back yard gy wel wen democrats start saying that sortsip about jobidon that is an indicator they do not actually him as a person that is a bag probem for jobidon saganch has this entire this entire piece in which he says the relatively spotless record of pats in the white house was stained last wee by shocking details in mor r than four hundred pages of your secrete service documents detailing a spate of violent attacks one of which left enough blood on the floor a white house tour had to be interrupted well is cleaned off who is responsible for the savagery commander the german shepard owned by presedent bidon and is family the dog was responsible for at least two dozen separate biting attacks on secrete service agents over the course ofa your ending last october when commander was finally exiled from the white house and she goes through all of the details and she talks about how terrible the dogs were behaving and she says i'm a crenential dog lover and first approachd these documens with empathyes for the bidons in deep sympathy for the bitten agens however she says i cannot really keep up that empathy she says as i waited through the gory details of all these biting in sence my empathy for the bidon's fated put plainly these documents are a herroing narrative the petownership in a high place is run dangerously a muck at some point the trouble is not the animals it is the owners nagan you might think that tht's a silly example i frankly thnk it might be a silly example but i will say that when you structs have the left turn on you as a mander of character your bad to your dogs that speaks to the lack of enthusiasm for jobidon if jobidon has a mas of enthusiasm gap the selections hestil callel locked bike twenty sixteen and that is exactly what you are seeing right now by the way according to tebrannuw harvard heris cap's pull donald trumps approval rating is now in positive territory jobidons approval ratng is now under water by eleven points these pull numbers are disastrous for jobidon according to the harvard heris pole fifty eight per cent of americans say that the economy is weak only forty two per cents a strong seventy and ten voters say the use will be in a recession now or is

eight percent for trump if it is a close election witho ourd young voters bidin his toast not just that the latest polls honey legal i migration sho that over all sixty one per cent of americans believe ing legal emigration is very serious problem and a majority of americans now believes important to finish the trump wall jobidan has a massive problem on his hands which presumably is again they think that there can be able to fix this problem not by changing their policy but by putting obidian in different places that is not going to work this has been a a myth that democrats of propagated since brokoboma was president that it was not a failure of policy that made them un popular he is a failure of communication if only we did but abom he says all the time heus to say it is not that obomicaric it self as a policy is un populars we we have not communicated it right we gt got talk better that ou butter drop talking but first of all owhy not true but second of all even assume that is true the person who asked to do a better chop talking is jobiden thab's the guy you are counting on to turn this ship around with his absolutely virtuosic command of rhetoric and the english language good luck to you but that is goinging o try correen jomp here sis the jobidn is now heading down to the southern bord to try to blim republicans for the situation which is weird because he is constantly saying now that h's goin a signe executive worders to shore up the border which is it thit is then issue that the american epl e toinee er e pe cere abou a h wi te e e ta e ees ta go on he te i hes goin te go o the bords t is tn te o ei ta esworc e ta e e o o and hes goin te her terec e ee wor e oinei es t te e hisel o i e wi ta e t i n te bo ee e es bor e oin i ta e

directly to in ot te prosis tactays s she exactly wits going on her directly ot the borde pertroiens whowho are doing no wore e et oin the best way that the a wit he wes i as that thy popety or absolutely amazing absolue sis she says he is goin to take action and they what action he is going to the border that is not an action by that is a finition i fixe the boarder i went there who wo ho that prbly fixe the problem not the way that actually executive action works again this issue is not going away for jobiden doctor phill who is becoming a lot more openly political man kno doctor pfilli him is on the view the other day and a he pointed out that the border patrol is saying that the human trafficing problem is worse than ever the view as was just a gog that doctor pil would say such things myner sanding is he went to the southern border and a an in ge gen to give peope o facts what did you take away from that experings o what kind of perporto n gen o ben man a tat epand wot toy efact that to tway a tt to the head of all the border guards dover er that the union i ask him straight ut kids are coming over the border with numbers ri non of fo numbers an adresses do we check thos tutis to what we call them is it possible that were sending tim in to noinposstitution rings or swet shops he said its not possible it is absolutewe are susing a merican tax tollars to ship children in to nown prostitution al ab wanyshobsunco what who knows o we kno no a ta are you what cind of check im to they ti o they ca n a number if they dounobout tho chil te sa yes we receive em when the com yes said is it possible tous tha prostitution ring he said we we know enough to know that it idn't a number of cases it is turned out to be absolute sexring a again this sort of stuff is stuff than americans do care about and joby does not have a cure for its can republicans snatch defeat from the jaws o victory i mean of course they cans there is lot of talk about a government shut down this week and i've a question what would be the purpose of such a thing i know these are impolitic questions to ask some time among conservatives because the question for me is always is this performative or is the substantive there is a differencs sometimes performed of politics is quate useful because ractually changing the narrative on a subject for example it is performant of politics to ship illegal emigrants up to martha's iniard that is obviously performative it is not solution o the problem it is an attempt to shame democrats for not having solved the problem an making them own the problem the government shut down are we talking about something performeatofe ly what are you getting out ofte shut town in terms af p ar or is it substantive meaning this is such an important thing han we need a fundamental restructuryng and we are willing to shut down the government over it and it seems republicans are doing neither performative nor substancive things with regard to the possibility of government shut down this weeken americans by pulling get it typically do not goernment shut towns andthey do not understand what they are about if you'r going to actually create a even a partial government shut down people just count of do not one think about the gvrnmen is the truth hey cannot want the goernment just run and the dn't want to think about it and the more the think about the more anoid they are with whoever is the person they believe is creating the hold up let us be real first of all about government spending everytime there is government shut down there is lot o talk about government spending and we are goig to fix the goernment spending withthe government shut town marginal changes that an't got indo it when you do these government shut downs and wht you end up with his cutting ten billion bucks from the butget twenty billion a hundred billiong dollars from the budget if you could get that t which they will not if you if you could actually do that that would not even remotely solved the underlying problem in the american economy which is not spending a hundred billion dollars it spending a hundred trilian hollikers on things social security medicar and medicate unless you are willing to actually step into the fray and fix the underlying problem all this is performative and then the question becomes performing for whom if the idea is that the republican basis desperate for another government shut im i i do not see it two doyou thnk donal trump as part of his relict prospect wants another government shut im doyou think that he wants people redirecting their ir away from jobidon and torter re publican congress it seems to mean not sujust a ppolitically performative matter it does not make a lot of sents and again i'm more in favor of cutting spending then bertially anybody whos tock about cuttng spending right nawbes i think we actually ought to restructure entitlements becaue that is the serious striver of america's national debt not the post office in hoboken but in any case according to the ner times an grussional leaders have now failed to reach a deal on legislation to keep federal fund in going past friday republicans are insisting on policy dictates to the spending bill chucksumers and on sunday that despite in tense discussions republican recalcitrans was raising the prospect of a destruptive shut down at midnight on friday jobidon has now summon congressional leaders to the whitehouse on tuesday to discuss at that spending legislation as well as the ninety five billion dollar foren ad package for ucran in israil the senant past earlier this month the speaker of the house has refused to take that up at this point three can second o times over the last six months congress has re light on those short turm stop gap spending bills pass by by partisan polition of lawmakers you'l remember that actualy the besteal was negotier by kevmac carthy who is then sumerily austid in an idiotic coo that achieved nothing i'm sorry whatever you think of cevemac carthy the idea that that wasy strategic victory for conservatism i'd wut let at some point th evidence would be great i what do we ned evidence for propositions any more we just sort of say them apparently a lot of the re publican members want johnson to scure major cutts and policy changes that have no chance of enactment with democrats ind control of the senate and the white house and again those major cutts whenever the near times describes major cutts understand thei'r not tucknment major guts the real cutt would be the restructuring all f the major entitlement programs in te united states and no one is willing to touch that i mean don trump is not wiling to touch that one of the reasons the out flanked his compatriots in the republican party an to thas not sixteen is because many of them were saying we ned to restructure an titlements in troubles nockin at touch it that a keep em that icet and that actually was a popular position with americans who when it comes to government spending are always of to mines one is yes we shuld definitely cut the government spending the goverment spends way to much money and the other mind is no not that i din' mean that thing a bottom line is is this a smart political move for congress to make in the iddle of tha presidential year i think not ay meanwhile the rants of the day these stupid rans of the day goes to jroyry because it is nearly everyday but that jroyreed decided to sound off on invitro fertilization the other day because obviously alabama has now declared ve o the supreme court that embryyos have the status of protected humans which raises questions about how ive yef is to be performed and the preservation of frozen embryos for example thes our complex moral issues no question about it but leavets o doy read to have the stupidostake of the day here was tat hereos joy reed stalking about it i have a couple of questions question number one who is the wean i mean your federal officer europ united states senator are you saying the federal government needs more kids because y was not aware that there was a federal mandate for the government of the united states to demand and increase in population where does that mandate come from who is the we the federal government needs more kids for what the united states has a population of north of three undred and twenty seven million people why do not we mean more kids i mean your party senator tupberville is the one screaming that ten million emigrants which i do not even know that that number even makes any sens cause it does not o have streamed into the country since jo bidon has been president and your claiming than that is too many people that if more people come into the southern border this is some sort of crisis because we wee got too many people and we have got ino more space and we cannot afford more people but now your sing we need more kids in the same the sate of alabama needs more kids why does ta tate of alabamide more kids more kids for what there was a time when the state of albama absolutely needed more kids because alabama was a slavesate and the mandate of the planter class at alabama was for black women to produce more kids because those kids were property and they could work more kids and make more money on their plantations what the f sa a few things number i m that sat that is a very special ran there from from driried manshe s sheis just chis whipber snapper smark shis she is bright uwhat let us begin wit the migration poin the reason the republicans very often oppose emigration is not because they do not believe that the population of the united states netes to increase is because it matters where people are from and what their culture is in what they think about things i kno ths his tougfor droy red tactually understand but not all humans think the same things when you say that american ease more yes america does nee more kids in fact virtually all major countries of this point need more children especially to pay for all the programs the droy red much second when you say that we need more kids we do not mean that we want to enslave our children we are saying that kids are inately good it is good for people to have kids i know this a weared idea for many people in leut but actually kids are wonderful kids are they'r gine pan in the ousin they are absolutly wonderful there is that just on a pure human level more human souls good also when you talk about the economics of the situation not ti met enslaving the kids you are talking about the fact that those people are going to produce more innovations more goods and services that make life better for every one but y again leavez dryried to give the dumis to take in the land meanwhile gavenusum giving his own dum take it itis it is incredible that you see this very conflicting position on ivee from from democrats one is ivef is really important because we need to let people have kids and the other is people should kill keds and the the these two positions are simultaneously held the question with regard to i tef for many conservatives in terms of how it is done is o case you are you are now giving an embryo a shot at life but you are doing by perhaps discarding other embryos which is to create a human life to dispose of it and s that is a real problem and what you are trying to waih is the upside of creating a new human life with yoe downside of killing other human lives an that is a really complex moral problem that has real ramifications onm left youhave the simultaneous idea that ivef is'n is an unbridled good becase it creates a human life agree but also if you wish to kill it no problem which is i gess solves your way out of the i the aftolema but gets you in some pretty murky waters elsewhere here is gavenusum saying he sorts on restricted abortion do you think there is the week that actet to abortion should be pan ummetu i i think we have established that firmaly in the contects of what states are doing california where we established e constitutional right the access aborti in the end of the day i think that is of tetermination for women at an locters as a relates to the issues in california we have established that firmly in the state constitution as a relates to getting into the debate around late ternabortion that is a complete connard amazing amazing stuctep from gavenusum but again this the party that has some real promise of the definition of basic concepts ranging from men and women to human life itsolf arereadyo coming up we will get to the situation in ucrane and russia conflicting reports over exactly what killed elexay navonny will get into that momentarily

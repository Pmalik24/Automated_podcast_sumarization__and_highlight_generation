welcome to the hubermanlaconca n cus science e science pace toe frli i mandruhuberman and or professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing journaling for mental and physical health i want to emphasize that today's discussion is not a general discussion about the value of journaling rather it is a discussion about a particular form of journaling that the scientific pure viewe data says is especially powerful for improving our mental and physical health in fact what i will discribe to day is a journalling method that is supported by over two hundred purereviewed studies in quality journals and i frankly was not aware of this journaling practice prior to researching this episode but in researching this episode have come to discover that this practice should easily be placed among some of the other critical called foundational pillar practices in terms of its impact on improving mental and physical health including things lowering anxiety improving sleep improving immunity to things cold flues et cetera as well as reducing the symptoms of autoumunedisorders such as arthoritus lupus and also providing some relief for fibromialga which is a condition of excessive pain the particular journally method in pro to call that i will describe has also been shown to improve various matrics of everyday living including improved memory decision making and on and on and on much that again i was very surprise that i had not heard of this particular journaling method one would think that if such a powerful method existed that everyone would know about it but it turns out that this particular journaling method has been somewhat cloistered within the fields of psychology and psychietry it is not that nobody was aware of it in fact i learned about it for the first time from our associate tare of psychietry at stamphr e university school of medicine my colliguan collaborator doctor david spegle who as some of you may know has been featured as a guest on this podcast previously and upon hearing about it i decided to explore the primary research that is the studies that demonstrate the power of this particular journally method and was absolutely blown away by the positive impact this particular journally method can have what is wonderful about it you will soon discover is that it takes a relatively small amount of time in fact it is something that you could do during the course of one week or even across one month and then never do again and the date a say that it would still have lasting positive benefits both for body and mind while it is rare to feature one particular protocol as an entire huberman labpodcast that is indeed what i will do to day it is important that we go into some depth about the specific protocol because there are some important details that everyone should know if they want to a pliet and make it as effective as it can be and in addition to that we will talk about some of the underlying science that is been published explaining why and how this protocol is effective for mental and physical health before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate fror my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium and no sugar the electrolytes are absolutely essential for the functioning of every cell in your body and your nurons your nerve cells rely on sodium magnesium an potassium in order to communicate with one another electrically and chemically element contains the optimal ratio of electrolytes for the functioning of nurons and the other cells of your body every morning i drink a packet of element dissolved in about thirty two ounces of water i do that just for general hydration and to make sure that i have adequate electrolytes for any activities that day i'll often also have an element packet or even two packets in thirty two to sixty ounces water if i'm exercising very hard and certainly if i'm sweating a lot in order to make sure that i replace those electrolites if you would to try element you can go to drink l m n t dot calm slash hubermen to get a free sample pack with your purchase again that is drink l m n t dot calm slash hubermen to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity i've spoken many times before in this pod cast about the fact that getting a great night sleep really is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the keythings to getting a great night sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct and that is because in order to fall in stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment in the beginning middle and end of your night it has a number of other features tracking the amount of rapid i movement and slowwave sleep that you get things are essential to really diling in the perfect night sleep for you i've been sleeping on anightesleep mattress cover for well over two years now and it has greatly improved my sleep by fall asleep far more quickly i wake up far less often in themiddle of the night and i wake up feeling far more refreshed than i ever did prior to using in at sleep mattress cover if you would to try eight sleep go to eight sleep dot calm

canada the u k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dot calm slash hubermen to day's episode is also brought to us by waking up waking up is a meditation ap that includes hundreds of meditation programms mindfulness trainings yoganee recessions and n st are non sleep deep brest protocalls iv start using the waking up ap a few years ago because even though i've been doing regular medit ation since my teens and i sar doing yoganedra about a decate ago my dad mention to me that he had found an ap tor not to be the waking up ap which could teach you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much i gave the waking up apatry and i too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes i only have a few minutes to meditate other times iave longer to meditate and indeed i love the fact that i can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness but also to place my brain and body into lots of dferent kinds of states depening on which meditation i do i also love that the waking up ap has lots of dfferent types of yoganedra sessions those hyeu do not know yoganedra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind it is very different than most meditations and there is excellent scientific data to show that yoganedra and something similar to it called nonsleep deep breast or an as tiar can greatly restore levels of cognive and physical energy even with just a short ten minute session if you would to try the waking up ap you can go to waking up doc com slash huberman and acts ass a free thirty day trial again that is waking up doccom slash huberman to acts ass a free thirty day trial ok let us talk about this particularly transformative form of journaling that initially was researched by doctor james pennabaker james penbaker was a professor of psychology at southern methodists university when he first started researching this form of journaling and it is positive impacts on the body and mind but he has since moved to the university of texas austin where he still runs a laboratory nd has continued his studies on the role of journaling and other forms of language both spoken and written in terms of their impact on one's mental and physical health the origins of the research into this particular form of journaling started in the mid eighties and it was really in nineteen eighty six that the first published manuscript about this form of journaling was published now i want to be clear that prior to james penebaker study this form of journaling clearly others had used the form of journalling that i'm about to describe however it was penabaker that really started attaching measurements of the specific types of changes that occurred in people when they did this journaling in a particular way and indeed came up with the precise protocol that will talk about to day pennebaker an colleagues and james penebraker in particular really deserves credit for the discovery of this method as he will soon learn pennabaker was absolutely meticulous in figuring out exactly how long the method should be carried out what exact forms of change occurred in the body an mind he was careful to explore the method in the contexts of students as well as in the general population in veterans in elderly in kids and on and on it is really that incredible attention to detail and that scientific rigor that makes the protocol incredibly powerful that first scientific study of this particular form of journaling as i mention was published in nineteen eighty six and i provided a link to that study in the shownote captions but what that study essentially consisted of was inviting undergraduate students into the university laboratory one at a time and they were to spend fifteen to thirty minutes writing about the most difficult even tramatic or possibly nontramatic but still very difficult experience that they can recall from their entire life the instruction included that they should write for the entire time that is because they were writing by hand in that particular experiment that they were do not stop moving their hand for the entire duration of the fifteen to thirty minutes and in addition to that that no one besides them the person writing would see what was written at the beginning middle or even after the experiment in fact the students were invited to tear up the paper at the end of the writing exercise if they chose o case o the first key instruction is that they take a moment to think about what is themost difficult perhaps even tramatic experience of their entire life the second instruction was t at they were supposed to write for fifteen to thirty minutes and the third instruction was that they were supposed to write for the entire time that at no point would they take a pause unless somehow emotionally or physically they were unable to keep moving their hand on the paper in fact they were told to not pay attention to accurate grammar to not pay attention to reread ability they were told in fact that their writing could be replete with spelling errors or grammatical errors that did not matter what was most important is that they tappened to a particularly negatively charge memory of their prior life experience now of course because this swas an experiment carried out in universy laboratory there was a quiet place where the students could write undisturbed but since we are taking this particular protocol and were exporting it to the real world through this potcast it is important that if you decide to implement this protocol in your own life that you carry out the writing in a place where you will not be disturbed for that entire fifteen to thirty minute duration it is also important that that even though that first nineteen eighty six study was done having students write out these memories by hand with a pen and paper or a pencil and paper there have been many subsequent studies that have explored whether or not the pen in paper was particularly important and turns out its not the exact same magnitude of posive effects are observed regardless of weather or not people write out their passage of words by hand or type it out on a word processor or any other form of writing now just to make sure that everyone gets the exacting protocol that was provided in that first initial study from pennebaker and colleagues and that has been used really over and over and over again for more than two hundred pure reviewed studies that demonstrate the power of this protocol i'm going to read to you some of the specific instructions from that first study the subjects were instructed to quote write about something that you were thinking about or worrying about weigh too much or if you are not thinking about or worrying about something weigh too much perhaps you have deliberately tried to not think about this series of events or event something that you have been dreaming about at night perhaps in disturbing dreams or something that you feel as affecting your life in an unhealthy way either internally or externally could be in your emotional state youar inability to calm down when you want to be calm maybe our ruminating maybe ven compulsive thought may be its leading to addictive or compulsive or habitual behaviors or perhaps you can identify a specific trama or set of tramas that are really plaguing your body in mind the specific instructions that were given to the subjects in those experiments are the specific instructions that i'm going to give to you now should you decide to emplement this journaling protocol and those instructions are as follows i want you to write down your deepest emotions and thoughts as they relate to the most upsetting experience in your life really let go and explore your feelings and thoughts about it as you write you might tie this experience to your childhood your relationship with your parents or siblings people you have loved or loved now or even your career or schooling how has this experience related to who you have now become who you have been in the past and who you would to become the instructions then continued to say many people have not had a truly dramatic experience in their lives but everyone has had major conflicts or stressers and you can write about the most dramatic or stressful experience you have ever had o kso those are some of the key instructions that subjects in these experiments were given before they do the exercise and of course they were given a few minutes to think about what they wanted to write but once they selected what they want to write they started writing there was a time or going in the background for fifteen to thirty minutes and the reason by the way i keep sand fifteen to thirty minutes is that some experiments employed a thirty minute period other experiments employed a twenty minute period others employed a fifteen minute period turns out there were no major differences between the fifteen minu and the thirty minute writing blocks in terms of the positive impact that they had on mental and physical health but for some people and there particular experience that theire writing about fifteen minutes is simply going to be too brief a time in order to capture the entire experience and as many thoughks and feelings about that experience as one would perhaps put down on to paper or type out if they had a full thirty minutes you can allow yourself fifteen to thirty minutes and feel welcome to stop before the thirty minute period is over or perhaps you are going to restrict yourself to fifteen minutes and you are gon to force yourself to get out as much as possible in that time it really does not matter or say the data o caseo before i continue to detail the specifics of this writing protocol you probably already notice that what i'm describing is a very different form of journaling then say morning notes which is a form of journaling that writers often years in order to quote and qu clear out the clutter this is a process of sitting down and writing down in stream of consciousness whatever's on your mind for the first five to fifteen may be ven thirty minutes every morning is awaited rclear out your mental processes and get ready for the day perhaps a day of other forms of writing or other activities entirely what i'm describing is also distinctly different from called gratitude journaling in fact it is quite the opposite it is not writing about things that you are grateful for necessarily it is writing about things that are extremely unfortunate that happen to you and that you have very charged negative emotions about in addition the form of journaling that were talking about to day is distinctly different from the form of journaling that i many others have undertaken perhaps not on a daily basis but perhaps on a daily basis where you essentially are writing out the contents of your daily life a called diary and i mention that because i think many people do journal and some do on a consistent basis i would put myself into that category although the last few years i have not been journalling too much i have literally stacks and stacks of journals dating back to a the early nineties i brought a few of them along to day and know i'm not going to read them to any of you in fact a when i was looking these last night a and by the way these are from the late this is summer of nineteen ninety seven i would have been a late in my aundergraduate career this is a fall of ninety six nineteen ninety to always done on the same composition notebook at that time and always done by hand a msurprised that my handwriting was as legible as it was it is gotten worse over the years i do not know what nerl process that reflects but in any event in reading over these journal entries a it was clear to me that just as i had recalled that each in every one of them was e sentially an up date about what was happening lately what i was hoping for some challenges mou im basically a diary of sorts and a these are kept in the second drawer of the second now i'm just ketting a the idea for me as also that no one will ever read these besides me it was a quite an interesting exercise to go back and and read those and a other were a few cringe moments but there were also a few moments where i found myself smiling because a in certain ways a little has changed between the person i was then and the person i am now and fortunally a in many ways certain things have changed between the person i was then and the person i am now now i mention all of that simply because i think the form of journaling that i've been doing for some years this sort of autobiographical approach to daily entries or pseudo daily entries is far an away different then the type of journalling that were talking about forsake of improving mental and physical health during to day's episode which is not to say that gratitude journalling or autobiographical daily entries a ach a diary type journalling is not useful in fact there are data to support that gratitude journaling in particular can be very beneficial for both body and mind everything from improving general states of happiness to reducing anxiety improving relationships and on and on but to get back to the protocol that were talking about to day you probably noticed that it is not a protocol that is likely to feel very good at least not at first and indeed that is what the researt shows and this is something that you really need to be aware of that when subjects are given this research assignment druing the assignment they are often quite distraught oftentimes they cry oftentimes they find themselves holding their breath and anxiety often times they will finish that fifteen to thirty minute writing block and they will feel as if they had run a mental marithon and therefore the subjects were given a period of five to fifteen minutes post writing to settle down and transition back into their day highly recommend that you incorporate that into your protocol as well if you are going to allow yourself say twenty minutes to write you' want to give yourself probably ten minutes of quiet time to you' bring your composure back and reset yourself that you can re enter daily living because the writing that you are going to do for this particular protocol is design to tap into very negative if not the most negative experiences of your life and that something to be taken seriously and it is an entirely unreasonable expectation that you could write about something as difficult as the most difficult experience in your life and then simply pivet a go back into everyday life right away 'll want to designate a time of day or night perhaps when you can do this writing and still allow yourself some time to settle down your autonomic system return your breathing to normal perhaps i know wash your face wit soon cool water remind yourself that the rest of the day continues that you are doing great in fact you made it through this first installment of the journaling exercise you are probably strarting to get the impression that this form of journalling that pennebakering colleagues really researched and pioneer the evolution of is quite different than other forms of journalling in fact it is very different i've already told you that the ideas to sit down and write fror fifteen to thirty minutes rite continuously write ab out something that really to you is one of the most if not the most difficult experiences of your life in addition to that for this form of journalling to be most effective that is to bring about the greatest positive shifts in mental and physical health you are actually going to write about that exact same thing four times now the way that that was initially researched by pennabaker and others was to have the same person of course write about the same experience four times on four consecutive days for fifteen to thirty minutes each students or people from the general population or veterans we are literally coming into the laboratory and sitting down and writing about the most difficult experience of their life that they coul recall fror fifteen to thirty minutes on one day and then again on the next day and then the next day am the next day much of the data on this particular journally method reflects that four consecutive days of fifteen to thirty minute writing bauts of the most difficult experience that you can recall however there have been variations on this protocall such that people selected one day per week and it does not even have to be the same day every monday it could be mone day of one week and then ednesday of the next week and on such that you write only one day per week about the most difficult experience you can recall and then you write about that same difficult experience one week later and then again one week later and then again one week later across the course of a month or any four week period for that matter now i do not know about you but when i hear that that i'm going to need to write about the most difficult experience of my entire life that i can recall for even fifteen minutes let alone thirty minutes let alone two times and here were talking about four times perhaps even on four consecutive days that actually speaks to some intensity some demand in fact i find myself kind of leaning away from that experience a little it but as will talk about later that is exactly the point of this type of exercise which is that we are harbouring these stories these experiences and in some cases partial recollections in another case detailed recollections of the difficult thing that happend to us perhaps even the most difficult thing that happend to us and those narratives exist in our nervous system these are not necessarily tramas as we talke about before although they can be tramas now we hear a lot about trama and these days people call all sorts of things trama and tramatizing and say that they been tromatized by this or tromatized by that there is acually a specific definition of trama that was provided by doctor palcanti who is some of is a medical doctor and psychiotrist he is been a guessed on this podcast first to talk about trama he wrote a excellent book about trama i provide a link to that book in the shownot captions by the way and he and i did four episode to the hubrman ladpodcast a cal guests series specifically aimed at mental health what it is how to build mental hell specific protocalls and doctor palcanti is really truly a world expert in trama and he defines trama as any experience or experiences ploral that modify our brain and neral circuitry to be brain or body or both such that we do not function as well emotionally behaviorly or cognitively going forward from that experience cay not everything constitutes a trama but many things do applying that definition i think it is fair to say that many if not most people have some form of trama stored in their nervous system and other people perhaps do not have such tramas but everyone has had stressers in fact i think it is fair to say that everyone has had major stressers in their life provided that they have lived at all as just part of life unfortunately or maybe fortunately maybe it akes us who we are in positive ways if we are able to transmute those negative experiences and stressers or tramas into particular forms of learning that allow us to do better and indeed that is possible that was discussed with paulcanti in that four episode series on mental health but the particular form of journalling that we are talking about to day was really design to have people focus on those difficult experiences and then for four episodes total yes total there is know on going every week or it is not having to seek out sunlight every morning and getting sunlight in your eyes or trying to get the best possible nights sleep at night an always incurging people to do this is really a short term protocal but it is one that is indeed very intense o casalong those lines that deliberately journaling about a particularly distressing experience are set of experiences is likely to bring some degree of sadness anxiety frustration anger perhaps other emotions as well it is important that some of the data that have been collected about this journal and protocal one of the more important features of this protocall is that when people do it they tend to bin out into two different groups and these two groups have been described as low expressers and high expressers now low expressers and high expressors have nothing to do with introversion and extraversion that is actually been looked at and they have no relationship ocaso some people who are very talkative and very extraverted they could be a low expresser somebody whose very intrverted tends only share when they really have something to say and maybe does not have a lot of interest in social interactions or as some of you who heard the episode on relationships know an actual intravert is somebody who really enjoy social interactions but they are very sated they are very satisfied by less social interaction than are extraverts if you want t learn more about that check out the episode i did on relationships but in any event when people sit down to do this exercise and when they consent to having their writing analyzed and when they undergo a number of other different tests turns out their two different groups that segment out the first are these low expressers the low expressers tend to use less descriptive language in their writing they tend to get less emotional during the first boued of writing that first day of fifteen to thirty menute writing whereas the high expressers tend to be people that use a lot of negative language to describe their negative emotions about the negative experience that means more negative descriptir words were used at higher frequency these people when they have their physiology measured also tend to have higher amounts of distress and upset in the first boued of writing that first fifteen to thirty menute episode we have got two different groups the low expressers on the high expressers the low expressers on day on are sharing a bit less their expressing less on paper of their particular emotions that they can recall from that tramatic or very distressing event and over all based on physiological measures as well cordes all increases as well as skin conductans changes and heart rate and blood pressur the low expressers are effectively relatively more calm less distressed as they write about this very stressful event in their lives relative to the high expressers who have higher blood pressure higher heart rate they tend to be the ones that crimore or hold their breath more or sob more the higher levels of cortes all during that first round of writing now for the protocal to be effective it does not matter if you are in the low expressor high expresser group here is what is interesting i just mention that on day on the low expressers are less distresse physiologically in psychologically as they write about this for them very distressful event where as the high expressers are much more distress significantly more in fact when these are measured in laboratory studies on both mental and physical dimensions of stress now that is on day on but then what is observed is in opposite pattern of progression such that the low expressers become more and more distress as the writing exercise continues from day two three and four whereas the high expressers these people that use a lot of language to communicate their distress and ar experiencing a lot of physiological and emotional distress as their writing on day one their amount of distress from day one to two to three to four actually goes down more dramatically you can expect that you fall into one or the other group this was truly abinary distribution where people bendout into one or the other based on a number of different measurements but here is the good news turns out it does not matter whether not your a low expresser or a high expresser you want to use the form of writing that is most natural for you and that for you communicates what that negative experience was and how it has affected you and perhaps how it is affected others as well the important thing to know is that both groups both the low expressers and the high expressors benefit from this journaling protocol such that three weeks later and even three months later and even years later both groups are experiencing far less distress and base line levels of stress than they did prior to embarking on the journaling protocol at the very beginning now the reason i mention these two groups the low expressers and the high expressors is that it is a nontrivial detail of this writing protocol because some people are very familiar with communicating their emotions both in writing and perhaps in speech as well and this actually has been looked at ah there is a wonderful study also by penobaker and colleagues and i should mention that even though he studied these journaling protocol for a good number of years his laboratory has evolved now to studying all sorts of things related to how the particular language usage patterns that people use in everyday's speech as well as in their writing how that reflects their underlying psychological tone and emotions but also and i find the interesting how the particular words that we use in writing in speech actually shape in a causal way our emotional states i'll talk lobit ababout that later but the important thing to focus on now is the results of this study entitled natural emotion vocabularies as windows on distress and well being and this again is a study that was done by penobaker and colligus of link to in the shownote captions and it essentially examines peoples natural language usage patterns now what do i mean by natural and why is that important well there have been many many studies of people's vocabulary an accessing whether not people have more knowledge of negative words to describe negative emotions or positive emotions these studies are varying in their form but generally consist of having people circle words they recognize or may be writing out the definitions to and it turns out that people that have more extensive knowledge of words that describe negative emotions themselves tend to have a lower affect or negative emotional state as compared to people who have more extensive knowledge of vocabulary words that pertain to positive emotions a crude example of what i just described is somebody that has fairly limited knowledge of words that describe positive emotional states perhaps they recognize the word happy they recognize the word ecstatic they recognize the word joyful but they have a fairly limited words set that pertains to posive emotions whereas by comparison sis always relative within the same person rit by comparison the person knows four times more words that pertain to a negative emotional state in general those people tend to be more depressive tend to have highr levels of anxiety and forth as compared to somebody where the veverse pattern as true where they have knowledge of far more words that pertai ain to positive emotional states as compared to negative emotional states now on the face of it that result probably seem straightforward people that have lot of words to describe happiness are more happy if you will thave a lot of words to describe sadness and negative emotions are more sad but it didt necessarily have to be that way and it turns out that it is not always that way what do i mean by that well the particular study that i've been describing here this natural emotion vocabularies as windows on distress ind well being is an important paper because it explored not the words that people have knowledge of but the word patterns that people tend to use in their natural speech either spoken or written and what penibaker and others showed is that people that tend to use a lot of negative words ten to have more negative emotional states whereas people that naturally tend to use words that describe positive emotional states have more positive emotions and this related to both mental and physical metrics of negative emotions and positive emotions this is a significant result because what it says is that our nowledge of vocabulary words is while interesting and perhaps important for other things is not nearly as important as which particular words we use on a frequent basis and whereas before i said oque if you are going to embark on this protocal of fore writing sessions fifteen to thirty minutes each that you should not monitor youre writing that you want to sit down start writing and just do not stop you dn't want to pay attention to grammar or spelling or anything else and then after the fourth writing session you do not look at what you have written for at least a week but then a week or more later you go back and you read what you have written paying careful attention to the number of words that you use that reflect a negative emotional or affect as it sometimes called state in the first verses the second verses the third verses the fourth jernal entry now this might seem a little bit a detailed an reductionist for a protocol that we weld discuss on this potcass yere were really talking about you doing your own data analysis of self but if you think about it a practice this both can be very quick and highly informative for instance you can go back and simply circle all the words that at first blush to you appear to reflect a negative state and put a square around all the words that just by your read seem to reflect a positive state and then compare them across those four jornal entries and of course you can opt to not do any of this but what people find that is what was discovered in the research literature is that on average the patterns of language use from the first to the fourth entry shift dramatically such that by the fourth entury people even though there still writing about the same negative experience a writing about that experience in a very different way not only are they naturally using fewer negative words to describe their recollection and experience of that negative event but the number of positive words is also increasing now this is important because when penabaker in colleagues gave the instruction to people to do this protocol they encourage them to think about three things before they ever start writing the first is of course to write about facts about that difficult experience i think that sort of obvious that when people are going to recall difficult experience their likely to write down facts about that experience the second thing that they want to remind them to include were emotions that they felt at the time of the experience as well as emotions that they happen to feel now about that experience and third that people include writing about any and all links that come to mind about the negative experience and things that may be happening to day or plans for the future people from the past present or future really any link no matter how distant it might seem or how random it might seem to include that in the writing ocase just to repeat the three things that they were instr cted to include before they ever set their pens to paper or started typing out their negative experience first facts about the hard experience whatever they can recall that happened in that hard experience or perhaps it was something that did not happen and that was why it was a hard experience but facts related to that hard experience facts of the hard experience second that they include writing about emotions felt at the time of the experience as well as emotions felt now while writing about that prior experience and third to include any writing about any link that spring to mind about the negative experience and anything that is happening now or perhaps happen in the past or things that you have planned for the future now that third category of lynx between the experience and other things may be direct and obvious maybe these are real ah moments wer how my goodness i realize now that what is been happening for the last six months is a direct mirror of what happened in that earlier tramatic or very stressful episode or perhapts the link are more opaque maybe the link is now i do not know why but i keep thinking about this one experience that i had and i keep thing about this one person and i do not know how thei're linked that is fine put those down on paper you can even draw a diagram but i should mention it is important that you try to the best of your ability to writ things out in complete sentences again they do not have to be perfect grammar or even pseudo perfect grammar the spelling can be off your handwriting can be amess athoughf your handwritings truly amess might be hard to read later by the way folks my older sister always teases me that my handwriting as frozen in the third grade actually of would to show her my journal entries my handwriting was actually quite a bit better than it is now of which basely speaks to a some degree of cognitive decline for me but in any case the point is that this third category of establishing lynk between the prior negative experience and whatever else is an important component of the writing protocall whatever it takes to it include those links they are worth including no i want to re emphasize that even though i pointed to the positive health benefits of using more positive words in one's writing or speech i suppose to negative words which tend to be associated with worse health outcomes both in terms of physical and mental health it is important and etcensral to this writing protocol if youare going to get the positive consequences of it that you are not monitering the words that you are using too closely you are not trying to write this someone else can see it you are not trying to write the great american novel you are not writing youre ulogy you are not writing your autobiography youre really writing this for you i cannot emphasize that enough you are doing this writing protocol that you can work through something that is stressful or tramatic that resides in your nervous system and that is not serving you well indeed next work an a talk about what happens when these narratives of our prior negative experiences are not worked through that they have not been put either to speech or to pend to paper or typed out and perhaps more importantly or gan a talk about the incredibly positive benefits both at the level of neurl changes call neral plastisity which is the literal rewiring of neral connections as well as psychological benefits reduced anxiety improved mood improved sleep and improved immune function that are the consequence of doing this for bouts of fifteen to thirty menute writing protocol as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and are cognive functioning are memory oure ability to learn new things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough vitemens and minerals from high quality unprocesse or minimly process sources as well as enough probiotics and prebotics and fibr to support thasically all the cellar functions in our body including the gup microbiom now i most everybody try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods ideally mostly from minimaly processed or non process foods however one of the challenges that i and many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fibr and probiotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables that is why way back in two thousand in twelve long before i ever had a podcast i started drinking a g one and i'm delighted the a g one is sponsoring the huberman lapodcast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still drink a g one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those vitemens minerals probiotics and fiber to insure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you would to try a g one you can go to drink a g one doccom slash hubermen to claim a special offer they are giving away fie fr travel packs pluss a year supply of videmen d three k two again that is drink a g one doccom slash hubermen to claim that special offer o cas let us talk a little bit about the posive mental and in particular physical changes that occur in people that do this writing exercise i should mention that most of the studies andagain more than two hundred quality pure reviewed studies of this protocol ve been carried out and are still on going not just in penebaker laboratory but in many many other laboratories as well reveal that the positive physical shifts that occur in people that complete this four bouts of writing in the way i described is both significant and long lasting now of course it is not the case that these four episodes of wriing can completely cure major forms of depression or posdramatic stress disorder although they have been shown to benefit that is to reduce depressive symptoms and to reduce the symptoms of post dramatic stress disorder considerably but they should not be considered complete theraputics for those conditions however they have been shown to significantly improve many other health matrics and i lu ted to some of these at the beginning of to day's episode there have for instance beent studies of this type of journalling protocol for people thathave been suffering from chronic anxiety and insomnia and indeed they experience significant relief as well people who suffered from arthoritis people who are going through cancer treatment people who have lupis which is an autoomundisorder report significantly improve symptoms not neserely cured from those conditions but significantly improved symptoms as a consequence of doing this writing protocol in addition and earlier i mention this i realized abyll mention again people suffering from phabral mialgia which is a chronic pain condition that is or can be very debilitating has shown significant improvement in symptomology that has reduced chronic pain after they do this for bauts of writing in the way that i described and again the relief from pain seems to be on going again not a total cure of their symptoms i do not want to a provide false hopierre or overblow the a the positive impact of this particular writing protocol but none the less statistically significant shifts that were pervasive over time in addition people suffering from ib s or irritable baelsynpdrum have achieved some significant degree of relief of their symptoms relative to people who also have irritable balsyndrum but who do not do the exacting protocol that were talking about to day now of course in all of these studies we are not talking about people that simply do this writing protocol as compared to people that do not do the writing protocol pennabaker and others of course are excellent scientists and they provide adequate control conditions the control conditions in most cases were to have people also do fifteen to thirty minutes of writing but to do journaling in the more conventional manner of autobiographical report of what they been up too lately or what they plan to do in fact very much my journal entries from college and in the ear subsequent to that it is important understand that t were talking about to day is a journaling protocol which seems somewhat conventional but the exact protocol is highly unusual as we havebeen talking about throughout to day's episode and in addition all of the data that were discussing in terms of positive mental and physical effects are data that were established relative that is are statistically significant as compared to a control group that also wrote for an equivalent amount of time tended to write out an equivalent number of words on average and yet were writing about something quite different than the people that were in the called experimental group i's im portant to keep in mind that were not simply talking about phenomenology here were talking about scientific studies where very specific measurements of the experimental group that is the group that did this particular form of writing about something very distressing or even tramatic four times fifteen te thirty minutes per time relative to a control group that did nearly the equivalent form of mechanical processes of writing but that the specific emotional content related to that writing was the major variable that differed in fact that is one particular strength of the protocol were describing today that if you think about it would be very hard to do in a study say of physical exercise where you have people perhaps run on a tread mill getting their hart rate up to eighty five per cent of there maximum heart rate for thirty minutes five days a week you would expect that that group compared to a group that did nothing would experience significantly greater shifts in positive healthmetrics lowerd blood pressure certainly not during the exercise about during the exercise about you can bet tht their blood pressurer and heartrate went wayway up but that of course afterwards they would adapt o that exercise aby having arresting heartrate that was lower than any group that did nothing or that walked on a treadmill but it is atually very hard to think about a control group that would provide real equivalents of time spent and effort spent but that would differ only on one variable which would be heartrate you could probably come up with someth ing but hey be very difficult to do whereas in the studies that were talking about during to day's episode essentially everything was the same right people are still writing theire still sitting theire sill doing it for the same amount of time it is simply that the content of the writing is different at the level of the emotional tone of the subject that they are writing about which i find both exciting and personally quite motivating to do the sort o protocal that i've described to day because it leads to such dramatic shifts in health across a huge range of dimensions both in people suffering from certain conditions an people who are not suffering from certain conditions and then the question becomes why what is actually happening at a physiological level that can explain all of these incredible psychological and physical positive shifts that occur o cao as with any protocol that shown in many many studies again here more than two hundred pureviewed studies to have pousive effects on mental health or physical health can imagine that there is going to be a constellation of pausiv effects that occur that can explain say the improvement in automune conditions or the improvement in anxiety that is a reduction in anxiety or the improvement in sleep patterns it is not going to be just one thing however there are some general categories of physiological changes that have been observed in people that do the particular protocol ere talking about to day that i think can explain a great number of the mental and physical shifts that occur now one of the more important studies in this area that is been published and here again this is a paper by gems penbaker but i do not wat to give the impression that he is the only person are the only laboratory thats looked at this particular writing protocol many others have as well and all provide links to some of those in the shonote captions but this particular studym about to describe explored how the disclosure of tramas or the writing out of very stressful experiences an impact immune function at the level of specific cell types of ormune system that are challenged in a way that mimics the sort of challenge we would experience if we were to be exposed to a bacteria or virus now without getting into a detail lecture about iminology and by the way i did not entire episode of th hubrman lad podcast about ammune function and the brain some years ago and you can find that by going hubrun labed out calm just put immune system into the search function it will take you to that episode and to any time stamps of other episodes reit touch on the umin system or protocols related to a mune brain function in the meantime this particular study is very interesting and worth high lighting because what they did was to essentially have people do the exact same protocal that we have been describing throughout to day's episode but they also included blood draws from the subjects in those experiments and they collected that blood from subjects both before and after the writing episodes in fact they took the blood fifteen weeks prior to the study and again six weeks into the study oca now keep in mind that people were completing the writing exercise over the course of at a maximum four weeks but they were still monering these subjects in terms of their psychological and physical health after the final writing exercise that was a key component of essentially all of the studies of this particular protocol they dessess people before they did the writing assignment they assessed people during the writing assignment and they assess people often long after the writing assignmint was completed even years after the writing assignm int was completed in this particular experiment their drawing blood fifteen weeks before and six weeks into the study six weeks into the study is after all of the writing that is the four bauts of writing have been completed they also divided subjects in the study into people that were called high disclosers these are people that revealed a lot about their particular tramatic or stressful episode in their writing and people that were low disclosers they also included a control group and the control group was essentially as at described before it consisted of people that also were doing journaling for the equivalent amount of time as people that were in the experimental group but that were not writing about a tramatic or stressful experients now the basic take away the study is as follows they take the blood they are able to isolate from the blood something called t lymphasites teelymphasites are an essential component of eurimune system these are cells that many people describe as white blood cells they are manufactured in the bone marrow which i still find a mazing right we think of bone is just these hard components of our body and are skeleton that allow us to be upright and to be rigid and to move about and not be a jelly but indeed in the centere of the bone is marrow and the marrow itself is performing an important physiological roll many rolls in fact one of which is to create these t lymphasites or white blood cells they actually are born of the bone marrow but then they mature and a structure call the phimus the phimus is an organ that sits essentialy behind your sternum and it is there that they cells that originate from the bone marrow are matured into but are effectively white blood cells which are essentially cells that go out and combat infections bacterial infections viral infections even fungal infections now they combat infection not alone but in collaboration with other immunecell types that you can learn about again in that episode that did about the omiune system and the nervous system if you choose to go listen to it and even if you do not here is what you need to know about this study in this study what they found is that when they took the blood from these subjects isolated those te lymphasites and then challenge those te lymphaites with something that mimics and infection and they do that with something called concanavolan a concanavolin a is what is considered a midrogen its something that activates t lymphasites and it activates what are called natural killer cells now that is a lot of detail for sake of this episode basically what the concanavolin a is doing is its mimicing and infection but in this particular study this is all being done on teelemphasize that hade been collected they are put into a dish and then there exposed to different concentrations going from low to medium to high of that concanavolin a mimicking a lowgraded moderate or severe infection and what they observed in thi study is remarkable to me is this distill blows my mind people that did this for bouts of writing protocol experienced greater degree of teelymphasite activation from the concanavelin mitogen challenge which mimics infection then did people who wrote about something that was not stressful or tramatic now that itself is pretty striking if you thing about it o were time out a writing exercise that generates an emotional state verses a writing exercise that does not produce as negative were intense in emotional state an were tongue about a significant effect on the immune system or the mobilization of ammunecells in response to anan immune challenge in addition to that however they observed that high disclosers that is people that really poured themselves into this writing protocol experience a greater degree of immuneactivation that is a fighting off response to this midogen concanavoline then did people that were low disclosers this really speaks to the fact that the intensity the emotional state during the writing exercise is having a significant impact on the immune system at the level of something as basic and yet as powerful as how much deployment of a muneresponse there is to an infection now the field of called psycho neuro immunology has been around for more than thirty years in fact if ye do not apply standard definitions to that field it is been round for thousands of years but really it is only in the last ten years or that scientists and physicions at least standard scientists and physicions have start ed to really adopt the understanding and really apply to their studies and their clinical practis this firm idea that the body and mind are linked in this way that emotions can really shape or physical responses and that physical responses also can shape of course are mental responses now i'm not trying to be disparaging at all of traditional science or medicine is just that until recently these feelds have existed moreor lessasylus people that studied bodily organs verses people that studied the brain people that studied emotions ind psychology verses people that studied the immune system andtere's been some cross over but by enlarge hat's been very sylode now i mention this because if you look into the history of why james penebaker in colleagues started exploring this particular pattern of journaling it actually relates his own personal experience and oft once spend too much time on this but it is worth mentioning that penabaker is actually spoken about and written about in by the way an excellent book that i've linked to in the shownote captions where he talks about his experience in suffering pretty severely from asthma as a child and that that ashma was seasonal and yet at some point later in his life because he had certain relatives visiting him in his new home location that his asthma would come and go as a consequence of interacting with certain members of his family independent of season and basically what he deduced from his own personal experience is that there must be some link between our emotions either negative or positive and our immune system or other physical ailments or thriving in the physical sense now he certainly was not the first one to come up with that hypothesis but indeed he was one of the first to really start exploring a protocol within the laboratory an experimental protocol that could really tap in to high degrees of emotionality in this case negative emotions and the consequence of that on physical health outcomes and this study that i mention is but one of those examples and in that way he is truly a pioneer and think ing about connic psycho nerro in munology but couching it not in the direction that most people do which is for instance there've been lots of studies where people have said okein people that are chronically stressed which includes of course psychological stress what are the effects on the nervous system the imune system et cetera and as you could imagine in general people who are more stressed over long long periods of time had worse physical outcomes and people w e're less stress had better physical outcomes but the protocal that we are talking about today is quite a bit different if you step ack and think about s little counter intuitive what pen obaker essentially did was to have people deliberately induce a negative experience and yet ther seeing positive physical health outcomes or in this case posive effects on a mune system function that leads to the question of what is really happening juring an after these four episodes of writing and that is where things get especially interesting as it relates to the nervous system and to nerrw plasticity or the nervous systems ability to rewire itself in response to experience that is what organatalk about next i to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nuteritian platform that analyzes data from your blood endiane to help you better understand your body and help you reach your healthicols i've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test i major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones et cetera but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutritian behavioral modification supplements et cetera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor go to inside tracer doct com slash hubermen for this week only meaning na ow through november twenty sixth inside tracker is offering fifty per cent off all bundles and thirty per cent off all other tests again that is inside tracker doc colm slash huberment o caso what is happening at a mechanistic level that allows people who do these four bouts of writing about something tramatic or stressful to achieve these long lasting positive shifts in mental and physical health there could be any number of different changes occurring at the level of the mind or body but what were talkng about here is tring to find the pivotal one or sometimes referred to as the linch pin mechanism that when one taps into that mechanism it wicks out into all these different systems of the brain in body and provides all of these different positive benefits now in researching this episode i thought long and hard about this and came up with a short list of ideas and as is always the case people have worked in this area on this particular protocol and protocal similar to it in the field of psychology and nurl science have also generated their own short list and though shortlists converge at the level of one particular mechanism that is worth describing and that one particular mechanism is anchored around the concept of nerrow plasticity that is ore nervous systems ability to change in response to experiencs and if you have heard me talk about nerrow plasticity before nerrow plasticity in childhood occurs through rather passive experience of any sorts of events in fact one of the hall marks of childhood is that just the mere exposure to an experience reshapes the brain not nasserely permanently but often in a way that is very long lasting now that is a feature of childhood because if you think about what the nervous system is really design to do for us it is of course what allows us to move our limbs it is what allows us to have a heart rate that goes in the background without us having to think about it calle autonomic functions it is what keeps us breathing without us having to think about it and on and on but one of the main functions of the nervous system is to be a predictive machine to make good guesses about what is to come next and one of the ways to make really good guesses about what is to come next is to take a certain period of life that we call childhood superimpose on that period of life that childhood what we call a critical period or sensitive period during which our experiences create a sort of map within us that allow us to predict o ke well if this persons in the room later well then that is likely to happen or if those people are in the room any number of different things could happen but of one particular category of experience as opposed to another that is really what your nervous system does it becomes a prediction machine and it becomes a prediction machine by drawing strong correlations between emotional states your physical surroundings your perception of whose there what is there what happen just prior to something and how it made you feel later when we talk about recounting a stressful or tramatic event if you recall there are three components to it it involved facts about that experience literally who was there what happened as to the best of our recollection if you recall the second thing it is also about recounting how that experience made you feel at the time and how it makes you feel now and then if you recall the third thing that is critical to include it is about any links or associations between what happened and really anything at all if you think about it all three of those things in that list are really about tapping into your nurl map or your schema as it sometimes called or your internal representation both conscious and unconscious of what happened during that stressful or tramatic event now a hallmarked feature of tramas as well as a hulmarked feature of addictions as well as a hulmarked feature of compulsive behaviors or negative habitual behaviors and negative habitual states chronic stress anxiety the sorts of things that trigger inpsomnia the sorts of states of body that trigger immune compromise and give us autoomune or other types of immune system challenges are that a certain component of our nervous system and our brain in particular are less engaged then they normally would be in the healthy condition now i want to be clear that in any one of these conditions whether nots irritable bal sindrum or is fibre mialga or its chronic anxiety or depression there are many many different brain centers and net works that is stations within the nervous system of the brain and body that are involved i really want emphasize s this there is no one location in the brain for instance for fear or anxiety it is always a net work phenomenon the relative activation of differen brain centeres at different times and on but with respect to thinking about tramas and stressful experiences we have to ask ourselves what is it about the emotional states and all the mapping the representation around those emotional experiences that would somehow impact are immune system ar fimus of all things or ar bone marrow or conversely what would it be about a stressful experience that would impact our heart rate that would somehow then also change our brain the mechanism that seems to be a sort of smoking gun of sorts that is the mechanism that really does seem to be at least one of those lynchpin mechanisms is that when we experience very stressful or tramatic experiences are prefrontal quartecs the neural real estate that is just behind our forehead which has several different subdivisions in fact is reduced in its overall levels of activity and other airs of the brain that sometimes are referred to as the limbic areas of th brain although if we were to be more accurate than that the modern nauraw science really refers to these as subcortical structures they are not necessarily limbic structures per say although they can include components of the limbic system they can include things the hipophalmas this dense collection of nurans that resides over the ruf our mouth ats involved in things aggression or temperature regulation sleep wake cycles and on as well as structures that perhaps you have heard more about such as the emigdola which is evolved in threat detection but other structures as well all of which are subcortical now those sub cortical structures can be compared in a fairly general but still a accurate way to the prefrontal quartex which is involved in contextual planning involved in a sessing outcomes if i do a what will happen if i do be what will happen the prefrntial artex is also associated with our self concept of our identity who we are what we are about what we value what motivates our decisions to do or tonot do things i do not want to create any false impressions that the prefruntal cuartexis somehow and more evolved structure than the subcortical and limbic structures but in some sense it is it is involved in more cuodin sophisticated functions or at least functions that involve us really thinking and being able to place a coherent narrative of what happened in the past what is happening now and what is likely to happen in the future if conditions a b or c happen to arise mq that is a very brief top level contor lessen in prefruntal cortical function and comparing it a bit to some subcortical and limbic structure functions now there have been nera imaging studies in particular studies by the leber man laboratory at university of california loss angelis but ner imaging studies in other laboratories as well that have established that when people recount very stressful or tramatic events the prefrontal quartex level of activity is reduced as compared to when people recall less stressful or less tramatic events in addition to that those subcortical structures ramp up their activity when people recall tramatic events at least at first cay this is very important what am about to tell you is that the repeated visiting of stressful and tramatic events in a structured way or even in a pseudo structured way as is the case when people first start journaling about that stressful or tramatic event on day on when it tends to be of pretty unstructure narrative that is actually been shown in the literature and then over the course of that second and third and forth writing bout people not only shift the sort of language that they us to describe their feelings and that event as we talked about earlier but the degree to which there is a more coherent narrative placed on the structure of that writing increases with each subsequent bout of writing and this is very important because what were really talking about here is people going deeper into their recollection of the experience not remaining at such a superficial level and two things are happening even though they are going deeper into this very distressing event there perhaps even experiencing heighten levels of distress right if you recall back to earlier in the episode when i talked about people who tend to beyond the low disclosure end of things they are not very reverbots they do not tend to use a lot of emotional words and early on they are not sharing too much about this experience an over time it increases whereas the othere group decrease the level of emotionality with each subsequent writing about but in each case the coherence of the narrative that is the degree to which the narrative takes on a story structure increases from the first to the fourth writing about and this is very importan because what were really talking about here is increasing the amount of truth telling the honesty around the experience and when we say honesty i'm not talking about any prior debate or on going to bate about what happened during those experiences remember when people do this proto call you are recalling what happen what were the facts in your mind what were the facts what happend what did not happen perhaps is relevant too but what happen second how did it make you feel that something that you are uniquely qualified to answer factually because only you can really know how you feel sometimes it takes ome effort to think in to how you feel to really get a clear sense of how you felt and how you feel but only you can report that factually no one can dispute that those are your feelings and that is part of what you are writing about nd then of course there is the third component of what are the connections between different experiences that are coming to mind and there again that is your unique factual report of what is going on inside your head around that event ok what were talking about here is an exercise in writing that yes is distressing but that we know based on your imaging data over time is increasing the base line levels of activity in certain key areas of the prefrontal quartex and that we know is associated with improvements in the symptomology around trama and other stressful events now it is extremely important to high light this truth telling component and the fact that your truth about these experiences is indeed your truth and it is such a key component of the writing exercise what we are looking at here is a situation where the event or events that happened actually happen there is no changing that but your narrative about those events is vitally important in terms of how you experience either on going distress from or relief from those events and in sort of a counter intuitive way reporting those events in a way that initially is very stressful or that can be stressful in any number of those different for writing bouts over time provides relief from that stress why do i say counter intuitive whill you could say oka will then does distress itself cause changes in the prefrontal quartex that are positive know in fact the opposite is true we know that being under conditions of diress or stress or trama reduces activity in the prefrontal quartex and here we are saying recalling that trama in stress in ways that are highly emotional and negative is actually increasing on going activity in the prefrontal uartex and indeed yes that is the case how could that be during development ner oplasticities a passive process whatever we are exposed to changes our brain in a way that allows us to more reliably predict the future right that is one of the key functions of the brain but as an adult meaning from age twenty five onward and really that is not a strict cut off could be la teens may be nineteen all the way up to say age a hundre and twenty which we think is perhaps the maximum life spand that humans could possibly reach we do not know most people do not reach hundr and twenty but let say from nineteen all the way up to a hundred and twenty we know that nerl plasticity is created when the nervous system goes into states that are a typical as compared to our normal waking states and one of the key triggers for nerl plasticity is when we have high levels of the call catacolamines dopemine epineperan end or nor epineperan in our brain and body that creates a state change that we call autonomic nervous system shift where we have elevated heartrate more distress high degrees of emotionality it is highly uncomfortable often and yet that signals to the nerl tissue hay something is happening here and we need to rewire we need to change and the actual rewiring occurs during deep sleep and states such as non sleep deepresst are any time were in a deep relaxation state some of you have heard me talk about ner plasticity before but the key elements to remember for to day's discussion is that these states of heighten levels of emotionality are the trigger for nerl plasticity and that the actual rewiring of nerl connections happens in sleep and states such as non sleep depressed we were to be completely logical we would sit back to this point and say oke here is a protocal in which we deliberately make ourselves stressed out again about a very stressful or tramatic event and yet even though that stressful or tramatic event at first created problems for our mental and physical health by revisiting it and triggering that stressful experience again four times in a lot of detail somehow its giving me relief from that experience it is creating positive mental and physical shifts an how could that be how could it be that the negative experience on the one hand creates problems and then on the other hand recreating that negative experience relieves those very same problems theres somethin n completely ological about that framework right well here is where things get really interesting there have been two separate collections of work in the psychology and narro science literature in the last ten years which have focused mainly on two concepts the first concept is that extremely stressful and dramatic experiences because they induce a relative reduction in the activity in the prefrontal quartex divorce our mind from creating a coherent structural narrative about what happened during those particular episodes and in doing crete a sort of confusion about responsibility now there is a whole discussion to be had about this and we will have that discussion in a future episode of the podcast about how trama is actually mapped within the brain and body they are lot of theories about this right sometimes we hear that it is all mapped within the body sometimes we heare it is all mapped within the brain turns out as is almost always the case it is both but there does seem to be both nourro science based and psychology both clinical and research psychology based evidence for the idea that when people experience very stressful and dramatic events that the representation of those events is somewhat fractured in the sense that people by not talking about them by not creating a coherent narrative around them start to form false correlations between the kind of stress that they create in our body and mind when we think about them and a confusion about what happened a confusion about why we feel terrible when maybe we were not the perpetrator or create a sort of lack of coherence between our bodily state and what we are thinking especially because we are not the perpetrator right here we talki about tramas and stressful things that happened to us maybe we for participance in that by virtue of our circumstances but when we talk about tramas what were really talking about are things that we would have never elected to do otherwise i doft wnto be two abstract about this but again within the nouro science and psychology understand ing of tromon stress it seems that there is a lack of coherence about the narrative there is also a mismatch between the bodily state and thoughts about that experience and there seems to be a confusion about who or what was responsible for inducing that negative state in a way that in some sense causes people to set aside that narrative and tryin push it away and not think about it because it is confusing it can often even be discombobulating for those that have suffered from very stressful events and trama i think some of this will resonate with you now a separate literature that is largely nested just within the narrow science community although it starting to wick out into the psychology community as well is the idea that when people tell the truth and in particular when people tell the truth with a very coherent structured narrative the levels of activity in the prefrontal quartex increase but not just temporarily that is that there is neural plasticity of these prefrontal quartical structures which are both involved in generating coherent narratives but are also involved in this is superimportant that are also involved in regulating the activity of those subcortical structures the hypothalymus and lymbic structures in other words that when we can increase our understanding of an event when we can understand why certain emotions arose what are rollin it really was what others rolls in that particular event were will then by increasing the activity of the prefrontal quartex it is better both in that moment and going forward to regulate the activity of ties of ther subquartical structures and i think one of the more impressive experiments within that whole field of linking prefrontal activity to truth telling is an experiment that was published a few years ago in the prossing is the national academy of sciences entitled increasing honesty in humans with non invasive brain stimulation now this is a very artificial scenario where people come into the laboratory and they have people do what is essentially a die rolling game they roll dice ocase of the rolling dice and then after they roll the dice only they can see the score that they get with those dice and then a numberis presented on tha screen and they after report whether or not the dye roll that they did matches or does not match the number that is persented on the screen and if it does match then they get a monitory award and the monitoryward is not huge but it is not insignificant either for each dye roll where they match the number that is presented on the screen they get the equivalent of and because this experiment was done in switzerland nine swiss francs which at the time of the study corresponded roughly to nine dollars and to day corresponds to roughly ten dollars they do this repeatedly and in some sense the subjects in these experiments are in a place to make not an enormous amount of money but again not an insignificant amount either now here is the key component of the study the statistics of the dice that they roll and the statistics of dye rolling and the numbers that they are presented make sure that there can only be a correct match on average fifty per cent of the time and in this experiment the subjects are asked to report entirely on the honor system what they got when they rolled the dyce and what one finds in this study and other studies that have been done subsequent to it is that when you take every day people you take men and women you take a broad age range you are not selecting for sociopas you are not selecting for people in one given profession or another pic your favorite profession if you were to assume any one given profession has less honest people than others they collect people from all sorts of walks of life and people report getting the same number that is presented o them that is a match about sixty eight per cent of the time which means they are not faithfully reporting what happened now nurr imaging study show that when people lie certain areas of the frontal quartex increase in their activity although the major effect when one looks noraly is a reduction in the prefrontal quartex and in particular sub compartments of the prefrontal quartex that will talk about in a moment and this particular study entitled increasing honesty in humans with non invasive brain stimulation as the name suggests used non invase of brain stimulation this is transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a really nice inconvenient tool becaus youownt afte drill down through the skull you can simply put this tool it is a coil you put it over particular part of the brain bond the outside of the skull indeed on the outside of the hair and you can either inhibit or stimulate particular brain areas using this transceannual stimulation i've actually had this done not in this particular experiment but i had it done when i was a graduate student some years ago and it was placed over my motor quartex and i was instructed to tap my fingers in a particular sequins and then they inhibit nural activity in a particular brain area and i was unable to tap in that same sequincs and they coud even shut down my ability to tap it was terrifying frankly although i do not want to discourge anyone from participating in any of these experiments should you choose and yes of course your motor abilitiese come back immediately afterwards that is why they can run these experiments now in this experiment what they did as they stimulated or inhibited ineral activity in particular areas of the prefrontal quartex and what they discovered was i think and many others by the way also agree a remarkable result which is that when they stimulated over a particular region of the prefrontal quartex people's honest report of what happened when they rolled the die relative tof the number they were presented increased ocheso they went from reporting that they had matched the number on the screen and therefore one money sixty eight per cent of the time that number was reduced down to what down to fifty per cent of the time in other words this stimulation of the prefrontal quartex took dishonest people even though they were should we say mildly dishonest or dishonest only in cert n conditions thrwere getting into judgment calls and i do not want to do that and made them truly honest they faithfully represented reality when a particular area the prefrontal quartex and that area by the way is the dorsalateral prefrontal quartex was activated they became truly honest they faithfully represented what happened in the dye rolling game now the conditions in this experiment are far and away different from the journaling protocal that we have talked about up until now however there been subsequent studies that have shown that indeed when people tell the truth to the best of their abilities they are absolutely trying to faithfully report what happened in the given experience of theirs activing the prefrontal uartex goes up and it persists afterwards there is indeed ner plasticity of the prefrontal quartex the hypothesis that seems to be the most likely and indeed has the greatest weight of evidence for it is that when people accurately and truthfully report and experience even if that experience is a stressful and tramatic one the repeated activation of the prefrontal quartex that occurs during that truth telling even though the truth telling is about a highly negative experience has the net effect over time of leading to more activity in the prefrontal quartex and that has a sort of runaway positive effect in the sense that it creates a more coherent framework and understanding of the stressful thing that happen writes all that discombobulation and that lack of coherent story that then leads to lack of coherence in terms of one's autonomic function underlying strass and confusion about whose responsible that does seem to be resolved or at least partially resolved and the prefrontal quartex of course does not harbour one area just for faithful accurate reporting of tromas and stressful events that very same area that dorsalateral prefrontal quartex is responsible for faithful reporting of all s orts of other things and there are now more and more study showing that truth telling faithful accurate representation of what we at least experienced in our past an our experiencing presently is good for us both in the short term and the long term and this i believe and other researchers both nero scientists and psychologists and psychotrists that have talked to about this result are an agreement that when one sees all these positive shifts in say immune system function how could it be that the cells produced by the bone marrow and te thimus are somehow better able to deal with and infection when one has recounted a dramatic or stressful event right first of all its counter in tuitive second of all why would that be i enhowr the body and brain linked in that way well there linked through the thing tat we call the nervous system and the key componet of the nervous system in this context is that when the prefrontial quartex can organize its understanding of wire autonomic nervous system was active well then the autonomic nervous system it seems becomes less likely to be active when it is not supposed to poce that could at least partially explained the reductions in anxiety the improvements in sleep the reductions and insomnia and because the nervous system in the immune system are in direct communication this often is in discussed but not only does the immune system impact the brain but the brain has networks literally neral circuits that inervate structures the spleen the thalmis that can communicate with the bone marrow right this is in science fiction this is really the case in fac there was an article that just came out in the journal nature this month and i'll provide a linktuin the showno captions which is finally starting to acknowledge that yes while these fields of immunology and brain scins and psychology have existed as disperate silos up until now it is oh clear that the nervous system is the connection between all these different components of brain and body and while it might seem counter intuitive that a writing protocall of the sor t that we' been talkingabout to day could posively impact the emune system were that a writing protocol the sort that we are talking about to day could posively impact things bibral mialga symptems well it makes perfect sense really when we start to think about the prefrontal quartex as this highly flexible seat of our cognition about our self representation ideas about who we are and about when certain elements within our brain in body ought to be activated and when they ought noht to be activated because much of the negative symptomology of stressful events and tramas is about the kind of disarray and discombobulated activation of wakefulness in the middle of sleep it getting woken up in mill the night and not being able to go back to sleep or elevated heartrate panic taxt anxiety and on and on i talked about some of this in the hubrn ladpodcast episode tht i did about stress and how to master stress with particular protocals it also came up in the discussion with doctor paulconti in the episode about trama and the series on mental health what we are pulling together here is a mechanistic understanding of why something writing for fifteen to thirty minutes about a stressfuller tramatic episode would were even could induce all these positive shifts in mental and physical health and while we do not have a complete understanding about the underlying mechanisms the activation and the neural plasticity of the prefrontal quartex seems to be one of the most logical and the most likely that sits at the center of at least the top list of the most important mechanisms i want to be clear that yes indeed i'm saying that when you writ about your truth about the facts the events of an experience and your emotions as they relate to that experience and the connections that you draw between any number of different things around that experience that the truth telling is the stimulus and that the emotion that accompanies that truth telling is what allows for neurplastesy to occur and that indeed truth telling and heighten levels of emotion even if theire negative emotions really do seem to have a positive rehabilitative of fact they are not an a surely going to cure every ailment i certainly do not want to give that impression nor am i saying that people cannot still benefit from theraby talk therapy woor other forms of therapy prescription drug therapy et cetera though certainly have their place you should talk to an expert psychatro psychologist medical doctor of course and in fact the data on the sort of journaling that we talked about to day indicate that people's progression through talk therapy drug therapies et cetera for depression in pitiesty is accelerated and significantly when they do this type of journaling the sort of journaling ere talk about to day and other theraies are not mutually exclusive and yet the journalling pro to call that pen obaker and colleagues came up with i think is spectacular because it has a number of important features and some of those are perhaps obvious to you already first of all it is completely zeril cost am it costs a bit of time but not even that much time it has an emotional cost an we should acknowledge that it is intense right an the more intense it seems the more effective and third it is something that really can be done either in the course of four days or across an entire month has some degree of flexibility to it i would even say a great degree of flexibility to it and last but certainly not least it is been shown over and over again i me more than two hundred pureviewed studies not just from pen obaker but from others as well to have myriad posive effects on the body and the mind in ways that are not just short term but that are pervasive not just over months but indeed over years i do not know about you but when i first learned about this literature i was well initially will but sceptical because that is just my nature a longwat how could a journaling have such a huge impactamy i've been journaling for years i know other people that journal on a regular baasis and i've never heard of this particular impact and i certainly have not heard or seen the data but when i started looking at the data i thought oh my goodness how come i h avent heard about this and do not really have an answer for that although i will say that pen o bacere and others i think we are very early in there merging of mind and body states although the initial studies were not really focused on mine anbody all the emphasis on a mune system and brain and nurow signs that actually came later i think one of the reasons we have not heard about this particular form of journalling is that frankly it is nested within the academic literature i have not heard much about it being incorporated into clinical practice is although i am sure it is incorporate into clinical practice is in frankly whatever the reason i'm just grateful to my collegue doctor david speagle who again as our associatesure of psychiatraate stamford he is a medical doctor credibly highly esteemd world wide for his work on neurow plasticity and helping people with stress and anxiety in all sorts of other challenges for informing me about it much that i've decide that next month i'm going to do one bout of writing for each week within that month i've opted to not do the four consecutive days of writing to me just personaly that seems a bit too intense it is not the time commitment it is the emotional commitment of placing myself into close proximity of them really challenging stressful maybe en tramatic memories day after day after day for four days personally i do not want to do that other people might opt to do that in o you non't titer succession and do the the four days in a row what the literature tells us again is that it does not really matter om as long as you do the four bouts of writing some time within a month period does not matter if they all are back to back days are you spread them out by a week or just to recap the other components of the protocol you are going to write about the same event for all four writing episodes those writing episodes can be anywhere from fifteen to thirty minutes but not less throughout each writing episode youre going to continuously writ and unless you need to stop to catch your breath or wipe your eyes dry of tears you are going to keep writing it is not necessary to pay attention to grammar or spelling but some degree of coherene may be not perfect complete sentences but some degree of coherence is probably useful especially if you decide to go back and analyze what you wrote later which again is an option you do not have to do that but if you do want to do that you aregoin to go back and circle the negative words that is the words that you perceive to be negative and you are going to square the words that are positive and if you you can also re read them and see whether or not as was observed in the studies that we described there was an increase in the amount of coherence about the topic or the event that you wrote about keep in mind that for each of the four bouts of writing you want to include both facts about the events facts about how you felt and or feel about those events now and third any associations whatsoever that happen to come to mind about those events emotional states people in your life anything pass present or future that third category of things to include is really open to you for anything you want to include the only requirement for it to be included is that it is true for you keep in mind also that this writing protocol is for you it is not necessarily to be shared now there is not a rule that says that you cannot share it with anybody although i do want to introduce the important covyacht that if you are going to share it with some one that person should be a dedicated health care ideally mental health care professional because there are data that suggest that when we write about tramatic and strestful events while it can be very beneficial for us it can actually be tramatic or challenging for people that we read it too now ther's huge variation around that statement certainly many of you probably know friends or family members or other trusted ones that you can talk to that would be able to hear about your stressful or tramatic experience and not be tromatized by it however it does seem that the listener can experience trama and negative symptoms which as challenge s sleeping distress et cetera by hearing about very stressful events that have occurred to others this is third hantrama or observational trama it sometimes called if we were to adhere to the protocol as it was used in the various studies that form the basis for what we are talking about to day we would say that you are writing about something that is for your eyes only in fact you are welcome to tear up or deleat the document afterwards and certainly you would want to store it in a safe place that it is not going to fall in to hands of somebody that you would not want seeing the contents of that writing the other thing to keep in mind is that while it is been demonstrated over and over again that over time these bouts of writing lead to improvements in mental and physical health as we talked about earlier it is very normal and in fact quite likely that one will feel pretty activated in the negative sense that one will feel somewhat low depressed angry sad immediately after finishing one of these bouts of writing especially if you fall into the high expresser category it is important that as we mention earlier that you have a buffer of time after which you complete the writing before moving into your other days events i also just personally would not recommend that you do this writing exercise just prior to trying to go to sleep at night if the experience is especially stressful or tramatic and by definition the writing exercise focuses on stressful and tramatic events keep that mind is well and then as a final point but certainly a significant one is to keep in mind that if this writing protocol is creating in you significant enough amounts of stress either psychological or physical that you simply do not want to do it or that it is impeding other areas of life by all means just stop moquet there was very little if any data within the papers that i read that indicated that people had to be removed from the study for this reason but keep in mind that we are talking about purposely delving into stressful or tramatic experiences and writing about them in some detail it stands to reason at some people might not be able to tolerate that and i want to strongly request that before any one embark on this writing protocol that you ask yourself whether or not you are indeed prepared to deal with the emotional state that might accompany faithful accurate recollection of what happened what you felt and any linxer experiences a full four times across the protocol i also see no reason why you could not do this protocol for something that was not the most stressful or tramatic event in your life but rather take your first pass at this protocol with something that was very stressful may be even tramatic but perhaps not the most tramatic event as a way of sampling weather not it is for you in fact i planned to do that in reviewing the literature and preparing for to day's episode i wrote down two things possibly three that i would want to write obol and then i rated them one through three one being the most tressful perhaps even tramatic the other being less tressful in the third the least stressful of the three and decided to go with writing about the second in that list that is the moderately stressful i cay tramatic event om as a waigh to first weighed in to this protocol but i will adhere to the protocol i'm going to write about that same thing four times has opposed to switching from one event to the next midway through the protocol i am going to adhere to the protocol i'll certainly be happy to get back to you and let how it goes i invite you if you to embrace this protcol to try it we have provided lynx to the literature that supports this protcol again it is very rare perhaps the first time that i've ever done an entire podcast episode about a single protocolor to formulate an entire podcast around oprotocol but frankly i do not look at this protocol from penebakere and colleaes as just a protocol i look at it as an entire body of literature that includes a centere of mass of data that all seem to point in the same direction which is that writing about something very sressful or tramatic for fifteen to thirty minutes four times either on consecutive days or separated out by a week between each of those four writing sessions can produce long lasting posive effects on mental and physical health and to me that is a protocol that is simply too valuable to overlook and simply too valuable to not share with you if you are learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribed are you two channel

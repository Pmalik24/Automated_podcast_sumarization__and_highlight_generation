welcome to the hubermen laponcas science science pace to my name is andrew hubermen and o a professor of neurobology and opthemology as stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate fror my teaching an research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring you zero costic consumer information about science and science related tools in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens ath letic greens is an al in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reasen i started taking athletic greens an thereason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentally with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need nd the probiocs to support my microbiom if you' to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash hubermen and claim a special offer they will giv you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wor getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in viteemin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stockam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are in element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proparatioes all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optomized if the electrolites are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok cam slash hubermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase thei're all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element doc cam slash you erement to day we are going to talk about how to change your nervous system for the better as you re call your nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord but also all the connections that your brain an spinal cord make with the organs of your body and all the connections that the organs of your body make with your brain in spinal cort this thing that we call the nervous system is responsible for everything we know all our behavior all our emotions everything we feel about ourselves and the outside world everything we think and believe it is really at the centre ofe our entire experience of life and who we are fortunately in humans unlike in other species we can change our nervous system by taking some very specific and deliberate actions and to day we are really going to focus on the actions the motor commands and the aspects of movement and balance that allow us to change our nervous system it turns out that movement and balance actually provide windows or portals into our ability to change our nervous system the way we want even if those changes are not about learning new movements are learning how to balance and sooniu'l understand why to day we aregin to talk a lot about the basic science of nerro plasticity i promise to not use excessive nominclature they will be a little bit but i'll try to make it as clear as possible and we are also going to talk a lot about protocals and tools that the scientific literature points to and supports fore changing our nervous system again not just forsake of learning new motor movements are how to balance better but for how to feel differently about particular experiences both pass present in future as well as how to learn faster we are not gin to discuss hacts a word i loathe we are not goin to discuss emics we are going to discuss mechanism and scientific data and the tools that those mechanisms and scientific data point to that you can tailor your practicses around learning to your specific needs and goals let us begin by just examining the big picture question which is does the brain control behavior and my hope is that everyone is immediately thinking yes the brain and nervous system we really should say as the brain s just one componef the nervous system controls our behavior how does it do that well there are couple different levels that it does that first of all if we are talking about movement behaviour generally means movement if we are tall youbout movement we have two categories of nurons that are very important to think about in the contexts of neral plastesy first of all we have what are called lower motor nurons these are motor nurons that live in our spinal cord if for the effisionatoes out there for those of you that might be had to medical school are just one to learn more about the anatomy they live in the ventral horn of thes final corn mothet does not matt r if you do not want to know that just know that you have these things called lower motor nerons these are nurons that are in the spinal cord but they extend a wire that we call an acts on out into the periferal nervous system into the body and those nurons connect with muscle they send electrical potentials out there that allow our muscles to twitch in to contract as a litle pointive of fact actually we do not have muscle memory there is no such thing as muscle memory muscles are dumb they do not know anything they do not have a history they do not have a memory they do not know anything it is the nurons that control those muscles and their firing patterns in which all the information for motor patterns are stored your ability to walk is not muscle memory its nural memory now the lower motor nerons while smarter than the muscle to speak ares not the most brilliant of the motor nerons they are generally involved in doing what they are told and they are told what to do from two sources we have circuits in our brainstems this who be cone around your neck deep in the brain that are called sentral pattern generators these are sometimes called spgs central pattern generators or what allow us to generate repetitive patterns of movement inhaling an exhaling inhaling an exhelling subconsciously is controlled by e central pattern generator that just means a collection of nurons if you really on know ther caled the prebought singor nurons discovered by jack felldmen in colleagues that you seel e these nurons in the brainstem send information down the frenic nerve and control the diaphram sen it goes inhale exale inhale exale and you do not have to think about that you could think about it and you could change the durations of inhales and exales and change that up but the motor nerons that control that are just responding to what the brain is telling to do the other central pattern generators include things walking the right limb left limb right limb left limb pattern that we normally associate with walking was learn during childhood and these central pattern generators sometimes called spgs tell are loator lower motor nerns fire now you fire now you fire sod they are literally saying right left right left they are the marching orders from the brainstem to the lower motor nrons these lower motor nerns do what they are told they are obedient little soldiers and they do what they are told and their job is to make the muscles contract at specific times oke that is all simple but then there are the upper motor nerons the upper motor nerons actually reside in our motor quartecs way up on top of the brain and they are involved in sending signals for deliberate action kiso they send signals to the lower motor nerons which are the effectors the ones at actually control the muscles but the upper motornor on to the once that send very specific signals for instance the signals that would allow you to make a cup of coffee in the morning or to deliberately engage in any kind of behavior now you can probably make a cup of coffee in the morning without having to think about it too much it is almost reflective for you now which means that a lot of the information about how to perform that particular movement has been passed off to circuitry that is now more or less in the brain stem and below the motor quartecs now why am i giving you all thits detail well if you want to change motor patterns you have to know where in the circuitry changes are possible and ye you ought to know where the changes are most likely to occur you also need to know how do you signal to the brain that and nervousistem that a change is necicary let us just pause there return to the initial question that we started with which is does the brain control behavior and the answer is yes and now how it is upper motor nrons lower motor nerons you got these things called central pattern generators in some connection with the muscles there you go you just got basically what a was the equivalent of the introduction to a college lecture on motor control in the nervous system but the point to day is all about plasticity how can that be leveraged in order to open up this magical thing that we call plasticity in order to access changes to our emotional experience or to our beleef system or to our ability to remember and ue specific kinds of information for say math or language et cetera well what i'm not in to tell you is that you need to go running or you need to go biking or that simply going through motor patterns is going to open up plasticity because i hate to tell you this but as beneficial as exercise is it does not open plasticity unless you do certain things and i will tell you exactly what those certain things are to day to be clear i think exercises wonderful and healthy can improve cardevascular function maintain strangth bondensity all that good stuff but just working out or doing your exercise of various kinds will not change your nervous system it will maintain it and it can certainly improve other health metrics but it is not going to open up the window for plasticity the question we need to ask is can behavior change the brain we already agree that the brain can change behavior but can behavior change the brain and the answer is yes provided that behavior is different enough in specific ways from the behaviors that you already know how to perform let me repeat that can behavior change the brain and the answer is yes provided that behavior is different enough from the sorts of behaviors that you already know how to perform and i should have added the word well because you cannot obviously perform a behavior that you do not know how to perfo orm because you doft knw how to do it yet but there is a key element to accessing narrol plasticity that frankly i do not see out there in the general discussion about narrow plasticity in the general discussin about narrow plasticity and about learning i hear all these gimics about using different ways to remember lots of people's names and arranging things into their first letters and nemonachs and all this kind of stuff which frankly to me feels really ghimicky and i think that if you look at superlearners they tend to be people that have a process of say extreme memory but people who have extreme memory generally the literature shows us are pretty poor at other things i do not thnk most of us are interested in walking around knowing how to remember everything in fact there are some interesting studies looking at humans who overremember and they suffer tremendously because they remember all sorts of things the number of the top of the receipt at the bodaga that they bought a cococola ten years ago this is useless information for most people they do not do well in life really the goal is not to remember everything the goal is to be selective about your brain changes and when we talk about brain changes i want a highlighte a daptive changes there is a whole category of things that we are gounto discuss when we talk about dramatic brain injury and domentia a topic for a future episode about all the things that happen when you have damage your nervous system or your missing nurons but to day i really want to talk about something that i think is very near and dear to many of your hearts which is what are the behaviors that you can engage in to access nerrow plasticity that then you can apply that plasticity to the specific things that you want to learn or unlearn this is very important because i do not want people to get the impression that were really talking about learning abount cha motor movements you may be in athlete you might not be in athlete you might want to learn how to dance you might not you might want to learn how to dance and get better at remembering and learning languages for instance or at unlearning some difficult emotional experience meaning you want o remove the emotional load from a particular memory of an experience what were talkg about to day is using behavior as a gait to enter states of mind and body that allow you to access plasticity let us talk about the different kinds of plasticity that are available to us because those will point directly towards the type of protocols that we should engage in to change ourselves for the better the called adapt iv plasticity there is something called representational plastcity representational plasticity is just your internal representation of the outside worlds you have a map of auditory space believe it are not meaning you have nurons the respond when something over all my right happens a snapping my fingers over to my right cannot snap as well my left which is a the whole thing into itself a the a week over there on the leftcide but when i do that theire different nurons respond to those we have a map of visual space certain urons are seeing things in certain portions of isual space an not others we have a map of motor space meaning when we move our limbs and particular directions we know a not where those limbs are because even if we cannot see them we have what is called proprioceptive feed backs we have knowledge about where our limbs are in fact people that lacks certain nurons that for for propriosceptife back they or very poret controlling their motor behavior they get injured a lot is as yet terrible situation we have got all these representations inside and we have maps of our motor commands we know that for instance if i won to reach out and grab the pen in front of me that i need to generate a certain amount of force i rarely overshoot i rarely miss the pen mon qe our maps of the motor world and our maps of the sensory world are merged the way to create plasticity is to create mismatches or errors in how we perform things and this i think is in amazing and important feature of nerrow plasticity that is highly under appreciated the way to create plasticity is to send signals to the brain that something is wrong something is different and something is not being achieved i think this will completely reframe the way that most people think about plasticity most of us think about plasticity as oke we are going to get into this optimal learning state or flow and then suddenly we are going to be able to do all the things that we wish that we could do whi hate to break it to you but flow is an expression of what we already know how to do it is not a state for learning and i'm willing to go to bat with any of the the the floanise does out there that want to challenge me on that one flow is an expression of nervous system capabilities that are already imbedded in us errors and making errors out of sinct with what we would to do is how our nervous system is cued through very distinct biological mechanisms that something is not going right and therefore certain neuro chemicals are deployed that a signal the neural circuits that they have to change let us talk about the experiments that support what i just say is i'm about to tell you that making errors over and over and over again is the rout to shaping your nervous system that it performs better and better and better and i'm nok in to tell you that the last rep of a set where you hit failure in the gim is anything nerrl plasticity you hear that too that it is pushing to that point of of a cliff where you just cannot function any more that is the signal that is not the signal that is a distinct nor muscular phenomenon that bears zero resemblance to what it takes to get nerral plasticity let us talk about errors and making errors and why and how that triggers the release of chemicals that then allow us to not just learn the thing that we are doing in the motor sense play the piano dance et cetera but it also creates an environment to mill you within the brain that allows us to then go learn how to couple or un couple of particular emotion to an experience or better language learning or better mathematical learning it is a really fundamental aspect of how we are built and when you look at it it is actually very straightforward it is a series of logical steps that once you learn how to open those hatches it becomes very straightforward to deploy last episode we discuss some of the basic principles of nerow plasticity if you did not hear that episode no problem i'll just review it quickly which is that it is a falsehood that everything that we do in experience changes our brain the brain changes when certain nerro chemicals namely a seetocoline epinefron and dopamine are released in ways and in the specific time that allow for nerral circuits to be marked for change and then the change occurs later during sleep i'll review that later but basically you need a certain cocktail of chemicals released in the brain in order for a particular behavior to reshape the way that our brain works the quession really is what allows those nerro chemicals to be released and last episode it talked all about focus if you have not a seenn or heard that episode you might want to check it out about some specific tools and practices that can allow you to build up your capacity for focus and release certain chemicals in that cocktail but to day were gin a talk about the other chemicals in the cocktail in particular dopamine and were really in a center or discussion around this issue of making errors and wi making errors is actually the signal that tells the brain oce its time to change or more generally it is time to pay attention to things that you change and i really want to distinguish this a point really clearly which is that i'm an talk to day a lot about motor and vestibular meaning balance programs but not just for learning motor commands and and balance not just for learning nou motor skills and balance but also for setting a stage or a cond of condision in your brain wecan go learn other things as well let us talk about some clastic experiments that really nail down what is most important in this discussion about plasticity s i mention last episode and all just tell you right now again the brain is incredibly pat plastic from about birth until about age twenty five passive experience will shape the brain just because of the way that the chemicals that are sloshing around and there and the way that the nurons are arrange in all sorts of things the the braind job is to customize itself in response to its experience and then somewhere about twenty five 's not the day after your twenty s expirthtay plasticity closes there is a cimtapering off of plasticity and you need different mechanisms to engage plasticity as an adult we are mostly go me talking about adult plasticy to day but i got a lot of ques ions about well what about if i'm younger than twenty five first of all it is great i i it is i wish i could a i wish ad a time machine but i do not am becaus as i've said a before the stinger is when you are young your bain is very plastic but you have less control over your experience when you are older generally you have more control of your experience but your brain is less plastic if you are already asking the question as a twenty year old or fifteen year old what can i do now that is really enhance my brain a i guess the simple question would a anser escuse me would be and aside which we get the broadest education you can possible that means a mat chemistry physics literature music learn how to play an instrument i'm saing that cause i wish i had a et cetera get abroad training in a number of things and find the thing that really a captures your passion and excitement and then a put a ton of additional effort there that is what i recommend including emotional development may be a topic for a future episode but if you are an adult or if you are a young person knowing how to tappen to these plasticity mechanisms is very powerful you need these chemicals deployed in the nervous system in order to mark whatever nerve cells happen to be firing in the time afterward for change and people are obsessed with asking what supplements what drugs what conditions what machines ar will allow for that but there is a natural set of conditions that allow for that when we came into this world we learned to take our different maps of exof experience our motor maps are auditory maps are visual maps and to link them we aline those maps the simplest examples the one i gave before if i hear something off to my right a click that could come from my finger snapping or it could come from something at generally by somebody else or something else to my right i look to my right if i hear it on the left i look to my left if i hear t right in front of me i keep looking right in front of me and if i hear behind me i turn around and that is because our maps of visual space and our maps of auditory space and our maps of motor space are a line to one another in perfect register it is an incredible feature of our nervous system it takes place in a structure called the superior coliculus although you do not need to know that name spiriculiccas has layers literally stacks of nurons in a sandwhich where the zero point right in front of me or may be ten or fifteen degrees off to my right or ten or fifteen degrees off to my left are a line that the the auditory nurons the ones that care about sounds at fifteen degrees to my right sit directly below the nurons that look at fifteen degrees to my right in my visual system and when i reach over to this direction there is a signal that that sent down through those layers that says fifteen degrees off to the right as the direction to look it is the direction to listen and it is the direction to move if i need to move there is an alignement and this is really powerful and this is what allows us to move through space and function ind our lives in a really fluid way tset up during development but there ebeen some important experiments that have revealed that the these maps are plastic meaning they can shift their subject to naurol plasticity and there are specific rules that allow us to shift them hearers the key experiment the key experiment was done by a colleague of mine s now retired but whose work is absolutely fundamental in the field of nerol plasticity are newson the newson lab and many of the newson lab scientific offspring showed that if one is to wear prism glasses that shift the visual field that eventually they will be a shift in the representation of the auditory motor maps to now what they initually did is they looked at young subjects and what they did is they moved the visual world by making them wear prism glasses that for instance if a if my pen is out in front of me at five degrees off centers ir just a little bit off center if your listen to this this would be just a little bit to my right but in these prism glasses i actually see that pen way over far on my right it is actually her but i see it over there becaue i'm wearing prisms on my eyes what happens is in the first day or you ask people or you ask a animal subjects or whatever to reach for this object and they reach to the wrong place because they are seeing it where it is not this gets especially complicated when you start including sounds when you have a thing off to your right making a sound but the thing is actually right here you are hearing te sound at one location and you are seeing the object at another location because you are wearing these prisms your image of the world is totally distorted or in experiments done by other groups they wear glasses subjects wore glasses that completely invert the visual world that everything is upside down which is an extreme example of these representational maps being flipped or shifted but what you find is that in young individuals within a day or two they start adjusting their motor behavior in exactly the right way that they always reach to the correct location they hear a sound at one location they see the object that ough to make that sound it at a different location and they somehow are able to adjust their motor behavior to reach to the correct location it is incredible its absolute incredible or ing the case of the people who look at the world upside down they somehow are able to navigate this upside down world even though we are completely used to are feet being on the floor and not on the ceiling and people not walking at us by hanging off the ceiling bats amazing and what it tells us is that these maps that are aline to one another can move and shift and rotate and even flip themselves and it happens best in young individuals if you do this an older individuals in most cases it takes a very long time for the maps o shift and in some cases they never shift this is a very experimental cenareo but it is an important one to understand because it really tamps down the fact that we have the capacity to create dramatic shifts in our representation of the outside world how can we get plasticity as adult that mimixs the plasticity that we get when we are juveniles while the newtsand lab and other labs have looked at this and it is really interesting first of all we have to ask what is the signal for plasticity is it just having prisom glasses on no because they did that experiment and ruled that out is it just the fact that the visual thing is over to my appears to be far over to my right when in fact it is right in front of me no the signal that generates the plasticity is the making of errors it is the reaches and failures that signal to these to the nervous system that this is not working and therefore the shifts start to take place and this is fundamentally important because i think most people think oh well practice is going to be i have to acts ass beginners mind which is a great concept actuallates about approaching things expecting to make errors which is great i think ii am a believer in beginners mind but people understandably get frustrated their trina learn a piece on the piano and they do not know they cn't do it ore theyre trying to write a piece of code or the're trying to acts as some sort of motor behave and they cannot do it and the frustration drives them crazy and i cannot do at i cannot do it when they do not realize that the the errors themselves are signalling to the brain and nervous system something is not working and of course the brain does not understand the words something is not working the brain does not even understand frustration as an emotional state the brain understands the nerro chemicals that are released namely epineferan and a setocoline but also will get into this the molecule dopomine when we start to approximate the correct behavior just a little bit and we start getting a little bit right what happens is when we make errors the nervous system canit once a freaks out becaus it is a very a mechanistic and controlled situation but the nervous system starts releasing nero transmitters and neuromodulators that is they we better change something in the circuitry and errors are the basist for nerrow plasticity and for learning and i wish that this was a more prominent prominent out there i gosis is why i'm saying it and humans do not this feeling of frustration and and making errors the few that do do exseedingly well in whatever pursuits they happen to be involved in the ones that do not generally do not do well they generally do not learn much and if you think about it why would your nervous system ever change why would it ever change unless there was something to be afraid of somethingthat made us feel awful will signal that the nervous system needs to change or there is an error in our performance it turns out that the feed back of these errors the reaching to the wrong location starts to release a number of things and now you have heard about them many times but this would be epineferan it increases alertness a sutocoline focus and this is why frustration that leads us to just cone a quit and walk away from the endeavor is the absolute worst thing but the it because if a sutocolin is released it creates an opportuniny to focus on the the error margin the distance between what it is that youare doing an what t is that you would to do and then the nervous system starts to make changes almost immediately in order to try and get the behav iour right and when you start getting even a little bit right that third molecule comes on liner is released which is dopomine which allows the plastic changes to occur very fast now this is what all happens very naturally in young brains but in old brains it tends to be pretty slow except for in two conditions l me just pause and just say this if you are uncomfortable making errors and you get frustrated easy easily if you leverage that frustration toward drilling deeper into the endeavor you are setting yourself up for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage but if you take that frustration and you walk away from the endeavor you are essentially setting up plasticity to rewire you according to what happens afterwards which is generally feeling pretty miserable now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is that continuing to drill into a process to the point of frustration but then staying with that process for a little bit longer and i'll define exactly what i mean by little bit is the most important thing for adult learning as well as childhood learning but a dult learning in particular now the newson lab did two very important sets of experiments the first one was published in nature very important study which showed that juveniles can make these massive shifts in their map representations meaning you can shift the visual world using visual prisms a huge amount and very quickly young young individuals can shift their representations of the world thait that they learn to reach to the correct location they get a lot of plasticity all at once it happens very fast in the period of just a couple days in adults it gent tend to be very slow and most individuals never actually accomplish the full map shift they do not get the plasticity and on houre were time ut mapchous but this could be am learning a new languages could be any number of different things that one were attempting over saying is what i always said before which is that we learn very well as youngsters but not as adult after twenty five but then what they did is they started making the increment ove change smaller instead of shifting the world a huge amount by putting prisms that shifted the the visual world a you do not all the way over to the right they did this incrementally first they put on prisms that shifted it just a little bit just seven degrees i believe was the exact number and then it was fourteen degrees and then it was twenty eight degrees and what they found was that the adult nervous system can tolerate smaller and smaller errors over time but that you can stack those errors that you can get a lot of plasticity put simply incremental learning as an adult is absolutely essential you are not going to get massive shifts in your representations the outside world how do you make small errors as opposed to big errors well the key is smaller bouts of focus learning for smaller bits of information it is a mistake to try and learn a lot of information in one learning bout as an adult what these papers from the newson lab show and what others have gone on to show is that the adult nervous system is fully capable of engaging in a huge amount of plasticity but you need to do it in smaller increments pur learning epoch ar pur learning episode how would you do this wel let us say ot for instence that i'm terrible at freethrows let' say i wanted to learn free throus ofm forty five years oldsom well past the you a twenty five and under mark i'm in to make errors only a lot errors if i go into learning free throws knowing that errors are the gait to plasticity then i feel low of it better but i still have to aim for the the rim ofthe basket or the the net basically you showing how little i know about abasketball but i think i know the general themes around abaskine aballs in that abackboard and and aball of course i go the free for a line and i'll throw how long should i go well until i'm hitting the point of frustration and at that point continuing probably for anywhere from ten to a hundred more trials should be my limit right that should be my limit if i want to improve some specific aspect of the motor behavior and the question then is what should i be paying attention to what should i be focussing on whel obviously try to get the ball into the basket but the beauty of motor learning is that the circuits for auditory and visual and motor more or less teach themselves i do not necessarily have to be paying attention to now exactly what om the contact to my fingers with the ball or some random feature whether notm bending my knees or not the key is to try a number of different perameters until i start to approximate the behavior that i want to get a little bit better and then trying to get consistent about that non many of you involved in sports learning will say whell that is obvious is just incremental learn ing but the keything is in those errors by isolating the errors and making a a number of errors in a particular aspect of the motor movement it is signals to the brain that it is plastic and if i leave that episode of going and trying to learn how to shoot freethrows my brain is still plastic plasticity is a state of the brain and nervous system it is not just gear toward the specific thing i'm trying to learn their two aspects to plastecy ta i think we really nean to highlight one is that there is plastisity gear toward the thing that you are trying to learn specifically and then there are states of mind and body that allow us to access plasticity now toward the end of this episode i'm going o spell out specific protocals in mulimore detail that freethrow example might not of correlate with what you want to learn i sha i do not have a huge desire to learn freethrows i've more less given up on on basket ball but and free throws in particular but i think that it is important understand that motor movements are the most straightforward way to acces states of plasticity and that can be forsake of learning the motor movement or forsake of accessing plasticity more generally one very important aspect to plastisy getting plasticity as an adult is not just smaller increments meaning shorter bout i give an example of another hundred freethrows or something but going out there just getting my ten yu ten thousand free throws all at once or packing as much as i can into one one episode is not going to be as efficient for me as shorter abouts of intense learning as a bes an adult because the error signals are not as well define to my nervous system it is not kin to know what needs to change and this is really the key element of increment to learning is that your trying to signal to the nervous system at least one component that needs to change the nervous system needs to know what the error is now when ive shoot free throws lord knows there a lot of different kinds of errors that happen probably the way on betting my knees the ark of the ball the way i'm organizing my shoulder is probably where my eyes are lots of things which ones to focus on that is what i said before the beauty of the motor system is i do not have to worry about all of that i just need to get the repsin a number of times and the nervous system will figure out how far off my motor commands are at the level these maps that i describe earlier how far those ar those deviate from the desired behavior getting the ball into the basket and it will start making adjustments but as i make adjustment fore has my nervous system makes adjustments for me the keything is to not start adding a variety of new errors because then it gets confused and this is why short learning bouts are absolutely essential let say it is for learning an instrument as an adult probably anywhere from seven minutes to thirty minutes is going i provided that it is full your fully attending you are your very focust is going to be a pretty significant stimulus to inspire plasticity in the nervous sistem now there is one way to get a lot of plasticity all at once is an adult there is that kind of holy grail thing of yon getting massive plasticity as you would when you were a a young person but as an adult and the newson lab revealed this by setting a very serious contingency on the learning what they did was they had a situation where subjects had to find food that was displaced in their visual world again by putting prisms and they had to find the food and the food made a noise there was a noise set kind of the location of the food through an array of speakers basically wt they found was that if people have to adjust their visual world in order to get food the placticity would eventually occur but it was very slow as an adult it was very very slow unless they actually had the hunt that food they actually if they in order to eat at all they needed plasticity and then what happen was remarkable what they observed is that the plasticity is an adult can be as dramatic as robe asas it is in a young person or in a young animal subject provided that thereis a serious incentive for the plasticity to occur and this is absolutely important understand which is that how badly we need or want the plasticity determines how flact that place plasticity will arrive which is incredible because the brain is just nurons and soup of chemicals what this but this means that the importance of something how important something is to us actually gates the rate of plasticity and the magnitude of plasticity and this is why just passively going through most things going through the motions as we say or just getting our repsin quote un quote is not sufficient to get the nervous sstem to change this study ut beautiful study publish in the journal narrw science shows that if we actually have to accomplish something in order to eat or in order to get our ration of of income we will reshape our nervous system very very quickly the nervous system has a capacity capacity excuse me to change at a tremendous rate to enormous degree at any stage of life provided it is important enough that that happen and i think some of you might be saying well doe that is obvious if it is really crucial then of course tit is can ot change faster but it did not have to be that way and for most people who are trying to learn how to learn faster or learn better they probably in most cases they are hitting a limit because the need to change is not crucial enough and i think there number of places where this has important relevants in the people who are battling addiction for instance i will be the first to say that i sympathize with the fact that addictions have a biologicl component ah there is clearly cases where people struggle tremendously to change their behavior and their nervous system in some cases is diserrupted by whatever substance they have been abusing or behavior that they have been engaging in that it is that much harder for them to change but we have also seen incredible examples where when people have to change from an internal standpoint from their own belief and desire to change that massive change is possible and i think that the studies that newson did showing the incremental learning can create a huge degree of plasticity is an adult as well as when the contingency is very high meaning we need to eat ore we need to make an income ere we need to do something that is vitally important for us that plasticity can happen in these enormous leaps just they can in adolescence and young adult hood that points to the fact that it has to be a nerro chemical system there has to be an underlying mechanism right this wasnit a case of you now sticking a wire into the brain or taking a particular drug all the chemicals that were about to talk about are released from drug stores if you will chemical stores that already reside in all our brains and the key is how to tap into those stores and we are in a next talk about what are the specific behaviors that liberate particular categories of chemicals that allow us to make the most of incremental learning and that set the stage for plasticity that is similar enough ere mimics these high contingency states the need to get food or really create a sense of internal urgency chemical urgency if you will if you have heard previous episodes of this podcast you may have heard me talk abut all tradian rhythms which are these ninety minute rhythms that break up our twenty four hour day on they help break up our sleep into different cycles of sleep rem sleep and non remsleep and in waking states they help us i or i should say they break up our day in ways that allow us to learn best within ninety minute cycles et cetera some of you might be saying weight you have been tung met all tradiin cycles in a moment ago you retulgy about seven minute or twelve minute or thirty minute learning cycles to day were really talking about how to tap in to plasticity im through the completion of a task or are working toward something repetitively and making errors and just a frame this ah in the contects of the altradian cycle you might sit down decide that you are gon to learn a on conversational french which we meedn that you probly do not already speak french sere gon a sit down you are going to a decide you gon to learn some some nouns and some verbs uou might do some practice at the the will treatiin cycle says that for the first five to ten minutes of doing that youre mind is going to drift and your focus will probably kick in provided tat you'r visually a you restricting your visual world to that just the material in front of you something o talked about last episode somewhere around the ten or fifteen minute mark and then at best you are pobley ging to get about an hour of of a deliberate kind of tonnal vision a learning in there your mind will drift and thend toward the end of that what is now an hour and ten or hour and twenty minute o cycl you aregoin your brainwill serstrike to flicker in and out you might serthing about what youneed to eat or the fact tyou have to use the bathrom or something and than by the ninety minutes ats probably time to stop the learning about and go to something else maybe return for a second learning about later but im maybe take a nap afterwards or something to enhance the learning but that it is going to happen within about a ninety minute block you aregoingto go through that that cycle of learning but when i refer to the sevener or twelve or thirty minutes of of making errors what i mean is when you are really in a mode of rerepeating errors not deliberately you are trying your best to accomplish something in your failing you are absolutely failing your your tryna remember say om the sign language alphabet i must tryn to teach myself this recently and then if kp repeating an repeating and then get to a certain poinmy kept making errors making errors making ours you want ta keep making errors for this period of time that i'm saying will last anywhere for about seven to thirty minutes it is exceedingly frustrating but that frustration it liberates the chemical cus that signal that plastasi needs to happen and they also signal the paticular nurons that are active im in the case of sign language it might be the ones that control my hand movements as well as me thinking about what the different letters are it it is signaling differeng components within the networks of betwen the brain and body and it is trying to figure out wait where or these errors coming from where the errors coming from ah it is those nurons they are making the mistakes they are making the mistakes they are making the mistakes and it is sentially highlights that pathway for change and it is the case that when we come back a day or two later in a learning abaut ater a naper a night or two deep rest then what we find is that we can remember certain things and the motor pathways work and we do not always get it perfectly but we get a lot of it right whereas we got at wrong before that seven to thirty minute intense learning bout is within the altradi in cycle and i want to be clear about that and some people can tolerate many of these per day most people can only tolerate one or two maybe three this is intense work if om of shooting free throws you couldprobably do it all day but when i'm taking about is really trying to accelerate plasticity by having a period of thi seven to thirty minutes pur learning bout that is specifically about making errors i want a really under score that and it is not about a simention before coming up with some little hack or trick or a or something f that sort it is really about trying to cue the nervous system that something needs to change because otherwise it simply will not change now there is another aspect to learning i i think it is only fair to mention which is that a we can all learn a very easily when there somehing very bad happens to us and i do not a i do not wish this on any one but it is the case thate if something really terrible happens that we will have a a lifetime memory for that event we there are processies that allow us to uncouple the emotional load of that event i talked about some of those a few episodes back the episode on a dreams trman hallucinations an organ a return to a troma release petiesty in some of those other themes in a future episode but the reason why negative experiences are but can be wired intus quickly is because our nervous systems main job is to keep us safe but at a deeper level it is because negative experiences cue us to the fact that whatever's happening that is really bad is very different than than than the other things that ten to happen before most of our experience does not remap us but those negative experienceus deploy high levels of nor up an efferent high levels of aseedo calling and really make that whatever it is that we experience in that bad a episode is essentially cued up and sot we are on the look out for it and this has a number of negative effects but a enterms of psychological n emotional facts but it is really a a process design to keep us safe the other ways in which we can learn more quickly besides just making errors is when something really surprises us and if we are positively surprised by something or we are just flooded with this molecule dopamine then there is a great opportunity for plasticity a dopamine is a molecule that is almost always associate with pleasure and with the accomplishment of a particular goal but it is really also a molecule of motivation it is a molecule that is released inside of us when we think were on the right path and it does have a capacity to increase noral plasticity motivation et cetera it is released in response to a number of natural behaviors just that help a with the progression of ours han other species a things food sect a in some sense social connection although that is more caratonan and caratonan does not have the same affects on plasticity quite the same and will talk about a few later but a dopamine is when we think we are on the right path toward an external goal a little bit is released and it tends to give us more motivation toward that goal i think every one could stand to enhance the rate of learning by doing the following learn to attach dopamine in a subjective way to this process of making errors because that is really combining two modes of plastis ity in ways that together can eccelerate the plasticity earlier i talked about making errors and having a focus bout of learning that includes making a lot of errors inside of that learning bout that is going to be frustrating but the frustration itself is the cue and epinepron will be very high under those conditions but if you can just subjectively associate that experience with something good and that you want a continue down that path as opposed to quitting when you hit the point of frustration well then you now start to create a senergy between the dopamine that is released when we subjectively think something is good or tel ourselves something is good and that situation of making failures in other words making failures repet it failing repetitively provided we are engage in a very specific set of behaviors when we do it as well as telling ourselves that those failures are good for learning and good for us creates an outsized effect on the rate of plasticity it accelerates plasticity some you might be asking and i get asked a lot well how do i get dopamine to be released can i just tell myself that something is good when it is bad well actually yes believe it ore not yet the thing about doamine is it is highly subjective what is funny to one person is not soly funny to the next has to have some am sense of authenticity for you but if you really want to be learning the thing that you are trying to learn that should be reason enough to to tell yourself while i'm frustrated and but this the frustration is the source of of accelerated learning dopamine is one of these incredible molecules that both can be released according to things that are hard wired in us to release dopamine again things food seck warmthom or cold a cool environments when were too warm it is that kind of pleasure molecule over all but it is also highly subjective what release is dopamine in one person verses the next every one release s dopamine in response to those very basic kind of behaviors and inactivities but dopamine is also released according to what we subjectively believe is good for us and that is what powerful about it in fact a book that i highly recommend if you won ta read more about dopamine the book that frankly i wish i had written at such a wonderful book it is called the molecule of more and it really talks about dopame not just as of molcule associate with reward but a molecule associate with motivation and pursuit and just how subjectively controlld dopamine can be make lots of errors tell yourself that those errors are important and good for your over all learning goals learn to attach dopamine meaning released dopamne in your brain when you start to make errors keep the bouts of learning relatively short if youre and adult younger people can can probably engage in more bouts of learning and it is probably one of the reasons why they learn much faster they can just pack much more information into the brains and nervous systems compared to adults you it is a little bit a i'll use the example of a performance enhancing drugs you kow that some of those drugs probably do enhance performance at the level of increasing red bloodsail count et cetera but a lot of what those drugs do as they allow athletes to recover fasters they can just train more they allow them to do more work and being a child as a littlebit being in a performance enhance brain mill u their brains are kind of on natural healthy norro chemicals that that afford them a lot more learning should they pursue it this goes back to my advice for young people early on if you are young what should you do learn as much as you can about as manythings as you possibly can end i suggest specializing in something i guess a i'm i'm not in a position to give any one directedvice but i would say am hopefully by about age thirty hopeful younger you have some sense of what excites you and un trying get really good at that thing provided it serves the world for better a but that is all i'll say in terms of parenting advice it is not my place but i maybyou sometime i'll have a and episode completely devoted to am a sort of youth and learning in youth but once you are attaching dofpe amean to this process of making errors then i stare getting lots of questions i really are thatthe right questions which are how often should i do this and when should i be doing this and at what time will ove talk to little bit about this and previous episodes but as long as we arein a now con into the nidegrety of tools and application each of us have some natural times throughout the day when we are going to be much better at tolerating these errors and much more focussed on what it is that were trying to do last episode was about focus but chances are that you cannot focus is well at four p m as you can at ten a m it differs for everybody dependy one when your sleeping and your conatural chemistry and rhythms but find the time or times of day when you naturally have the highest mental acuity and that is really when you want engage in these learning bouts and then get to the point whre youare making errors and then keep making errors for seven to thirty minutes just keep making those errors and drill through it and you are almost seeking frustration and if you can find some pleasure in the frustration yes that is a state that exist you have created the optimal norr chemical millu for learning that thing but then hear's the beauty of it you also created the optible mlu for learning other things afterward if you leave that bout of i give the example free throws or maybe it is plantennis or maybe it some other skill and you sit down to read a book your brain is in a heightened state to learn and retain the information because those chemicals do not get released and then shut down your creating a whole milu and environment of these chemicals and the tale of how long these chemicals stay a you slashing around your brain has too many factors for me to put a hard number on it scin to depend on transporters and enzimes and all sorts of things but at least for an hour or i would say you are going to be in a state of heightened learning and the ability to learn not just the motor patterns but cognive information language information maybe you go to terape right after that and you work on something in a very deliberate way that you are tring to to work on maybe you do not go to therapy maybe you do something else om that is important to you again there is just a variety of examples i could give there are a number of things that allow us to powerfully acess the states of error that our kind of surprising but also kind of fun and these are not again these are not ghemics these tap into these basic mechanisms of plasticity and the three that i'd to talk about next or balance meaning the vestibular system as well as the too sides of what i call limbic friction or autonomic arousal and if none of that make sense i am going to put a a fine point on each one of those and what it is an wyat works for opening up neural plasticity let us talk about limbic friction now lymbic friction is not a term you are going to find in the text books if any mycholegues are listening i want to repeat limbic friction i realize is not something you are going to find in any of the text books but it ison important principle that captures a lot of information that is in text books both neurbiology and psychology and it has some really important implications limbic friction is my attempt to give a name to something that is more nuancsd tan mechanistic than stress because tybically when we hear about stress we think of heartrate hearbeat going too fast breathing too fast sweating and not being in a state that we want were to alert we wanto be more calm and indeed that is one condition in which we have lymbic friction meaning our lymbic system is taking control of a number of different aspects of our autonomic or autonoautomatic biology and we are struggling to control that through what we call top down mechanisms were trin a calm down in order to reduce that level of arousal we are all familiar with this called the strestress books however there is another aspect of stress that is just as important which is when we are tired and we are fatigued and we need to engage we need to be more alert than we are and what i call liymbic friction is really design to describe the fact that when our autonomic nervous system is not where we want it meaning were trying to be more alert or were trying to be less alert both of those feel stressful to people the other way to put is that the word stress is not a very good word to describe what most people experience istressful because it can either be being too tired ore being too alert now why am i bringing this up in the discussion about neural plasticity this is not discussion about stress at some point we will talk about stress and tools to deal with stress but the reason on bringing this up is that in order to aca neral plasticity you need these components of focus you need the coponet of of sel of attaching subjective reward you need to make errors all the stuff and a lot of people find it difficult to just get into the over all state to access those things now there is a series of gates that people are having a hard time accessing they are too tired and they cannot focus for instance well here is the the beauty of it if you are too alert meaning you are too anxious and you want a calm down in order to learn better there are things that you can do the too that i've spoken about previously on various podcast ill just review them really quickly are the double inhale exale inhaling twicethrough the nose and exhaling once through the mouth this is not some yoget trick or some a hack this is what is calle a physiological sie osfloats carbondoxide from the lungs it has a number of different effecties were described in textbooks in at sdgitting back to the the thirties and a a number of laboratories of explored the nerle circuitry under lying these caled physiological size that will calm you down faster totan anything else that i'm aware of the other thing is starting to remove your tunnel vision when you use tunnel vision you very focus that apan effrnt is release by dilating your your field of gaze call panoramic vision great now you can start to move up and down this level of autonomic carousal the key is you want to be in a state of arousal that is ideally match to the thing that you are trying to perform or learn fime really anxious and i cannot an pick up the basket ball whet i feel i'm shaking or my muscles are too tight i do not have that kind a looseness now the when i move that almost makes it look i could throw throw free throw but i miss nine you five per sent of time a unless the basket is very very low and i place it in direct ly but i gess its not a free throw is it in any case the point being that you you want to be in a state of alertness but calm and you need to have ways to calm yourself down when you are when you are too amped up but the other side olimic friction is important too if you are too tired and you cannot focus well then it is going to be impossible to even get to the starting lines to speak for engaging in nerl plasticity through in cromental learning et cetera in that case there are other methods that you can do to wake yourself up the best thing you shou do is get a good night sleep but that is not always possible or use a and es to are non sleep deep rest protocall but if you have already done those things or you are simply exhausted for whatever other reason then there are other things that i often get asked about sure a cup of coffee or superoxygenation breathing which means inhaling more than exhaling on average in it in a breathing bout these are now were sort of getting toward the realm of how you could trick your nervous system into waking up and if you bring more oxygen in by makin yor inhales deeper and longer you will become more alert you wil start to actually deploy nor apaneffrnt if you breathe very fast there are things that you can do to move up or down this called autonomic arousal ark and what you want to ask before you undergo any learning bout is how much limbic friction in my experiencing in my two alert and i want to be calmer or my too calm and too sleepy and a one to be more alert you are going to need to engagin behaviours that bring you to the starting line in order to learn there are other things that you can do in order to then learn better and faster besides increment al learning and those center on the vestibular system and this may come as of surprise to some people but probably not as a surprise to some of you whose professions or whose recreation involves a lot of motor activity and what we call high dimensional skill activity not just running or psychillying or very lineor activities weight lifting but things that involve inversions in a lot of lateral movement actual sports om jumping diving rolling these kinds of things gymnastic stype stuff why the vestibular system to access neral plasticity well we have a hard wired system for balance and here is hout works in as simple terms as i can possibly come up with as we move through space or even if we are stationary there really threemain plains of movement i realize some pulare just listening to this somen to do this for both the folks that are just listening and for those of either watching on vidio there is three main modes of movement and it turns out that your brain does not really know where your body is except when through that propriaceptive feed back the mainway it knows is through three plains of movement that we call pitch which is nodding fi nod this that is pitch then there is yaw which is side to side which is shaking my head kno and then there is roll from side to side one a puppy looks that you that kind of thing oke pitch yaw and roll and the pilots out there will know exactly what i'm talking about the brain knows the orientation ond position of your body relative to gravity depending on whether not your brain is and your head actually is engaging more in pitch yaw or roll or some commination because if i lean down or it is a commination of pitch yawn roll ell you my say what is going on here well we have these little things in our in our inner ear call the semicircular canals just our eyes have two main functions one is to see objects in space and the other is to set our circadian clocks through subconscious mechanisms our ears have two main rolls one is to hear right to perceive sound waves or takin sound waves for perception called hearing and the other is balance or vistipular function sitting in our ears are these semicircular canals and there these little tubes where these little little stones there actaly little bits of calsy roll back and forth little marbles when we roll this way they roll this way when pitch whe we go from side to side their some that sit flat this and they go sh shh mar vls inside of a holu and then we have roll there some that our kind of at forty five degrees to those and its of piciaan roll toke great that send signals to the rest of our brain en body that tell us how to compensate for shifts relative to gravity i say ocuwe thaugh weyur time out plasticity but this is where it gets really really cool errors in vestibular motor censory experience meaning when we are off balance and we have to compensate by looking at thinking about or responding to the world differently cause an arry of our brain called the cerabellum it actualy means mini brain it lookslike a many brains tuckbenlower are quartecs in the back cause the cerabellum to signal some of these deeper brain centers that release dopami norup an efferen and a seet of colling and that is because these circuits in the inner ear et cetera and the sarbellum they were design to recalibrate are motor movements when our relationship to gravity changes something fundamental to survival we cannot afford to be falling down all the time or missing things that we grab for or om running in the wrong direction when something is pursuing us these are hard wired circuites that tap right into these chemical pathways and those chemical pathways are the gates to plasticity i really want to spell this out clearly cause i've given a lot of information to day the first thing is how are you are writhing to the learning bout you need to make sure your level of autonomic rousal is correct the ideal state is going to be clear common focust may be alopit more on the on the erousal level heightened arousal understand limic friction understand that you can be too tired in which case you are gin to need to get yourself a more alert or you can be to alert and you gon need to get yourself calmer that gets you to the starting line when you are at the starting line than you'are to go into a learning bout and that is when you want to start making these errors ok but what i'm saying is there is a layer in between where if you are interested in using motor patterns is a way to open up plastisity for all kinds of learning not just motor learning desrupting your visvestibular motor relationship meaning and i'll tel you how to do that in a moment can deploy or release nor chemicals in the brain that place you into a state that makes you much better at learning and makes making errors much more pleasureful you are much more willing to do that now some of you are probly saing flow state flow state oke i have friends at work on flow states and who are volved in flow states an try to figure out what they are and have great respect for those people won o utip my hat to them te very important work but again flow is an expression of what you already know how to do it is what it is not how you learn rn it is how you express what you have already learned s i want o be really clear about that it is been con o presented as this super state are highly desirable state but it is that we can all reach for that is the wrong wrong to reach for until you already know how to do the things that i'm describing in my opinion the vestibular system if you can engage the vestibular system and create some errors within the vestibular motor operations that your currying ount you create a noro chemical state that then makes you very very good at learning very quickly regardless of age what woitd this look does this mean just doing inversions well does this mean doing yoga maybe does this mean am taking a corners faster on your roadbike does this mean am let say you always swim freestyle or breststroke os this mean swimming a a backstroke or butterfly it depends it depends however on a very very easy to understand parameter which is how regularly you perform a particular motor behavior and how novel a behavior is the more novel that a behavior is in terms of your relationship to gravity the more it will open up the opportunity for plasticity have you ever seen somebody who just jumped out of plame for first time with the with a parishut i do not only want a thing about what if you have you have seen somebody yo jumped out of plaine for the first on without a parishut i'e just of the plan was on the ground but if you have seen somebody after that they are in this incredible state because they are body and brain are flooded with all these narrow chemicals because it is very novel to them however now ihave got friends from communities that do you no have done thousands upon thousan tens of thousands of jumps and theyare always alert and aware but it becomes pretty regular for them that is the point and they are not in this kind of buzdou excited state afterwards because it is routine for them the key is to bring novelty to the vestibular motor experience the vestibular motor commands that you are that you are performing and how do you do that well it is all about your orientation relative to gravity now i would not want any one to place themselves at risk if you cannot do hand stands do not try and do them freestanding and whatever if you are good at hand stands guess how much plasticity doing a handstands for half an hour is going to create for you zero zero your body is fully comfortable walking on your hands i see these people walking on your hands being upside down being inverted you n your circ disallay performers their very comfortable there and there is zero learning zero plasticty because the failures and errors and the relationship to gravity are very typical for that individual now what this means is that if we are going to use motor practices to open up plasticity for learning not just those practices but t some maybe some cognive skills or other things in the period that follows we need to create a sense of novelty relative to gravity and that means being either in a new positi o on or slightly unstigable believe it are not this sene i do not want any one injuring themselves with ta sensation of falling or close to falling signals the sarabellum to signal the deep brain centers that release these noro chemicals that something is very differen an we need to correct this are very very fast now earlier i was talking about high contingences for learning and you defly do not want to make it a kind of either survive this or or die kind of experience i've am i confess i occasionally look at these parcorvidios on youtube and autbelieve are not alaw those people have died am the ones that do these ridiculous things of hanging off of buildings things i am not suggesting you do that please do not do that what i'm talking about is finding safe ways to explore the sensory motor f a stibular space as we call it the relationship between those things that could be through yoga if your terrible at yoga there is more opportunity for you to learn than somebody who is very skilled at yoga for instance or gymnastics or handstands or on your road bike this is unfortunately what i do not want name brands but stationary bikes where they give you the visual experience of moving through space but you are not actually moving through physical space there is no vestibular feed back it is all visual right you are stationary on the bike right unles you are hanging off the bike in your living room almost to the point you are tipping the bike you are not getting the actual vistibular a motor sensory mismatch that mismatch is the signal that deploys dopomen ap an aferent in these other things i do not care how excited or how much fun the ride was or how much music you'r playing that you love it is not the same situation as being out of a out of your normal relationship to the gravitational poll the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal clear and focus is best but do not obsess over being right there t soke you little anxious or lo bit tired then you want to make errors we talked about that and this vestibular motor censory relationship is absolutely key if you want to get heightened or accelerated plasticity and we talked about another feature which is setting at an a contingency if there is a reason an important reason for you to actually learn even if you are making failures the learning will be accelerated there is really for things that you really need to do for plasticity as an adult and i would say that these also apply to young people and there 's an interesting kind of fought experiment there as well which is if you look at children they are moving a lot in different dimensions the an they are hanging sometimes hanging from trees or oui was a kind of a uti was my sports were always things where i tended to get hurlot fall lots ors of escape boarding for me when i was young ers a lot of falling and rolling and am verious things of that sort but whatever sport that kids are playing or even if they do not play a sport they tend to moving a lot of different relationships to gravity more dimensionality to their movements i should say than adults and one of the questions that is always conhave been in the back of my mind is now as we age we get less good at engaging in neral plasticity part of that is because as the brainages theire certain changes to the the way that nurons or structurer the molecular components et cetera but it is kind of a of a self amplifying or i should say a a self om of self a degenerating sel degenerating cycle where as we get older we tend to get more lineer and more regular about specific kinds of movements we get on the tread millor we take the walk or we just always go up the same stairs et cetera and there is less opportunity typically for engaging these relationships to the to the gravitational pole through the vestipular motor sensory convergence that we doed about a moment ago and you sort of half to wonder wheather or not the lack of plasticity or the reduced plasticity in older individuals which includes me would reflect the fact that those chemicals are not being deployed because we are not engaging in certain behaviors as opposed to we cannot engage in the behaviors becaue the chemicals are not being deployed now i've a feeling its both these have a reciprical relationship and i certainly again i i i do not think om it would be wise for any one who does not have the muscle stablizing skills or the om or the bondensity et cetera to start unid doing inversions and things that sort that is not what i'm talking about here but it is interesting to think about the sorts ofexercise that we engage ind we all know that getting the heart raghe elevated three to five times a week is really good for us for cartivascular health i think there is ton of data support that now some load bearing exercises important for increasing bondensity and maintaining muscular strength and propraceptive feed back because at amsuremany of this but o resistance exercise actually trains the nerve tomuscle connections as much as it does the muscles themselves something i talked about the beginning of the episode but i think most of us could stand to increase the degree to which we engage this vestibular system in novel ways and that can be done quite safely through a number of different mechanisms m i'm not a surfer but people who do that sort of thing are very familiar with orient in their body differently according to the gravitational pole eitheir lying down than their standing up than their their turning their leaning their heads gein its this picia rol thing and again if you are very skill that surfing you'r actually nok in open up plasticity just by surfing it is in the learning of these new relationships to gravity that the windows for plasticity are enhanced i want am make sure that i i underscore the fact that this vestibular thing that i've been describing is a way to really excensuate plasticity it is tapping into a inborn biological mechanism where the cerabellum has outputs to these deep bring newcleeas sociated with dopomine a seeto colling an ar upan effern you do not want endanger yourself in the course of pursuing these activities but it is a powerful mechanism that is an kind of an amplifier on plasticity as is high contingency if you really need to learn conversational french to save your relationship th a chances are you ging to learn it there are limits of course to the extent to which one can accentuate or eccelerate plasticity yothe the sealing on this is not infinite although we do not know how high it goes i think it is reasonable say that if one put a gun to my head and said learn conversational french in the next hundred twenty seconds that conversational french will be limited provlegages one word ely the word weat or something that because i cannot stuff in all the knowledge all at once ima i think that is the dream of brain machine inter face that one will be able to download a chip in to their hyppocampus are cartex or some other brainstructure that would allow them to download conversational french and some day a we may get to that aas a that capability may come about right now it does not exist nor is there are a specific pill or chemical that will low you to download more information more quickly this is the a the issue round neutropics i've talked about before there are things that can increase focus mainly things that increase asut of calling and ar transmission through the nicotine system things that can increase dopamine things altyrosine again i'm not recommending these you need to heed the warnings on those bottles but they will increase these nor chemicals and there are course things tit 'll increase happen efferin things kafine or on some people because a prescription take ataral a i'm again not suggesting people take any these things in fact to day i focus almost exclusively on behavioral tools and ways of structuring learning bouts that will llow you to access more plasticity regardless of age and they center around things that i'm sure if you look around you you will see evidence for oh incremental learning is powerful or oh the vestibular system can open up opportunities for plastisiumpsure that the yogies out there all saying wait the sounds exactly yoga wor spless to push to an edge and do these inversions and do all the sorts of things well i want to be clear i never said any one should do inversions i said that the vestibular system is a valuable portal into some of hese narro chemical states that favored plasticity but not seldom i hear from the yogic community and they will say things much of what your saying about how the brain works or nerro plasticity has already been describers imbedded in yogit practices and i just want to be very clear i have tremendous respect for a the yoget community and the practices of donyoga from time to time i find it challenging and valuable i'm not a regular practitioner but the problem with yoga is exactly the same problem with science which is that yoga has a lot of practices for which there are very specific names but no description or lending of understanding about mechanism and science has a lot of mechanisms and a lot of publications and papers for which there is very little if not no description of tools and practices my goal i in not just to day but in many ways throughout the course of the podcast is to bridge the gaps between these various disciplines in ways that are grounded mainly to the fields of nauroh scients and some related fields yes it is true that i look at things mainly through the lends of science but that is not to say that it exhaustively explains everything about anything nor is it to say that it is the only lends through which one could look at something neural plasticity just want acknowledge that i i have great respect for all these different practices and communities and i think that indeed there are many cases in which different communities and practices have been aimed it targaing the same goals or outcomes science and neuroh science throu an understanding of mechanism can allow all of ust to gain a kind of common understanding about what those practices are and how to acess things neural plasticity sleep et cetera and i do believe as i've said previously on this podcast that understanding mechanism affords us a certain flecibility and i do not mean physical flexibility i mean a flexibility when we cannot engage in a particular behaviour may we were injured or may we were not in the right situation to do our particular practice but by thinking about mechanism we can adapt our circumstances i talked about this with sleep if youre rigidly attached to one protocal of always looking at sunlight at one particular time in te morning and in the evening that is not as valuable as understanding the mechanisms why you might look at sunlight at one particular time verses another because that affords you afflecsibility allows you to adapt and life is very dynamic and we do not have control over all the external conditions all the time and understanding mechanism through the lens of naurow science i do believe can be very powerful because of course there multipaways to acess dopeamene they are multipi ways to a just limbic friction ats nottis through respiration of course there are many ways to do that and my overall goal here in this episode and with this podcast is to give you some understanding the mechanisms and the insights into the underlying biology that allow you to tailor what these can ofe foundational mechanisms or to suit your particular learning needs i really thank you for your time and attention to day covered a lot of material i very much encourage questions in the comment section if your looking at this on you toobe and if you are nodding or listening to it on apple or spodify please om feel free to visit us over on the outu channel and put your questions in the comment section i do read them this entire month is all about naurol plasticity there is a lot to cover but i'm very excited to delve deeper into this topic as it relates to your particular interests many of you have graciously asked how you can help support the podcast the best way you can do that is to subscribe to the utub channel if you have not done that already as well as to place questions in the comment section below or comments if you to give us feed back also to subscribe on apple and or spodify an apple allows you to leave a five star review if you believe we deservafive star review as well as leave comments about the podcast in addition if you can suggest the podcast to your friends your family members or any one that you think might be able to use an appreciate the information that is a terrific way to support us and of course check out our sponsors that we mention at the beginning that is a terrific way to support us as well and as mentioned the beginning of to day's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are of the absolute highest quality end aship international if you go to live momentous tock calm slash hubermen you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the hubruman lad podcast and you will find various protocals related to those supplements in the next episode of this podcast were going to continue to explore neurle plasticity this as you may recall is the way that we go about things here at the huberman lad podcast which is to really drill deeply into a topic for three or four or even fyve episode that by the end of those episodes all of you have a very firm understanding of how to apply the principles of neurbiology to the specific practice is and endeavors that are most important to you s i very much thank you for your time and attention i know it is a lot of information and it takes a bit of a focus an attention and certainly will trigger plasticity to learn all this information ant encourage you and just remind you that you do not have to grasp it all at once that it is here are cived and that if you want a return to the information it will still be here and that i most of all really appreciate your interest in science and youst

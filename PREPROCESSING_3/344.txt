welcome to the huberman ladpodcas discuss science science pace to lii mander huberman and om ou professor of naurbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day is an askme anything episode or a m a this is part of our premium subscriber channel our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for this standard huberman labpodcast which comes out every monday and is available at zero cost to everybody on all standard feets you to apple spodify and elsewhere we also stared the premium channel as a way degenerate support for exciting research being done at stamford and elsewhere wresearch on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health physical health and performance i am also please to inform you that for every dollar the huberman la premium channel generates for research studies the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health physical health and human performance if you to subscribe to the huberman lapodcast premium channel please go to huberman labdoc com slash premium it is ten dollars a month to subscribe or you can pay one hundred dollars all at once to get an entire twelvemonth subscription for a year we also have a lifetime subscription model that is at one time payment and again you can find that

feed and for those of you that are not huberman labpodcast premium subscribers you can still here the first twenty minutes of to day is episode and determine whether not becoming a premium subscriber is for you without further ado let us get to answering your questions the first question is about nature in particular about the scientifically supported benefits of getting out doors into nature the person asks about the role of sunlight the role of calming sounds the role of observing wild life of observing green colors and quote other stuff and in fact i'm glad dat they asked about other stuff because i get the question about the scientifically supported benefits of nature a lot i often also get the question about grounding for those of you that are not familiar with what grounding is grounding is a practice of putting your feet on the earth directly with bare feet oftentimes into soil or on a lawn and it is a question that i seem to get more and more in fact every week for quite a long while now on social media or elsewhere somebody asks me about the scientific support for this practice of grounding obviously there is a lot of interest in what the scientific research says about getting into nature and putting one's feet on the ground a ga grounding and on ok if i'm going to answer this question i first have to be very direct with you there is excellent meaning dozens if not hundreds of quality pureviewed studies which support the value of getting sunlight in one's eyes in particular early in the day to set their circatin rhythm this is something tht've talked about extensively on thehubermn labpodcast and as a guest on other podcasts it is one of the first and frankly most important items on the tool kit for sleep which is a zero cost tool kit that you can access by going to huberman labdot com going to the men you are going to news letter can see it as a pedy after you do not have to sign out for the news letter you can access that tooll ket for sleep and you will notice that very close to the top of that list if not top of that list is to get sunlight in your eyes early in the day you do not have to see the sun cross the horizon you can that is great but if you wake up after the sun has already risen go outside face the sun blink as necessary to protect your eyes but get some sunlight into your eyes every single day or as often as you possibly can especially on overcastas k that is an absolutely unequivocally science supported tool that will increase daytime mood focus and alertness and will improve your nighttime sleep viewing morning sun light also has profoundly pausive effects on metabolism now those effects on metabolism could be the direct effect of viewing sunlight or more likely they are the indirect consequence of getting better sleep at night getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and ideally in the evening or late afternoon before the sunsets is a very well supported protocall that we know is beneficial for numerous aspects of mental health physical health and performance and of course sunlight and getting sunlight in one's eyes does require that you get outside you simply will not dereve the same benefits from viewing sunlight if you trying to git through a window or windshield or if you look at a picture of a sun on a screen forget it you are not going to set your circatian rhythm you are not going to derive all the pausive effects of sunlight by trying to get it from screens or from looking at pictures of suns or something of that sort now if you are sunbody that for whatever reason seasonality where you live on the planet work schadual et cetera who cannot get sunlight in your eyes early in the day on a consistent basis well then you might consider purchasing a called sad lamp which is for seasonable effect ife disorder which is very bright light you can look at in the morning for usually about five to ten minutes people will put it on there counter while they make their morning coffee eat their breakfasts and that has also been shown to improve moded focus an alertness and set one crcatian rhythm but it is not nearly as effective as getting sunlight in your eyes now why m i talking about this practice that have already talked about extensively on numerous podcasts before well because the question is about nature and sunlight as a key feature of our natural environment but the person is also asking about other features of nature seen green colors or blue colors are running streams for that matter well here too we can ask what does the scientific data really say about things going near a waterfall or a running stream or being near an ocean asshly this is quit interesting there is actually a pureviewed literature on negative ionization as it is called which is a pattern of ironization that is present close to bod ies of water and particular types of bodies of water such as water falls running streams et cetera there is acually e laboratory at columbia university school of medicine that has publish fairly extensively on the health benefits of negative ionization as it relates to setting circadian rhythm and some other aspects of mental and physical health i intend to host the head of that laboratory on the hubr ladpodcast in the not to distant future for now we can safely say this there does seem to be some positive health benefits to placing ones self near bodies of water in particular moving bodies of water and of course as is always the case when there is a discovery about how the natural world can impact health there have been some technologies developed to create negative patterns of ionization within a home environment but as with viewing sonlight exposure and comparing it to say sad lamps the negative ionization machines that one can purchase and put in their home environment have been shown in a few studies to produce some positive health benefits but those posive effects in no way reach the level aposive effects that have been demonstrated in studies where people are actually spending a dedicated period of time outdoors near a moving body of water in thinking about nature natural environments there strong evidence forgetting sunlight in one's eyes there is some evidence for being near moving bodies of water perhaps again a really want a highlight perhaps because of negative ionizatione creative by those moving bodies of water there is far less evidence for sunlight simulators or negative ionization machines used in doors and then the asker of this question also quite correctly asked about things comming sounds watching wild green colors et cetera and herein lies a really important point for everyone to digest while of course answering a question about the natural world or about health requires that we first pose a hypothesis for those ve that art familiar whit a hypothesisis a hypothesis is a stated prediction it is not a question a qu estion would be something is getting out into nature good for our health a scientific hypothesis is where one actually takes a stance for instance you could take the stance and make the hypothesis that getting out into nature for thirty minutes per day three days per week improves mood and nighttime sleep ae that is a hypothesis that then one would go on to design an experiment to test and then evaluate the data from that experiment and compare it to the hypothesis either validating or negating that hypothesis that is essentially how science is done there is a lot more to it but that is essentially the scientific method and while of course the scientific method is a fabulously powerful tool for some questions it is a less potent tool and the question of is getting out into nature helpful for enhancing our mental and physical health is the sort of question that while ideally you could design a really well controlled study to a dress it is actually quite difficult to design such a study and here is why in order to perform a study that is very well controlled meaning where you can isolate individual variables sunlight the sorts of color contrast that one sees in a natural seen outdoors in a forest or nearer river in order to address whether not the calming sounds or the presence of squirrels running through your environment or the relevant factors it becomes incredibly difficult to try an isolate individual variables meaning as soon as you bring people into the laboratory yes you have more control over which variables as they are called you present them right by bringing them into a room that essentially has no art on the walls and then having them look at a picture of a sun or looking at sunlight or listening to soothing sounds or looking at a picture of a forest of course you are controlling the individual variables however there is a sort of gistalt meaning a collective picture of being in nature that brings together lots of different elements right the element of surprise for instance the other day i was out for a sunday height and that morning i saw squirrel running across my p ath and it was interesting because the squirel had a pine cone in its mouth it had been chewed down to the cob and the squirrel s probably only about seven or eight inches long and the pine cone was probably about nine or ten inches long the cob of the of the pine cone that is and the interesting thing is that the squirrel was carrying it long ways from the tip of the of the cob and i delighted in the fact that this little squirrel was working hard to carry this object through the woods and this object was literally longer than its own body length and it looks dedicated in its running across the the path in order to do whatever it would with that on pine cone cob something that of obviously stuck in my memory it delighted me and at the very same time there are number of other things happening besides the presence of that novel wild life experience here was the sound of a stream there is the sunlight there is the color contrasts everywhere i'm breathing fresh air because i was far away from any cars or any civilization in fact and here is what we know there are dozens if not hundreds of studies that show that if people get out of doors into nature is could be parks this could be near a stream this could be an ocean any number of different natural environments and if they do that for anywhere from ten to thirty minutes three to seven days per week indeed there are demonstrated significant reductions and things blood pressure resting heart rate improvements an sleep improvements an mood and i think we can very reliably say that yes or perhaps even absolutely yes getting outside into nature kin enhance various aspects of mental health physical health and thereby performance in different aspects of life however when talking about the benefits of getting into nature we are talking about hundreds if not thousands of variables some of which we are aware of such as the presence of wild life or sone light or color contrast and ten of course there are going to be dozens if not hundreds made even thousands of other variables that were not even aware of perhaps its negative ionization most people aren' measuring the ioniza tion of the air when they go out into nature but perhaps it is also the presence of certain smells from the soils that are being broken down and then theire changing the oxygenation state of the air round you the plants et cetera again many variables that frankly to try in isolate any one of those variables in the laboratory seems not just artificial but i think that it actually would just lead to a diminish sense of just how valuable nature is while of course the hubermlad podcast is a podcast where we always center on scients and science tolated tools meaning protocols that are grounded in quality pure revewed studies that have been subjected to control conditions where some people are getting say the drug treatment toore taking the supplement or doing a particular behavioral practice and other people are not or doing some variant of those and dose responsecorves all of that stuff when it comes to the question of whether not its valuable to get out into nature think it is a very straightforward yes absolutely as get out into nature as often as you can and safely can of course i realize some of this is whether permitting people live in different area some people in cities some people in desert some people are near the ocean but getting out into nature has been shown over and over again to have numerous positive health effects and yet unless we are talking about sunlight exposure and isolating the variable of setting one circating rhythm by viewing sunlight early in the day all of the other features of getting out into nature things forest bathing this is a term coin from some frankly pretty nice studies that were done in japan which people place themselves into forests environments for a certain period of time there were control groups where people were not placed into those environments in thepeople that did this called forest bathing experience inhenced mental and physical health that brought on a practice of people who could not get out of doors into forests bringing plants into their home environment which i think all of us would agree of look nice am they often will add pleasant odors to the air and perhaps t ey do actually shift our mental and physical health and significant ways isuppose it depends on how much you plans how much you pay attention to them an of course how many plants there are but and i think this is a really important but to emphasize while most all questions about tools and protocols for enhancing health immediately lead me to say ah this study or that study or yes there is evidence or no there is not evidence when it comes to questions about nature and grounding in particular i take the stance that this is a unique instance where we know therere just many benefits of getting out into nature that trying to isolate any one of those variables in a quality rigorous way within the laboratory almost seems too artificial to really justify the conclusions that arrive now i'm sure there is some of you out there who are aware and if you are not i'll tell you there are studies that have explored this practice of called grounding they have had people come into the laboratory and place their feet on soil that is contained within a box or there are other studies where they actually have people go out of doors and place their feet on to the grass or the ground and there are bunch of theories as to how grounding could improve one's mental and physical health that are not just about getting outsides of the theories go that this has to do with the exchange of electrons with the earth and the earth surface in particular there is been the argument made that shoes and particular shoes that have rubber sols may block some of this electronixchange with the surface of the earth hev been theories about the tactile that is the touch sensation with the earth being important not a lot of science published in let us just say o blue ribbon journals which is not to diminish some of the journals that these have been published in but just to say that again there are many variables associate with a practice such as grounding that will simply say yes please do get out of doors into nature i try every sunday to do my zone to cardio by rucking or jogging or hiking often with other people if i'm trying to be social with family or others but the point is getting out of doors s has myriad positive effects on mental health and physical health and of course when you are moving out of doors you arealso getting that zone two cardiora other forms of physical benefit by elevating your heart raid or perhaps you culd even do your resistance training out of doors on other days now i also tried to get out of doors other days of the week but oftentimes i'm by way of weather or by way of other commitments force to be indoors on plans here at the podcast studio were certainly i'm indoors but i've tried and get out of doors at least a few minutes each day for a morning stroll looking at sunlight etcetera the long and short of this is yes there some evidence for grounding is it superstrong evidence no it is not we do not really know what it is about placing one's feet on to the earth that is producing the positive effects that were observed in those studies and thee studies made some reasonable attempt to isolate the variables and figure out whether not it was iy on exchange with the earth or the tactile meaning the touch sensation of having one's feet on the ground frankly i do not think there is enough quality science to really draw any firm conclusions about that however if you the idea of grounding by all means do it in fact if it feels good to you i recommend getting your morning sunlight out of doors with your bare feet on the ground or if you are me you areyou put on your shoes and you take a walk most days although i've tried this practice of grounding and feels pretty good meaning a it feels nice to have my feet on the earth provided o on a clean soil or or clean lawn i'm deffling do not do this at the dog park am hookworm is a real thing by the way folks a pay attention of the sorts of surfaces that you are putting your feet on to but the question about whether not nature is valuable for a mental and physical health is an easy one it is an absolute yes but isolating the particular variables about nature that are most beneficial well that is a much tougher question itt's one that frankly the scientific method is not and to be honest i do not think ever will be in a position to isolate and really nail down specifically because as soon as you get specific about that question you start to diminish the value of the study itself the long ad short of this is get out into nature as often as you safely can if you can exercise out of doors even better i you wan to to get social great if you do not want to make it social fine 's your life it is up to you but there certainly is value in getting out into nature it is also just beautiful from a visual perspective from an auditory perspective and i myself try and take at least a few trips each year none of thse are particularly expensive trips where i try and get out hiking camping the weekly walks in nature are a youabsolute must for me if i miss one because of weather conditions or travel i make it a point to try and get into nature more during the following week or whenever i can and frankly i do not have a scientific explanation for why nature is oh beneficial except for the sunlight piece and perhaps this grounding piece in the negative ionization piece and frankly i do not worry much about the lack of variable isolating quality pure reviewed studies that support the benefits of getting out into nature i simply getting out into nature and into different natural environments as much as i possibly can because for whatever reason imagine those reasons have something into with sartonan dopaman hormones oxytosts and probably a bunch of different things that are rooted in how our nervous system envolved in natural environments well igus feels really good thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the huberman labpodcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to huberman ladodcom slash premium just to remind you why we launch the huberman labpodcast premium channel 's rualy twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard huberman labpodcast channel which of course we will still be continued to be released every monday in full length we are not going to change the foremat or anything about the standard huberman labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which i think we all ag e is a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocals for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channels huberman lab podcast and other media channels s the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that s kinds of answers in the first place now in especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that theare going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the humbern lapremium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a ms you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocols of huberman laponcast episodes not found elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health and performance you can sign up for the premium channel by going to huberman labdoc cam slash premium again that huberman labdoc cam slash premium and as always thank you for your interest in sine

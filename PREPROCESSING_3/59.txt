the benshvershosponser maxpressy pian i talk about them every single shop why have not you got n of vepanatan expres ve pian right now and express vepiandicams lashed men at the end of the dark night probably the bes moviou the last twenty years commissioner gordon describes why bat man has to go into hiding and wrongly take the blame for harvey dense death he is the hero gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now says commissioner gordon well folks there is the debate america deserves and then there is the amade american needs right now last night fox news held ta made between governor rondisansis florida and governor gavenuesm of california was he stark contrast in visions the santis laid out his record plainly he criticides california's short comings accurately newsum obfiscated his own record and that of his opponent but it was all things sold a relatively normal political debate ana mate which bot sides came with their information and points and then argued over that information ond those points in those policy positions it was in short the debae america deserves it was not in fact that amade american needs right now here was de sans's general izes take on california's failures i was talking to a fella who had made the move from california at to florida ndhe was tell me that floridas much better govern a say for better budgit a lower taxis all this stuff hiy's really hoppy with the quality of life and any pause an hy said no by the way i'm gavin newsom's father in law we do count gavins in laws as some of the people that ave fled california they understand that florida's doing it right and i can tell you the number speak for themselves we have way more ain mogon to thi state than leaving gavin cannot say the opposite more people are leaving california that are moving and ore alemii ay but the reality is they have failed because of his left this ideology and the choice for america as this what bidin and heris and newsom one to do it is take the california model and do that nationally in florida we show thet conservative principles to work this country must choose freedom over failure is what a good concern of gans and it looks and here was gavan newsim on the other side going after onto santis suggesting falsely that he was banding books six books have been band just last yeare under ronto sentis leadership a loglyto kees pullin this ot i've seen this he is been doing this all of the campanter what is wrong with tony morison's books not ban what is wrong it is not true what is wrolling the man o gormans not ban an poetry one thousand four hundral neratives one thous all four hundend six book s hadbin band on your banning bench in the state of floridas nat of course it is not true books have not been band in the sane of florid a the only question is whether there are books they are inappropriate forsan fifth or six quanters that do not belong in junior high libraries to sancis responded bi actually pulling out a sheet of a book called gender queer and showing what it looks in a public school obviously newsome cannot defend that here was do sancis doing just that what is the roll the roll the schools to educatcates not in doctrina kids it is not to imposin a gendites to do the basix and what we have said in florida is it is in appropriate to talo kenter gardener a that their genders a choice it is an appropriate to tell second grater that they may have been born in the wrong body now california has that ah they want to have that injected into the elementary school my wife and i have a seven five and a three year old though we do not think that that is appropriate i know most parents do not think it is appropriate ah it is also import in respect pronal rights to know what corriculum is being used in the class room and everything should be age appropriate i tually have something that i brout that is some parents have objected to this i's a book that is in some of the schools in california florida this is not consist with our standards called gender queer i it is some of it is blocked out you would not probably bill to put this on air this is pornography it is cartunes it is aimed at children ah in it is wrong this should not be in schools ah when people on the left say that somehow you'r banding books by removing this from a young kid's class room now this is not age appropriate and were gan stand for the rights of parents i think we need to do that nation wide i do not think you can have a situation where some stase is trample on the rights of parents parents have a fundamental right to direct the education and up bringing of their can again thereis excellent seff there from ron do santes news him also tried to glacter tis hancs by claiming tha disantis lockown florida also simultaneously claiming by the way that he was fined to loose in his coven policies he is taking the sort of downal trump view of ronistances that he was simultaneously to harshan to

had your policies the equivent of ten not elevens tens of thousands of people lost or lives and for what run in the same line of tack news im in suggesting that tisancis lock down the stane and then he' suggesting that he should not have locked it down but also he should have lockittown the sands is responded by clocking newsim on his own reckord on coven on a percapita age o just the base its californian flora basically the same now why is that important because gaven new som did huge damage to people in california he ruind livelihoods we reopen tha the thusday iry greatlyis we saved thousands of jobs we sayve hundreds of th hundred thousands of jobs thousands of business as we had our kids in school he had the kids locked out of school because of the teachers union that is having a generational impact california 's one of the lowest literacy rates in the country an the most recent napig xam florida came in number three for fourth great reading california was far far behind you should apologize for not getting your kids ind youll why did not you get the kids in school in the summer of twenty twenty we did only bowd in the kid keetor only perscidn't do the job you shon areu the sansis went on to roast gavanusam overgoing to the french laundry on mass while everybody else was lock nawn coun go to resteren i remember because that time i was still living california the martha's vineyard transport martha's vineyard said it was a sanctuary jurisdiction kind of reminds me about gavan nuwsum when he restricted californians than he went to the french laundry these liberal leats they to impose burdens on you they do not want to have to face the consequences of their actions wive got a lot of a leats who want opan borders who leck ore everybody else about it and the minute they have to deal with any of the consequences o man all hell breaks leub ga correction id ardy move from california to florida lak tens of thousands of other people the sant is also added the newsom tom city of san francisco where nusum was mayor and hoe pledge clean up san francisco he pointed out that was coverned a human poop and he brought the receats to show it e lookin a total time governor togaais this is a map of san francisco there is a lot of plots on that you may be asking what is that plotting well this is an ap where they plot the human feces that are found on the streets of san francisco and you see how almost the whole thing is covered because that is what has happened in want of the previost greetest cities this country's ever had human fecees is now a fact of life except when a comunist dictator comes to town then they cleaned up the streets they lined the streets with chinese flags that his absolutely gract san francisco is full of grap and is gavanusam perhaps to sans is finest moments when he caled that nuwsum's vision of liberty noting that by liberty gavenusom generally men taking power away from parents especial in the area of generine sexuality in california if your aparent and iowa or new hampshire south carolina and into your minor child can go to california without your knowledge or without your consent and get hormon therape puberty blockers in a sexchange operation all without you knowing or consenting how in the hec is that thonoring parents rights when you are bringing people from out of state to go around their parents backs an getting life altering surgeries that is radical thand al undra kid that is a all tonterants rights at o gay all of this right here isn the demate america deserves ito mate over serias palice you differenc is and governin styles and abate about california verses florida at debate over the future of the country but it is not the dbate american needs right now the debate american needs right now is a dbate over one simple topic why are agan a get by inversis trump in al likelihood why should america be faced with the prospect of an election in which both candidates our elderly enfading in which both candidates are wildly unpopular with the american electric jobidin's approval rating his curnenltly forty point six per cent in the real clapolitics puling average donal trumps is at forty one point one per cent and in which both candidates can only serve one more turman office why is that the fate of america the answer's action pretty simple for the democrats the party bosses remaining control of the leaver's of power for the republicans the party bossis are not in controls of the leavers o power democrats right now are cramming down jobiden on their own base but they also control the power which means that candidates newsum will not ad mits running even though nusom is pretty obviously running me simultaneously running just in case jobidn should keel over or fall down stairs to hard the santis pointof that out last night poyment rate is two point eight per cent that is o thous on a by niht at by i ovener because it is at commandan control economy they have a political it gande that their pursuing let in ass si listto people on or the question a joi i thing it is important oir that of iwa that otherwa about effects i viin ministration last three years dis it ot mast ol bisn' tan a i ree floin nin per cent i thought there is e sla perso state but not but it is about the united states of america i thought thi ky was running for presint unite states e wy the ge its woni ain for yeri yas i on i it r wil no admitit ter bo a i genl ati youre vielad i we ca o case that is true but on the other hand got the republican party wher nonel trump leeds in the real clapox pulling average by leapsan bounds in every primary trump is as always on nearly every side of every issue this is his stock in trade he is pro life he is responsible for the overturnin of rovers's wat and he is prochoice as'on talk about abortion we should come some sor of generalistion sensus he is probialem he literally championd a beellam in dorsemen two days ago and he is antibealum he is pro isolation is a man he is pro intervention is at he is proentitlements and hi's anti depicis none of that really seems to matter that is why newsom was slamming to sancis during thedebate by suggesting that trumps nomination is a foregone conclusion there are profound differences to night that look port engatiom but there is one thing in closing that we have in common is neither of us will be the nominy for a party in twenty twenty four there he is doing the work of jobid now listen maybe newsum is wrong maybe do sansus pulls off a late ron meb h wins iwa and switches momento maybe nic ke haly pulls it off the out's right now are not in their favor but if the election does send up being trump verses bidon rather than sate the santus verses newsum maybe w ned to go back to original question and ask what is the debate america deserves and what is the debate america needs the debate american needs is a debate over wheather we even have a debate at all in this country any more whether or even capable of doing normal debate in this country any more whether we are polorized that debates om polcys do not actually matter the only thing t h matters is how we manage or divorce sure maybe we do not deserve a serious political debate because were and unserious people in a very serious time maybe we do not deserve a real debate on policy because we have given up on such debates altogether in favor of need jourc sentiments about our fellow americans or maybe just maybe the problem goes even deeper than that maybe the problem is that after decates of raticalism from the american left usurpation of institutional power buy that left in corporate america on the cords in the media it is too late for any compromise to be brooked or any truce to be brokerd maybe it is not about policy maybe both sides just hava mutual eu in mind if that is the case that should be the debate what exactly do we have in common what can bring us together what is a merica really all about what maintains america if to answer that question but four we get to the policy questions until we ask that question the disantis new sum debate we will not be the debate we need and it' certainly will not be the debate we actually deserve in just one second we will get to elon mus because elon did a fascinating interview on wednesday really interesting stop but first

doing evil he was specifically referring to major corporal leaders who spend their days virtue signaling while cracking down on desenting opinions in promoting harmful material there is what he had to say tells the carysells at to that is much in tels e lector riccels that is wet's if metr corri isin and i is commin tells us done more tos helthy barment that all o the companys combined were refar to say that therefore as a leader of the company i done olfr thy vimat than everone up at at any single humen on earth n kill about that that a not ar about that e no i asking you personally how you fel bout thut te cus tis tois wer tim but power and influencing i hadant ot tin what o but whut a ca bout is the the reality of goodness not the poception of it and what i see all of the place is people o care about looking good while doing evil musker was explicitly talking about companies disney who see yobabiger had announced earlier in te month that te male's house would stop advertising on x formerly knowniced twenter iger explained that decision to andrew ro sorkan you stoped advertising the nex we didn' tell us about that decision am ii ave a latter respect for elon in what heis accomplished not just it o one business o to businesses and we know elon is largeted lifein in any respects and that his name he is very much tige to the companies he either his founded or heons whether it is testla if o or x in x ssx or now x n and by him taking the position that e took in quite a public manner and we just felt that the association with that position and and heon mus and was not necessarily positive one for us and we decided we would pull our avertise this is ridiculous of course dis not y is not pulling its advertising on xs because of one of youlon musk stweet at weet he then explained and apologised for they are pulling their advertising because their part of an advertiser cascade at is designed to pressure eulon muskin to doing their bidding now it is one thing for an advertiser to decline to be associated with any outlet or product that happens all the time havd one the show havts on other shows that is their right we live in a free market when companyes make public announcements that they are withdrawing their money that is obviously designe to create public pressure and the pressure in this case is for elon musk and acts to do the bidding of groups media matters he far left censorship group that seeks to destroy political opponents through in some cases outright slander media matters wants musk to censor those whot does not and he're willing to astrotes r secondary boy cocks against t advertisers to achieve that tht's why musk is coloneltly suing media matters tisney and others pulling their money from axs our doubling down on their own catostrophic woke strategies in disn'ey has essentially destroyed its own stock valuy over the past few years by going wok these companies continued to tell the world how proud they are to bee wok they really do not free speech and they especially hate andy company or platform they can break their strangle hold on the media the same media that has never been willing to say go yourself to the likes of disney it is a true clash of the tigtans now well the daily wire does not have disney money yet we see what y lant is doing with axis one of most important things actually happening in the culture to day when it comes to preserving free speech which is why to day we have secured a two hundred fifty thousand dollar spend for it take over on axs to promote our new feetial length commidy lady ballars we may lady ballers because hollywood atded and abetted by big tec censorship we will not make a movy about how ridiculously absurdit is that we now pretend that men can be women and allow grown men to call themselves women and then dominate women sports extrives the conversations in away no other social media outwat does and provide to space to freely mock absurdities we do in lady bullers in ways that other outwets wont in other words ac is the only social media platform that allows and is attempting to even preserve free speech who would not want wo in vestit that whell the answer apparently is disney well our two hndred fifty thousand dollars cut into axes loss of revenue thanks to virtue singling not much but every little bit does help and if we want to keep ex o free speech space tit is in portant everyone continue to subsidize the business as they as he lan to aptly put it if disney and others are successful in their advertising boy cot it will kill free speech if that happens everybody is can know who actually killed it wut gan in just one secon will get to all the up deates from the middle east isral has now resumed its offensives in the gozistrip

there is actually lines in the scripet were an actress says the thing that we all know which thet divorce is extraordinarily damaging to children that is something that hollywout has pushed against for literally decades claiming the divorce might infact be good for kids the best thing for kids is one the paren selfishly decide to part ways and leave the kid with their planted exploded as said in the movy now hollywood has helped facilitate the break up of families in american society with exactly that sort of messging marriages just about love the children are ansilary to the marriage and we

ballers at eight p m eastern at daily wire pluss the idea is bomming the gossis trip again the reason they are bombing the gossis trip again is because the gosipstrip was firing rockets tof them again over the course of the last twenty four hours cmas took credit for a shooting in jerusalem in which at least four people were killed sixteen people were wounded it was two brothers from eas jerusalem who are claimed as devites by homs who got out of their car and literally just open fire with m sixteens on a bunch of people who were standing there now rmember according to the mainstremedia israel bobbing military targets and accidentally kelling civilians is exactly the same thing as terroris getting out at a bus stoplic a bustop in yer neihborhood and just shooting people which is precisely what happened in jerusalems thofse violation of the seas fire number one and then last night cmas began firing rockets again at israel because effectively theyhave run out of hostages that they are willing to hand over two israel to by time tbecause the hostages to are left are isrally military or women ere children who are either dad in teir bodies ot this point or have been raped mutilated or whatever the story maybe in comas is making very clear what they are en once again the world is trying to pretend the omas is not what it is according to the uncle of a couple of the hostages or with sixteen and egal yahkove was twelve quote they took the leg of each child taken hostage and burned them with the exhausted hey motorcycle to mark them in case they ran away they could find them they were droggd that thus they did they a mean thi zilic at aushits people were tatu in order to make sure that the noses new who people were when comas kitnap children the immediately burned them wit the exhaust pipe of motor cycles in order to brand them if they ran away they could be quickly identifiged in recaptured by comas meanwhile we are being treated two hostage vidios of yardin bebas yardin is the father of a family that was slaughtered by comas i tey were taking kinnap in their kinnap we played the vidio yesterday of their cannapping as mob and two young children were talking belica four year old and a ten month old coms now says that their dad cmas is claiming that they were killden is really airstrike which may very well be true because comas took them to the goscelstrip in therewouldhave been no air strits in the gosselstrip of comas a not taken them in the first place and then they released a hostage vidio of dad who has just been told that his family are all dad this is what comas is truly evil human pieces of debri garbage human beings there was a a littlebit of the hostage at vidio which as comss propaganda of course bi says you destroyed my family and my children everything i had in my life thing then can bring me and them hon at they will be buried in israel an begging you bring me and my wife and my children home a hes talg about their bodies at this point this is who comas is and these are apparently the people that the american lefton much the internationalist woncs to protect as a power in the gasistrip in ant of abygally don a duel americans really citizen who is taken hostage and who turnd four days a few days before being released seid her nice shared one piece of peto bread per day with f our other captives did not have a shower or bath for fifty days according to the ant the five hosters were kept in above ground apartments changing locations at least ones apparently a her hair was cut off shoase covered completely in lice one of the hasstages was held in the attic of a member of you an our dbly way and the this is to comas r thi zu homasar pus we now have vidio of comasin and tape of coms stealing humanitarian aid here as a picture for one of comastonnos and as you will see is completely filled with humanitarian aid wth gar te convenient wen ar but much o picuthat is you and our dublgway bags fuel canisters in the comastonnel where do the gess of is coming from meanwhile comas leader yah yas sinwhir who is a person who is released in the last hossage exchange that israel did for gelashally dhearleyas a hundred u one thousand n twenty sevend prisoners and am he was released as one of those prisoners he is now the head of military operations of coms israel saved his life yet brain cancer and hen they released him and he unleashe thi hell upon them he now says quote the leaders of the occupations should know october seventh was just a rehearsal meanwhile a comsoficial was on with them a tik tac you to personalin in bell mubashar and explaining that comas is going to wonce more attac against israel ae emn becom te thisn comra fu us out interview er saying if you could go back in time totober six which ou still do w s in ouotober seven is osama comdon coms political bureaunwhy do some people assume we would go back in our ac of resistance s we have no regrets regret for shattering in his hire division of the occupation army tn fha thies al san that if thns railies would make newarassusis at the the bokte fies is one comg after all the risoners are eleast from his realdly prisons nn you would carry out another operation tobers e can you promise another october seventh mo c i can promise that if that a war of liberation is coming if nocust another october sen ther thin clearly out loud that this is going to continue said i do not think its far off meanwhile comas put out a statement is before they broke the seas fire a world wide called to mobalize in support of gos of this friday saturday and sunday quot we call on them to mobalize all theirpopular means to reject ins announce the crimes and maskers committed by the notse occupation to call for an ends wo its barbaric agretion and decades long occupation we urge them to be embolden by the strength of palstinian wrights in the justice and legitimacy of our struggle we also appeal t them thaint to maintain all forms of solidarity and support all forms which presumably would include violence again comases intentions are clear they violated the sease fire and israel has now resumed its campaign in the gasipstrep meanwhile the united states continues to want to have it both ways because again this is a weak administration and they continued to make signals to the world's worst people that ma be if they continue to hide behind civilians israel will stop antony blinkin decided to go back to jerusalem to lecture the israily government on how to conduct a war he said quote you cannot to operate in southern gasa in the way you did in the north they are to millian palstinians there need to evacurate four people from teir homes be more accurate in the attacks and if not then not to attack where there is a civilian population what is your sistem of operation the idea of chief resim terty hallave he said we follow a number of principles for portionality distinction the wars the laws of war there are instance s where we attacked on the basis of those principles and instance is where we decided not to attack because we waited for a better opportunity this all led to this astonishing interchange defence minister yo of gallant said quote the entire is rally society is united behind the gold o dismansmec commas even if it takes monts and blincon supposedly said quote i do not think you have the credit for that what the hell is that suppost to me you rn of the credit re retomallic infrnational moral credit is al wort talking about righthere thofm the what sort of credit does not nation require in order to destroy a terrorist enemy bent on tone annihilation wov kinnaptin kill babies well what exactlet what what precisely is the moral credit required in order to do what is necessary to protect your own citizens that is an absurdity from antony blinkon and again into all these mixed signals they are being sent anthony blinkin simultaneously yesterday he went and he visited with palstnian authority president macchmudabass a hollo coston ire and garbag human being in ramalla and he treated out quote i reiterated the youus commentment to advancing thestablishment of the palistonianstates just to get this correct commass attacks and slaughters twelve hundred people and takes another two hndred forty hostage half those people lend up dad and the reaction of tony blinin and jobidon is maybe tpalstinians deserv a state i'm s wondering how that incensive structure is supposed to work anotherwords the more terrace violens you create the more pressure on israel to make concessions to you and your alise cas make no mistake in this par ticular effort the p a is commas zalla the pia has never condemned october seventh the pi in fact tried to claim that it was israel that was responsible for deaths on october sevent and meanwhile got tony blincon making overtures to machmaabas it is rediculous here is blincon yesterday saing ther cannot be any more mass ive loss of civilian life again if somebody could provide some sort of magic won that isrel could use to distinguish commss from these civilian surrounding them orcomss by the way tfrom wi the eighteen year old guys who claim not to be members of commas but who ar carryin guns and just not wearing uniforms i am sure that israll be happy to here bout this magic wone otherwise this just empty verbiage design at what reducing tentions but tironically at increase s tentions it is the same exacting you see in briton where briton will take down manora in the name of reducing community tentions that does not reduce community tentions just give strength to a ratical enemy herestony lincon toing just that mi many day with the priministurinsenoris realy fitions i mad clear that before is real resums majnilitry operations it must put in place you manituriancevillian protect ion plans then minamis further castalthese of innocent palicinians pthat means thaking worth pecko steps to protect the lives

mirrord by that same sort of confusion an cowardice when comes to forein policy more generally this is why thereis an entire piece by ben roads to day the former deputy national security adviser who ise nickname i'm not kitting you there is book bys heavy trubery talksabout this apparently his nickname in the white house because you anto isrel was commoss not a jo that is serious thing he wrote a peese in the newyork times in which ke goes after henry kissenger now as i said yesterday about henry kissenger's deff the'rea lot of things to criticize henry kissenger over you can say that he made short term plays at the expense of long from interesty with regard to china you can say that ke greenlet regines tht would commit human rights to trocities but only because the alternative was a sovia take over of that particular area may yu can make all of these claimes but what benroads does is something deeper he critikues kissenger's general foreign policy understanding on the basis of the fact that he used right novels about his cat from a brooklyn apartment and knows nothing and benroad's s he is one of the dummast people in american politics and has been for years what exactly's benroads o foreign policy vision he says that the conduct of global affairs has to be about maintaining maintaining image he says quote you can choose to see onexploited boms as the inevitable tragedy of the conduct of globel affairs from a strategic standpoint mister kissenger surly knew that being as super power carried with it a cavernots margin of error that can be forgiven by history super powers do wa they must the wheel of history turns when when andwhere y live determines whetheryou get crushed or lifted by it but that world view mistakes cynicism or realism for wisdom the story what it is all about matters ultimately the berlin wall came down not because of chess moves made on a board of great game but rather because people in the east wanted to live people in the west economic's popular culture social movements mattered despite all our flaws we had a better system in story anotherwords the reason that the berlin wall fell according to more on benroads is that we had to v and gines and that no foreign policy moves we made anywhere in here made an difference at all which is weird because depriving the sovie union of nearly all foreign policy resource is as well as bankrupting their economy with our defence spending is what actually brought down the berlin wall it was in fact a pro western foreign policy that existed in many parts of the earth that helped bring down the soviet union but according to according to ben roads it is all about credibility sas credibility is not just about whether you punishian adversary to send a message to another it is all about whether you are what you say you are no one can expect perfection in the affairs of state any more than in relations among human beings but the united states as paid a price for it is hypocricy what exactly is that price here is where benroads goes to mazing he says around the world we see a resurgeons vautocracy an ath kno nationalism most acutely in russia's war against you crane now you might sate yourself way ta second russiaton invade ourcranewel donnal trump was president russia invaded you cranewell trobidon was president and russia invaded crimea an tat onbas while brakobama was president and turns out that american credibility on foreign policy matters a lot more than the virtue signalling of people benrods you might say that but ar corin benrod's down in in ino know it is only because people donal trump in the united states that russia invaded ou crane weird take he says quote in gaza the united states has supported in is really military operation that is killed civilians at a pace that is once again suggested to much of the world tht we are selective ind are embrace of international laws and norms o y have that is thats why the middle east is filled with people who hate the united states an must be because israel is being too unbridled in its use of military power because until october seventh everything was hunkey dory in the iddleleast actually it was gwhat it was amazing in he mddleleast an an evect more pressure on israel it is not as though more pressure on israel incentivized comoss under jobidon it is not as though more pressure on is rof the a aron in sentivized by the by diminstration had any impact again this comes from a pervirse view of how the world works the foreign policy world how should be view foreign policy very simple principle if you want of yiou foreign policy in one sentence you have to deside do you think the world on a foreign policy level is a prison yard or is it a playground is a prison yard or is it a playground if you think as i do that it ist a prison yard that means a few things first the world is a vilands and contentious place it is lawless is governed by both interests and ideology and really in the endeds governed by raw power economic power military power these things actually matter because it is a prison yard and it is i lit the lot of bad people there' some peoplewho are in that prison yard who are there becaut fthrough no fault of their own there some people who are actually good in this particular prison yard but it is a prison yard it is a lot o bad people who hate each other and want a fight each other and have very very adversarial interests second foreign policy is ae series of bad choices between awful alternatives there are very few amazing choices in foreign policy it turns out the very often you have a choice between allying with the soviets and losing to hitler for example that iswhort stuff happens in foreign policy all the time and to pretend otherwise is to be ignorant of how foreign policy actually works third foreign countries in adversaries have their own math they hve their own interests and their own piorities it is not is though they have no agency and that the united states does a thing and than it is all blowback maybe the united states has its interests and maybe the saudies have their own interest may thes rallies have their own interests maybe the british have their own interest maybe the russians have their interests mye the chalans have their own interests and maybe they pursue those interests regardless of what the united states is doing or not doing that would be a much more accurate descriptin of how you work in your everyday life why do we always assume if you are on the left that only american exently every one es sitting around thinking about what baroccobama things about the world as suppose to what they want to do to day and finally refusing to engage what the world is not a real possibility the united states was lold in's that false sense of security because for the first half of the united states existence briton was the lobalhedgemon not the united states and that guaranteed freedom of the seas for example and we benefited from briton's ownership of the seas through free trade through british nomination of a lot of foreign areas through british calming influence and a lot of its colonial holdings and then briton started to collapse brettin give up a lot ofthose colonial holdings the world became a more dangerous place and the united states filled the gap and now people well what if we just stopped filling the gap well then youould get chaos because remember the only reason that the ap was fill before is becaus there was another globel hedgemound if the united states does not do it right now who d you think is ging to do it thou thing that shas becomes a power vacum pre dy things can a fill that power vacum you'l know the answer it is china it is not briton it is not france not germany be china and you will know it bat according been roads again the basic idea here is the reverse forn policy the world it is a playground filled with wonderful children who just wan to make friends with you and if you hand out enough chocolate and candies and if you make friends with them and if you put a rainbow sticker on your back pack they will love you much they are just good people you deep down at heart an what they really need is jobs and friendship and that is going to woo people ho have a completely obverse world view to yours in this particular view america is the only actor in the world you are the only on wo matters and if america shows it is example by just being supernice all the time and never engaging in form possy and never making hard esisions and never building up its one power and never doig tus up everyn will look at the unites they'l sae what a nice person the unot what a great place the united states is i wish we were them and than they will just voluntarily give up their power it will be amazing if you believe this it is because you are stupid person but the basic idea from benrodes and many ironically on the sort of isolation is right is that no one else on planed earth has agency every dis cussion you will here from isolationists is about how no one has he agency except the united states america did a thing therefore another country did the thing never the other country o the thng may bewe reacted to them where that country is allying wit the country that we do not very much and growing in power and threatening our interest maybe we have t ry ap the blame america first crowed exist on both sides of the aisle and it is all based again on that centralized principle which is that america could with draw from the world and just be a light unto the nations a sort of example without ever engaging in world politics and i's not true it is ridiculous it assumes number one he world is t a playground and number to even if the world is not to playground that the united states is the option with drawing within our own borders ant there will be no impact on the united states which i'm sorry to say is not troue i was suere true it happens not to be true in this view the west has to play dad in orde to make room for everybody else and their bunch people whol hold this particular world view and they range from the ratical left as i say to the sort of isolation astriht will get to that in just one second first the october fifteenth taxdedline attarty tast i know many of you might be dreading the struss of filing your taxes filingyour

and all all it requires is frust to axis the best angels of our nature in order to operate in this prissing yard in everyone roses will blue meverywhere one of people who pushes this all the time is the po gape as everyone knows this point i'm not a tanipoe francis i think that he is a disgrace to his posiction to be perfectly frank with you i think that he says things that their antibilical on the regular and i'm not tog mat ant habiliclif a yush pentof youan not a catholic obviously i disagree with catat cathalzon otherwise i woul i would be a catholic but i'm not the u one ho believes this iwut ta a vas majority of conservater tatholics believe the pope frances has abandond many of the church is crucial missions including bas sline morality in favor of a globilist view of the world that is all about environmentalist and environ mentalism and left wing redistributionism over actual eternal meaning hings and poe francis what that means that very often he is en gaging in exactly the kinds of moral equivalents that you would see from the radical left you saw that yesterday apparently as bom's fell in tanks penetrated deep into gosi an late october is really presin is a curzog how they call with pofrancis apparently herzag was describing his nations horror over october seven and franc said quote it is forbidden to respond to terror with terror which is just the grosist thing ever me that is supergros because israel was not responding to terr with terrificeral wanted to wipe every civilian goza off the planet it certainly has the military power to do it did not and it was not seeking to herzog said pub up what were doing is trying to defend our own people the pope said those responsible should be held a countable benouts ovilians that of course is ridiculous because comsis hiding among civilians if isrel could distinguish between the two wl that make everybody's life super easy but that is why komas is not allowing them to do apparently according to the washington post that private call woatd in form is rali interpretations of franci's polemic statemen at his november twenty second general audience in saint peter square that the conflict had gon quote gon beyon war this is terrorism the seniorofficial from misrel said the pope was calling the campaign and act of terras m hales could be interpreted adthe the vatican decline to clarify what they mat which is again the way that francis works hoe will say something radically left and then when called upon to clarify what he saing good i dont ned to clarify there is no need to clarify and thi stems from a perverse world view in which apparently just surrendering to evil makes evil likely to become good that is a lion is notrue and there people who use that they are people who quar perfectly willing to use that mentality the rat radical is lamas use this al the time rshetocoledi for example good frend of brakobama you remember that time that borakobama and reshe calledies in events together leading up to two thousand ape nd was on tape and the media completely buried it the eli times had the tape they arefused to release it becausethey wanted barokobama to be president and reshed caledi is a spokes person for the palistine liberation organization at one point well coledi apparently the cling to say on thursday that israel had either a legal or a moral rightsto respond militerily to the comas terror attack coledi said the question is its framing that is the problem gas has been underseege for sixteen years ind goes on and on and on about how basically israel does not have the ability to respond to a terror attack again not a shock coming from adical is lamas and left sides with dapic is left is either foolish or corup mewa they are people on the right who are cors simultaneously doing much the same thing a group on t libertarian right who sound very much now om chom sky on the left sound very much burniy standers on forein policy i do not know what to make of that other than they are just wrong tuker carlson yesterday hea he did a show with a comedian iantom and this commedian i gess the libertarian and tuger carlson was talking with this guy and this guysir rippinginto willam of buckly and it led to this ten of odd exchange whatever this atrophe to might be intelleg ins of the american people it is i think it is excelery tin i mean it is a you will look and again just uaid all disclamer as well i'm throwing but people who i do not necessarily i view bill buckley is one o the great villains of the twentieth century o than yo wen ruins i could not a gree more but but he was a clearly very alsost the io othr way but he was also a very intelligent guy and witty and was not speaking down to his audience and an bagagen tuckers is e retalshosdroncaster and i think tukers as mark ey i'm ust wondering whitley i would love for him to explicate why he thinks bill buckley was one of the worst forces of the twentieth century i gat be good to know in bill buckley was most prominent conservative of the twentieth century now tucker may not national if you right now he certainly writing for the back in the ninety sometimes but hehe may not them right now that time you dosn't have to agree with the editor s over it national of yeu i'm just wondering why buckley why buckley because what buckley's mostly famous for was forging the famous three legged stool of conservatism social conservatism which i s soon tucker agrees with in fact i nottuckers agrees with it fiskol conservatism which is about free markets where tucker's pretty dicy and foregn policy where buckley's position was a sort of realist anti soviet position iwhat which parts tis tucker disagree with id be i'd be very curious to know a very curious to know because from liberatari an wright the disagreement with buckley is on social conservatism where tucker i believe agrees of buckley and on forein policy which is largely again the sort of america is to blam for every war thathas ever been happening on plan at earth position since world were to maybe including ruld were to i iejuby curious to nwer tuker is on this sort of sucks i actually it it is unclear at this point i'm curious alredy has therest i sho continues right now you are not con won a miss it will begetting into a shocking report from the e yor times about the failure of imagination

i can before you can understand how bob' sister became the talk of the third grade and the big day that that led to the people still remember and he to explain first that bob's sister is a drawing the teacher in this third great class mister a blow spotted it one day while teaching mat he saw one of the students antonio working on a picture i went over to him said but the picture way i'm probably did that two or three times and hn the fourth time i went over it i just took the picture an a he have not said a pe attention its botglass and i put on my desk he came up wit before rese lesson as i can have my picture bak knows what is this picture of anyways and he sayd it is bob's sister and i and i mi who is bob's sister turns out bob's sister is ominion an which am i do not you think bob' sister exists in the minion world yo saa saing the minions from from the mive despicable ma yes exactly and he just invented a sister character for bob yes parently mister a bob take the drawing to the bookshelf behind his dask n your feltow of a wolf that was already there cause it was quare of antonio kept the drawing i would continue to be a distraction him and a couple of his friends who at that point wete the only won's in class whe really cared about bob's sister that is i do not worry she is not going anywhere shol be are here he time one s sheer shoal be behin me cause he his were into the picture abob's sister ye i did not really quite understand why i never investigated why this was picture was such a big deal but yet they would talk about they would go up and look at it ias a thing why were you gi excited about bob's sister do you thing i think it is because it was that can netin distraction in class that people could talk about i straight forward enough this a doin when of antonia's friends who was in to bob's sister from the start described the drawing it is just it ok to puss and then it had to ies and then tento clas coming out an he was bob's sister was an ack tor puss bob's sister was not oc to puss but bob's ominion wit it did not yearly have anything to do it that and was he referring to the minion bob reminds now knows not i see was it a good drawing it was and et yolds ocate drawin it was an amazing but it was he knew what it was this sole question is t a n octo puss is an ominion a santonia who do bofs sister about that he tended to see bob' sister as a pack man ghost with big eyes but he said and at thohes surprising a mature for somebody in elementary schooll he thught part of the a peal of bob's sister was it was open to interpretation i really do not know what it is it is jus a thing i do not know what it it is jus lots of different things you could think of it as a minion that looks wor it ou could think of it as flyg out with the legs yu could think of as pack my gos with pigers it bob sist was different to everybody ut everywone with one of them whic just n it we did not sa ything i any moce toplay with the clit but the thing was kee to bob's sister was bob's sister was not actually anyone's sister is nam was just bob's sister in hs face that is very fonin ev e did not dom up wit the genter either bob's sister genderans specified wbeve don the book shelf near the felow of a wolf and tall one week when mister a bob wen on vacation and the kids hat is substitute when mister abob came back bob' sister was gawn banished disappeared and was all that kids wanted talk about this is the point where everybody in class is very very interestedt a bob's sister this kind of all the speculation about what happened to bob's sister a she stolen which she murdered a tdid she die and i go in you noi look a little bit looked under the desk a look beh in the bookshelf and just subsitute bam i did actually he they had no idea what i's talkig about which was good enough for me a really for me that makes him suspect number one interesti thereis y i doyo not watch any crime drama at all aen or ther all kinds of theories about what happened abob sister in tonting i don said it was really fun to talk about various abductors cutting animals from an alternate universe but doone says the prime suspect for is classmates that other picture on the bookshelf they just decided that the wolf at the gause it was e was tin right a bobs the wolf the wolf was jealous or something the reallealy know why they guess that is er that is what they said who said that they sically everybody i mean he is a wolf yet the chetter about bob sister does not go away which is funny but also mister blaus got a correcuum to get through im a kind of vaguely annoyed because i's not going on in a school they do not have much time to think about a picture of bob siser but they'r kind of pestering me about it and than one other student dean actually pipesin and says can we have a funeral for bob sister and what are you talking about and and theyre welle she died something happened om and i afuneral for bob sister or pictur and i say yes pagan just to get them to stop talking about bob sister but also this is the kind of teacher is he sais sometimes it is mart to take some detours fathings way they lead and they wen li i do not know when i do not know whet this funerals can happen and there wen ones it can happen one apen we are goin to have a funeral bob sister and then finally after the recess on friday and that was monday rest ofthe week o pretty normally mister blaus or hoe that they wuld forget about the funeral by theanowe but no way they' murmuring about it paring for it which she has no part of the eight year old of t ones organizing us and thinking it through finally friday arrives the big day the day a the funeral gets come back into the room from recess they are pretty giddy and pretty excited fin lan ocay game o let us go funeral i have no idea what what is about to transpire all of a sudden whom tables kind of move out of the way the leader of the funeral comes up with the stooll two other students pring two tables and crab the flowers apparently a bunch of girls had been making posters they right bob sisters funeral on the board teone's leader of the funeral and he prepared to ouwula said t his friend theo do not gets in front of the class holding micrfound mister bab keeps in the room the rest of the class is totally on t e edge of their seats is waiting for this kid to to start the funeral it paying more attention to him than they ever pay to me ready for it o he starts out kind of adli being about welcoming every one thanking everyone for coming to celebrate the life of bobs is sure now how did what to say in a ouwud ge we get we just said lie sinc things that sounding about way something that that you might say i funerall that might make someone cry tou have you your wild e there yet tinke it out could you read it and getns and tit ta sort of my ousess sas sort of back and forth she an who sell is et yan reing ell bobs sister was a great person people that that bob as just a drying on a piece of paper for i knaw he was anything bat back but she is still in here she mad e think i coan do things in school if she was yee to ga she would a keep on trying that is hroing iyes it sounds you r trying to be sert of inspiring ye had you seen a you wougy and a movy or something that that you knot never wo the other you would the theoot was also really good i just when ti say something about the special person here bobs sister as shou such a good friend all the potatoes and especially mister potato had a potatoes were another fascination an mister reblale's class at year what an honour it was to have her with us god blass her and tan from the back of the room mister oblow here is a boy crying i would say almost wailing but it was a real cry and at first time thinking oh i got another just turning this into a joke and then i realize that he is actually seriously crying this is not a joke cry and i walk back i walk back there and everyone cant of turns back every one's looking at both of us and i ask him i what is wrong what is going on how why why ar you crying ah and he is it is because bob's sister did and i was it is not about anything else maybe and he is know it is bo sisters died it is just sad mister blaw thinks maybe it was really about his dog dog that boy had grown up with die just two weeks before his mommison an hemoun to let him know but mister blass roy not shore it ai'te your plenty old enough to catch a glimpse of what death means and then they look up and then the whole kind of feel of the class room is changed it is gone from kind of giddy excitement this is a fun thing to half the class is nervously laughing and the other half looks there on the verge of teers thers about three girls that are kind of really sad and i was oh no what if i created this was this was reaching an emotional level that i actually hadt never experience before and i've been teaching for about a fifteen years nd i'd never felt kind of this not that it was getting out of control but it was it was leading to something that i did not know os can and honestly i do not know what is go to happen next if three other kids ster crying i do not know how to andal e situation i ike id thi'd never experience ckind of that in a glass room it is interesting it is it is it is it is it is they were playing around with aneralike with a weegy board and joking around and suddenly they accidentally summoned a demon into the room ye and a way and for me t i was i was right there on the weegy board with him and soand said this monsters in the room youve vun wesh this really good cind o of primal force this grief it this yet greet death and a i mean one of the really nean things about their grad as it is i mean there is to saying you they stop a learning to read and are a reading to learn sucs that it is an age where their world gets a lot bigger they kind of are experiencing real things and i think a funeral is one of those things they probably all heard of a funeral they read them in books but most of them probably had not been to one and did not know what that felt an mister obla felt responsible tell them through this near experience he had lots of others that year he took control of h room back from the its nd ad dress them all that was well funerals ar can o serious sometimes when you go to a funeral it make it is very sad because you are missing the personn that is a move on and sometimes it reminds you other people whoave moved on a nd it is important to remember those people and it is mportant to be sad o and this is the end of the funeral anwhich work ive body snaped ot of it the deeming left the room tnext as free times they ill enjoy everything at's fine but at the end of the school year when the class stood in a circle when each cimame something they remembered and liked from third grave a couple of the kids said bob sistra's funeral here is a moment for mister abal to sometimes yu know the joking round ndti light and fun and trying somethin you have never done before and some bigger subterranean forse gets on wast that is wha i just goin to be about to day those moments you get a glimpse of all that feeling it is there down below hidden from siht o bo beasy chicago its this american life am or glass stay with as nan anact one music of the night after night after night after night after night after night after night aernight when you go to a big theatre you see all the people who are on stage ther brightly wit the visible to everybody theyare witterily there to be seen but then just below them down in front there is the orchestra pit than it seems straightforward enough what happens in there musicians play their instruments but other things go on in there all kinds of in teractions and feelings it usually we do not get much of a picture of ou there old saying hella's other people noc she comes from the theatre come from play no wegs it that boy was not witden by somebody who sits in the orchestra pit but jak cast bin kang is thi story but how many musicians and theatrical orchestras might understand the sunniment referst brat casts the story back in twenty twenty we are bringing it back to day with an opdate here is yet tik cemam it to new york and two thousand six to try to make it as musician he had just finishe ap college and had all these dreams of

was excited about fand im of the ofper was a show nake its love since he was eleven years old he ha just tarted playing the trumpet and wutd lay on his living room floor listening to the music of the night it slowly ganly nigh unfrills it splender that call changed his life he would finally arrive fan im on broad way on his first day nic enterd the majastic theatre on forty six and eighth avenue he walked through a back alley pass a gintub of dry eyes down a flight of stairs into a lock room where he changed into all black he then haded into the pit to play the music he had loved as a child he had his own seat there now and a music stand he played the first show next day he went back and playe it again and then again his brain started to a jess to playing the same show eight times on we and then he started to notice it was not just the music that repeated it he ot seeng the same actors f exax him tire in the same is is sions of exact same time and seeing same people the bafthrim i thexactons ing evevery time one of the dancers comes through to put her wig on she says to one of the other dancer is sold goud jaw berico lic every sicincl day is very ground hark di at first is his funny almost charming nick was thirty an the youngest person in the pit not by a few years but by a few decades hed never been in a situation this where everyone seemed locked into routine hhis collegues would sit down in their chairs at the exact same minute every day there is the challise to would say marvellous every time they gasked him how he was doing there is the first horn player who had pull out a stofp watch every single night to time how long the second orn player held a note in one of the songs some days it would be seventeen seconds and other days sixteen point to you you deffully start to notice people talking about each other men complaining about it the same people are await every single week if you bumpin to a stand by accident you will get im ligup wat the you doing come if the luk take a deep breath ion o wha what is a bang at thet te a is aer o basily i'l not is jated haves the rest of them ak no by say anything that is now a i now soxo beer e i i even be herligo e yo sill no yeu soll o in o people kind of walk in ther li acin dess again and some of us us in ther boy language the way they walk in the door the con a trargin ayo at one some one says to i have to do this that i fanam of the opera opend on broadway and january nineteen eighty eight it was an instant hit at ey wone i a thing is at is abot comes a lan come an the show is virtually guaranteen to run wel into the next deccate it did and then another thatcate an another the musicians of the pits on contracts with the provision which guarantee their jows antil the show shut down he expected two may be three years but the show kept going this three years turn into five years wic then turned into thirty two that is over thirteen thous an performances fvannam is now the longest running show in the history of broadway thereis almost a feeling a nsye t you have to do in again you have to douit again that' s malony felt he nobo as who as been in the pit for twenty eight years now t on ate describe it a fhusical sensation that i get a literaly eton jonli on o mi sket my it is a legi i cannot sta a stan when crasy only that thing as happenein i first heard about the pit at fanam through a friend whose wife had recently supped in the viol in section she described which she had seen as a horror show waiting for guffman but thirty hard years down the line i could not quite get it out of my head s one of the first things people ask how can you possibly stay saying and play the same usic every nigh het wright has been playing fanams since opening night he is a french horn player who times the notes on hi stop watch every night no there is something in that wer you i would ook in the music sometimes andi it would just look literally look shapes i would just seye sircles and wines and dots i would have no idea i will not even know what page ot as on thet thiy get the s associate of failing almost likeii hearing yourselves speak and you do not and you are not sure it is english i that is i do not think that ever happened oand then that is the funny things you see someone else do at you immediately know what is going on with him but what is their face lik oh theyre just legla they just it is as if they do not even know where they are they are waking up in another room ut's what happened where am i what day is it what week is it when i start o talking to the pit musicians a comple of years ago i wanted to know how they found meaning in the mundaning inevitable repeticions of life and lots of jots people do the same thing every day bud nothing quite this you hearing the exact same lines from the stage playing the exact same nots for the same songs even they got sating next to you breaths in the exact same rithem every day the fanam kis is pristine for the first time in the same shandiler comes crashing down in the same spot on the stage i ave seen the archist remembers were sand archers o pull back the same bow it the same motion until they die i talk to a trumpof player an lowell hershy lons been at the showsincs day one and everyone says he is the same as pirson in the pet and a kind of drives you nuts for the first few weeks and then after that youre mind deals with it and just flushis it out when you are not there iu do not think about it do the words to the songs at your play a no thout not entirely where any gerl here any fondly whatever i may i remember one at one time after a show had been running for a while it is somebody asked me to play aotle bit of a tune from the shell and i could not even do it i could not even think of one had submarge ti mut brayers look base just ejected being cognats under the music is going on thi thin that typical of people do to shows that the right time of personality as that can hande is shop i'm descended from a long lying of serfs and pe os yeu ow people who are use stell pabering in the feels for for hardly any money and thand are relatively happy with that the fanam players are not exactly sirfs they are well paid they play beloved show and they get the playin small orchestras on the side but the is are highly trained musicians who went to the fanciest music schools in the world andrew loid waver one ed the best of the best for fanam bhich mea's a pit wil always sound good though it also create some creative and spiritual problems for the players who have to get through the score night after night after niht i'm a violent operator tahow you describes that is that is how you jescribe o you i fut's it is it is very technical i have i have no emotional connection with it that is a violinist named kercobel he is a composer his dream was always to write schores for horrophones hes now been at fannam for twenty two years long enough to see three people in hi section die i'm playing the show nobody's interested in my creative in put i've often compared it to working in a hospits yoit is just we just keep the s o alive as long as we can here they all are and this weard social experiment trap together for decades twenty seven musicians crammed into this tiny space e trumpet player told me it is playing in a submur i've been down there and you can barely turn round without knocking into something in the pit you notice everything the way your neighbour blows out as pit val way some one braggs about their kids the smell of some one's perfume every little annoyance every preceives flight accumulates one of my favorite stories which should drive any one who has ever played in a band crazy there is his pesene player who has sat next tof the same clarinet player since nineteen eighty eight she is convinced he plays half ino flat on every note he is ever played he denies this the person i talk to the muss in the pit wass melany the oboist she is one of the rare people you meet who has no real filter i was complaining about something which i imagine was that it was really cold it is always really cold and then e some one else from the orchastra said jus tired f the sound o your voice an i'm tired o the some of my boys tooshy i con is sympathized with her then ti was a wiolet is that man because i sai used round up in my garden she she would not speak to me for io to weeks during most of our talks melony was making reeds it is an extraordinarily meticulous process there is all sorts of medieval looking tools and tiny bits of wood everywhere oh bost a the most orcanistic people in the world because everytime tan akreed they think that at my work f usually do not at anyway this part onli i's gepping the mose iw wyyou made to pik your collor of thread and it just makes all that ever that i never know what collour hed i tis as always find that mi have that got afful noise melany studied it juliard she dreamed of being the principal oboess in the mechrupon opera or the philhermonic but she kept bobbing her iditions her nerves got the bass of her every time she was up for a big seat and then life and bills intervene pannom in that way is a very good job in a feel where there are not a lot of good jops anywore he put malanies kids through college peter mortgage and provided security while the music indistre colassed around her but at the end of thirty years sitting just inches away from your coworkers you lose all sense of proportion your enemies turn into monsters for malny the monster in the pit was always tha trumpet player named francis bawni everything he did troof melone nots from the black biking shorts he wore in the pit to always eating his dinner in the lockeroom with his pack turned to her francis was the miserable sone of ich and at a stertain point he is storn o worrin bi he put this black shlik shede on the side of his glances yes where those ins causehe os wone to see me ri that is why hes where is i really truly bos i wanted to run this all by francis it just seems unreasonable france is the only person i had talk to who had actually escaped from the pit he got in a trolk an trove out to the middle of nowhere in colerado he says he is much happier now yos welgam melody oh ye hevythi i undersa that you too did not have the best relationship one of things that she told us was that that he c basically made an eye patch that you would not have to look at hers is this a true story that justellingus i did do that some boin but elbowsn't just because a millonin oh she is taken too prucialy it was actually anybody that was on my right she told us for a long time that you sat in the lockeroom and that you re turn your back to every budy because you did not want to look at them yell yell was in a lacker room i came there i my dinner looked at the white woll winian play the show and then left the theatre left the premises as fast as i could and o it worked beautifully can you compare that relationships that you have with other relationships it is family it is espes you cad stad in a putting up with people did you just do not want to hear their voice again you sit there thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of hours this is a cart of a life time the musicians in the pet do not play the whole time which means there are thousands of hours where they are not actually doing anything and during those rast they read books spy thrillers and mysteries and do the crossword with their neighbors the trumpet player has taught himself three languages another musician ran a wood shop business on his lap top during the sho and socially it is a bit maddle school there are the loners the jocks and the french horns they are the boys in the back in the box they bring in fart machines and run the same practical jugs over and over sometimes th even mass of the audience the front row is right up against the pet close that their feet sometimes dangle nexts of the musicians heads occasionally one on the french horn players and take out a bottle of white out and writ little messages on the souls of the audiences shoes those guis there is sitting where behind me they are always chattering and laughing i being me if i play badly i think i go their sang how terrible an oh god i do not want you reallyate myself this more than anything melany told me is one makes her want a sound good every night she is worried the french horn guies will make fun of her i'm not playing for the audings cause he audiencs does not and i'm playing for those french horn place i do wane to say on one of the complens i've goten over the years is how do youse to play well when you have just bee doing phantom for all those years itsthit is a choice that i fat my choice is to play this music its any other music ful i ply and and make it beautiful an you firtwi can cithe really hard one if it is really battle i beg you now during the pandamic the rest of broadway pandom shut down the unstopable show as put on paws for a year and a half i checked in with melany during that brak she wasn' doing very well she was not getting paid by the show and she misse fannam this was a prising to me melany and all the other musicians had told me about their fannassins a finally leaving the show and i had believe them but now that it actually happened she miss the routine fantom i miss the the comradeship the re petition of te silly jokes and watching everyone at and i do not know the routine i count of lake routine in my life this of course is the oppice of what she said in the past before covit was always easier to complain that it was boring and to complaine about driving into the city and wasting all that time in the caran playing the same music and going home again an and ight just thought i knew i was lucky back then but it becomes very real now i me what can i fay now i really no what if not having this jom i it is s much fun to complain about things that do not matter ah the women in the bath from they are just always talking about their expensiv hair and make up and i iits the women in the batro and i ye i'd be happy to complain about that again before the pandammic every time i talk to melony i would ask how she was doing rans are always depended on parking it is hard to park in mid town manhatan the good parking spot was a good day the bad parking spot was a bad day this is how she made sense of her life i think about this all the time most of our lives are spent finding parking for the job we do not want to do melony's not alone in that and after any number of years those routines accumulate nd that is more or less your life of all the people i talk to in the pet one musician dealt with the mondaning inevitable repeticion of life in a way that really stock with me for the past two decades in the pit cart the musicianeo described himself as a violin operator has been dreaming up the most elaborate and metaphorically perfect coping mechanism it is a ban made up entirely of automatons i met these robout musicians in a warehouse in yonkers the panban stands for partially artificial musicians kart's automatans are made up of scraps of medaline string all wired up to a sounboard that kirkan program to crate whatever sounds he wants there is magnes an electric corin organ a creeg the base guitar and then there is rosy the fermen this is jach a solid boly electric violin using be exo skeleton design this is what how o alleviate the bord of of the redundency of phantom o i'm constantly thinking about this project and how i can incruel he ougt o mation and the con music that i would te createwhat why did you decide to do this oh if i ever see a theropist maybe they will help me under soho iv tand im there i gwas ae part of it where you are man i am playin in this orchestra i'm not expretting a it is not the expressiveness that i want i also a kind of feel an oautomaton and may u just make an automaton a short violines yi may i can i can see exploring that am i looking for some kind of soul heeling from this tehumanization of being in a violen section possibly i ask cart if the panban could play the music of the night or all i ask of you or any of the phanum classics he was not into that at all this band was not design tod play angerloid weper but something inside him jus caldn't get away from phanom of the opera back when he was sitting in the pet he would can pas just in his head both the preoqule an the seequelt to phanm both which involve indian a jones typhe characters in years ago he got a copy of the nineteen twenty five silent film version of phanum and wrote an entire score he wanted to play it for me he turned out the lights in the warehouse and projected the film on to the wall the panban started to play the score features him curt as the solo violen is from the star of the show the automatans all play the same thing but curd always inprovises not of his show herever the thang can caspan can staffordr from the new yorker olost fon the pi cask time to say good by hestry was produced by miking we a first brork as sat stoy three years agow and now the decutes of repetition in the phantom on the opper pit are finally coming to an ad after thirty five years the long is running show on broadway history is closing this week curious how the musicians in the pit were takin the news ja caught up with melony the obo pir which she just had four shows left to play ja asked about the muman when everybody w works on the show her definitively doing a big zumeating actually thet show was finally closi it was your first thought cause i remember that we had talked about in you sort of you and and lll and he had all sort of fanasized about ecause i asked your bas e lodg ess wot watting in at on you leave ike hausigan a feel i and the hagit actually feel as you finaling at confirmation that o cad this is actuing in and the first things you yes that the dropping of your got into the cellar kind of feeling of shock just complete shock bu the bottom is falling out of my world kind of feeling i was upset om what i do i sa i do not want to be sad i will be angry let us choose anger and i said i'm going to focus on all the things i hate and that way i will not be sad and that is what i did soo it did it work i did at work geter i was successful to just focas on everything you head and yet av you knad whatever feelings as sad thas sever grad aran a fear that might have thought tha now this is at the beginning o k i was good right i was successful om now that it is imminent i do feel different om now it is much more but rollar poster up and down right now thers all kinds of exciting activities going on and then you can sort of forget that it is closing i am certainly sad about it it is an entire way of life om i i cannot even really imagine knowing it will never be back but most of those people i'm never gon to see again are people being nicer to one another te thank you for usk people ar mang nice i'm trying be quieter rup things that annoyin me but fewer things are annoying me and it is all very festive and fun we had really fund photo up on friday we they had a full company photo call i really enjoyed it because everybody was up on stage they all gave as the poster and everyone is getting their poster signd your high school your book and when i first interviewed you several years ago one of things tate you told me that au o made me laugh a lot was that you after playing twenty something yeares at the time on the show had never actually seein the shell and thats ser blue my mind because its i cayou gn itink youe never actuallyin the show yet om i realized that i really wanted to see the show and i asked the management and they set me up at the soundboard and it was wonderful his just last week i think and what what amaze me was the pageant tre of it the beauty of it i had no idea you see them bringing in all the ice back stage outside of the stage short everyday theresthe giant ice container the dry ice and the they carry it in and then and then we used to complain about the the smoke but i never knew what the smoke did and it is crates is incredible atmosphere and then there is all these lights li we see the candle ob under the stage but they are not lit under the stage and i got to see them on the staage an i got to see the fanam in crisceen at the end of i do not know which number it was but they just disappear i made it is a trap door but is o is thir jus disappearing ad i feew a little kid in a way just low struck by always seeng that other people have seen many time a eleven people hweome in the pick closing night the musicians who ere there on opening night back a nineteen eighty eight was able to reach old hurshy who as ja wen at the story if it to cause the sanest person in the ped many well has other gages lined up frafter vanam closes here and there nothing big nothing to challenging neither of them imagines playing for another broadway show there is a sub as regular player well i have to say was very chill about the closing i cannot say that i did not enjoy going to

to get a mest cross message do not weave change wying around one time she put an article on the fridge saying toddler chokes on penny and then just left at everybody else to connect the dots on his mother communicates in the same indirect way which became a problem in the years after elna left the church on his family's morman and a mammat some important things that yoe wante to say to or here 's on thi's all started when i made a joke about my abying wed to my brother careful he said if mammar dere that she would send an email to the whole family about how you are an atdict i laughed and then i was wait what that was wage specific did mmm sent an email to the whole family about me being an atdict and he was nothing never mind which could only mean one thing she did it took several round a questioning before i got the whole story the emo he was raferent thing my mamad sented ten years agow at the time i was about to house o comedy showing new york where me and a bunch of performers but played drinking games on state it was called the drunk show the show was being promoted on line my ma'm a devout warmens a an article about it and freek dowd warmans do not drink it is against the relagion and what i learned from my brother years after the fact is that my mind was worried that i was doing this show she sent an email to my family my extended family uncles cousin s and family friends who i grew up what life the michels the cox is highty my middle school drama teacher dear friends it begins i am writing because i am concerned about the direction elma's life is turned she is spiralling downward fast my mind then explains to them that i'm doing this event called the drunk show then wrihts i am very concerned and our family you are either in alcopolic or a mormen and i think she may beheaded in the wronk direck sion i do not know what i can do personally she does not hear me i'm get inreject here that i did not hear her because she never said anything to me about it in the e mal she inscerts to link to the article about the drunk show and then reveals her grandmaster plan she is been commenting on the article under fake names warning me not to do the show can everyone else please make up fake accounts and also comment this way a'll cancel the shw she ends thanks pray for us both please when i read this emal i was mortifiet i drink cially i'm not an alcoholic but since i'd never intercepted the email i worried everyone who got it hid thought this for years i immediately clicked on the link to the article at the bottom of the page there were four comments from for different people trolling me all clearly my mother her first fake character is carroll from the west village who says quote encouraging irresponsible drinking that could end in hospitalization of performers is an invitation to a law suit do not be idiots the three other comments to escolate from there here is the weirdest part she wrote all these comments while she was staying with me she was in town the week of the drunk show we slept in the same bat but she did not say a word to me about it as interventions go it was the least successful one ive ever heard of or could imagine no one else among the family or friends chimed in and i the target of the intervention never knew it happene i never heard of or read the comments on mine until my brother accidentally let it slit years later since i found out about this i've wondered why my momths to communicate this message to me the way she did but i've never asked her because i figuret which asle to a fight and no answers but we are much closer now than we were when i did the drunk show why not try to my surprise she agreed to talk about it but on these conditions dad had to be there in case we need a mediation i had to come home for christmas in exchange and most importantly i could only do this story if she got to write the ending which will get to later i talk for sic i olma are you ot momger yes sexy ama i im trying out a lower voice cause i thing my voices toscreet do not do that the whole interview not being yourself we started at the beginning how did my mother decide that anonymous comments on line would be the best way to reach me she said my sister julia told her about the drunk show i land there on the couch 'm at your apartment probably about five in the morning and i'm steling over this cansly hav slept for hours and then ah i just the this littleepifany i can put this on here in somebody else's voice i do not have to use my own voice an then may she will take it seriously yeu just need to hear it from new yorkers why on only you are from new york you live in new york and you value their opinions more than yours oh absolutely cause i'm nowl this fuddy dudy old fashioned mormon lady hat does not ow anything no from nineteen fifty om june clever are you saying that you are better that i think you think i think that is what i think you think i am ye before things gets you tenss my mamant i pull at the comments page together snow it' ki the first thing i learned was how fleshed out these people were in my mind's mind carroll from the west village who warraned that irresponsible drinking could lead to losses she is a lawyer cause that is the way a lawyer would say things is not it she is dealt with law suits tat have been blovealve tha drunk drivers or a something with alcollism invalved ri sto be clear nowhere in the comments does it say caroll is a lawyer for each entry there jus a name and locat sion dan from the upper west side pretty ritsiaria right who is down in your mind on is a a commedian oh who is older he used to do kind of old style comedy again reading the comments you would never know don was a comedian ye he is just discusted with how comedy his a yevalved in the last fifteen years or what does don think about me doing this show he says comedy where you are laughing at the performers and not with the performers is not comedy it is tragedy is this really what and why see comedy is reduced to are you really not cleverer than this why did you think don saying this to me which would reach me wha you love commedians to means all about the comedy for you of course if's this not going to be funny than h maybe we should not do this the next comment comes from these village from a commenter named please te case i'm thinking this is a ah a policemen and his name is polease ye officer please it does not say officer mowhat whyis this policeman writing me whys he offended by this show well he says ten years after nine eleven and this is where new york is come on the show was on september sementeen i think this week of all weeks we should all be a little more sensitive and full of introspection am can we just i think we can both agree that you went you went real big on this one i hat the nine eleven button her last comment is is straight ap mormon talking point a'lcall is am and all other edictions take away freedom of choice seven minutes after she posted that she sent the massemale my mam said she went hard because i have to uncles who died of a'lcoll ism poisoning my uncle died age thirty ma other uncle came to my wedding completely drunk and anded ap dead about two years later from alcollism garry's grandfather died abalcoholls an that is how i get there it is no it is a mormon thing it is a an experience that has affected a me it affected my mother she was just devastated over her a brother in his alcohol ism stopping the drunk show meant stopping me from becoming one of these people my mam says she saw the promophot of me sipping a drnk on the page announcing the show and thought i she lost her mind she has relatives who died of alcholism she is been taught since youwas little girl to be careful around alcoholl is she completely locked out everything i've ever taught her did you ever consider just calling me eln we have partyv been there you do not hear me you just do not hear me it is just a joke you have to hear it for somebody who you think it is credible come on admitted ilme you would have just laughed you would call keven you would have a good laugh and you would have the show anyway but you did not youdthink gamon admit it w it you would ave rorld your eyes of me but you did not even try alma just just tell me what is the truth on your end well i do not think i heare's the thing i think if i'm you just told me not to do it i would have at i would have done eximthing what you are saying but if we would had a full conversation were we really talked i for example i did not know intill just now until we have had this conversation i did not really know that much about your familye history with drinking you do not talk about these unpleasant things that one year against drinking i think i did think it was just had to do with mormanism and not that it had to do with really painful thingss you witnessed in your life becuse syeu never told me about them i'm sure i have said this statement before in your life in our family you ere either ah morman or an alcal it alcoholic ye ye yet i heard that one befor ye i just in believe it she would said this to me all my life but i was missing the context i've never emet any of these family members who drank i do not remember her ever mentioning any of these stories i saw my mother as sheltered almost all her frends are mormon i just thougt she does notknow what she is talking about which was unfair whend i make a radia story i listen to my inter viese over and over ia gan and this time something un usual stided to happen with eachlyson my mother sounded less and less my mother i stopped hearing her the way i usually do rolling my eyes getting tofensive and actually started hear what she had to say this is the line thats truck me the hardest elma we have party been there you do not hear me she is right and i can hear in her voice that this has been hurting her feelings for years and that is my fault i see why she thinks it' hopeless to talk to me about drinking about anything i'm incredibly dismissive that is my part in this in her part she was totally up frond about that she did not want to confront me about drinking because she has much trouble with confontation of any kind with any one going back to when she was young meives as litl keet i used to e just admit faul't to anything that happened in our family in order to get the confortation to be over with i never understood before this conversation but that feelds for her she panics feels trappe she needs to run tightness in her chest which is what makes this conversation hard is is wor yowe are doing exactly what i hate to do what talk about coflict was happening toou when we do it a well see i'm totalling my thums right i'm feeling i my neck turned to stone this cord which is ardy coiled up is the triple coiled d co or the headforns o yeil thank you for e putting yourself in your most uncomfortable plays sure your welcome elma anothing for my daughter i knew what this meant from the tone of her voice it was time to stop this was the must direct conversation i've ever had with my mother and the longist real conversation we have ever had shed gone above them beyond and did something she did not enjoy for me i could return the favour and call it a day well folks might toe et on for christmas is buked and now for the ending my mother requested it comes down to three words she was right not about me spyralling downward fast but about the drunk show for the record the drunk show was the disaster i was the one who organized the drinking games but because tha't only recently left the church i was brand new to drinking and all the penalties in the games wer things take four shots of whisky things went op the rails quickly a performer threugh a chair at an audience member i drunkdal my ex from the stage and the call went badly that i started crying in front of the audience ira who was in the show got black out drunk for the first time in his life he said and then threw up into a trsh bag and some one ended up in the hospital my mommet knew none of those details of course but big picture caroll from the west village knew what she was talking about when she said your responsible drinking can lead to hospitalization another words mom was right pon a bigger is one of proicens

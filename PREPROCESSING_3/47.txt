today sho sponsor express vepian thousands of licenershave already secured their networkdata join them expressly piandacom fleshmen on monday politica ran a long interview with surgeon general of thevake mirthy mirthy is apparently quote worried about our sad social lives according to politico americans are burned out disconnected isolated in starved for time maybe it is postpantemic blutes maybet's are smart phonediction whatever the cause it is serious enough that mirthy has issued a formal advisory to the nation calling for action to address this epidemic what are mirthyes solutions plose hosting events around the country trying to put people in proximity to one another and speaking about the power of friendship at these events according to political quote people dressed as dancing unicorns handed out prescriptions for five minutes of social connection quantity endless refills daily that is a thing that you are paying for mirthy then encourage people to spend forty five seconds riting a tex to a loved one mrthy asks people to engage in what he calls the connection exercise he says that such exercises can be supplemented by investments in social inferstructure which is where policy makers come in or alternatively it is precisely wear policy makers and government should but out see there is a reason far loneliness epinemic that is a real thing e loneliness epidemic people are lonely they are disconnected theyre adamis and sure all of that has to do with smart phones and the intrinet and the increasing atomization of our lives as we hunger down with our screens and wreck our necks but screens are just a tool to be used for good or ill the real problem is that are social institutions have been summerily destroyed over the course of decades largely by government those social institutions used to begin with and centere around church historically churches performed three interwoven functions first they provided common orientation around a higher goal complete with rules and regulations that required skin in the game in order to be accepted into the group everybody goes to my sentagog believes in god and also believes in a series of commandments that we have been given the skin in the game ranges from for example wearing eomica showing that youare committed to the group and to the idea to keep in cocure an obviously every church has something similar a higher orientation and as sat of rules that require skin in the game second churches provided economic benefits and social reinforcemen ranging from charity to the helping hands of neighbors in our community that means when some one falls on hard times that we all try to find that person a job that we will bridge the financial gap for people that will make sure that somebody is able to drive our neighbors kids home if their parents are stuck at work finally churches emerging from the firsto functions create a feeling of community that feeling of community associologist emeal durkimrote in the late nineteen century could only be attain with referents to the sacred a series of beliefs worth while they were not to be question that is what the sacred is something that is higher something that is not really open to descend or question as robert and is but the sociologist rights q it is community that gives to the sacred its most vital expressions everywhere birth marriage tdeath and other momens in the human drama those are things that are higher the sacred undergirds the community and the community provided the support structure necessary for the flourishing of the family and then government tried s replace the church and destroyed community in the process the first step with the substitution of government benefits for the earned membership of a church see in order for you to earn benefits of being a member of my synegogue for example you have to be a member of the synegogue not a paid member but you have to at least be in the community yove to perform the functions but once government stepped in people no longer had to have skin in the game of a community in order to be given charity now they had entitlements by dint of breathing you are here therefore somebody os you money according to one study yoew zeal policies from the nineteen thirties crowded out thirty per cent of all charitable spending by churches because instead of people going to church getting charity from their neighbor which might come with the awkward requirement that you actually part of the community in goods your neghbor instead youst go to the relief office government benefits are now expenantially greater than they were in the nineteen thirties family structure itself was dramatically undermine by government spending you are no longer responsible for your kids in fact if you are a dad you just did chur kids and the single monget bigger benefits from the government you are no longer responsible for paying for your elderly parents government would do that through social security andthey would borrow the money to make up the gap your call on your neighbor no longer acquired you to sacrifice for the community instead of you having go your neighbor and sailison members the same community i take cary your kids you take care of my kids ere all in this together instead yous go the government the oernment points it is gone at your neihbor and steals his wallet able to reap the rewards without the cost many people stopped going to church after all if you get the money without having to engage in any of the actual cos structure why do it and over the course of decades churches began to a just to the pews that were emptying out not by reenforcing the common orientation round a higher goal sanctity an the thing that really brings people to church but instead by trying to get rid of judgments as to include more people becuse the pews are emptying out there reaely only two ways to refil thepus one is a rededication to cor principle and the other is demolishin cor principle and basically turning a church into a piece of party churches began to try to murror government noskin in the game plenty of benefits as gurtrd himilpar wrote to decittical quote this process of religious accommodation has since gone on a pace that to day many mainline churches offered little or no resistence to the prevailing culture on the contrary some are very much part of it priding themselves on being cosmopolitan and sofhisticated undogmatic and unsensorias iis how you end up with pride flags hanging off to hundred year old churches and thus the sacred has been wiped away leaving us all alone with our subjective sense of self caiter to by a broad welfare state are we happier will that problem be cured by government of course not at can only be cured by return to community and historically that community means religious community and that is why it is staad to see religious leaders playing around the edges of conciliation with value sisteme that undermine the sacred at every single turn get to that in just one mum at first are you traveling for the holidays if purtock has he covered becaue they just added internatunal roming to

check him out right now oke speaking of religion opening its doors to valu systems that really undermine the religion on monday according t the vast majority of the legso media pope frances apparently decided tht it was fine for priest to bless same sex couples bo t least was the headline from the leggasy media according to your times this move was quoe is most definitive step yet to make the roman catholic church more welcoming to el g b t ku catholics and more reflective of his vision fte more pastoral and less rigid church if all of that were true of course that would mark a massive shift for the catholic church whit has held fast to the traditional teaching that marriage is between one man and one woman and that sexual union within marriage is the only morally prermissible form of sexual union by the way that is an opinion agreed to by virtually every main line religion for the past several thousand years the church has held fast for thousands of years not only to the sanctity of marriage but to the natural law philosophy inherent in that sanctity of philosophy that says that the world of god's creation carroies within it certain ovious rights and wrongs tliological ends in this viewpoint things in nature were designd to perform certain functions the sexual function was designes to create children man and woman were designed to become one flesh accordin to this philosophy and that creation is designed to end in the creation of new human life as philosopher robert george was catholic sex plot what is unique about marriage is that it is truly a comprehensive sharing of life a sharing founded on the bodily union made uniquely possible by the sexual complemen terity of man and woman a complementarity that makes it possible for two human beings to be come in the language of the bible one flesh and for this one flesh union to be to be the foundation of a relationship in which it is intelligible for two persons to bind themselves to each other in pledges of permanence monogamy and fidelity it would certainly be a mass of surrender for the catholic church to reject that teaching on behalf of a broader teaching that morality now in compasses sexual relationships of all sorts per ticularly sexual relationships without any potentual whatsoever for the creation of human life asper the l g b t ku pluss minust vida by sinagenda is the media really accurately reporting what the pope said what did he actually say what his defenders say that yo reallychange nothing according to the catholic publicationtho pilloquoe toducia supplicans which is the name of this publication says clearly the vatican does not intends permit same sex marriage or anything that resembles it and says that the church does not actually have the power or authority to do that while the text does creat a framework for blessing ga couples it says that those blessings should not be confused with marriage or even with approval of same sex unions or homosexual activity faducia supplicans says that blessings are quote a pastoral resource to be value rather than a risk or proble and that they may be bestowed upon those persons who quote although in a union that cannot be compared in any way to a marriage desired to intrust themselves to the lord and his mercy to invoke his help and to be guired guided to a greater understanding of his plan of love and trute such blessings ought not to be given in any circumstance resembling a sanctification of same sex unions says the vatican and quote there is no intention to legitimize anything furthermore says the document the blessing ought to descend on those who quote do not claim a legitimation of their own status but who bag that all that is true good and humanly valid in their lives in their relationships be enriched heald and elevated by the presence of the holy spirit is there any reason for the controversy of nothing change i mean there is the documen itself suggest the blessings should not be quote subjected to too many moral prerequisites and that priest ought not to lose pastoral charity which should permeate all our disisions in attitudes and to avoid being quote judges only deny reject and exclude furthermore the document does not make clear whether the church will in fact cract down onlet churgical blessings its is not approve in the document the pope in other words is being vag and otherse are supposed to clean up after him which which tends to be the way on fortunately pope francis works a lot my friend lario conner catholic has a good run down of his interpretation vaaties missive heareswhat he rate quote i am not in full communion with the church as such i am required to abstain from partaking in the ucharist at mass i walk up to the altar with my arms crossed on my chest andthe residing plete priest ffers me a blessing he is not blesing the situation i am in that keeps me from being in communion with the church he is offering me a priestly blessing i can continue my faith journey and move forward closer to cristis bye my situation this exactly what the vatican has confirmed the passers may do for individuals ho have same sex attraction and are also not in full communion with the church because of their situation but is that all the pope is doing because lary is not approaching the altar as a member of a samsextu couplies not walking up their laries divorce is not walking up with his second wife to gether with her to receive a blessing as a couple according to laric he is approaching individually of course religions should offer blessings to sinners while hating their sin of course every one is a sinner this is true in judiousiment just as it is true ind cathalicism or procentism everyone is a sinner and if sin or what barred you fom receiving a blessing no one could receive a blessing but when a same sex couple approaches a priest for a blessing as a same sex couple the distinction starts to fall away hes again they are not approaching individually and asking for blessing individually while being a sinner the idea is that the church knows they are same sex couple an they are proaching for a blessing as a same sex couple and then theyare receiving a blessing as a same sex couple the popier is not allowing blessing for indiviguals who participate in same sex unions that was already the case every traditional religion allows sin eres to receive blessings individually far as i'm aware instead the vatican is apparently now green lighting blessing same sex couples as couples then pretending it does not mean anything long as the blessing is not in outright sanctification of the same sex relationship now that is clearly how the left is reading it the reverend james martin of radical left win catholic sex qe this new declaration opens the doors who nomle trurgical blessings for same sex couples something that had previously been off limits for bishop's prec and deacons of all with many breeks i will now be delighted to bless my friends in same sex unions why oght we to care now'm not a catholic but here is the thing we ought to care because when historical pillars of western tradition including natural all begin to carve away at those pillars in the name of tolerance and diversity when they throw open to dors of the church by getting rid of quarpt prinsciples or by crumbling those cuart principles the entire edifice starts to wear away and the state problem for religious believers of all traditional stripes is not restrictes the catholic church s should not be read as justac cretie of the pope it is not uneats cathalsis its happening in judism ts happening in protestantism on the same day the pope issued his statement celebrated by the nar times the eyork times issued another piece about the collapse of the united methodist church riven by controversi over el g b t k pluss minis divided by signe issues as the time describes quote at issue for methodis is the question of ordaining and marrying el g b t k people a topic that is splintered many other protestant denominations and which methodis have been ebating for years there are eight million methodist in the united states in twenty twenty according to the us religion sensus between large scalle departures and the broader train of dhe cline according to one sorce that number tcould drop by half in decate the exidus marks a calamitous decline for the broad er tradition of mainline protestantism which ones dominated the american religious social and cultural landscape and here in lies the biggest problem of all there is no substitute for traditional religion in the american landscape or indeed in the western landscape more broadly and traditional religion requires skin in the game it requires rules it requires behavioral restrictions it requires people to actually believe in a moral system above their own subjective morality the minute religion becomes merely a non judge mental blessing tumped on top of subjective self glorification religion is no longer valuable and when religion loses its value church crumbles and when church crumbles social society crumbles and then we are relegated to the surgeon general of the united states the vake merthy lecturing us as dancing unicorns hound out prescriptions for social connection herein lies the problem when church dies does the united states it is why every one feels chaotic these days non to kno by the way why theres arising conspiracies theories on everyside the isle these ads is because when you do not trust in god you start believing there has to be some other conspiracy responsible for why the world works the way that the world works when you believing god it makes ve ry easy to tellcat i do not understand what th hllse going on here about there is some one who does but when you do not believing god or when you fear that god may not be in charge then you start believing that a small codray of human beings are capable of manipulating a pends to the and degree and then you find those human beings than y blame those human beings and this allows you to believe in any form of conspiracy theory and that is a real problem because once you start believing in those sorts of theories you cannot have a functional democracy or functional republic along those lines does not mean there are not conspiracies that are true but when people start believing evidence free conspiracies when every thing that happens the sign of a broader conspiracy of which you have no evidence that is really a problem exs a means you cannot trust any outcome every outcome is now inherently untrustworthy and that is a real danger for the country i can meanwhile jobidon has at record approval ratings in the twenty twenty four election according to a bran new poll from monmouth university he is now town thirty four per cent sixty one per cent of those poll disapprov of the job that bidin is doing his president twent with the twenty twenty four presidential lection now les than a your way accoring to medite andthes are really horrifyingly bad numbers for jobdon cats a twenty four per cent approval rating among independence this puts him

make e case to jobidin that the reason tha he is losing popularities because he is not left toing enough which is in a hesing case to make i'm to have the president who spent more money than any president in american history here is en b s interviewing young voters for tunning way from bidin and naturally if you interview all the crazy young people an meant nt look at these people i me my

loses the reason jobidan is going to lose if you loses because gan lose those independent voters in the middle again he as perceived as the moderate alternative to trum in twenty twenty he is no longer perceived as a moderate alternative to trump and hits can be particularly true if the economy continues to basically stag ar along now the entire meedia are invest in the idea that we have now avoided recession that the economy is booming everything is going amazingly while the washington post has an entire peace hat the top of their rebsite today titled every one expected recesion the fed and white house found a way out wow amazing sure we have had complete wage stagnation in the country for last three youars sure everything cost a bagulian dollars more than it did just a couple of years ago but they avoided a recession technically now actually they did not if you recall last your ratually did have a couple of consecutive quarters of negative growth which technically qualifies his recession but if the idea hears that were avoiding a gigantic procession in favor of oboma esk stagnation for a long period of time that probably true and that stagnation ise going to get worse because there are a fe economic factors that cut in favor of the idea that the stock market for example is actually ahead of where the federal reservice illget to that in just one second we need to ramp up our efforts to save the lives of innocent babes i cannot stress this enough because of our partnership with preborn in organization dedicated to saving the lives of the unborn we can do just

already meanwhile the biding administration there again i still think economically speaking their their whistling past thegraveyard the inflation stats have come dow they have come down meges lot of supply chains have now been restored the supply chane problem was in facting mass of contributing factor to inflation bid one lying about that now you add an on top of that with records spending into an acconomy that had two fe goods flowing through it and as the supply chance of open back up the number of goods has risen and it is moving toward meeting the amount of money that is flowing through the system however they because of their cowardly forn policy they are now experiencing the possibility of serious problems on the supply chain again that as happening in the sues canow according to the wallstery journal thou us unvailed a multi national naval force to protect merchan vessels in the red sea after who the rebel attacks threatened the sues canal central rulling lobal trade on

the hothes the oil crin be p on monday was the latest company to halt its tankers from sailing through the red s now for for all the people who ten to believe that form pollicy has no impacked on how you live our life that obviously is untrue things get wa more expensive when these ses are not free for trade let us be rial about these the economic development of the past couple centuries and a half thas been due in large part to two main factors first the british on pira nd control the seas and second the american navian control of the seas tou be in order if those two things do not happen you can forget about your cheap goods at the stor you can forget about being able to afore all nice things you can afford i know there is this beard take out there that somehow forn policy does not affect you in anyway or tht your life would be significantly better if you did not have sheaper goods available to you i'm just wondering how that is thet tis o this strange idea that our lives on a material level forget about a spiritual level on a material level are somehow not better thanthey were in nineteen eighty is ridiculous on every possible level you have a bigger house than you did in nineteen eighty you have more divices than you did in nineteen eighty you ro ley ave central air youn have that in nineteen eighty you probably have a much better parer than you did in nineteen eighty all of that is because of supply chains economics is not a simple case of its separate from foreign policy it requires free movement of goods and services across bodle nect trade lanes the red sea is one such trade lane the babo manub strait is one such trade lings as canal is a trade lane ti'me on straits our trade lane all these places are tradlingsthes are hot points that can absolutely crush you at the super market if they are not guaranteed by a western navy and the reality tht the united states is only now starting to sail commabel il scortsome ships through the baboman of strade or what ever it as again that is going to have some pretty significant knock on effacts if the rd sea becomes no goes one from most tankers according the walsterturnal t would redraw the global oil market for the second time in two years after the ware on you crane and related sanctions force russia to find new markets for its patroleum that could send oil prices andtankorades vaulting higher according to richar matthews reserch trector at e gipson shipbrokers its all you knows it is cn a cause chaos everythings can get lot more expensive as a monday morning matthews had most tankor companies were still willing to send their vessels through the shipping chopoint preventing a jrumpin prices but if the whoothies continue their attacxk in these particular areas then things are going to get worse now they are two ways to prevent those attax in in these areas it is really only one way they have the only way to prevent the attaxinairs by blowing the pirates out of the water that is grow the only way to do that because yeu in pretend that if you should run away from the area that matically terrors scrups are not going to then attempt to do the same thing and grab money and ransom these ships for example but that is not true 'me glad thetde by administration as always late is attempting to do something about this butt again cowardly foreign policy ends with much much worse economic circumstances for american tax payrs and ye add on to that the fact that we are about to enter into the ar of big taxes and the weak foreign policy high tax economy of the united states which is very reminiscent o the nineteen seventies it is nok gon to be grates nineteen seventies ere time are we had over spend and we decided to receed on foreign policy and the commination of those two factors led to much higher prices at home a led to a stagnating economy an leds people in gas lines that could come back fairly easily according tote wallstregernal rich countries are raising more money from tax pairs than they have in decades to finance a burst of state spending as surging interestrates make borrowing less attractive tax revenues have risen to record levels is a share of economic output in a number of mature economies including france capan and south corea the increases are with hundreds of billions of dollars and additional revenue for governments they are navigating in array of new spending needs from military priorities to industrial policy goverments continue to spend tand ord to keep up that spending they are going to have to increase the tax revenue in order to do that they can have to jack up the taxes it is something that jobidon has on to do for quite a while now the united states has been able to rely on the fact that we are still the best bet on the block when it comes to our debt because we are till thestrongest economy they are woll come appoint when that is no longer true in fact we are fast approaching that point when no ones can one actually buy ou es tat becuse the possibility that down the bere no can a shou repay that that oregan in flate our way out of it and that means increases in taxes in the twenty nation eurozon according o the whilestrternal government spendig will reach half of the regions economic output this year according to the iamef in the united states state spending stands at thirty eight per cent of g d p in the entire gep pea the country the contry is now spending thirty eight per cent of that on sociael serviceis and tuch new closts are coming down the tracto because the contry and th west are gtting older we have baked into the cake extraordinary mand to tory spending programs and yhe nlway pay for that is to increase the taxes in try to grow your way out of it er not gonen grow your way out of it given the policies the regulatory an business policies pursued by this administration if you do not grow your way out of it then youre nocamel payferin in the stuff without radically raising taxes or ratically in flating the currency or both and the federal reserve knows this by the way right now the stock mark is th litle but disconnected from the federal reserve the federal reserve announce the otheir day that they were not going to be raising the interest rates and this was taken is a sign that inflation has been defeated in the united states in the federaleserve knows it and pretty soon hre gust art lowering those interest rates whichwill ake it easier to get a morgage shoall make a crediccard rates go down and all the rest of people gett very enthusiastical heat will take that money o put it right back in the stock market that is ken on thy basic idea but the problemis people are doing that now in anticipation of the fed lowering theintrest rates there sho little bit ahead of the market at this point as mohomedal arian is saing mohomedael arian is an excellent finantial analist he is saying that if right now people are expecting the fad to lower the intrestrats an they do not lower te interest rates in the next year as much is expected the stock market will drop again jobitons economy is on tenter hooks because of many systemic probis created over the cource of decades and then exascerbated by jobidn now again as we mention a moment a go some of that exassurbation is being driven by events in the midle east now the best way to guarantee the freedom of the season at eleast is to not let pirates push around histo not let the aronians push around in the region and one ofthe best ways do not let the aronians push o around in the region is that when one of the aronian proxy groups comits the worst terror attack since nine eleven you let in the ally of the united states completely destroy that terrogroup there be an excellent way to throw aron off of this to push them back to contain them to speak without going directlly to war with them cutting off the arms of the octo pusif you are not willing to go directly at the head israel for its part wants to do exactly that right now israel is attempteng to push another aranian prox oug cause balaw off their northern border they want to prevent another conflict the one that is curently happening according to oxios israel told the byn administration wants cuse belas forces to be pushed roughly six miles from the border as part of a diplomatic deal to en tentions with lebanon the bih administration is deeply concerned that esclating border skirmishes could lead to an all out war that would be even worse than the gosic conflict in tat of course is true but if israel's force intwa worth casbalaw israel is not can hole back israel is holding back in goza they are that is why they have got out a hundred an thirty one dead soldiers over the cours of the last couple of months in the gazistrip that is is not going to apply in nerena wor has blo is far better armed and has rockets capable of reaching the entirity of israel hes rally governments has publicly that in order to allow his raily citizens to go back to their homes the situation us to change either through dediplumacy or military action attentions on the border with lebonon were oe of the main issues under discussion between secretary defence loid austin and is railly primnistern its now who administer defence yuov gallans in tell of eve they want his belod not to be alowed to go back to their positions allong the boarder which israel destroyed in the last couple of months again israel they have thirty thousand citizens wer culnely nowleving their homes are not going to allow this to continue the way that it is but one of the preconditions to solid form policy is not wishcasting form policy unfortunately the united states seems to be in the weird position of being half realist in half wishcasting t's on the realist side loid austin yesterday he was in israel an he said he is not here to dictate time lines to the israely government regoing time line is is isreals a piy and that here to dictake time ine or turn ar support er to israel's right to tefend itself is im tlie is you heard me san ta er time in tha miman tane it is critical is i satewayer that hav not amas and that be able to threaten israel a from gaser or even threaten gasin any more o abet then loyd austin starts his wishcasting says commass does not speak for the palistonian people not why does this matter in matters because there is this weird idea that is prevalent in american form policy circles that the palicinian authority run by abumazen machmudabas who is in actual holicost denying terror supborter his actual government has law that pays people who kills jus right now there is this weird idea that the palcinan authority which enjoys an extraordinarily low approvalrating in the westbank where it has governed tyrannically for the last twenty years abumazen is now in the seventeenth year of a fore your term the hav an held nelection in seventeen years and f alachnwer helded ahamaso win in the westbank this idea requires is ral to then make concessions to eranian proxies thet will en macmase the power again do not wish casform policy folks it tobad mistake here is ot loid austin to inxtjus that hamas is still holing hostages including american citizens ham in bes iself an ha itself by inmisen palistandian soviage hamas is not speak for the palistanian people anmamas ist it termin to don both is raalios and

subscribed he meanwhile on the other side of the il donald trump running a campaign against chiproy i do not and now we can have to bring back tood trump bad trump because that is just the reality of trump sometimes he says good thing and sometimes he says bad things well yesterday he dessid once again attack chiproy one o tmose conservatiov members of the house re publican at cawkis he said has any smart and energetic republican in the great state of texas decided to run in the primary gainst rhynno congress men shiproy for the right person heis very people if interested let me know ges just be very clear chiproy is one f he bust congress people in america he is an excellent congress person deeply conservative he is one ofthe people who pride consections away from cavmac carthy s if you light those concessions thank chiproy chip is again an excellent thinker super conservative donal trump does not him because he did not go along with the idea that donal trump one the twenty twenty lection he still pisset about it and by the way this is really stupid when i say it stupid i mean ot his technically stupid the primary ballot is not open it is too late to get on the primary ballat against shiproy at seven days after the tecas primary filing dedline past and which is yand tweeding things or putting things down on truth social does not manifest them in the world now this should be a point of annoyance for lot of conservatives it really should but the biggest problem is that again conservatives they basically trust trump they watched him be president for four years the polices that he promoted we are pretty conservative and the have learned to baselly discount anything that he says on truth social which means that the're not a lot of amazing lines of attack by his opponents in the republican primaries against him ron to santus is line of attack was going to be ion more trustworthy as a conservative an the best conservative governor of your lifetime and all of that is true but if the base in love of trust from the conservatave public is very high for trump very hard to outflank him that way this seems to be te santis continued message and again in primary primary held today i vote for tosantus over trump an haley but to santis ow this line of attack is not going to be fruitful against donald trump he says trump could pardon non violent ganuaris ix protestors he chose not to out puring donald trump is not going to work what is interesthing on on the coul gauwher sex protest o man ke he called that rally knowing that that was gen to bein d see were wore things could get pettentually out o hand and he is now saying he would do climant se for that i woul guess the non viway am the bineont he could have don that when he was president he could have said look this was he could ha taken responts o bility he could have said that the people that went not the violent people oviesly that the te pri the pren it is a bord of a different further but on the people that were there just as protestors an cat a got caught up and he could hae granda climant seat of th am and he chose not to because o thin ke was told that if he did that he could pefectually rist being convicted that tis set oit in pakecontrel of the idea that now he is going to help people that were railroad ad he could have done that before he left office agaso desansis is totally correct about all this of course but that is assuming that the conserve republic is deeply interested in trumps policy positions which they are not meanwhile de sansis turning his guns on nickey haley and he saying that she exemplifies everything the trump supporters oppose which again is weird because she was the youan ambassador under trump very pro trump throughout his administration she sliped floped down from a little bit post his ad ministration he is not wrong about this again if you look at the poles trump supporters are likely to shift if tosan sec its thrace they are not likely thifto haley tesantis they the dessansis is voters would move over to trump in al likelihood which is again why both of these candidates are very unlikely to to defeat trump in the nomination fiht just speaking technically and looking at the poles right now but here as desansis going after nickey haley yesterday she is not get a win a re publican primary it she is there to do is to take some boats from people who do not want trump and really i think in sure that trump has a better path ought to be able to go interestingly donold trumpso trumps corse upporters do not haley because everything they claim there agance establish man globel is om liberal wall street don ers not on and on that that is haley right and yet when trump is assed can you categorically a rule out her is vice president he will not rule her out as vice president now again he is right about all this but is that line of attackin a bare fruit probly not new hampshire where again nicky haley is is now in second place by pretty significant margion o beinteresting see what happens in i when meanwhile haley's angle on trump continues to be ththes too old and maybe that lineworks a little bit better but the reality is that he is going up against jobidn his dead some not ure that line workseth this is the bigest problem the most plausible line agains trump from december twenty twenty two was he loses elections a wat and because he lose election's lot you do not want to lose the upcoming election but nobody was able to jump in in time to capture that message before bidon started sinking enough in the bulls that now trom his beating him in virtually of repol here is nickey haley going after o going after donald trump yesterday now a clear second place nicky haley has behind trump in the first thin the nation primary state and on the heels of those naing donvers she is also launching an new ad not heating at her republican rivals but right at president by that i'll jusfa minto tomeie aiin narsin oin a manlasin cinfrom yeterday cannot mead ai tomorrow we man tum menal comaan a realan ta an re stor r r con o his obviously's an adigans bit is not realy nat agins bidn it is really much more about trumbrime she is running in's trump in a primary when she says too old what she realy means a trump is that likely to end with trump not winning the nomination again i'm not seeing a lot of fruitful line of attacks against trump at this point in the race just technically speaking but trum is also not held to any of the same rules is noral politicians he is literally out their tacking one ofte best congress people in america right now an conservers m i'm not i wish i know it to doabout that i i honestly do not know the answer meawhile democraso not to t about trump either tere just going with the trumpis hitlerisin again te douglas brinkly he is out there doing this rotine thi siging o be them all the way up til they election as i say and let me to say something no one in america things trumpet tiller no one thinks less andthere may be some crazes left us tho believe this in reality here is a colum ant that washington post yesterday the pointod this out people ask hou look at trump's policies and what he says on policy in they he seems kind f a confused moderate mik greally conservatives no that he did a lot of conservative things but most people are pretty disconnected from politics and here is what donald trump has said on major issues major controversial issues a he is set on abortion do not knowhat to do about it will come to a universally consentis which is a con qualt moderate position is not a prolife position a he is said when it comes to things gint an teimpe now genn tatch them u terraaban grup buand ho unetat i'm nat tat gi man dieman re that that is acuunc moderate position when it comes to el go be teku plus minnis bie by sentisshus i ca len geri can use the girs bathorom tat they vine in they duncan i every hopbutan issue trump has takin a quasy moderate position he is not in fact a hard core conservative and also when people staks an authoritarian that is a suming a level of compitence that he is not demonstrated in being in authors firkin zo this kenno crat from douglas brinkly is not going to wor get to that in just one secon first if the audion engineer fel it is typically not filled with joy and laughter our audo engineer mi cormina no exception i've askd him to cher up for i know 's beenalmost a decated this point he is he is not going to listen he is just going to remain as dowr as ever but we love mit

trump must lose because he is an authoritarian and we do not authoritarians exceptfor when jobidns using his pen in his phone to try to mansat that eighty million people take of accination or lose their jobs and then then they authoritarians or when they tri to just by did not of executive order get rid of hundreds of billions o dollars in to loaned at and then the sprimcourts has now and then they do it anyway which the thing that is literally happening right now they still been dispersing funs i'm not getting in violation of supreme court ruling that matter the real authoritarians are people donald trump again look at that truth social and tell me the what you are looking here is it what you sing here is a burgenting mousilinear hitler wo got is truth social do you does not know how to capitalize right guys he miss spells basic words lik ot when he was president of the united states his authoritarianism a mounted to him saying things on twitter that he then did not do but dis noton t be there entitling no one thing sound trumpets this scary seriously i'm sirrylic even people hartrart suggesting that january six was a massive crisis level event for the t not just an ugly horrible thing that happen which igree ugly horrible bad images of people swarming t capital bilding hurting police officers andall the rast that was not an excistential crisis for the united states not remotely was much it dolts and some people who art in good faith there and wandering the halls who held up the proceegertflike to ours and then that was it but there still going with the trump pitler thing here who is that which has invaded a national body especially the strong an flos a forne plod that is fa myn com as at historiantad what in't you here and the fellow presents remarks i

who buies this seriously doesnhm by this meanwhile ady loud doing the simrotinan i'msemd you see i massend me see the trumpet hitler channel is they say the trumpis tapping into longstanding illiberal tradition again hearing people on the left talk about illiberal traditions as they simultaneously shut down for speech on campases tell people that they are not alowed ued byological pronouns use the power of the pen and the ethephone to you whatever they damn wuld well please im im i'm having some trouble squaring the circle here remember not see lawyers in the nineteen thirty is actually looking

there is n extraordinary not serally par wat trop has done he is tapped in to a long standing illiberal tradition in the united states and is exploiting it we need to see the newness of it but also

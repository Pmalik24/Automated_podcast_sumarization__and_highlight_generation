the benchverishorsponser by express vipian privece's a right don a privilege defendyau right t express epianzacam slashmen why precisely is their a caukis in the united states congress that openly sympathizes and lies on behalf tay jew hating genicitl terrorist group that is the question that should be on the lips of every american to day after washing reshite to leab the elected congress woman from michigan leadin insurrection as protest into a congress building in solidarity with commass to le dispeneher entire political career hating jews she has rutinely acquated jews defending themselves from comassterrism with commasterrorism she rutinely denounces israel as an apartide state but has never founded in her heart to condemn either comass or hesballah according to the lashington free beacon to leb has ties to a pro palestine actves to praised cusbala for attacking quote asreel to leeb has met repeatedly with a mischcan base newspaper publisher who claims cesbala has made lebonon safer to ive to leabs campaign bunglers have pushed anti israel and proterrorous views another to leab ally salisarsuer has been accused of financin comass through front groups in the nineteen nineties according to api documents sarsuer and official at the aslomic society of malauki organized fundrazers for s leab and both twenty eighteen and twenty twenty abas cami day a palsinian actviss who cheered that quote cesbala slaughtered ausreel attended to leabs two thousand nineteen swearing in in short it is no mystery where reshita to leab stans she stands with commas and other genicitl anti jewish terro groups she made that even clearer this week when she issued no denunciation of comass specifically for their masscr of fifteen hundred jews instead blaming their anti jewish pagrom on american funding of israel's quotin quot a partie government and then yesterday to leav promoted a blood libel as we talked about an yesterday show on tuesday a failed paliston in hislomichy hodrocket landed in a parking lot next to a hospital comas promptly lied and blame the iserailies and claimed five hundred dead the claim was quickly dubunk by rate our data vidiodata an audiodata thin matter the entire media ran with it but shere is what resheted to leab staid yesterday after the de bunking at a procomas rally at the capital continue to watch people thinit oka tabama hospital t enoa sometimes it watchin otidiot an anli gisdo cri ci ersno er e c ta concinued no all of that was a lie bit not a shocking lie because to leap supports terris she has done consistently throughout her career she openin calls for the eradication of the jewish state supporting instead what she calls a secular one state out come which would of course devolve inton is lamic state she has never at any point expressed to any discontent about the presence of some fifty five is lomic states on the planet of course and yet the media have treated toleib is a great lite bringer the nurtimes magazine ran a glowing piece about to leab and twenty twenty two explaining in breathless terms quote she changed these rayly palestininto bat ing congress by reminding her collegues of the human stakes it is a burden she would rather not carry toleb is not the only member of the comas caucas of course ilhin omar is a founding member toleib she pareds comas talking points down to the lie that israel bom the hospital she to leib is a supporter of the called boy costovast sanctions movement that seeks the extermination of the tate o israel she believes that israel quote hypnotize the world she blames republican support for israel on the benjamins peroting the notion that jews pay off congress people to support israel she combered israel comas and the talaban to one another and yet democrats continued to avoid directly condemning either to leib or omar meanwhile other atrunc members of the comos caukas continued to gaincredibility in democratic circles in shune of this year nine democrats including the venerable alexandra o cozo cortess voted against a resolution in congress declaring that israel is quote not erashistorapartite state and stating that the united states will quote always be astaunch partner and supporter of israel the eight other democrats include gamal boman summerle cory bush ondra carson telluramer as ianocressley and promiligiapol aose of course wept openly on the floor of the house when the house passed funding to re arm israel's defensive iron dome that is right she cried in front of the cameras because israel was being given funding for defensive weaponry to shoot down rockets aimed jewish civilian areas why does the democratic party have such tough time dissociating from its terr suporting nembers why d they suddenly suffer from a tute amnesio when asked even condemn their comments the answer is obvious too many democrats have invested too much in a political strategy that is deeply dependint on a single lie that there is in interosectional coalition of the oppresed that must be united in order to tear down the roote institutions of a corrupt western society in this view be alem is the same as comas is the same as the democratic socialist of america is the same as the ratical elgib tiku plusminas dividabasin movement all oure necessary cogs in a machine designe to wreck the west in the name of the called marginalized a machine design to tear down the supposed hierarchy dominated by white mal christions now for a long time many the liberal jewish community thought they could be part of this club after all have not jews been historically victimized are not theyaminority now they were wrong of course it turns out that the jews are too white and too disproportionately successful for the liking of the intersectional coalition in this view is will be golberg one said even the holicos was merely white on white crime and when commas terroris murder jewish babies well that is just decolonization the democratic party cannot throw out the comas caukas without also recognizing the failure of its new cors ideology if it turns out that dis proportionate poverty and failure among certain groups is not the result of western civilization itself or some evil white hierarchy that comos can be rown and poor and also evil tand that their evil is not the result of supposed jewish colonization or exploitation well that would under mine the entire colitional strategy and that cannot be allowed now the democratic party does have another road they could simply make the case for left toen policies on their own merits on the basis of redistributof fairness or efficiency but they probably will not they stake too much in their intersectional future to toss out the terror supporters and they will likely continue to promotes the comosquawkets and shu hatred will grow an the collapse of the west will eccelerate and second will show you the insurrectionist activity at a capital building that will probably not result in long prison sentences four protestors because of course they are left wing procomas activis will get to that momentarily first last month tha ge twenty announce to plan to impose diginal

it is certainly is not five hundred we we certainly know who fire the rocket according to both american intelligence and israliintelligence and rate our data and audiodata and visual data we know exactly what happened here tere shetitly bwent and she lide to an entire crowd and then that crowd proceeded too e sentially overrun the cannon office building that is a house office building that is located just a few yards from the capital building a to lead for her part she asn't ansering any questions she ran away from reporters when she was confronted about the fact that she was lying openly about the bommbing of the hospital she just ran away because that is what she does because she is a most terras she is an atural coward wel the procomss protestors mobbed at the capital here is some of the footage of the protestors mobbing the capital again it is all good peaceful rioting when it is when it is people of the left when it is people supporting terrast groups they are occupying government buildings that is okay that is f a way this works anv you are a january six rioter or you are ust an old grandmother wanders into the capital building under the weardness impression tha youwere allowed to be in there on januar six you might get a few years in prison however if you' deliberately storm a capital office building which is eilegal and then you occupy it then that apparently is totally fine kind of fine i'm i'm eager to see how it turning general merrit garland decides to deal with the hundreds of people who 're actually arrested because of this particular event look at the size of this crowd here is a giant crowd of terrace and their fellow travellers and useful idiots marching toward the capital office building the cannon house office building hat is a big crowd of people who really terrace right here in the united states always very encouraging again none of those people will actually condemicomants none of them in fact they have posters reading decolonize what ethink decolonize means have they been shy about this decolonized means killed the jews that is what it means hey ben absolute clear about this what come o stat according to this crowd is they began the prosts of de colonization by wiping out jewish babies and small vilages hats they did by by by literally i've seen the photograph and teyo evidence o more of at yesterday nit con a sha tea today but it is there certainly y confinin on line of them pulling bodies out of wreckage that have been tied together with bailing wire and then and then murdered yet that the that is decolonization though and there is lots this sort of footage of these these evil protesters who have decided to take over the the cannon hat house office building here some of them what happened when they when tey went into the office building again you areyou are most to loth metal detactors and actually but but apparently it is totally find occupied buildings now again when you are democrat can get away with anything or when you'r democratisociat a thethey they got a bunch of useful idiot quasy jews why take quasy jews i mean thse people maybe ethnically jewish but they have about as much association with judiism as em as a hamshandwich does an i met my favorate part of the vidios of the of the not in ar name psudo jews who are wh are joining this particular movement i do lof it when there is bidyo of people who are supposed to be looking jewish and then hey just completely misweare the guar bitswen my favorite things t's a lot of them are wearing what are alled tolla shim it the tolly theyyou seen pictures of orthodox jews that ring what loks a prayer shawl right itto prayershawl hese more ons were a cantake loft becas thy've no idea what they'r doing no shock there they are useful idiots on behalf of terrace this is the least of their problem the comoss protestors took over the cannon house office building a rests we are made i will say i do take a a bit of glee in the way tese a rests go down i mainly because im if you are going to go and do a criminal thing and then you get arrested and then this ise your reaction a ya youre real tough gy until the momen you get arrested this particular protest are getting arrested for occupying a a house office building seems to have eaten a raw holopenio at the same time that he was arrested yetit tuf stuff there and there are these morons shouting at people not in our name now who is asking for anything to be done in your name i gan what they ma my free free palestine is not free th gas a thred i've come os they do not

are not they are the they are not hiding the ball this is the part dstrites me absolipawall the unbelievable gas lihting where people keep saying over and over and over outloud exactly what they want and then the entire western media pluss the bydministration less totally not what they want none no there are nocomas supporters in the gos stript none they do not exist they'r re wonderful westerners we have just ben dominated by small group of evil terrists which is weards thas absolutely not wht's happening and these protestors there they are not in favor of homaskys they are just in favor ofor palestoni an state sure they say they want o completely destroy israel an su're not a single one of them we will go on camera condemning comasit for it for its attacks or as an organization but what they really what they really wants and the projection of you are own thoughts and wishes into people who up who believe truly evil things continues to be a source of amazement to me prokomas protestors also try to climbarriers outside the white house si was exciting yesterday th no ae trying you ahondement little insurrection i happening it there i n'tknowhat they thin they are going to do whonce they get over that fence other then go to jail but the gengenious level stuff from our prokomas crowd here in the united states procoms protestors also invaded us enat hearing there is seny here ind going on they decided to i go tothe senate building and disturb the senate hearing that would be a legal right that is disturbing the functional workings of government i was told by all the

smecu from seriously no play my jue card here you no no i do not i do not believe your crenantials you'r crinantials ar garbage you ot them from the bottom of a cracker jack box i demon strated from the main floor and from several balconies singing praying holding signs and banners in chanting seeze fire now close to three hndred people were in costody more than three hours after the rally inside thecongressional office building began three have been charge with asalt on police officer during processing according to the police this seems i if the rules apply for the goose they ply for the ganner i expect that some o these people will be hld in solitary confinement and then i expect that some of tem will go to jo for prolong periods of time aftr all we are told that tese are threats to the re public i not hereis here is a question where are the democrat's blasting the fomoss cakus seriously whys re sheud it is leave stone congress she mixbeld it seems to me that supporting terrorists 'sprig o reason to expel a member of congress it ise lik a fairly obvious one why exactly should you be alowed to sit in the halls of congress if you support a terrorist group come oss work cas bellaw as we shoul its leave obviously does where is the democratic party in all this where are all the top level democrats sang anythin insteadwhat they are doing is many f them are sang proisral things andthen their pretending to they that reshuted 's leave does not exist until it' time to pose with her on the cover of a magazine sthey can show the strength of the intersectional coalition shuckshumer thse senet majority leader he correctly said yesterday that the world blame d israel un fairly or the hospital bombing here a strucktumer but of course he is had nothing to say over the course of years about any of his collegues inside the democratic party who support terrorism it is strucksumer by the way who also help usher thr rue the garbage arondil pushed by the abomi administration that help strengthin aron two strength in the hand of comass for this attack in the first place struction ere voted against the deal but only after giving permisstion to memberse of his own cakast tvoin favor of the arondil anyway here is truck shumer we e was inis no there is there is who e otyis ulys that the ron of course was not o is you but rer was o wo os i os wosmass this los rus o is i e in e staten egas te wi ai a wonk of the truth mors immediately sid o the o th id en wy ie no ors isrs wo ly iso erly o the wors ann in te woas i i oo well i mean that is true it wuld be great if you speak up against the terrae members of your own cawkis or terrar supporting members of your own cakas by the way won my favorite things about the all these demonstrations is that this this is now a realities havpen all the tines up last night i spoke of the university of flora about this topic there is a pro comass rally outside members my team went ou there wit cameras to ask people if they could describe what their engul is the map of israel and the palstinian authority occupied areas in the comasac byt airies inthe gosestrip and thit dok i want you to explain to me which part of this ought to be palistine none of them wuld answer the questions and that is because people are now being told do not talk to the media because you might in invertenltly show that your genicidle which presumably is why for example pro palistine demonstrators according to the daily caller gathered outside the white house on monday refusing to denounce come oss the daily callers tul gibbons asked one man why he was at the protest he started covering up his face people's people refuse to answer questions to seems to me if your hae a protest you should be able to answer questions about your protesting for that is the purpose of a protest but to not according to these folks because we all know why there a the protest the answers at they supporta terrace group you mite ce dam hamas i cannot do that no one condemns violence but the same time what else it pusses whatelse he wants to do i approof of any one the fight for the freedom i'm sasting tupin down the ttats a why o antaa ta itis rally savenge atags on gadsan were ther literaly bombing thousands of babies in the hamas fiters or under ground not bei tuch can you explain to me why is rail is bobbing thousands of babies as we speak and you explain that to me i do not i do not o o ten o mo not t afai es not a fan which much tem are you afando on which team are you afano yet zo i'm the answer to his question is the reason that israel has beenbobing these targets with as much precision as it can is to kill as many commos terraces a can the reality is that if israel would do what what israel needs to you re nounce pon the tunnels can the tunnels are all lookate forty fe underground israel does have the ordinance to do that they'v bee refrai ning from doing that because comass will mot alow civilians to be cleared from the area it is the exact reason commoss wone to las civilians to be cleared from the area isrel has been trying to get this vilians out of these areas 's they can bom the terror tunnels before they have to send i's raily men and women into these areas to fight hand to hand with terras well being shot at by civilians by sudo civilians many of whom are located in these parts of the gazastrip that is the reality on a military level what israel actually neds to dos destroy the tunnels before it goes in but because comasses hiding civilians on top and they have the sympathy of the world media they understand thet israel cant even kill the terrorists that is the whole plan to turn this thing into veit nom for israel that if israel goes in it turns in to black hawk down that is the entire goal that isthe entire goal that is why comasis keeping cilians up there ts why civilians are dying right now and just one second we will get to the intersectional coalition which again continues to be quite robust even if it means backing terrism get's that first every hollowin parents are worn about theptential dangers in kid's candy now a lot of that is exaggerated but thepotential dangers you encounter everyday in the meat isle is truly spooky lab grown meat is growing more more popular it is no unusual for foreign meet to be libled as product of the united states you on't really know what is an thatstuff fortunately my friends to god ranhers have made it their mission to change all of that this howling good ranchers is taking the trick out of their meat and thy are throwing ina treat for my liztrs thirty bucks offyour orderd with brummocoachipero at good ranchers dot com the number one place to get america's best pork beef chicken and seefuly delivered is with good ranchers their products are transparently source all american and delitious when you shop if good ranchers ot commun ough to question wha'sin your mate because again it is guaranteed one hundred percent american take the mystery out of th metile this it good ranchers tot tom use mycoshiper to get thirty bucks off with free express shipping i know the quality of teir product because they made me their only cotre stack in wis spictacula it is cod shippero for thirty buck off your baks at good ranchers that com american meats delivered again go checked am out right now good ranchers tot com use t my promacochipera and get thirty bucks off with free express t shipping the best meat in america to day okay the intersectional colition everybody understands that what it is holding it together is hatrid of the supposed power hierarchy that is what this is 't understands thes comas here is a flash back twenty twenty one here is the had of comass tactually it is yaya sinjoar condemning american racism now what what wise it is happening why the answer of course is because he is attempting to draw a kinship between black people in america and palsinian arabs living under the tyrrannical rule of comass but not because the palsing arabs living under the trannic rull of of commass are being apress by comass y know becaue israel is the great oppressor and iit is the coalition of the dis possessed nonsense and by the way this is exactly how many organizers for black live's matter talk about the palcinian issue they suggest the black americans are living under the boot heel of the evil white american raceis substructure in the same way at palsinians are leaving under the boots of the evils ionis oppressor that is the commonality you onder wi beelem was tweeting out actual graphics of hang gliding palicinian terras murdering people you won ra theire that is why you knowho knows that come oss and they play on it here is igos sinwar doing exactly this just a couple of years ago not thun by the infuslor we the an i the go he says no wone to take this opportunity to remember the racest murder of george floods get's a fall terrorist yoo you george floyd was killed youn as h result of a races ideology held by some people liteally his chock an chartisis kill all the juws by the waye u should e r mind this same type of races im that killed george floid i's being used by the israel iagainst the palsed inians they know the game they know the ntersectional game they are playing the intersectional game and they are enabled by the media to play that intersectional game because the media ar part of the deal the media lovelhe intersectional game the media allow them to continue to claim that the west is actully the gratsat in the west is the problem it is all western structures of power israels a colonialist outpost in the mddle east never mind the fact the only reason anybody ever gave a crap about the land over there is because it is jewish in the first place neve never mind the fact tors continues to is presence in the land of israel since literally the time o te bible predating the existence of islam by malennia then matter non that matters all the matters is the narrative and the narrav is there is an intersectional coalition to take on the the halls and the inty pillars of power this you oner wy aoshe got sect in this thing they aos knows bleap about themat least aose barily knows how to tide her shoes in the morning ao s cannot make herself a bula obio tat lady has the eye kul a come quat what is she there is literal tape of her with margaret whover explaining she knows nothing about th midlies nothing o the t opaplea potino fa oh i i think hi a what i ma forfli fo efattn fontofo npfefer or poftetofo tepefafeto thatohon do you thnk you can ac ta why i donk i think i dol think to i iam not texper tofoathi fate thitiol and yet that lady is extremely vocal about all this why why but becaus again she is part of the dispossessed coalition this the intersectional colition must be up hell at all cos even at the expense ive lots and lots ave dead jews that is what is going on here this is why ao s party girl of the democratic socialist of america is suddenly deeply concerned about iron dome in thethi this this ridiculous insthe gram take tock dop een here here she was yesterday talking about tactsthe rich and slicing leminens on the instas also she is she is very much in favor of of the commass shech accunt of likes them there ar theyr kind of cool why they would kill her first opportunity by the way an me ligt one of my favoritethings about theintersectional coalition is it they are willing to ride or die with commass up until the point were commss actually kills them i noted yesterday again at the university of florda there ware two protesthat were simultaneously held outside my lecture at the un versity of florda both fairly small one of them was a protest by the elg b t ku crowd and the other or was a protess by the procomos crowd they get along all the way until the procomos crowd decides to kill every member of the elgi b t ku crowd hn andicase hre as aos yesterday promoting her democratic socialist idealis ue amigai cudalemen and i cansi sit and it sic a sitres mo shact my raticals who think tat mabe one way that we can dea wi a wa the shortfult a

ao si makes intelligent that doesnt make in ish a und a dupis from the vally struck an nineteen ninety seven veeu this allot it meansthat you'r smart according to the media by the way that that swetcher she is wearing the tax the rich swetcher heu can buy it for fiftyeight dollars on her webside exciting news from the tax the rich crab in anicases again the intersectional colition is all and the entire media are in support of this this is why for example charles blow has a piece of the near times again his name is apt his colums absolutely blow they are they are awful universally heas it in entire piece of then your time stake called an envolving moral highground in the isral goss war what is the evolving moral highgroun pritell the first who paragraphs tell thewhole story the terrorist attack by comass against is railies was horrid barbaric an and excusable what is happening to innizen citizens of goso is also horrid and not a justifiable response to terris to tax ah sartalliin against coms is the same thing as comas by the way including thons of gosen civilians i know this part of the story that nobody wants to tell is it is ugly and it suggest thed there a lot of gossen civilians who actually kind of love comas but there is hongs afootage during the actual terrorist assaull worst attack on tu since the holicos of tons of gosan civilians were tong about kids is young is fourteen fifteen years old running into jewish areas and stealing things or participating in the violence but according to charles blow there is moral equivlence why does he have to maintain the moral equivalencs again it seems kind of weird why is it that advocates for black lives matter which jis supposedly a civil writes organization are protesting on behalf of one of the worst civil writes in humonrites violators on plan earth why they doing that again intersectional colition that is all that matters and the media continued to lie on behalf of this intersectional colition across the west see bes news disgusting we all know at this point it has been thoroughly and completely demont that the hit om gaza hospital either killed five hundred people cause itdid not hit the hospital hit o parking lot or two that even was done by these railies who is done by palisto mean his lomicy hod there is audio tape e played yesterday on the show of comas operatives talking to one another in sang o boy that was os was not it or yes it was but it osn't matter here is how sebas news covered it who is still israls fault the aut your mouth tof goo mous explosions at the o on the hospital is still a smoking brec which should have been a safe haven has turned into a living nightmare ot beinsactin a we left our home to come here this woman says we thought it would be s but then we got bond the anglican church which runs the hospital has said it was struck before byn is really rockit just four days earlier injuryg for members of stanspeaking to sbia tes futle nime a doctorat all aty says israel's army sent to warning to ae vacctuate of facility i sin forty eight hours before without explosion again now posi you may notice that then tir clip is there anything mention fact that it was a palacinian aslomic g had rocket it fell in the parking lout of the hospital not a single thing there just ignoring it thet pretending the story does not even exist that pretending the truth does not even exist the scumbags the media truly have blot on their hands because it turns up it turns out when you spin up terroroust supporters with lies about the blood liable jews it turns out people die because of that the media do not care christian imon for another com ossphan hershe was yesterday promoting the idea the as the idea f lying under these circumstances christian imon pooris disgrace to journalism now the issue is as he said no matter what teis any sa now what youa say ar iny in the beginning before there was any cout o put investigaele there was an investigation and they came to that conflusion in ignited the atawa ter this they have seen many time and because ni'm sorry to say this because in the passe is realy idea has not been honest about what actually happen look attuing abua that i know that we cannot talking about it they always cer saterenabuapla which was a situation where as unclear who shocherin ablapla and then admitted thate was these railies these railies in any case christian imon poor doing doing camassas work for them because this is what sor memory many members of the mans frmet to the b b s which is absolutely worst on this the bb s is bad on this sort of suff the bby ses in grin the antisemicismas unbelievably strong which is why seven separate journalist from the b b s in last week alone have had to be fired or suspended because they posted on public media about how they were in solidary with moss doesn 't matter here was a bbsy journalist saing the attack had to be isral even not clearly was not israel this realy military has been contact it for colment and they have said that they are investigating but it is haw to see what else this could be really given the size of the explosion other than and is raya strike or several astrikes because whas everal tsr rockits being flied outs of gasa we never see explosions or tha scale we might see half a dozen may be a febal people being killis ja her such r honestly i ad but why they doing this why why the answer is twofold one actual antisematism there has been in overt attempt particularly by members of the left since nineteen s xty seven israels victory in the sixday war there is been attempt by the left to basicly convert israel into the world's big bady that was originally pushed by the sovia union which was attempting to create a pan arab nationalism to use thagainst te united states in the aftermouth of israel's victory in the sixday war that is the geo politics of this sort of antisemitism but there is also this latent pro arabism that has existed prertictarly in briton tfor a very long time an anor ther to weard sort of at' no centric exoticism that exists in brittan or what the helit is but it is pathetically antismatic and

proposition that the west ies the bad gi in the world an israel is just a spiarpoint for left that sort of stuff lends a lot of credents and credability to the worst people in the world which is presumably why according to the wall stree journal the situation in the middleast has got in significantly worse quote the explosion at a goza hospital tuesday night set off a wave of protests across much of th mideleast and the broader musle world sme of them calling for death to israel theire's a shock now doesn' matter by the way that of palsinans killed their own people here and then lied about it then men re at all by the way i i love t it that people are still repeating the casual seeto casual te statistics brought to them by the comas halth ministry a literal lying terrorst organization tells you how many people are dead and injured and that they have a magical ability by theway to count the stuff minutes israel is still figuring out exactly how many people were murdered from the october seve of the tax which to weeks ago ther comoss within minutes can tell you exactly to the person how many f it were killed their ages and who they were or their lying to you and the media are credulis morons or theire notrous credulous morons the actually are closi procomas in any case all of this has now exploded in the iddle east anger nevertheless bread quickly through the region acordng toe laster journal riots broke out near the israly amassy an jordan where millions of palsnian tdiaspera live and which astad diplomatictizes oth israel since the nineteen nineties by the way when tiy t the mk the palcinian diaspera understand that is not correct transjordan was part of british mandate palistine transjordan is filled with palcinian airs becaus british manda palstine included jordan around eighty thousand turkish protesters ascended on the se rally conslits an istonbooll some attacking security forces and antemptingtans or te compound according to authorities get not a shock there turkey has been a long time ally of comas they famously attempted to send a flotilla of weaponry into israel which ended with israel having to way raid the flotila and that of course was then blamed on israel in aron thousands of people across several cityes demonstrated including at the french and british how massies that of courseis jinndup by the aronian government a lot of ranians are not anti israel there such a sort of weird iron in he mddleast which is that in places where the government is the most anti israel the population tens to be the most can of apathetic or olckay with israel beby a ron and in places where te government is least anti israel which would be sauty arabia the population hates israel its kind of its kind of interesting there are chance from protestors in a rock or on on tuesday night calling for the death of israel some governments turkey and jordan have declared days of morning at the governments themselves booking for an offram said they can please their domestic constituency they declared a day of morning on behalf of a hospital mascer that did not happen number one an number too was caused by palistonians lomicy hot if it did all this sispropagantistic and tha the media did its best to promote all of that meanwhile seanan is is having fund the're doing their mostly peaceful protest thing again fiery but mostly peaceful and i'mon jordan it we tho get te e hundreds e people go ther i thum crte te tepen temte stol stoly iay and if thi the wehat bit of an incre the the curi tal the h mea e or mostly bese i ma sure theire trying to uno break can amassies but it is mostly peaceful as well know this is the way that it works just the blackbides materies which cause to billion dolars and property ams fiery but mostly peacefuls is what is happening over there meanwhile jordans forgn minister imonsophati said on wenesday thathey do not care whether is lomicehod bombd a hospital they do not care about that at all instead actually there is deep skepticim quo nobody is buying that narrative in this part of the world every one here believes that israel is responsible for it these rally armies things not as be yonest try nd fight any onewhas een believe it in this part of the world i wonder why that is could that be because youhave had generations of a of lies teaching the jews are these scum of the earth and th they ught to be exterminate mae maybe it is that may maybe it is because of that meanwhile all these arub nations which cares deeply about the palistinians in gosa they care deeply about them ot we are up to twenty one moslemnations tha hve express olidarity wit the palistonians in gossip a a grandtol of zero have offered any any refuge assistance any in fact egypt's forn minister can not yestery and said absolutely not when er not can take any refuges said there is pressure on egypt and other countries in the regions to absorb refuges from gossip egypt refuses on principle othe principal is thatyou have to keep people in warszown that is the principl it is a hellevan a mazin principle that you have found there or maybe you do not want the palistinian refugees in egypt because you are afraidtheye canaty stablized orgine as they hve routine le stabelized regimes ranging from jordan lebanon again lebanon is a casin point of what happens when palstoni refuge gs and their leadership on mass anter a country lebanon used to be a fully functioning christian country be was known as the paris of the midaeleast it is now a trashy that would be the reason why egypt does not want a let in palistinian refugees from the gossipstrip that is the exactories unstead the're just oin to keep them in wars on and encourage them te stand directly over terror tunnels to shield the terrist meawhile it is its mazing i love is nations in themiddleast our apparently urging their citizens to evacuate lebanon multipl countries hav learned their citizens inside lebinon they shouldimmediately evacuate as cesbelaw ramsup its attacks on israels northern borders roiders has reportd that hesbel official hasshema safhidine give speech to thousand of support on wednesday claiming the terror scrupl with thousands of times stronger tan it was i the past threatening israel and the west meanwhile tons of nations including by te coait and savy arabia urging people to leave lebinon asap well that isa that is interesting s ther the're willing to takenn people from lebanon in sadury but not from the gossipstrip ther fat fascinating fascinating stuff meanwhile the idea is nounc ng that residente of twentyeght towns along he is rael u an on boar needed to evacuate you'r talking bout thousands and thousands people be evacuated thanks to a husbela oron is ramping up its activities in various parts of the world according to the jrusalem post the os military basin aroc intercepted several drones targaning arocks all osad air bas thust has forces at alos sod en several other facilities in aroc cudrones were intercepted soron is is sort of exploring around the edges now the reason that uron is exploring around the edges is because of the open question about jobiton and this is really what it comes down to does jobidon have deturrent power does he have the power to deturt oron from getting in that is the real question he is been saying lot f the right things but does anyone trust that jobidns going to pillis word thatif cusbelass are firing tens of thousands of rocs at israel that the aircraft carries station the iddle east will do something about that that is an open question jobidon's record up until now has suggested that he will do little to nothing which is why there is much tension in the regien if the united states were strong and muscular it would lessen the chances of a serious regional war because everybody in cusblat would know we step out that lone we a nay at clock inthe mouth en lose powerful military force inthe history of the world but because everybody sort of suspects that jobidon is a bluffer that is why everybody is on tenterhooks right now that is only exascerbated by some of the language that jobidon has been using sobidon is saying some of the stuff that is correct yesterday obviously he was in israel and he says that he knows tat the hospital attack was not in fact israel here ere is jobine yesterday ah ar ioy eyyi isi ii issii sssiiisy oiiooalii iiiiy jobidon is not project strang he does not he sang some of the right things there hes still projects weakness not only in his person but in some of his approach and just when secon will get to more of that this is one of the biggest problems in the iddleast right now is that when america is credibly dangerous the midleast tends to go silan when donal trump was president the midlies was quite silent why he is everyone was afraid that crazy dud was gen a beatthesh aled out of them that is what the were afraid of with donal trum thous he is entire strategy but when it comes to jobiden everybody is kind of suspicious that may be he stuffy t as about standing longside longtime allies maybe the meanal lot since they did cut and run from afganistan

again there is a lot of disquiet in the region because jobideing makes werd sounds he makes weird sounds consistency and projection of strength are not merely about military posturing meaning meke moving aircrafterrs people actually have to believe in your threat the the word the phraseis credible threat not just threat the jobine visiting israel yesterday he express to sympathy an that he warned israel not to repeat rage field mistakes after nine eleven now in thes sort of language is paternalistically weird it is strange what is even talking bout reage fueld mistakes is it it is now october nineteenth the szack happene on october seven that means it has been nearly two weeks since fifteen hundred sues were slaughtered men women mabies two hundred hostages being held underground by the worst terrace on the planet israel has yet to do a grounding persion even by the way for all the tome abow there is no electricity and water in gaza the reality is that because israel only provided ten percent of the electricity and water in gaza there still is in many parts of the godstrip electricity nd water and israels providing that nsout where are these rage field mistakes that biding is talking about what exactly as he warning of other then it is hat coud get out of jail free card if a stray bom hit is the wong target and the he cn claim tha i was a rage fueld mistake this it this is this dumb language from the president i understand a mevy mericars understan you cannot look of what has happened here to mothers your fathers your grant carrents sons dothers children even bages not scream out forr justice justas must be done but i cush o this fa you field at rage do not be consuled by after nine leven were inragein the states wawe sut justise and got just eus o made mistages i'm wondering what exactly heis referring to there in israel is not invading a rock i noticed they are talk amout going toliber ly into the area run by the exact terrors scrup that actually murdered all of it citizens were thah was tong mut again the question of jobne's weakness is still first ind foremost on a lot of mines that is particularly the case when in the middle of all this the by dministration sad it will ease sanctions against companies that trate an oil produced in venisuala sovenisuala is an ally of ron which is the sponser state of the terrist attack vennisuala is run by an evil dictator in and nicholas madura anta jobidon is a tempting two cotell then is wala because he wants to lower oil prices before the election and that of course is creeting a feeling among a lot of america's worst enemies that au now if the got leaver is on tome oil then maybe you cannactually eno shift the president of the united states here hat gobine will do anything to keep the oil price is low which is not a place you on a be if you if you feel a can lovers mosh powerful country in the world tbhat means of the president is projecting weakness and that is a real problem meanwhile anti semitism it continues to spread incredibly fast around the globe there'is an attempted scynegogu burning in berlin the other night according it to the b b c berlan's jewish communicy has been shaken by two petral bombs thrown in to synegogu but a spike an antismetic incidents in some european countries police said two people through burning bottles filled with liquid ind wha was described as attempted arson chancellor oloff shoals is exspressed outrage at the attack baans broke out elsewhere n berlin overnight during anti isral protest a mergency services were pellted with bottlestones an fireworks protestors set barricades a light in a number of streets and one demonstration close to the brand in burgate in volved seven hundred people that came as ctesbela was calling for eight day of rage gan european anti semitism on the rise largely in the radical musslin community that was been that is been imported into into europe over the course of last few decates meanwhile a sinegogue was attacked in spain as well an's called the malila synegogue antom there is tape of of u see people rushing down the three ton te sight on t tack the plece are going to try and stop this in france eight french air ports were forced to evacuate for security reasons in eastern france strasborg gaerparts as it was evacuated to bom threat nantes their part western frence was evacuated for th same reason ther ports of beerits and to loose in the southwest little in the north and the onbron in the south east set operations were resuming following a police operation all were evacuated earlier on wednesday because of at bom scare in tunesia a synegogu that is not in use but did contain torrisrols was burned here is vidio of that happening this is obviously of footage that is released bi fans of the of the arsenists that sa can tell with the with the incredible strit to the incredibly wonderful strains of a arabic language music happenig rit ther beautiful beautiful staff in spiring music as they burn a snegogu hundreds of tunetcians accordig to the algomina reportedly burnts the al coma sinagog on tuesday evening according t vidios and images posted on tictoc is my favorite part of the li about the state of israel that if the state of israel ceased to exist do not worry the jewso be tre a great in muslin countries yah i believe that you are totally right guis that that is going to happen the synagog does not currently function as a place of worship because om there is no joish community because again they were expelled the ds post of the morning after sho much of the sinagog complics burnt wit erabic grafede spreahd on the walls of the synagog rooms which remained intact they they shatterd all of the they shatter all the art inside the ynegogu again there is another dere deadly terrace attack in may against the elt creeba sinagog on the island of jerba as well that that haven a few monts ago thay they love jes in this particular region of the world that is why its shocking when they when when a terrascrupt killsbunch of jews in everybody reacts by blaming the jews that is that is wy we shouldall be shocked is because every one over there weave ben told by the westermedia is a moderate liberl minded person whofld be perfectly at home in new york or detroit or chicago or anywhere else on provide no threats the west wessoever they are all wonderful liberal minded people there just a few bad apples wut actually there'are munch peoplewho think truly evil things and thn their people are terrace there is distinction between the two people who believe truly evil things that is not a death penalty offense but pretending awav the problem is not going to solve the problem nor is it going to give israel wherewith all to defend itself or the west the werewith all to devend itself again the west constant belief in it in its own narcicistic centrality is is truly incredible and meanwhile the republicans continued to do our publicans do which is out run directlying to tresicate themselves in the ball simultaneously that that that is the thing that they are continuing to do now you might think it this time that we would have some ou know serious politicians on the scene unfortunately this is a merica we do not do that sort of thing around here the a the speakership of the house representatives is still very much up in the air jim jordon who was a the person who was going to run aftersteetsclis remember kevma carthy as ousted by matgates for n u they they thrummic carthy and he're plan was to and again concessions but they thrummic carthy because it had to be done could the establish i do love that the word establishment in republican parlents now just means people who do not rant at walls but thet's literally what it means lut if you rant at the wall then your then you'r anti establishment but if you do not rant at walls an you are probably part of the establishment it has no ideological haunt content by the way the word establishment has no actual policy content if you are pall ryan and ou want deep cuts two the social security medicar medicate that are driving merica's natinal debt you are an establishment rino but if you want to increase spending if you are big spending yourk republican you are also an establihment rino if you are a socially conservative republican my fense sorry to say you are an establishment rino also if you are a socially liberal m ember of the republican caucas thay chrisenon ha you are an establishment rhino if youre hawkish on forn policy lensy gran youre an establishment rhino but if your kind ed dovish john huntsman whell that also an establihment rhino anit the word just means whatever people wanted to met in these days what it means is you are not sufficiently loud or something or you got a thing done if you hat a thing done that is evidenceth you the other side if you got athing done soys whike kem mc carthy had to be ousted done matter that by the way any speaker of the house is can have to get exactly the same kind of deals that kemicarthy did because i know this is hard hard to believe but believe it or not there is a democratic senate and a democratic president and it does not matter what house built you pass that does not make it through the senate or's the president or get passed but it does not matter they ou ere to co mac carthy because they are excellent excellent plan was in anyway they ouere to ce mc carthy then they hadnan internal election between steeve scolees who is the husemajorty wip and jim jord in the head of the house over si comittee i both guys i know both guys both good guys both ton may good speakers scolees one the internal lection one thirteen an ninety nine then they lok ofine we will go forward as united frons except they dn't have the votes for scles because all takes his peeling olf fourepublicans not voting for scolees in ordr for him not st be come the speaker he wit through he is i'm not doing this this is garbage turning my life nope jim jordan is ok a fine you fine all to its jim jordan was on on the first ballat he cim up twenty votes short on the second ballat he came up twenty two votes shorts with seven republicans voting for scolees five voting fom a carthy three for lee elden one voted for john baner by the way who did all the democrats vote for hakeen jeffreys this is all going absolutely astonishingly well because it turns out that again if being establishment means that you run directly into trees and kick herself in the ball simultaneously the republicans are doing an amazing amazing job on the one hand you have the geope moderates and in new york districts who are deeply afraid that if jim shorden is the speaker of the house that they are going to basically lose their seats on the other hand you have the freedom caukis which is trying to be principaled in some ways but refusing to acknowledge reality in others you can see youn see the the battle happening inside the republican caucas because nonwall acknowledge the actual reality which is the incentive structure is exactly the same the fracturous caucas certain cuts will be made you are not can get everythingyo u want democrats r un the senate in the wite house deal with it sorry that is the reality and i know the ra lot of people in my prticlar indistry who spend all day and all night telling you that you can have the moon you cannots at's not how thes game works i'll tell you hare the republican strict fom principle i promise you i'll tel you hre they come up short i'm happy to tell you that what they could not get done also i live in a world calles reality world and in reality world republicans arncan get everything they want because they have a cawkas that is only two hndred twenty one seats and a minority in the senate and not the presidency in any case here is one geope moderates represent o dona bacon he he was boasting yesterday that jordan was headed for tefeet quote'll fight to the deat likely and we will not let off theire tactics angered us the harassing our spous even jorn hindebrickwall which by the way seems to be the case in the first vote for jorden twenty republicans defected the second vote twenty two republicans defected meanwhile chiproy ar representive actually trust member the freedom caucus chips really good guy would make a great speaker but would never be elected speaker because again many republicans our two left wing for that chiproy inthere is talk now about democrats joing with republicans to empower the speaker protan patrick mac henry because there dis function they' have to go to the democrats be what what concessions can we make to use we can have a functioning house here is chiprubbing what the hellery doing guises what is this never in the history of this institution never to the best to bot ouh have we ever appointed a speaker protem with boll powers of the speakership without having alect any duly alec the speaker we have not done that theh best bon out yo do that would be playing or games with such an important position as third an line to the the pres the we should do our jotis the speaker the constitution says that any move to do otherwise is contrary to the constitution and would do ignormous damage to not just republican part but the house representative and i violently apose any ever do thenn before thout ink chiproyis exactly correct but that is where it maynd up if republicans cannot actually agree amongst themselves to elect a speaker even if they have disagreements with the speaker from time to time and his just stupid first ruale of politics do not interruptor opponentswither make a mistake second rual of politics do not run directly into trees while kickingyourself in the balls republicans seem dedicated to breaking both rules ir dogis tat th rest of the show is continuing right now we will be joined online by ali beer he is the founder and president of united

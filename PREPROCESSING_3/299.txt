the lake we brought an emady firecracker and we wanted to dedonate it in the shallow water where we used to swim we were eleven and it was late fall of nineteen seventy seven we were visiting a place called freedom new hampshire a small town of a few hundred people just across the border from man my daubt had volunteered to do some aitenance work an a summer camp iad once gon to my brother kenny best friendyan and i went along we would been in separable growing out but now kenny had started hanging out with an older crowd and i'd been seeing less and less of thean since i'd just transferred to a new school i was in a funk about losing touch with kenny anean and for me the stakes for the we end were a little higher than usual in normal times we to go shop lifting or set things on fire that hollowen we taken cands of d forty and gone from door to door spraying it n the mouths of jacko lantern still flames burst out their eyes and they blew up in balls of fire this is my brother kenny he is now thirty seven and he is a scientist mi think eans mom im you sto worry little bit abauk you spending to much time with us or being brouht under our bat influence cause i think we tatty in about a in a throwing woodships tat cars we tatty in about unfolding paper clips that you could shoot them at people and on we were wandering around looking for something to do and we saw the house it was gray weathered and leaving precariously at one end the windows were boarded up from the outside two old cars probably from the thirties sat in the yard one of them had a tree growing oup through a hole where the engine had been at the back of the house we found a window that was broken and i remember peering in into neer darkness ireros kind of u a dar count of thing that is my friend en tit was one of thes ligs where we just would say i'm doin that house would not you then you would say id no cromp going that house an kenny t would say ye that house looks on none of us really want tod go housees we are all scured but we do ean was the skinneist was decided that he should go in first he slid sidewayse through the broken panes we would not get cut and disappeared tafter maybe ten seconds he scrambled back out clutching a newspaper it was brown and i remember it crumbled in our hands the headlines had something about notseas invading that was all we needed one bmy one we climbed into the house it was dark inside the only light came in through little cracks between the boards that covered the windows the floor felt soft underfoot and as my eyes adjusted i could see that it was covered with a lair of filthy clothes junk was everywhere actually we could not walk around on the floor becaus you could not see the floor in must plac es it was just jann wit worset tuff than you could live with some mumber the a couple of rooms y you you you could not go in to for for how much tup was jammed in there i was careful to remember how w e got in in case we had to find our way out in a hurry we were all very quiet we would seen enough hormoese to know that joking around could get us into trouble here is the and wdid not spread out we stuck prombly almost git to hit in our backs for gloody each other and kenne was may be looking the other way his back was it is a criterser ittle star of people walk through the house and kenny is one of t the worst people to go into a situation that wit wh ave you n ecause his his frigitery and he always wook cin a mumble about may be with the worst thing might be a might next hab you dont you nont ii that is som we's gong to come out of that closet o non some rooms were untold tisarray we things strewn about they would been rummaged through but then there were these little areas where things were untouched in the kitchen dishes were stacked on open shelvs pots and pans cluttered the sink and the pantry was stocked with kan food i picked up a container of hershee syrup and it felt heavy a salten pepper shaker sat on the kitchen table the main sense i had was of disaster this is my brother kenny as if people had been cound of tootling along in there everyday lives and something terrible had happened something catastrophic had happen to the people in the house catestrophic that no care had been put in arranging or sorting or andeting any of the contents of their lives and there was a feeling as we sat there that this time capsel had not an opened in fifty years hanging in the kitchen was one of those calenders that give out a gastations it was dated dicember nineteen thirty eight in the bed room was a pile of shoes may be thirty high that id fused into one mass on a night stand i found a pair of eyeglasses folded on top of the man's wallet and i slipped them both into my jacket pocket in another room was a bureau and tucked in the mirror frame was an invitation to a dance at the town hall pin to it was a rose that was completely withered kenny open the closet door next to the dresser and hanging there was a rotting white dress we began to fabricate a little scene a teen aged daughter returnes late from a dance with a rose she pins it to the mirror and hangs her dress in the closet and then something horrible happens and that is when time stopped outside squinning in the bright daylight we raised back through town kennynean were kids coming off a roller coaster but i had the sense of doom about the whole thing i'd heard about the king tut exhibit that was during the country i wondered if we would be cursed the guise who would found king tut's ton also i had much wallet in my pocket i took it out and showed kenny ne inn inside was a bright green one dollar bill dated nineteen thirty five and a driver licence for a man name virgil mason that night moller dad drov is home i put on the eye glasses i'd found to make kenny ney and laugh but then i felt bad about the joke i did not know anyone who died before and now i was pretty sure i was carrying the wallet of a dead man the next day my brother would be going back to his high school butties and my best friend would be going back to our old school i'd have to face the kits at my new school where i had not made me friends and it seemed everyon was named dug and played lecross ihad always ben a moody kid but it was an unfocussed sort moodiness now that all this was happening in my life my gloominess took on a new focus i brooded about the nason house my home room teacher had been an instructor for outward bound throughout the year he made us go low in the woods around the school i spent hour sitting out there alone with my journal on a flashlight brooding the winter passed and the only curse i suffered was great seven that spring my parents went back to do theire volunteerstint at the camp this time i brought a new friend named david i knew it impress him we got up early and packed flashlights in our book backs i think we even brought a canteen of water it was raining as we climbe through the window of the house nothing looked it to change over the winter and just the first time i had this acute feeling of being watched as we moved from room to room touching things opening up drawers climbing up into the attic daved felt it too all their personal woings were right there they felt close and i remember walking through some of these dark rooms looking round you knoway you will being afraid of perhaps noon covering something some evil scene orse discovering that they were there is very good they ad died there i member thinking that we were going to find it a bodyed an closet at any moment i reremember there is some some closets and covoards that we just flat out did not want ok or even open up the the ovn d i you just afraid you might find something in just did not want si you member the basement i do not remember the now i do not remember the basement did we ever go down we did go down into the basement eventuly did not we i still do not member the basement did you go down the yodn' g on the basement we never went into the basement then her is why the door to it had been blocked shut by a couch that was propped on its end as if some one wanted to keep something down there from getting out i remember oncovering finding a small doll his face had been burned off and i remember being terrified in that thinking this must have been some scene of some horrible ritual david has a really strong memory of a doll with its face burned off to remember that oh yet absolutely that wan carry the te minmention that i've got i've got the image of it om i made ther something creepy about a doll thit is kind of been mangle i remember discovering that there was these ser sneered tesies ary of we kkow or smeered there was eitheres animal or you man or we could not finger that aut the poop on the bed that was carry too iit make you wonder n at what the hout is going ot in here i think it the time without a you making people were crashing out here an that fit into whole story about out some some fugitive on the lambs from justice whoas hiding out in ow abandoned hou sir the town out thehalllike who used to crash out there after a bange o thing mus tak the strange part is do people just pick up and walk out of front door one day a leve letters that art credibly personal e this these were importantartifact to their family if they did leave for some legitimate reason coan move bo pack up you move you do not leave things lot a wallet with money in it or or your address bok that has the birthday is written of your family members and why why you want yo leave him in that how could you we had a mission the mission was to find out as much as we could about the family who had lived there and all over the preser letters and pieces of paper and each one was a potential clothes ae an we sat down and the dingy had a musky house and we started to read november twenty nineth nineteen thirty three dear mister mason i have checked up your case quite thoroughly and find that you have already had as much if not more work than most people i find also that you were working a car and a truck and that your son has a car and a truck also that your team is working halling cot lumber long as a man has anything at all he hasked to use it as we have to give work to the people who have nothing at all under these circumstances you did not qualify for work at this time signed the office of the county supervisor of relief dear mamma i'm staying over to night and go to the dance artie and i have had a fight he thinks i'm going out with anny i may i do not know i do not want him to know where i ams at do not telling come over to the dance and bring my shutes the blacks once now come over mamma and do not be mad do not even tell p t now mamma please do not be mad at me mister jackson is ugly to day be sure you get dad to come to the dance there is a ball game to night orver the next two years i returned to the nason house for times in all and each time i came back with more clues about what happened i read these letters over and over trying to decode them convinced that the answer about the family's downfall was hidden in some seeming e trivial comment or offhand reference this note is written on school paper by a young girl ond was probably my age at the time dear clide i wanted a boy friend i thought i would write to you darling there is no other boy around here that interests me as you do clide darling call me up clied darling when i saw you last night over at pinks i thought i would go crazy because i love you from your girl friend d we had to take things that could help us unravelled a puzzle i mun ight i do not think we even thought of it being private property yat tat at the start be tas it was just a bandoned a no one cared about it we read notes from doctors and found bills from creditors we scanned library past due notices and studied postmarks and came up with lots of ideas about why the place had been left we started to think she may be these people had their house for clothes and were thrown out by bankers because it does seem as if somebody migh have been shut out of the hout with all of them all of the a objects inside one of my favourite theories was that you ar the father die at do the same times the sons at to go to wor is woord looking at papers a talk about worst ar nan yound thinking about how a couple of of vance with old father and a couple of sons could very quickly finish the family i remember finding on information about bedding i think we saw i think they were tickets or a scandul of a dog track or a horse racing track and the story we made up was oh these people had lost all their money gamblen we needed to find someone who coul give us some answers a person who knew the family or a distant relative freedom's a small town some one must have known what had happened but when we would go ask down at the general store or the post office people gave us the cold sholder this confirmed to us that they were part of the conspiracy to bring this family down or at least part of the cover up in retrospect i realized the adults may have brushed us off because we were twelve years old tite was davyd wo found the break through clue a matchbook matches an tact soiled but legible it said stop an shop at nason grocery freedom side near effingham false bridge we rode over and ditched our bikes under the bridge there were two or three houses on either side all big old victorian buildings but it was obvious to us which one was the nason grocery there were couple of ancient gaspomps outside and arrusting moxy soda sign a rope held the door closed but we were able to squeeze through the first thing i saw when we went through the door were the boxes of cornflakes that lined the walls the nason grocery was a completely intact perfectly preserved store from the nineteen sixties with products still on the shelves by the cash register there were magazine racks and rows of candy there were glass countertops displaying fishing year and stacks of can vegetables corn and green beans some of the cans at exploded from years of heating an freezing which we thought was cool upstairs there were a few rooms that must have been an apartment being in a store all of the sudden reminded us ceg know a we are breaking at entering in a place that is got candy there was a small safe under the counter and when i turned the handle the door swung open inside i found four silver dollars and three kennedy half dollars i also found a five dollar gold coin from eighteen ninety two i took the coins al i spent the eighth great kind of detached from school i stare out the window at the falling stown and think about the drifts that must have been blowing through cracks in the house or i'd lie awake at night and imagine ow still in cold it would be in there instead of doing home work i spent a lot of time reading through my box of nason letters drawing up ae family tree from the clues we would found every reference to new hampshir became relevent to the mystery i sit at breakfast and stare at a tin of maple syrup and think about the nasons i was pretty sure that if there was some way i could support a family researching abandon houses theat it would be my vocation in life i was thirteen years old and i'd a crush on a house i had not told my parents much about it i was afraid they would shut us down over fears we would get hurt or arrested but i remember feeling that i wanted a grown up to see it to confirmed that we had an imagine the whole thing i started to tell my mother about it but i could see i was not getting in across how amasing it was that spring i led my mother across the field of weeds and watched as she climbed through the window of the house i was little appauld more than appaut when i went inside it was much more i much greater disaster than i hadnet matgined allso much greater mystery net i had imatgined and in many ways much more interesting for that reason my man proved to be quite a sluth she drode me to the town cemetery where we found plot after plot of nason graves there was ivenason died nineteen forty three bertha died nineteen sixty eight virgil whose dollar buill on drivers life since i had died nineteen seventy for and jesse who died nineteen sixty nine there was another jessie william who had a birthday but there was no date of death our theories of a car carrying the whole family into ravine of the war of sudden plague of the whole town rising up against the nations and massacring them these no longer made sense whatever had driven the family from its home had not been sudden the circumstances were more complicated than anything i'd imagined that win ter i had my first nightmare i was in the house rummaging through things and the natons were there in the walls watching me and they worked friendly the next year i did not go to new hampshire i'd started high school and was finally making friends there was less brooding in my life and what brooding was left had to do with girls my mother went up on the semi annual work we cend at the summer camp and she brought my sister along when they ereturned they told me a story that made my blood run cold tell me about the time h you went up with clare what happened that was a big mistake i think we were woe very embarrassed weembarrasse er we both ere inners no ye i felt i was angry you were angry i was now we blew it we blew it sort of in a sense what happened was this my mother had brought my sister into the house and they would seen a child's crib rotting away in the attic and they decided to take it they drove my family's bright orange valvo station wagon up in front and went in to get the crib there was no way one could bring that crib down the stairs and finally a fi pes of rope somewhere tied it o we loreed it ot the window outside the window now outside the wind of the house yi now swing an boy wal y and saw it we saw him see it we saw him see it and we realize ah the boy returned with two women who told my mother and sister they had no right being in the house my mamm argued asking them why if someone somewhere had an interest in the property they were letting it rot the women said it was none of her business and that she would better leav i felt betrayed the seen my mother had described the orange car the dangling crib the confrontation in the middle of the road people in freedom had a word for greedy city folk from massachusetts and elsewhere who came to town plundering for antiques they called them mass holes that is what we would become and i felt sick about it i collected all the objects and letters i'd found and put them in a small wooden fishtackle box i ad found in the nation grocery store i tucped the box up in our attic and i never went in the nason house again three years later i took a trip through new england with inn and we decided to take a dee tor to freedom i stopped the car where i thought the house stood even remembered it being further along we parked and walked up and down the road but the house was gone all the remained was an outline of the foundation in the dirk we drove to the bridge to see if the store was there but it was not we could not tell of the buildings had been torn down or if they would burned but they were gone as was i thought any answer had ever get as to why theyd been left in the first place i was having the nightmare regularly now each time it was the same i was in the naton house for some version of it but now undead nations for leaving their hiding places in the walls and attacking me it as a terrifying dream and i had it many times over the next twenty years inc or c there is playing here the summer i went to visit my mother and looked hrough the box of things iad save from the nason house all the years i had spent away from home she kept the box carefully labeled in stored through formoovs erah yei remember that yes they wouldnt box you see thus the wooden box that i remember and i think it has things in it should the box was as i left it a little make up case with powder still inside the eye glasses some children's records an the coins photographs of the family the letters and there were newspapers right on top was the one een found that very first day oan this newspit is very old boston sonday glo blik after marching cistosy after

very melancholy on thes noronen swise and melancholy the abandonment the abandonment is melncholy why in a way it is worse than throwing away much workse i can understand one famity being obliged to flee ovr un or abandone but that nobody else care that it was overwhelmingly abandoned by everybody that nobody had cared to solve something to resolve something that was very offensive to me that was i was leaving a corpse yot onleave corpses and that is a little bit the feeling that i had that here was a carcas a crarcass of e of the house of a life of a private innan nobody cared to pick it up

hampshire all the way back in eighteen ninety eight after the civil war young people had left the state in droves for better land and opportunities they notice elsewhere i'd last visited in the nineteen seventies and a few things have changed since the towns only store has been replaced with the shop for tourists selling tedoilies pandipped candles on beany babies farming is pretty much dead and city people have moved in because they love how charming it is the place is self consciously quaint that you feel your on a movi set about a small town tidy with just enough delapidation around the edges to be rustic the parade moves pass the old town hall the one shop across the towns only intersection to the semetery then turns around for another pass the theme for the parede this heare is we are freedom when i marched in the parede is a kid the theme was freedom of the press i dress as a radia reported and pretended to interview the spectators and irony bazaar i do not really know what else to say about it that afternoon i check into the only place to stay in town i bed an breakfast called the freedom house i'd been concerned that some distant relative of the nasons might own it part of the rough crowd i should not have worried the owners of new yorker there is princess die memorabelia in the library and my rooms painted bright pink ah in fact it is been called the ula laroom

when this person who was a charge settle these day he had died an still it was left and then the widow was paying the tactions all thes she is and she said belon o en continued to pay un gope i mean

keeper of everything do remember when it clotes to one they both a died a know thet gis one to run it i wa family leave all their things o these these precious things not not out of value but if gran own kno sh i ever send a mentl that you yet i never really thought of it but it seems rather tragic and way ane nat was a large family i mean how well do people how how many of them were interested in no one and the house an the store or abandoned because the kins did not care in some ways this was bleaker than anything i imagine back when i was eleven i d seemed a murder or an illness or an accident caused the nasons to leave all these things behind something out of the familys control but in fact it was the opposite the family made it happene they did not care about the stuff or they just did not care to remember et you davy wer yer to tell you they were carricters renthid nice people but they were a breed that had to find well they wuld the old school yetat t night yethey wele and ithey made everything do ythey would did not everybody then that was on the good old day en i getted when everywe had everything but money yes u ges sir at who i adfim fom the mersadins but ot e horse you would not a place for a pony by tha members of the nason family woul declined to be interviewed on tape confirmed the story n apland ave told me jes seemed berthanason lived in the house until nineteen forty six ask when they open the stornear afingam falls and moved to te apartment above the store they took what they needed and left the rest in the old house using in a storage and keeping open a possibility that they mov back some day when jessee in birth a died the fight over the estate began immediately their kids there were nine of them locked up the store until it could be resolved the house stayed pretty much as it was after eleven years the fight was settled the property was auction the money was split and the buildings were raised to the ground i asked an elder nason why they did not clear out the precious things in the house and she said what precious things it was full of crap and i mean crap as for the woman in the letter that my mother was never able to forget no one knew anything about her or her baby david mabel told me this just figures in a little town freedom y you kitting hona it thay patlite an explained that o just lik eery a cow athin e the'r ll a little yeletans in the co anan bed room i there tat no i a da a miin ani giv i oll town ritn it is all bi got that a a all ye wihin retrespect i know it was little much my obsession where the nasons as a kid i found the stuff in their house precious i soon they would too but of course the relics in their house worn about my life they carried no memories good or bad it is possible that for the nasons they were reminders of inheritance dispute or other disputes that they just as soon forget when i was talking to my friend david about the nason house he told me this story hits wife's father had recently and suddenly died and left behind a house that no one in the family wants david and his wife susan now find themselves in volved in fingering out what to do with it i feel it is on the cusp of being advanded no one's living there it is ripe for being vanthe lies and what do you do with the house that and now it is it is strange i mean it is it is tied up in this weird world of legal probate where you cannot really do anything with the property just kind of have to maintain it until some future court date it it the property's become a balantain and susan's un interesting thing wastat you knont gosh i i wish the house just burn down no saint gosh well why would you wish the house to be burn down it is partly it is it is a this lot of memories tied up in the house and the motions tied up etween her or down and somblizes by te house but the something about it is thev rell ofit i wanted to show some ant of the spod where the house had once stood in the early evening we walked through town and on to loonlake road we crashed through the bushes for a while hoping that we could find the old foundation or something but there was not a trace in fact the very land where i remember the house was gone the soil had been hauled away weeks before by buildosers constructing part of the new freedom elementary ye i mean that preasur io a i there i ye have a go long later when i was packing to leave town i found a small scrap of paper on the floor that had fallen out of the box of nason stuff there was not any writing on it but i actually hesitated at the trash can it is not that i missed my box of clues i'd felt relief handing them over to somantha in fact i act ly felt lighter but i was glad to have a remnant however small of the nasons i took the scrap in my bag

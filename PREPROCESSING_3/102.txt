republican candidates go right at each other to see who ise up for the challege of taking on donald trump truom strad ruling could be the most damaging blow to his candidatese yet and a mass crimes three in gulfs the nation i'm ben feare les is the venthpiroshow to day show sponserabackxpress we pt do you your ribe histery being seen and sold to advertisers now mean yeu ther gun express we pan right out express we cans i calm slash men preliminary note today noon eastern time i will be speaking with elon mask over on axthers and exspace were gen to be talking about elon mask an his fight with the antidefimation leaguan standars of free speech on ax as well as advertising presshire on ax if you wanta check that outmaktsure to head on over two ex spaces at noon eastern time o k last night was the second big republican debane by big i mean donal trump was in part of it and of course there is no way to talk about the debat without talk about the fact that the front runner by thirty points in the national average right now was not part of the debate and when the front runer is not there it turns in to a bit of a crab pot meaning everybody's just pulling each other now thate there is no way to avoid that sort of optic the question is is anyone wenn merge frum that crab pot chactually challenge donal trump now here is the reality believeiter n howwer still pretty early in this race it is only september twenty eighth at this point in the two thousand eight race which is sort last open primary race that we hade before trump stepped on of the scene in two thousand eight at this point there was a running gun battleto rudigulyony and make huckay for thy re publican nomination in fact even in the two thousand and sixteen republican primary poles donal trump was was leading at this point but he was not way out ahead was still pretty competitive at this point inother words some things can still happen now is that likely is that is that the most likely thing hat is on the most likely thing to happen however it is prettyovious that donald trump has some vulnerabilities in places iwa for example despite the fact that donal trump is leading significantly in iwa and also in new hampshire when asked which candidates oure being considered by voters in iwa an new hampshire a huge number of iwa voters and nuw hampshire voters are saying af theyare considering candidates other then donald trumps they are not locked into trump by any stretch of the imagination anotherwords of something terrible were to happen in trumps candidatese the're a lot of people whoud presumably shift over right now for example if you look at that s b s news pole from yugov what it chose is that an iwa about twenty per cent of the voter block says they will vote only trump in new hampshire that numbers abut twenty three percent which means eighty per cent an iwa and seventy seven per cent in it new hampshire our saying that they will consider candidates other than trump thirty one per cents of voters and iwa say tey will not consider trump at all thirty four per cent of voters in new hampshres if they will not consider trump at all and meanwhile of ask bolk of te voters in the middle the plurality of voters in te middle in both iwa and nuw hampshire say theywill consider trump and other candidates what is happening right now is that all the people who are considering trump and other candidates are splitting about half and half for trump 's o trump's got that locked in base of twenty twenty three per cent in these early states and then the other forty to fifty per cents of voters who say that they are considering trump plus everybody else are spliting about half for trump and half for everybody else ince the field is looking very fragmentit and the same thng is happening with the people e're not concedrning trump at all they are fragmenting abong a bunch of other candidate it is it possible that somebody could theoretically consolidate the rest of these voters it is possible that the field would have to wino dramatically and that person would have to take vots directly away from trump t would not just be a matter o picing up everybody whose anti trump that is only about thirty three per cent of the republican base at this point they would somehow have to take the other forty five per cent th bace and they would have to win that per cented to the base or leat split it in significant fashion s that is the state of the race as we move in to this debate now the field is to bate i's pretty obvious that is going to consolidate right now there is three candidateswho are probably on the bubbleleby tim scot chris christiand ugburgham the vake is self funded and not really running for presidents anyway and therefore he can stay in for pretty much as long as he wants with that said the field is likely to winnow and by the time we have another debate we are prbably can be looking at nickey haley ron to santis pencs probably will be out by that point out omangion she're looking at probably hayley verses to santis is how this race is starting to shake down noup are thse people definitely gon an drop out whit your chris christy you are just waiting into new hampshire you are hoping that the anti trump base can solidate to new hamptur sufficient two actually shows momentum over there but if you are looking at the state of the race right now in sid their publican party hayley into santis are the two most vible candidates o i say the two most viable they are not on even footing tosantus is well ahead of haily in iwa and the runing about even in new hampshire if the santus starcs to pick up some moment on which has been thestore of this campaign is the de santis has been a solid number two and he has never caught fire that is been the story of the campaign far again i am somebody who is very support for governor to santis an thn yeu make a phenominal president i nickey hailey i been supportive of governor to santis and his candidacy pretty much this entire time in trurms of whodwifink would make the best president among the candidateso are on the stage well with that sid everybody's still waiting for his campagn to actually initiate and that that there is been sort of a stagnation to the race it is been a very stable race basically since july since june july when when disantuis first to jump into the race did the debate change anything last night o the short answer is now the bate change nothing donal trump basically used the the war games a strategy the only when he move is not to play non'l trumpton show up he realise that if he did show up hoe'd get attack by all the other candidates on a wide variety of issues he was attackd by them anyway for not showing up instead he decided tat he is going to jet over to michigan and who is going to do an event with a few auto worker is in and claim solidarity with the members of the union over there ve noth union has shun him and there just licking the boots of jobidon wo simultaneously licking their boots as well with that sad him avoiding the ebate naturally means that everybody in the room is fighting each o ther and not tonal trump which is thay win for donal trumk and that sort of the dynamic lasener's a lot o people talking over each other people trying to get aggressive people attempting to fight each other and it turned into a mass it is a bit of a dog's breakfast will gets that momentarily first company is looking out for yu when they actually up grater service and do not charge ot for thit is great news for new and current pure talk

jump in to the debates last night the debate was moderated by a person from univis on which i i do not understand my fox news of partering with univisian that that is a far left networ it is sortr the ames and b c of the lateno community his banixsand and latinos ware voting republican or considering voting republican in th primaries they are not watching univisian and and every question that came out of univisium was was bys the left it is ture varny from fox business and you ad my frend hant a pereno from fox news and through no fault of their own andm i cannot plain the moder itsit is easy to blin moderers but it was just it was just a pile up it was just a twenty car pile up on the ey ninety five that is all it was ishus that it was complete car crash pretty much from beginning there is a lot awkwardness wat a weird moments some entertaining moments but now for those who suggestive the debate over all it is not a commentarian an one individual candidate the debate over all was relatively unwatchable that is true if it was a it was a not watchable thet now again i think that some of the has to do the modert some of it has to do with the way that tese tobates are don when i person is asked ta question every other mich on the stationes to be cut that is just the wy this augh to go and then when the clock expirers then the mike should be cut it shoud be that simple if yu strictly set the rules then the rules have not been set but nobody does that in these debates it is kunnom incredible to me i do not understand why fox news does not just set those rules right at the outsets you at leat have some sort of order the problem is they' right now you'vt seven people on that stage all agressively attempting to eat the microphone and get into that that camera with the red light on and they have no intentive to stop sir there is a tun of people talking over each other the there is a a ton of sort of non understandable nons ense were bulorga it just sounded late late gray noise over your ear just on an optics level it was not a god debate now as for the particular candidates nicky hayley came in with some someblin to momentamen i say some one someblone i mean again if you leae a polling datom she is doing better new hampshire than she was she is doon better an iwa than she was she is still third right now two the santis by a pretty significant margin in i wup and she is now in the scrum in new hampsure meaning if she is second or i she is tot er if she is forth it' con all the same because the reality is that is trumpet fifty and the its to santis and christy and hayley all between nine and thirteen persents she is got some thre's no question that nickey has gotten some momentum off of the last debate u and she came in very aggressiveshcam in very hot meanwhile the santis was planning presumely to stick to his playbook his playbook is every time you come to me iam going to give you my accomplishments and floortd which is a fine playbook that is totally fide you are a butded some attack some really i think scirriles attacks by moderators talking about for example the florida education plan to band critical race theory but itt was not in me a moment where he serv elevated as always these these debates are not friendly territory for is santis because he is at least on the stage of the front runner an he is seckond to trump everybody a second to trumpet he heis on the stage the front runer which means she has to fend off all this attacks the vakue apparently had a personality transplant he went from the first debate where he was just aggressively smarmy over the tops rmarmy and just grinning e're eare the whole time and and insulting everybody on the stage to much more humble the batand he must have gott en the exipols from the last debate and seen that it actually blunt imsel alout his momentum and he deside to change it up 'sims got by contrast decided that he had to get more agressive because he is also seeing those poles an what they'r saying is everybody thinks tim's got as anice kind nobody knows why he is on the stage christ christy was just christ christy the one thing ou have tak for chris christy that yout is always christ christy he is never not chris christy he is always christ christy except when he is getting tonal trumpicok but aside from that he is always chris cristy i and then tug burgham no one knows why and mike pence he again i i the vice cresenem he brought a heavy dose of awkward last nighte just in terms there is a lot of cringe to thes debate watching this debate felt watching the earliest episode to the office before they's her a hit their stride where 's all super crins humor not shurift your even allot to laugh or not ay the deba by gan with several of the candidates nocking donal trum fer not trung up to debate which hi's perfectly appropriate donall trum istheure publicang candidat for the presidency he should show up for th debate and every moral level also on ever stritegic level he defitely shuld not trump for the debate andyus con a point out that stretegically speaking when you are winning by forty points and you don' trup to the first debate and nothing happens your numbers there is literally no reason or you shop to the second dbate gad bu of course all the other candidates are going to are going to attack trump over this chris christy led the pack and attack ind trump for not trung up tot debate with the running gun battle for heaviest tose of crinch last night i mean this is lake fatal dose of cringe here from chriscristy now what a look of

chicken you chicken mak fly ou ci a salad stuff there from a from cris cristy hay will get to i more of this of this bleep sho debate in just one second first as i'm on the road and i'm on the road i

this obviously 's a much better calebrated attactin what are your you are you donald up mamammamma the this a this lobitter here from thesantis where is jo bidon he is completely missing in action from leadership and who else is missing an action donold trump is missing in action he should be on this stage to night he os i to you te and his fracter ere they added seven point a trily in to the dead that set the stage for the inflaceion that we hat ni go tay this is governor florida we cut taxes we ran sir cosses wee pate down over twenty by persent of our state dead and i bed od wasteful spending when can my des can is your presidand when they send me a bloating spending buill that is tat a cos your pricis to go up i'm in to tate out this pe do pand and i'm ge to sendet right back to them and that is a good pitch from onestansis now again does that damage trumpet any serious way mean trumps not even there and unfortunately huge percentage o from suppers do not actually hold him responsible for many of the things he actually did while he was in office but if you are onge launch an attack on trump that is the proper attack on trum come te fend your own record can meanwhile makpence decided that he was going to gomano emana with cris cristy in the awkward lane a he decided that he was going to talk about yewas asked about jobidn shoing up you a double you strike he was asked about on a trum shroing up in speaking michgan an when he was askedabout bidin hea he dropped what he thought i thing was a preplannd laughlines first rule of debate do not have preeplan laughlines you cannot predict when people are going to laugh particularly when you are laugh lines eare this awkward here is my pence talking about jo biden on the picket line weok i do disagree with somethin tos cut jus si jo bidon does not belong on a picket lawand he belongs on the unemploy e line and then on he looks into camera waiting for waiting for people to laugh or no or not now first mall hy's crimming off o all ragan it is an old roal regulaing his is recessions when your neighbor loses his job in to pressions when yo lose your job and recovery is when jimmicarra loses his job as he is basically can a twisting that line ba dom ya tha the crowd is a no that wene over let a led balloon ay meanwhile nickey haley i she shos very aggressive last night sheobvy sleeps amped up and you could tell from from her manner singe boorly last night it was just that he was very aggressive per formancefrom nickey haley whch was can of a difference from her last debate performance which i thought was actual very good i here is nickey on a emmigration for example and what she saying is totally right it is just that again when you are when you'e watching these things the cat in sort of matters o what happened that when to bidin wave the grain flag it told everybody to com tand now we thin tix knowin people cross the border we have had more fatin ol that if told americans and the arac teet n omour aft gan a tan wor's combined we need to mac io that we are a country of laws the sec that we stoppeing a con ter laws we give up everything thats country was founded on we happ to to cure the border the way we do that it is first of all de fin tankwer titys you see what happening an philadelphia right now wit' s got a stop 's all this is good by nickyhal ila all this is good benicky halian start off the debate in this mode as you will see a litle but leater on in thedebate she kept getting more and more grescipid again she start ufs od there is a reason why in this group of candidate halin in to sants our curnently doing it the best ay meanwhile vevake was there and om again i grew the lot of what vake sas to penning on the day and i an vevake yesterday was talking about the the southern boarder and heres what vake had to say out southern border militarieat the southern border stop funding sanctury cities and end foreign ade to mexico and central america to enty insentips to come across but i do go a step further you are right about that alia i favor ending birthright citizenship for the kids of illegal immi grinsin this countrry no te left al howl about the constictution and the fourteenth amendment the difference between me an them as av exally read the fourteenth amendment what it says is that all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the laws anjurisdiction thereof or citizens nobody believes that the kid of a mexican diplomat in this country anjoys birthrightcitoenship not a judshal wor legal scholar in this country will disagree with me on that wf the kid of a mexican diplomat does not enjoy birthright citizenship thend neither does the kid of an illegal mitrant who broke the law to comcu o e sokens o whet the thacasang them by the way actually is is a good legal argument thas it as been a very very long and an interesting ongoing legal argument among consevetabligle scholars whete the birthright citizenship actually was ever meant to extend to kids of people who are subject to another juristiction if you are a mexican citizen benond american citizen you come here and than you's drop kid aryou itis that kid there frorn american citizen as a case from the suprem cort in the late nineteen century a sort of suggestit yes this ness birthright citizenship is the way that that this is done i proting a constutial amendment to overturn thathersn aringbollad he could do with an active congress or not is an interesting legal argument this was the the debate the bake who showed up and much better de bate vake the problemis that there was hang over from the last tobate the bate and glast of ba vic was really ob noxrous ar he is gi have got om state and he suggested that every single

just de monstrative of the kind of ieur that people had for vake on the stake nickey hailey also could not stop going after vevake last night this started off actually when the vake romasuammy was asked about tiktock he had this very weirdflipflip on tiktok re said tiktock shul be ban and then he made a big stapemen bout how he was going on tik tockenout listen i think tiktock shoul ben i'm on tiktok tbecause my view of this is pretty simple i'm nto o over the aballs are i'm no gor thablls arbecus thtotherwise the bad guises get the ibolls if tiktock is available two people i'm not cont pretenents not available i've the same view of this that i have about ballat harvesting or about early boting when these things are available you have to use them because the other guise are going to use them and that is at thats kind of what vavake says right you are ut then he can t goes further an suggested may we should not ban tictocta here as vague talking about tictok tal is bound a goi wa go te issue devices because of its tis to the chies god yet you join tic talk after doo we balso and influenceo cha whol should the collandin she be easily persuaded why influence the answer as i have a ratical idea for the republican party wen he to win elections and part of how we wint elections is reaching at the nex generation of young americans where they are when i get into office up an very clear gid's under the age of social under deet of sixteen should not be using a dective social media we are only go a ever get to declaring independence from china which i favor if we actually win ocase you voids the question whether toe ban tictack or not and this leade snicky haley getting very agressive and some of e f others a good moment for nicky haly i sheu do not thing this god moment for nicke haly be cause again nicky haley's intire approacher has been very genteal a secie's been aggressive enough to attack people but tom yet i do not lean this moment went over for her particular

it is mary wesioun be attackin each other upon the stage when literally last tebate that is what he was doing again the person who was rising up from the scrum in all this was to st his stradity which is amistan over the side yer ra you gos onder your carcrashthing u'm to belik over here in mainly succeeded did one of one of us moments that disancis had last night was his moment on abortion he as a specificaly that a wortion policy te his noal trump has been incredibly aggressive in calling out to sancis is six week abortion ban in the state of florina in fact going far as to suggested it to moral to pass hartby bills in the states which again ii do not see how any prolife person can say that you can say eaving it is tactically wrong to suggest a a heartby bill at the federal level becaus not going to pass and is just going to take off in to pennyvoters i understand the tactics but to suggest as a pro life or that it is bag to passager bill is of course ridiculeus here is ta sanc is the answer on abortion a bortion was on the ballat and six stays and twenty twenty two republicans lost all of them net here a parson wi likely beyon the ballat and arizona that is a must wan state governon to santis how are you going to win over independent pro chois boters and arizona same way we did in florida we want the bigreatis to re publican victory in a governor's rates and the history the state over one point five million botes we were winning placeis my mme da county pom beates hat nobody thought was possible a because we were leading with purposing o victs and i reject this idea that pro likefers are to blame for mid termd defeates i thing there is other reasons for that a the former president a thoug he is missing in actionstod night he is had a lok to say about that he should be here explaining his comments to try to say that pro protections are somehow a terrible thing i want him to look into the eyes and tell people who been fighting this fight for a long time ya no good for hisansis good answer an then of course the sance has got attacked over supposed misteaching of slavery in the statesngand this a good defense by disantis here was im the reporter from unifis youn ing an t this the leftwin question from ait from an masan bslatino reporter i'mean is tes basically what univisin iit is a letenal emason be se suggesting that the teaching of slavery in florida talks about the mass of benefits of slavery which of course is not true we tik not his stensibely an the priogrims tolie it very much resembles the associated press standards of th the the the privet of the prior teaching standards then replied in state of florda our prety much mirrored here all sas is that slaves could use skills ty londering slavery opportunistically in order to advance their lives after slavery that is not mean slaverusy good thing theslay it is the samething o suggesting that if you if you went to jail and then you somehow got it agree while you ran jail you used that after you onces jos me jail was grat for you is me jailsing amazing blaze in any case here is i here is it disanses from bunting this ridiculous question slaves te bit of skill we can some instancis cut be a ike pit the prerson o befit you has tat slave the bit of skill in spite of slavery not ecosofit but many our skill hurt for the sentence of slave this is persona what it is your message to them first of all that is a hokes that was perpetrated byke comala hair a singa we are nokit to be doing tat onde secon of all that was written by to sendence of slaves he is are great block history scholars we need to stop playing these ganes here is the deal our country's education system is in te cline because its popos tining doctor nation to nine parents rights we' liminated critical race steory and we now have a merican sivics in the constitution in our schools in a really big way just president ragan ass fore and is far wile adress back in nineteen eighty nine florida i

geisit is all good from from abake the thethe bigest issu of the bakes sir sort in terms of sort f how e speaks to camera is that every issueis the same level of intensity but what he says here is of

forer and thet asem five and itt's literally in te d asem which is a which e list of mental disorders generdos forio or gener identity disorder i get the debate concluded with pretty much everybody trying to explain who they wanted to leave the race what they thought the race was about in the end ther're really only two candidates on the stage wher running to be the presidents of the united states in the end desanston hali everybody else is up there for different reason and you could see it in the answers the last dit question danaprin asgeting lot of craft for this because she said if

excellent precedent but the america first to genda does not belong to one man it does not belong to donald trump it does not belong to me it belongs to you the people of this country and the question is whose could unite this country and take the america first togenda to the next level o ca te thercaci fid thet promise that i's running it is a quic extent egan do that he is an excellent present i love his agenda and we need to take it t the next level he is standing right daring beeting you forty points do leg that that is some people here are running and some people here are not running there

understand in meanwhile donald trump again played the worgan's tragy the when he moves out the lite he instead decided to head on over to plintntownship michigan where hes supposedly speaking to auto workers unclear how many autor workers acturally showed up to this thing since the ua ubl as in jobiton's pocket because he is in their pocket he says in a roberos of pocket being in in any case donald donald trump goes there and he and he speaks about the auto workers and get some have lines this is smart powlitic can by trump again he he is he does have an inate instinct for getting attention and for misdirecting me cameras to a place he wants them be which is wiet is all fired frustrating that for the last eight years donald trump his not use that magical powerners tdirect attention where it should be in any case he goes to michigan anda and he jumps in ona on his trade o trunda suggesting that globalization or what he calls globalism not quite the santhing may the globalism is responsible for ut for what is going on shoul give me for more years and i will give you the end to this horrible globalism that is killing our country i can yo to re turn of the united states of americas the greates an stronges a dus onation a i on oer to gan the we will this manof the corrup power structure that is feasted an the suffering of the american auto worker and the workers of any kind not just oto workers workers of any kind we will cast for power the financial forces that have turned american sities and to ghostouns to build skyscrapers in baging china we will wield every lever of government to defend you ant to hold accountable those who av profit from the betrayal and suffering up the american factory workers satosy as your forty seventh president of the anentstates i will be your protector i will be your advocate and i will be your greatest chantin te grinscha an i ih that alout of the suffis trudso i think that manufacturing trousing an come flowing back into the united states thanks to presideen trump i canmy i do not i do not think that anybody has the capacity to bring manufacturing cobs nineteen fifty stau manufacturing obs fact tor the united states that is not what the statistic show however is that a solid mid western rusbelt pitch sure it his better pitcer is going after the by administration for the electric vehicle mandate this obviously is truke here is here is trumk yesterday in michingan en dey want i will turminao by in electric veico manda i will can tole recop cilling reculation that i struction american auto workers i will unleesh a thing called american energy stop the ban on the in turnor compustion angon and we will rill bab dill an we will wi and i'm agan all of that is got any smart for trum to go to michigan gets attention away from the dbate now the biggest issue that trump is about to face is actually this fraud case believ he're not all of the criminal violations that he may or may not have committed i think three of the four crolinal cases are beasset think one on classfied documents is very difficult for him to defeat just in the in the actual court of law because he says ontape that he does the grime but those are not really the biges threats in the biggest threats him in the thing i'm i'm sure that he is worre the most about is this fraud case in new york now the fraud caseis absurd it is nrom surd case law in the state of new york i looked it up yesterday the law in the state of new york suggest that the government is capable of what they call disgorgements of profits of a business even if no crime has actioun ben committed against any one s they are not chargeing wit the crime they are not they are not convicting you of fraud you have not to fraud in any one in the sense that the person who you supposedly bamboozled is not suing you it is heou and i make a real state deal i inflate the value of my real state assets i'm inflatingthe valued by real istate assets you make me the lone we both profit there is no loss by you in the state of new york you do not have to show loss the state of new york does not have to show loss there is nough to ben criminal fraud they can then push for disgorgemen of profits by filing a civil lossut and tha's precisely what happened in the state ofnew york to the tune of two hundred and fifty million dollars against trumps businesses which is wild i mean that is wild that is a that is that is a crazy regiment of law that if they detact they think civilly that you committed as series of frauds andotherwore to just completely kept inflating the value of your assets in order to a get deals at at lower intrestrats the make new yor inflaghting they gavyo the lone anyway the stake can then come in post facto after every one is benefited and done grat and the state has got more taxes cas everybody degrate and they can disgorge the profits from you by identifying a pattern or practice of fraudulent conduct it is ninning about finding at harm there is no harm now normally in a case h have to show harm hereng yam hav to shaw harm yust go after people here is what is happeing in that case according to the your times in your tjudge ruled on tuesday that trump persistently comitted fraud by inflating value of his assets and stripp the farmer president of control over some of his signature new york properties there is a real prome for trum if all his properties going to receivership that is a heavy duty burden on his asets if he is using those assets to say take loans out against the assets in order to raise legal funds that is not available to him it is a serious issue for him elect torally speaking according to the yor times the supprising decision by just as arthor angeron is a major victory for a turning general at tisu james in her lossout against ta trump effectively deciding no trial is needed to determind that he had frauginally secure favorable trums on lones an insuranceteels hamesis argued that trump inflated the value of his properties by as much as too poing to billion dollars and i seeking a penalty of about two undred fifty million doll lers in a trial schedule to begin is early his monday now if that goes forward and these properties are puttinto receivership what that means that trump cant manage his on businesses those business is now god to the hands of a third porty receiver who decides how to dispose of the assets two pay off creditors for example and one of those creditors now would be the state of new york to the toune of to un or fifty million dollars trum for his part said that justice en gron was a democraty calle them deranged while the travelold determin the size of the enalty angron's ruling grance of oe of the biggest punishments at james sought the cancillation of business certifit gets that allow some of trumps in york properties to operate a move that coul have major reprocustions for the trump family business the decision could terminate his control over a flagh of commercial property at forty wall street and lower manhatten a family estate westchester county the trump tower an mintown manhatten his golf club in west chester it would not dissolve the company but the ecision could have a sweeping in pact on the companies new york operations would shut down in entity that employs hundreds of people working for him in new york effectively destroying the company this is a serious full frunt to assault on donald trumps financial wherewith all his asset base in the state of new york which is where the majority o his assets are located and not only that incumberas the assets for his kids even if trumper stuff off the political stage to morrow even if god forbid sim they were to happen him to morrow it would then encumber the assets for his children this is a real threat two donald trump because it bean if he doeso doe that money to run his campaign where isome one ogn to come from presumably ton keep coming fom downers or ouning money to his campaign e's ging to use it to pay off all of his legal bills none of that moneyscgins getsmen on electioneerin 's yorn's i rout election inter ference this case actually might be the largestack of lection interference in the entire election cycle and that something pople should take in to account again if what you care about is victory over jobidon massive burdens on the republican front runner make it very difficult for him to win yes therea been some positioe poles for donald trumpet in the recent pass where allso youre and a half out from the election four criminald cases have yget to take place and if his assets going to receivership he is got a serious problem on his hands herein lies the problem and this is the case that really nobody made the toe bate last night it is a very simple case no one on the stagi is lost to jobidon here is only one person who is lost to jobidn donald trump ylost o jobin an twenty twenty run me right that is what every one oll statiould ben sang thes last night run me i do not los tobidon you dinsyht poles but those same poles suggest that donald trump is running dead even with jobidon and again donald trump thugh those pulls had hillerd com as can be donal trum there is only one thing we do know is that in an actual voting tust donald trump lost two jobidon and if your ruling take tat risk agan go donal trump but whore he could go with somebody who has not lost to jobidon before if vac trobidons made petty clear that he would to run against donal trump my that is the case that everybody basically should ave ben making on the stage last night and nobody action made that case which is always kind of surprising to me again the poles are l over the place eres another pole out to day from the economist you go and shoes bidn up five inside the spase of a week you have an eighty see nhois wash ington postpothrom trumpepten and then you have ne conmis tugov poles showing by nut five i that is a fifteen points wing that is were the hello i do not now where th polls are whet i do knot is that trump has very major stemac hurdles that he is geen to have to overcome then he is he thiss not in easy election for him by any structure the imagination and every single legal roin comes down against him justifi d or unjust fight it does not mather whether decision is right or wrether the decision is wrong the onlyving the matters is whether it stops from from from beating jobidoen and meanwhile gavan knew some who is desperately hanging around in the hopes that jobidin dies mean that that is all i can imagin he is doing here because the years twenty twenty four not twenty twenty eight his sitting governor californiam he shut up at the debate he crash the party and shut up at the debate i do not no one knows why except that that you desperately wants attention besto mean i saw about him recently is every time gavan news from smiles he looks a movi villain who just poisoned you which fac cha tru i jet set it in from the nineteen eighties is the the lead character in american pcsycho is younot takin in the back room put nons him put on some hip to be square in sare going at you with an ax gavenusm in any case here is gavenusom crashing the party governor won i giin e tewar o o be oi mer i think it will be clear trum comes out the goene forse after the stopy i min this is the ex ethis it en e cannot a sain this is may be may be o ispresiect what you doing hs guis are getting laoosnitinn close is notin in tiand i wets most tintestin mes e tha ex nasectwher the exon thi sho

ther wasting everybody's time and i say ti e lovin espect n what are you doings in then some of the advertiseins bin this counte i tise bat he ony want o to im because they know that on te mill again i repeat the question what is this duf is doing there what is he doing there do you shup tacs i fel gansranimally he shup to the j v gam j vy volley bol game on a on a randam wednesday night is that is thatything that you do ve ver very strange behavior from gavenusm then gavenuwsome drops ang even stranger thing we know that gavenusum is slated to have at the end of iblieve next month he is gon to have debate with ron to santis and should be really interesting he is an he is are two very different visions of governing the country the sansis wants the debate because he wants to beeld to take it two gavenusum and demonstrate since he s his bidmont debate him that the stand in for biding is very bada governing he is hopin it will give maboos newsom wants if he is anything that they gets gavenusumoun tev is something gavenusum wonte gavenusom then bizarley went on a went on a show on ac and explain that because rontosantis his debating him this tis qualifies him is president which is superweird tag is the newsom has been following around to santis asking for debate and finally tdosantitur round to t r what is do it and then newshims hha you cannot be presdent caus you are dbating

an you thin is till the a candidate of ember thiry usino at any quesston part of me wonders you the fct that he took this to bat the fact that he took o bate he relation to this te bat 's he is completien clovit a the present instane that is my humble replies that your bating an with the debate o forsin he wasn te bating a gis woneen when he for presidenn when he is when e for present he showin o it the ratan library hollow ground and he puts out an ad to day not firs presidentor campan to promoted the bat against the governor californ i mean this gise tostracted mn he is a big weirdham he is a big big weirdham debate me but if you do debate me that means your bad is it is a very weird take from gavenus om who is again sjust sitting around hoping the jobin dize let us be realed office it is all he wants in life these he figures that since he is running a shadow campaign if that happens then then he picks up te pieces meanwhile again jobides ad ministration continue to be ableep sho is the thing that is keeping republican's competitive in this race p buddhijadge the secretary of transportation who theoredically should be the one involved in whs the sectorary of transportation in the ou a double you issues or secrtor of labor should be in vo not yobidon jobdon shows up the picket lines we discussed yesterday on the program in one of most corrupt acts of ever

worked out at the table to day an you cannot speak to thus i have not coud who sbeaks he fact ed the president went were you a double you had on picket line he speaks that gent this tisdministration is just awful meanwhile the d de ministrator is out their admitting that fentinel is pouring into the country va mexico and tat wise the worder open ty all about the gathe an exploiin why it is difficult scopi first of all i think we shoan start even at the be get at which is that fental is the tat lea strik thract we have ever faith it is also incredibly cheap to make and it is easy to transport are hig because these tiny quantities the amounthi confet on te tip of a pencil are are deadly and this has concletely changed the faite of narcotic traficing in the world these are man made senthatic trugs starting with these chemicals coming from china going to mexico where they are made intephentinal powder and then often prast into pills the powder and the pills are coming ar cross into tyou ast i'm then why is the the border open that would be the big question gand jobidn' very very bad at the presidencing i'll ga time for some thngs i and then some things that i hate things that are since i'm an israel i constantlyget asked for you non travel recommendations while you arean israel here is one of lobit offa beaten pathers tons of amazing stuff in jerusalem r there is amazing sights masata but here is one that the kidswill really there is something in israel it is in a iplice call bit chemish calle the biblical museum of natural history and it is very very cool basically this museum was started by a rabbi who looks at the bible in light of science and he goes through the bible and he and he looks it what the language of the bible means with regard to animals for example when it talks about deer in the bible the word for deer actually means bazell but because people were translatin the bible wern't living israel thatin no the species that actually they were talking about when they translated the bible and you actually hve to go back to the original it is it is is very interesting and cool stuff it is again a merzur of science and religion that is really worth the visits hs yould go checked at out the biblical museum on natural history tok my kits theire yesterday and it was indeed a lot of fond if youre looking for more travel recommendations if you ever come to israel i'm happy to give them in fact i thin ore ongt be putting ot more material than you'r future about some places you should in definitely should not go if you are visiting around herol gate time for some things that i hate they last night in philadelphyet every liquor store in the city closhes every single liquor store in the city they closhe because several locations were looted shortly after the conclusion of peaceful protest against they judges decisions to dismiss all charges against a former philadelphia police officer in a fatal traffic stopshoting the police made dozens of rest following tuesday night's luting and they said they are prepared make more of things got out of hand on wednesday evening out of out of concerned for public safety they shut all forty nine reto line and liquor stores in philadelphia which is the the sign of a well fpunctioning cities you shut all of your retail establishments because you are afraid that people in a lutta living crab out of it in fact there restape of juvenal's looting mulspal stores in philadelphia this was tuesday night here is hat look luders ransack inseteritic fors first then policetei tat port richmond and ortti philadelphia as caravans of kidsantin roe fast from location to locatia here is what we have learned overnight at least twenty people are under a rast two guns or re covered at least one bolse car was damaged and there are no recort of injuries and betendt readin tilinhaw liveanthetertadin near one ofthe bis is luted a rend police say the letters wer taking advantage at ta paceful protest involving the deatly shuting of any arisory der police calling these luders criminal uper tunis to a went out after this peaceful protest had ended hitting stores the lululenin this is en written housequares of busy night witnessis report seing a hundred or moreteens young people even some chilldren ransacking stores it is going amazing is goine grate the cops were completely outnumbered clearly the issue here is police brutality not mass criminality there is one cop there look comany criminals o they a cannot ahand ias laty ju sinning there in filmang an a laughing hosterically that is grape one protestor was a wat standing usasor shouting everyone must eat it is a communis uprising in which everyone requires their big stran hve vrybdoyou mean drink it is e licters i'm andta and meanwhile people screaming that they are free iphones for everyone as well as that is exciting got a got a nail that that self onstorn grad yoursolf an ifun question where are the parents where are the cops why have the cops nop an allowed to arrest every single one of the people and their parents why is it that we are supposed to pretend that mass criminality if it is disproportionately of one particular race is in fact something justifiable i promise you that ifthey ware vast vast crowds of looting white teens goeanst the center of philadelphia and stealing things i do not think at you be o be getting a kind of national media black out that you have ben receiving for this particular sretten by latted philadelphi is not the only city thats been hit by the stuff shicogo has ben hit by the stuffsyatdleas been hit by the stuff li sangelists been hit by the stuff obviously race ties into it it was tied into the protest in the first place the entire li that the police are systemically races has led to a feeling among a certain a certain small subset of a certain group that believes that they are impervious to actual law abidingness that they have a right to go into stores and an steal things now imneand understand how person has the moral impetest to believe that you have the right to steal a thing where is that come from somebody olvious he feels morally justifight everyone must eat fhree eephones for everybody laughing hysterically while people unmas commit acts of criminality in the copsrn there to stop them i mean this is this is societily ruinous stuff but it is being tre ted with a with a with kid gloves specifically because if you were to say the oppsit which is criminality of any race is desgusting despicable and criminal should go to jail and we more cops to rest more people who commit crimnal acts t t they all go to jail if they commit criminal acts anybody who commits criminal ack shou go to jail if that were the actual take then the immediate response from lufflby tis proportion nmber black people going to jail racist terrible furicops we know is exactly what happening two thousand and twenty man the wages of the wages

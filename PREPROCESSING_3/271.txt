us at on but you dont noum lulu wam has this case study of people not admitting the truth when my grandmother was dignosed with stage four long cancer she was given three months to live she was eighty years old and my family for reasons i'll get into in a minute decided not to tell her i was toldly against this when i heard the news i wanted to talk with my grandmother comfort her i wanted to greeve with her in the way that seems natural when some one you love is dying but my mam she is the one who called me to give me the bad news quickly inform me that what i wanted that what i thought was the right thing to do would not be permitted and that i would have no say in the matter i was stunned my grandmother or ny ni as i call her lives in china a long with a lot of my other relatives my parents and i live here in the united states i really close to mynini at two years old i lives with her and my grandfather for a year my mam could work my naht is five foottall with a full head of pirmed white hair she is small but when my nin i walks into a room every one lis i was not the only one who felt weird keeping this a secret my dat thought about going to his mam and telling her she was dying but douwhat i could not take care er because i my wol family bagyou li sac i i mas yo her i then i woll yet woul to take there ris thoussfully he bealessly my mom it is true my dad was not the one on the ground looking after nini he levt china when he was just a tea nature his older brother has lived in japan for twenty four years the person who was on the ground was not as younger sister you not ar tat how did it bean i na a you do not you manging ni ow har tayaner now this is her my nini sister my great ant she look almost idendical to nini in chinese i call her salye ni which translates to little aunt grandma but i'll just call her little nina for this story little nin i lives in the apartmen rihe upstairs from nin and their very close she was the one who picked up the results of nanas physical it is customary an china for doctors to give bad news to family members rather than giving it direckly to the patient especiually if the patient is older nin as doctor recommended that nini be immediately hospitalize for treatment wat e an e o at nardry de wonder up wit ea she saying the doctor told her the cancer was very advanced do not hospitalize her would be irresponsible of course in order to hospitalize nini it means they would actually have to tell her she is sick what o e aola se a ne e daa a a you wul ye degi ae a e wa dan ado dami ani you donola little nin i told the doctor that nyn is too old that she could not handle of blow life this it is not just that little nin i did not want to upset her sister with a news of her death she actually believe that not telling her was a way to prolong her life knowing nin as personality little nin i worri that her sister would get overwhelmed with fear and depression she would stoppe eating she would stopped sleeping she would lose interest in life the chinese believe that mental an emotional health are completely linked to physical health a what are your you your yo o mi dama she tells me there is a chinese joke she people go get a physical one of them is healthy and one of them has a terminal illness the hospital gets the results mixed up the healthy person gets the terminal prognosis and vice versa then the healthy person and of dying while the sick person and up living je she ga sel wash jen te saa to day i ma co ecutya that is me asking little nini is that really a joke it is not very funny ye na yr a daa a she assured me that it was my family got a second opinion and then a third same prognosis three months may be less little nin i knew she needed a fague medical report to show nina she went to a print shop they told her we cannot create a false medical record if you one a make something up we could photocopy it for you little nn i whited out the real dignosis and wrote down words that sounded vaguely medical but on alarming something about the nin shadows my family built on that lie with and even more elaborate one we realize we had a problem how wire we all going to manage to see nini before she die family from three countries needed to say good bye without laynnii know we were actually saying good bye this would require more than white out my dad had an idea si si a ri a w your uncle may be we can just yo stage your sis wa er won ye r are you proud that you came up with this idea o yu am teo am y everybody cun seetered me is to yeu thi latis e your refir a ma ters wee this was our plan a giant good by party disguised as a giant wedding banquet this is a why that everybody agree to wye and shers how it was can ogo down my uncle hyben's son danlya had recently married a japanese woman they plans to celebrate in china the next year that now it would be in two weeks and it would bring together family members who had not all been in the same place for twenty five years my at told nii that the wedding banquet had to happen immediately because that was when the groom gallian could get the time off work how did you feel athat lying always tary cer cat this is a lines te gus ye ere ver lies that i you don wat be tis si go siis you gat gegeyou yo wager that lie yeu geyo li o big ye ges tus the way gatyou every you do not what an thats the way ga i suppose but that was not the way i wanted it or thought it was supposed to be and i still was not convinced it would be what nani wantet i was emotional that my mamm said maybe i should not go that i might cry and blow the cover i was afraid she might be right but if i wanted to see nin before she died i had to go and i had to be part of the lie aaw this is from a bitie i took i sort of filming as soon as i land i brougt the camp quarter with me to hide behind hoping it would help me to kee it together it the arrivals kay i heard ni i shouting my name through the crowd she wasn' difficulty spot a squat figure waving a han hanker si from the front of the crowd she was at least a foot shorter than every one else and her white hair stood oud oh my granddaughter she cried she looked me up and down you are not very skinny she observed your mamm says you would been very busy with work i thought you would be skinny but you are not that skinny nin i did not look or ac some one who was sick at all i asked her how she was feeling and she said she was doing well she had some neepain from the years she marched across the country with the people's liberation army when she was fourteen if it were not for my bad nees she said i'd be perfect my parents were delayed an baging that night but the rest of the family gathered around nini's dinner table little nini held her little white dog on her lap a dog they call ellen they named ellen after an american exchange student who had stayed with them e one trick that she can normally do on command everyone here is yelling seeing allen saing sing and then finally after dinner uncle ha being walk me to the near by hotel where i was stand nni is in one of the older neighbourhoods in the area there are still unpaved paths and small food stands but her street is being slowly engulfed by shopping malls and high rises nine i's very sick uncle said as we walked she took care of you when you were little she loves you much he kept saying things i ready knew things that felt he was trying to provoke and emotion out of me ou have to be very careful not to tell her he said you'l feel very sad but you cannot cry looking back i wonder if he was really just trying to coach himself you have to be happy he insisted i know i said as i stared straight ahead at the brightly let billboards across the street i most events the emotional protocol is clear you smile at wett ans you cry at funerals the confusing thing here was that this was one situation masquerating as another in china you are actually expected to cry at a funeral a lot as a sign of respect people judge you on how well you cry and how much you cry my uncle understood this protocall and my grandfather yeay his funeral in nineteen ninety four uncle hybean was tasked with the duty of performing a cathartic chinese ritual to demonstrate his great grieving as the eldest son this was his designated roll he stood in the aisle in front of the coffin and raise the clay boll over his head while crying loudly he smashed the bowls of the ground shattering it into countless sharts my mother hates these kinds of huge emotional displays by the way at her father's funeral years ago her family criticized her for not crying enough the people over there tey the expect you just fan te flor and the thi creasy people and the shshout he nd cry this is china part of you little der tradition the people thy they hire the people an ye you will have money you'l hire a hundred people come here jas cries the en tol sree cry and the wen ol sree tat i hate that the next morning my parents finally arrive wher o a'mvidio taping as ni i greets my dad at the door asking him all kinds of questions about his wliht about a recent dentle surgery he had the rest of the family hovers close by and i can see that my dd is emotional that he cannot say a single word he cannot even looker in the eyes he tries to be playful and takes off her hat than fiddles with his own sun glasses trying to distract himself later i was finally able to ask him what he was feeling when he walked through that door well you now us just likey now every or u nw thining that your mo than eis ti an you cannot tell and tow thinkin that thest tee probably the last time that you see u oll the farness is a on you everybody say and everybody knows was gon except you except o mol i was afraid to say something than te yo yo yo you geou cannot hopeless or is ar criet riht youal to say somethy but a littl with us it is it just no thus no worst to choose from at one point nin i asks him what is wrong even though he does not respond it is she can feel the weight of his grief and she just starts sobbing no i wondered if she knew why we were all there or maybe when you are eighty this is just how you great your son who live far away on there are other relatives around and my dad walks away from that night to get some space on the vidio you can hear my mam and her dat her voice up be trying to light in the moon he mo ye ra after a while ni i takes her usual roll as the matriarch and gathers every one around edin w charge o she reminds us why we are all here the big event a ladow and his wife's marriage yes my elim's wedding is the big event my dat confirms quietly we all urged nin to relax but she is busy getting everyone is or priarities you ceck on the banquet hall you guis nee to prepare your wedding speeches you need to get over your jetlag ty neneee ongle yano hall yanyo ha tohold ye seeing nani who ye probably should be in the hospital yet worked up over thes phony wedding banquet while we stood by and watched it felt cruel i went to nyna's niece what call gugu with my concerns gugu lives close by and also helps look after nat ni i asked her what if nana has things she wants to take care of what gugu responded i said i do not know none of us do that is my whole point no gugu said she does not have anything that and that was the end of the discussion te wedning celebration was held in h banquet hall of a newly built hotel theala had on a black suit with a pale pink tie his japanese wife wore a blue chivon dress with a floral shop guests approache nini to congratulate her smiler a politician at a press event nani smiled back she shook hands she kissed babies when it came time for the speeches uncle hybeng my dad's brother took to the stage first he fumbled a while with a microphone before looking up it is a rare opportunity for us all to be here to day he started you all new lalan as a young child before we left china and now he is become a man he is brought a wife back with him from japan uncle motion to lealan's wife who could not understand a word of chinese i think we are all hoping that next time they return they will carry with them a baby or two the room chuckled thelon translated this to his wife and her face flushed there is just one more thing uncle said his voice starting to quiver they say that a mother's greatest joy is having her children by her side my m has sadly not had that fortune he meant because he and my dad lived far away she is lucky to have all of you to care for her he stared at nini in the audience and then as if in slow motion tears began to stream down his face i thought of uncle hybein a yeis funeral gripping that clay bowl over his head as every one watched anticipating the explosion into a thousand pieces but this was not a funeral ir was a wedding no crying only happy he had warned me himself just the night before they were all watching nana was watching there was no turning back everything i am everything i've become is because i's my ma this release is the dam he begins to weep uncontrollably on stage his shoulders strakin ee eto ma were the desk mam in the entire world i looked over at naini who dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief was she moved was she suspicious looking at her i could not tell after the speeches the bridin groom moved from table to table making toast it did not take a mine reader to see that nin i did not the new japanese wife i think she is quite dumb nani said she does not understand anything that is b ecause she does not speak chinese i reminded her no she insisted it is because she is dumb the brid in groom were not use of the heavy drinking rituals of the northern chinese and got drunk fast i mean they had to drink at every single table dalan the groom constantly look he was about to cry and after drinking he could no longer hold it in he started to ball until his face turned bright red his wife's eyes were wide with panic as she scanned the room for help gugumotion wildly to me from across the room as we all swooped in to try and form a barricade around the sobbing room we told nin that teana was probably just too happy that he was crying tears of joy the night after the wedding we all went out to a restaurant after a massive feast who played a drinking gan y y nin i laughed hard that she cried and then laughd some more it was hard to distinguish which smiles were real and which ones were faked for nini's sake while i struggled with the grief of saying good bied nni focussed on the future a future she assume she would be part of when you get married she told me i'll have an eveen bigger wedding banquet for you she also asked when it have a baby saying that she was looking forward to holding my child i had no idea when any of that might happen but i played along we planned what my wedding banquet would look and talked about how to balance my career once i had this hypothetical kid lying made me sick to my stomach listend my mam tried to reassure me your nini would appreciate that were lying to her otherwise why would she have done the same thing to your grandfather this was the first time i'd heard of this i was only ten when yeya was diagnose with livery cancer as it turns out no one told him about his condition either as his wife nini was the key decision maker in that situation he had severe johndis and was barely looced when nin i finally gave him the bad news in the hospital i need to tell you something old timer she began he su cumb to the cancer three days later i askd my dat about this and he said in truth yeya knew no one told him but deep down people can feel when theyre really dying they knew and he knew but every one pretended not to know they could all allow each other to save face did nini also know was she also lying to us later little nini told me that there was in fact a secret that nini ha kept from us oane ni na hayo diteyou oh no the shape what wom noble dredald that is the sound of me being totally shot she tells me that in two thousand seven six years before the lung cancer dige noses nini had been daagnose with breast cancer not unusual for a woman in her seventies but my da did not know my uncle did not know i did not know she had mustack to me and she would been wearing a prosthetic breast for nine years nini concealed is from our family and uncle's family not because she was ashamed but that we would not worry all this time that we were lying to her to protect her she had also put on a show to protect us after i left china i immediately sciped nini from home i love you she said in english the few words that she knows a ma nish to find time to skipe with her every day just a checkin at first she seemed to be doing fine and had nosom tems then one day she started to cough and my heart sank i just have a bit of the flue she said it is nothing when the cough would not go away she suggested going to the doctor's office to pick up some medicine little nin i panicd and immediately talked her out of it but then a few days later nin i stopped coughing dhree months came and went and nin was still just fine every one was baffled eventually i could not keep up with the daily skype calls and it dwindle down to once a week and then once a month a year passed nin i said she felt fine she just decided to skip her annual check up that year and another year passed during her two thousand fifteen check up the same doctor gave the same diagnoses and procnoses stage for lung cancer very serious no more than three months this time little nin i did not even bother to mock up a phony document she just told nin i that she had lost a test results but that everything was the same everything was fine it is been three years now since nin i was first iknose little nin is certain her big sister is still alive because of her decision to lie to her because we gave nini joy instead of worry my mamm told me about an old chinese belief called chones ton means to rins out and see is joy chonesy is the belief that you can washi away a misfortun with joy even though this term was never use while planning the wedding that is essentially what we did and by the way every one in the family has their own idea of what saved tat night goge thinks it is partly because of her weekly prayers at the local dawis temple my uncle cried it is nine i survival to some expensive miracal probiatics he boughter from japan since nne i seemed to be doing fine my parents suggested getting a less expensive bran of probiotics and uncle hy been freaked out if we switch it an she dies then it is on you when this whole thing started i felt the only rational person in my family the lone westoner to fending my grandmother against old fationed beliefs as it turns out my mamma agreed with me but she and my dad just understand both sides i pretty sure a lot of other americans would feel the way that i felt that it somebody is get a die it is their right to know ya and the by we des sin that tat your busness you will not you will not leive wiyts her an te o e but did you but you understand where i was coming from do you understand why i was conflicted ya i know but that is china that is at dee fer in the world o hey people g to funeral and you will have to hold a peel around the house stree sree times and insis cantri youll do not do that ray you will you nither yous your counter tofll youll poh to them thisn mak chaos i wonder now if my mamor dad was diagnose with something terminal and i knew and they did not whut i lie to them and if it was me wout i wanto know whet my family did was kine and it worked maybe i'm reminded of a joke about a physicis visiting his collague neels bore and expresss surprise at finding a good loock horse she hanging on the wall shurly not superstitious oh no nos por says but i'm told at works whether you believe in it or not i know that does not seem a joke that whan i'm saying e e a aa na anaa agua tis a fo maker the first feature called postumous comes out this summer coming out the stuff that all of us do not know we do not know scientis actually tries to measure it the sent of of tit for chicaco bobagradio when our programme continues tismerican my from mar a class to days programm in defensive ignorance stories making the case for not knowing the case i admit you do not hear very often we averived at dac two of a programm at two ignorance for dummis the first half of our show we heard a woman who as kept in ignorance by your family in this halfe of the sheulgan a turn to people who ware just ignorant they just do not know stuff they do not know what they do not know which hello theres out to be all of us shall call has details and e purical deta there is the story about ignorance that david dunning really loves he is a psychology professor and he is even cigted it in his research it is about a gy name to macarthur wheeler who in nineteen ninety five robbed a couple of banks and pennsylvania and did not wear a mask and he was arrested and the police a basely said what we have you on the surveillant sapes and he said doyo do not and they showed him the tapes and he saw his face ent ah he stared incredulously and said abut i wore the juice i wore the juice the juice yes apparently a macarthur wheether was under the impression that smearing your face with lenen juics made it fuzzy er invisible to vidio cameras o toe his credit he had actually tested this theory he took is selfy but i think he mesame the camera the thing about m carthur wheeler was not just that he was an idiot it was that he thought he was doing everything right which made david dunning thing when people are wrong or when theyre performing poorly or for lack of a better word when their in competent do they know thei'r incompetent and he had a guess which was no they do not know their incompetent it we decided to a do some experiments and find out now this may not sound something you can easily test for 's trying to measure the height and weight of somebody is in security but professor dunning and his grad student partner just in cruger figured out away to do at they got different groups of undergrads together this as a cornell university and gave them one of three tuizzes one was on grammar another on logical reasonang and another wearely on humor which one of these jokes is the funniest an a panel of camedians rate the jokes ahead of time and at the end of the quizzas they asked each student a simple question how well do you think you did or more specifically in what per centile did you land that is what percentage of the other students taking the test do you think you beat and then they gathered together all of that dat a and ran the numbers and i still remember looking at the first grap a to this day and the big finding is we took a look at the bottom twenty five per cent of people in each study al these ar the people who had done the worst there scores are faling in the eleventh the twelfteh the thirteenth percentile inother words really low scores but they think they'r performing the sixtieth the sixty fifth the seventieth per centile among the better percentiles that is right they think that they ah beat out af majority of their peers aone way to think about it if you look at people basically where about to get deasy asse with the examly've just handed ain they think they are getting bes beplusses with the examply just handed ain in short there seeme to be a direct correlation between inconpetence and in overweening sense of self confidence it was not apparent in every poor performing student but it was in the majority of them most people who did badly thought they did just fine or even great they had no idea no anybody whoas ever gone to school worked a job or known any other people knows this phenomenon is that guy or lady whose coky and yet has no idea what their doing and it is infuriating that here in dunnings lab it was not just an annoyance it was a repeatable finding they did this experiment four times with four different groups of students and it happened every time bottom performers thought they were at least above average and in nineteen ninety nine dunning in cruger published their findings ind a paper called unskilled and unaware of it and their conclusion was this when some one asks how do you think you did and you open your mouth to answer your drawing on the same skill set to answer that question that you used to answer the questions on the test that is the lack of skill meas that only a good maga ot ofof stakes but it also bes ou not can beable to catch mistakes yours ore anybody elses you are going to think often that buthyer sain is absolutly reasonable ah this is the double curse it is not that your ignorant and also happened to be over confiden you are ignorant and it makes you over confident on the other hand students who scored well really were in the higher persentiles they tended to guess that they scored a little worse than they actually did and for kind of an endearing reson they figured most of the kids around them knew as much as they did in other words they were not mistaken about themselves they knew themselves pretty well they simply misjudged other people thinking probly as smart as i am over the years dunning and other researchers have run the same experiment in different ways over and over again and the result was pervaser competitive debaters who were doing badly did not know they were doing badly people a chest tournaments trap in sket shooters when theire quist on gunsafety medical professionals medical professionals you will find for some procedures a for example that the inturns atherinszation procedures exactly ah sof them think they know the signing well they can teach yit to other people whereas zero of their instructors agree in fact fifty percent of their instructors ay know this persen us still to be supervised whenever they do this i go falt ye and all psychological phenomena this one pretty quickly grew a name dunning was insistent that he and cruger had nothing to do with the coinning of that name the name the dunning cruger effect you few ah for example go on twitter and typeen donning crug you will see it the effect mention several times a day several times af day several times a day why have a computer in front of me agoing to twitter we just put n donning cruger ah oh here we go tramp is a static display of dunning cruger in effect ah where did you get your biology p h t dunning cruger university youre clueless rants merely reenforce your ignorence teys asoah very happy to get a mean out theire in the world unhappy that it it yet somebony people usit as at epithet that is your name thatheire using t exacly i's just become a scientific way of calling somebody stupid which i guess we were sorely in need of but i think the thing that a people in general miss is that a were we are not toing about the brain of the incompetent were talking about the brain of all of us because sooner or later we step into that group ah sooneror later we become the poor performers we all have ar a specific pockets of in competence and we know some of them but they'r lot of them we simply do not know and once we step into our own in competence a we do not know we have made the step this is really the disheartening stoner insight of this research if you think you are doing well it means one of two things ither you are doing well or you are not doing well at all try not to think about it too long really david doning who has thought about it more than any one says it is made him particularly vigilant about the things he says and does how he acts i trying to catch a handed glimpse of yourself in a mirror this one time for instance he was teaching a glass giving them an exam and at the end of it he asked the students the doning croker question how do you think you did and sure enough when he looked back at the tests he notice this one kit in particular got one of the lowest grades in the group and raded it himself in the ady at the percentile and i decided i whi am cou a pique at the name because i i just have a suspicion i'm going to see this person aid my offinceand indeed when the test was headed back yeu did come into my office ah because he did want to offer me a chance agraciously to admit that the answers that i had designated as correct on the exam were actually wrong ah ah and he is really trying to hard to be gracious i could see some vibrations of outrage ah in his body and part of my brain is going and watch this analyzs what is going on what psycholotially happening they ve got another part by brain kand going are you sures mut to you ar yau srts tabecause i think it would be embarrassing aa for a person who has propose the dunnyg crok refraing work to ah actually publicly displayed onin crooker ah but the sad sad truth is what i dearly love a would be a to be able to see me in this circumstance ah to be aware of o ka ah he i am having at any croker momah at ahaccording to my own theory i'll never have it that is because other people can see when we are doing the doning crooker dance but we cannot which makes you think why does not anybody say anything when it is little steff your lies down yet stuff in your face youre real friends and even some strangers we will tell you but somehow when you'r blowing a huge word balloon full of wrongness that is when the rest of us decide to be polite to go along caus to correct that we ardly confident know nothing jerk in the office just seems mean it is nour place but maybe it is meanor not to correct him the real sadness for me is that often people are going to suffer for their mistakes ah but they are never going to know it because if a person is a jerk in the office ah what happens is all the parties they are not invited to aah the wonderful social interactions they just do not get to experience and it is likely that they do not notice the absence of this you do not know you are incompetent ah you cannot figer it out in your awn and the world is treating you by bein silent well how do you improve yourself under those conditions i should say the dunning and crooker's research has been criticized over the years other researchers have tried to punch holes in their conclusion even going far as to publish papers with alternative statistical ex planations or doning in croker's findingce and doning says he and his partner have responded to those critics in brind and may have convinced some thut certainly not all of them which he actually takes to be a plus because the critics they have not convince are really confident in their opinions and doning an cruger are really confident in theirs one or the other is dead wrong and just does not know it o shall call is one of the produces of or show a three forget me not i brog them to days about ignorance of course a huge part of all ofour ignorance is the stuff that we used to know that we have all forgotten all our lives there is huge underto of forgetting that sucks old classmates names into the abyss the french that we studied that we never used in pots and cas of favorite movies we used to love thas this of course see this is a curse couding stephany foo i have several large unwieldy boxes stacked in corners of my apartment i almost never open them tut i've slept these boxes to the twelve tiny apartments i've lived in in the past decate they are full of no books external hard drives thousands or sheets of paper photographs fe cest tapes full of all my memories starting journals i wrote when i was five years old the idea that there are whole weeks even months of my life that have just disappeared into the biss of forgetfulness is horrifying to me if i cannot take these memories with me to the rest of my life then what is the point of even living them in the first place to hold on to the past a couple times a month i'll sit in my kitchen table one in my apartmen and i'll just start recording these long soliloquies about whatever here is one actual recording from february twenty fourth two thousnd fourteen eleven p m a six pack of corona and pacifico as eleven dollars which i thought was superchurchous and i tried to buy whatever a for pack of cans of corona cans an he as a that is nine dollars that ils well i might as well just by the hoan six pacts causensure in the year twenty thirty that memors can be hol all this is say that my obsession with my ever fleeting memories is what made me really excited when i heard about this condition called h s a m it stands for highly superior autobiographical memory june tenth two thousand six tell me what was the weather and what day was that jo tenth two thousand six was a saturday and remember it was a nice sunmy day because i was outside for gratuation party i was actually ddang the aparty that was one of my aparttin jobs in college jo de grandis is one of only about sixty people in the world who have bee officially found to have h sam and by the way i checked it was a saturday and in jigran falls ohio sunny joe remembers very specific details from every single day of the last twenty five years of his life i'm sitting across at table from hm when i ask him these random questions he was not crapped on any of them he is not using his fone to look anything up when were the oskars in nineteen eighty nine the oskers in ninety nine were on sunday march twenty first i avonass i think we will be goldbor costed at that year tim o k which episode is te one were rachel quit o k i the first few seasons of friends more than the others i think that that was season three i on say december twelve ninety six yas people wuld ah sam do not remember everything in their live cen and their memories can be flaud and by is just every one elseas but they remember a whole hell of a lot more than we do and our particularly good at remembering things te care about people with h sam who left sports hevnt insik repet acknowledge of scores jois realy good wichcseive he shows and he tells me its kind of all the memories are available at any given time for him the sort of scroll through for for the for the shomadman don am is pitching i i think coda and he see sat talking about the im the projector how it is sort of a carea sell of memory and it si it is not spot on how i remember things but it is it is pretty dam closhes caresell of memory yet it is and i think that the words i'm trying to re call exactly the voice over for this si for this teeser of something there is a rare occasion when the public can be engaged plan shere is that sen there is the rare occasion when the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash it is no stalger tistalger delicate wit potent it it takes us to a place where we long to go again takes us to a place ay cagoyou know and that is exactly how i feel when i think about my memories is ye want to be there sometimes i am there whether not i choose to how faebook gives you notifications about what you posted a year ago to day joey to grandas plays that game in his head all the time he tectss friends on a regular basis saying hey you moved to new york three years ago to day or hey six months ago to day we went carry yokiing in that little basement bar his friends tell me they enjoy the updates it is having your own personal biographer of your friendship but having h sam is constantly scrolling throughyur facebookwall twenty four seven and just any sort of late night scrolling it keeps him up at night when joy lies down he just ards remembering to much lately he thinks over and over about a gui he dated which seems normal except their whole relationship only lasted for a couple of months an it ended two years ago but joy cannot help but go through their whole relationship in incredibly minute detail on a regular basis march nineteenth two thousand fourteen we went to mexbrenner and unin square and had sundays and choklan wa fa roa you kow that was nach tellme and he is all a god joing the funniest person i know and of course my heart o three soi illis cause i'm al that this must be next day he takes ane picture of his cat and it was march twenty ninth that next week was the first time then we has a secual coun ter and that was really satin for me because again this was just more confirmation of the fact in maninis is sometini s april nineteenth and is which was he is to wegain twenty fourteen everything us can went down hill an da then at all soll part that is the problem how do you get over someone when you cannot forget thet what the way i explain it is how you have got and i your baggage i got a steamer trunk jill price also has h sam she just turnd fifty and says she is got fifty years of stuff and the steamer trunk is hu mongas wer shifting metaphors a little if you were you have a every day is a bag of garbage and then you go to sleep and ou wake up the next day and it is a fresh day and you can fear that garbage bag out from the day before i i do not have that i got mass of amounts ave just piled up garbage bags everywhere jill is an ella and she is worked as a script superviser on sat her h sam was really useful cause er job was to make sure that continuity was preserved hroughout the film that' some one's hair looks the same from shot to shot that a table is set in exactly the same way and of course jil remembered how that table looked even if the last shot happened weeks ago i called her up because i wanted to find out if resentment about the past is a sidt effect of eagh sam for any one other than jo short answer yes i'm still pished about stuff from when i was five and that is ridiculous jil says she cannot forget but she can never forget but maybe not being able to forget sort of hinders her ability to forgive as well as the rest of us she told me she still angry about this thing that happened in her first year college three decades ago jil a this calendar that she would used as a diary writing down details about each of her days and cramped handwriting manysculleit is barely legible i written all over i mean everything was on there ninet ay three was a really important year everything was on there everything you coulnd imagine whet could be the weather could be what you mean snexs whe you talk to what what is at every yes everything jil left the calendar at her mom's house for a few months while she went back to school and the next time she came back the calender was gone i cannot find the calendar i'd looking everywhere i hysterically go running through the house trying to get my parents to understand what just happend how important this was where is my journal wat at inthe're weno no ike and i remember they had somebody at the house they were talking to t was i was interrupting some sort of business meeting but i was all freeking oun i did not really care and eyven to this day just recently i said to my marm you kn i brought that up i said and you did not youyou really had no idea she thought i was rehashing things i why cannot you just get over what happened when you were five what what is this she could not understand why i was bothered or upset about things that happens decates ago where to me it was yesterday why why is it supertragic that hat you do not have that calender now well i a i do have it because i then went back couple years later and i rewrote the whole thing i mean i could not wril every single thing but i tried to go back and redo the entire calender that was how importantit was to ma ye and if it is all in your head it is saved in there anyway then why batheyr writing it down because if i did not write it down i would have fifty years of stuff just constantly swirling and writing it down just sort of relaxes it and it is makes it that it is it is it is there it is happened and it is put away was thot make sense ye it makes the lot of sense i talked to a number of people with ah sam and it is seems their days are filled with random memories showing up bees buzzing around their head until they can get swarmed by writing the stuff down jill manages the memories she is taking them one by one cataloguing them and putting them into a filing cabinet there is a link between obsessive compulsive disorter ro s d and h sam maybe having the power to remember much makes you want obsessively do it all the time or maybe it is the other way round desperately wanting to remember everything give certain people the ability to do it phenomenally well yeither way researchers say they seem to go hand in hand but a yourn' to have ago at i really bat brak ot a and one of the ways i got over my ex was by managing my memories which is predentious by to say i told myself he was te duci bag i dwelled on all the bad parts in the relation ship all is irritating qualities but recently i was slipping througs mon intries in my journal from a few months before not bad not for fun for this story not that far gone in one entry he intuited when i was feeling low and send exactly the right thing in another we went to a perfect dinner were we got free desert restaurants were constantly giving us freefood we could not figure out why but eventually settled on the idea that people liked us because we just lookd happy i had of course blocked all of these memories out because they did not find of the story i was telling myself and i did not want them back it had been good to forget and the difference between me and people with h sam is that i have the choice to stop reading the diary to just walk away jill does not have that choice it did not paralyze me until my hus band dived that his death has really paralye me how was it paralyzing because i will never ever ever ever forget that of course no one forgets their spousetine but for jill it is different i am still in marchip teth hast infived when he died yet not every minute but i could really put myself in that week and feel it and it hurts it it happened yesterday yet now the the feeling that i was nock on a survive i do not feel that way ty work ause i have survived but av how often do you think about that i'll oie ten times otoay even though i get up every day i feel i'm still standing in the same place it is it is really being stuck it is being stuck in a moment that you can there is no escaping do you wish that you could forget it yet or or or or remember it the way normal people remember it how do normal people remember it i do not know but it is not i mean i do not think that somebody would be sitting here eleven years later still lik feeling it the way i feel it see i wish you could understand and i wish i could understand what it is to be able to let things fade and or or not let just that is the way it is jullsays it is nowledge she is only reliving bad memories she likes to go back to one of her faverite afternoons october nineteenth nineteen seventy nine in the ninth grade when she had a bad day at school in her mom surprise her with whomle when she got home but when the bad once come on she cannot help but get emotional and they come on all the time if you did not have each samp how do you think your life would be different to day i i think that i would have been able to move forward i think i probably woulde be marrie today i do not think i would be scared i would be able to just we walk forward instead of constantly looking back o cas lit lt pit lits lits reverse this that you may be you understand your boy friend you guiyes broke up yet how l ong were you upset about it or un tell the point where you felt you can move forward without thinking about it all the time or move forward without it ripping your heart out oh god three months i do not have that luxury and are you jealous of me no no because i i on the flipside of all that i cannot imagine what it is to not remember my life i really cannot understand how nobody does even though it is tormented me it is just everything was just important to me that i just i hold on to it tight that i would not want a not be able to do that i'm not jealous of hurr either ever since talking to these people with each sam for the first time in my life i actually feel just find about forgetting i know

life of ontrolo cwasstummies a clowns a woodl woodland creatures alex pimberg has one such absolutely true tal he is a roducer un our show back wer first round this episode to day shows a reran here is alex michell and our husband lived in the woods at the end of a long half mile driveway i've a little used dirt road they loved it there surrunded by trees and mountains but still only an hour and a half by train from ew york city when we can warning his was their custom they went out for a short walk is a beautiful winter day mast the foot of snow on the ground they got to the road and turned around to had back up the drive my husband tends to walk faster the night and he was wanting to start into a little jog and i sait ocase an onet you just in o kind of go ahead in he went on home and i was it just started on the drive way and i look down straight away and i saw this animal thete was pretty far down and then i saw aid o it looks a rare coon i would say it was aly a hundred and fifty to to an erfeet it was pretty far away and i'm looking at i and i'm thinking well in know ints an go up into the woods but it started walking towards me and then i realize that he has not seen me yet and i sort of ou now just waved my arm a little bit and then all of a sudden it sees me and the second it was aware of me it just it just bolt id towards me i mean wat what there was not a second of a hesitation it was o m got it is o mi got it is coming right at me i turned and i started to run fis i was trying to outrun it and i i i could i kept turning to see if the animal was bearing down on me and it was getting closer and it was now wit is in five or ten feet yo nowt behind me and the whole time i mean from the moment the racoon saw me it hust and snarled i mit it was it the feeling was all or cared about was attacking me i do not even know what i was thinking that i ran off the drive thinking n i'll get away from it well as i run off the drive it jumps on to my i and i falled into the snow kind of down behind o rock and then the next thing i see is i is mouth as around mi right i the rcoon was about thirty pounds michell a slight woman was about one fifteen sh was wearing a big parker and snow pands the racoon was n'nable to get a good grip using all her bodyweight an both hands she was able to pull off her leg and pin it in the snow away from her body i'm pushing its face into the snow that it would keep putting its head up and snarling and then it would keep trying with its claws to scratch at me that i kept leaning on it and then pushing it into the snow and i'm screaming at the top of my luns ou now help itsomebody help me i'm being attack i m an i'm just and i'm sinking the closest neighbor it is a house that there sort of week enders and off an the're not there and it seemed no one was coming out of that house and i'm a half a mile from my house nm thinking nobody is to help me and i'm and im i was after about five minutes i stopped screaming and i just started thinking what am mi going to do this racoon was behaving in a way that normal recoons never behave was possessed not's because in some sense it was it had rabies at is ease that even scientists who stedy it called diabolical it is ae virus that attacks the aggression centers of the brain it is wiches off all an animal's natural enhibitions including fear and pain at the same time it floods the animal's body with he dranalin making it stronger and more relentless an nimals which were normally shy and easily scared away turned into tireless ferocious monsters it become nothing but a vehicle for the virus attacking anything that moves in order to spread the disease which meant from a shell she could not just try and fling the racoon away because would come after her again she couldn not run it any trees she could climb the recoon could climb faster then michell remembered that although she usually did not bring herself on with runwax that day she actually had the question was how to get it out of her pocket she needed both hands to hold the racoon down she was wearing big mittens but eventually after many attempts she was able to get the phone out and toss it in the snow using the speaker phon she called her house she got her grown son alex and i'v screaming ie screaming as he top of my lungs and and he acted it was a joke and and it was because the microphone on the phone was being pinned you knowhere it had this sort of strange noise and i thought to myself because it sound he was about to hang oup it was someone doing a prank and i said in to in my head i said you ou have to come down i said alec i said i've been a tact on the driveway by a racoon within five minutes her husband her son alec and his girl frond were there her son grabbed a big fallen branch and laid it across the racoon's back he stood on one end michell stood on the other the two of us are now holding this racoon which is still he has seeng ind snarling an clawing and my husband think he says i'm going to get a tire iron ot as a car and on try hitting it and to kill it he goes and gets the tire iron on of tha car and he starts to hit it and he figures he will hit it once or twice and he will kill it well he starts hitting it and he he probably hit it between fifteen and twenty time and and it is still snarling an clawing then my i said to om my sons girl frinolga is sat olga i said go to the house and get a knife and in the meantime my son takes the tire iron and my son starts feeding on the re coon for at least five minutes the're taking turnbeading thi racoon and about at the point where olga is coming back and gets out of the car with these two big niives the racoon and dyi weld michell did not know at the time was that her encounter was not an icolated incident there is a rabi's epidamic in erk which started in the nineties an nineteen eighty nine there were only fifty five rabbit animal cases in the entire state by nineteen ninety three the number had reached almost three thousand and she thousand for a rabbit otter swam up and attacked o six year old at a public beach the child came out of the water with the otter clean by its teeth to his arm and one woman i spoke to told me that a rabbid racoon latched itself on to her leg in the middle of the day on her suburban street when she was getting out of her car after a trip to bed bath and beyond she said the police had to shoot the racon five times before it finally died rabies is almost the hundred per cent fatal in humans if the vaxen is not ad minister right after exposure n the nineties brought the first human deaths from mabies in the state and half a century therehave been three to date two of whom were children bitten by rabbid bats in their sleep which brings me to a quick public service announcement a bat can bite you in your sleep without you even knowing it and without leaving a mark if you find on in a room with the sleeping person you ife to catch it and have a testit and if you cannot catch it you should go to a doctor i'm serious i learned about this it freeked me out and now i want t tell people for michel of course there was no doubt of exposure she had two fang marks on her leg racoon blood all over our clothes and a battered racoon carcass in a plastic bag but getting treatment proved to be its own type of forer story first she called the tat han told her to call the health department she caled the halth department but they were closed on weekens she left the message and called another halth department and a different county same thing eventually she just went to the emergency room on her own where she was told tha this was not an emergency she had ten to fourteen days before she needed to get a shot and she shoe just called the health department again after the weekend early monday morning the gat from the health department where she left her first message on saturday called her back she told him everything was fine she would been to the hospital a ni said well i was told i had ten to fourteen days and he sa you do not have ten o fourteen days you have seventy two hours from the moment that you are bidden he says you must have a shot by the end of to day the man on the phone was in the michell's county he told her goo to her own health department and they would give her the shot but when she called there they said they needed to test the carcass for rabie's first which meant sending it to the rabie's laboratory two hours away and all butty mishell begged them to just give her the shot first whereabout albany later they made arrangements for to go to the closest hospital and yet another county my husband and i go and of course we have to wait ti'm in the mergesea room and then we get in and then when we are inside an someone comes and tells me thot i live in putnam county and i'm in a hospital in west cesture and that they cannot give me the shots my god i am destraught at this point and i i start crying the first time therin the sole eposote i should put out the you actually cried rigt guess this was this is the first this was the first time that i cried i did i was was u know i you survive the attack by the rack who and you ser ive tityet over thete wi the tire and fifty times and then that thing that finally votue to your nees was the es self caresis tem yes thi eet exactly rit o i started to cry and i just said is not there i what is the problem and and then i'm starting to learn thot rabies sem mun globulan is a very expensive shot and the retail price of it was something thirty two or thirty five hundred dollars finally they gave her the shot but they gave it tearn the wrong place the buttocks and not in her arm the wasupposed to and then she neded five follow up shots but she could not find a doctor to give her any she called eight doctors and none of them ould even see her until she threatene to all the stateboart of health even suall she got the shots and to day everything is fine except mishell does not see her home in the woods the way she once did as a peaceful refuge ii felt betrayed by nature that that is actually how i felt i felt that nature betrayed me because i would take walks every day in the woods and i had never fell threatene and i remember waking out the next day and thinking that all of the hills around me that there were racoons standing and all these hills waiting untill i shot out the tor and they were going to come running toor mis the army ou no waiting for it is vixon ou know to come and and it i had this image that these racoons were just all going to come down from the hills and and if i ever go to walk and i and i do not have the cellphone i i will always feel little fear years before her attack mishell want on sufariin south africa she lions and dragts and rhynos come ap her drive at night afe she got home from the trip she peered into the woods around her house ad imagined that there were wild animals out there there had been an sufary now she says she does not wonder about it any more she nows for fact there a whild animals out there and it is not a comforting thought out wen te these days he is apot castin persario and the hos in the pot cast en noi to the hatur il yet i believe that we have all learned an important lesson about rabies ad bats an rer coons that to mention a lesson about carbamanocxside ind to introduce this next story i do not think the is much more inee to saret now then hi chiking he is dangerous ir can be dangerous theyk cam be bed tan if you do not believe me bill level tells this true story of what happened to him than is brother when i was twelve and my older brother jim fourteen our parents dropped us off at one of those agricultural fairs the kine with the big farras wheel blue ribbon pigs and hotog geeting contest this was an martha's vineyard and usually our parents went with us but jim and i were getting older he was a teananger now we wanted to do it alone there were girls to impress we were told to call home for a ride when we are ready but at the end of the night we decided be cooler to hitchek we were not scared this was nineteen seventy seven and martha's vineyard still a relatively sleepy island every one hitchik there it did not take us long to get a ride some guy heading to egertown to meet his friends we lived in oak bluffs out of his way but he said he could take us half way home jim and i did't even think about saying no we were to excided for the adventure to begin drure to his word the guy dropd tust off half way home this was out by the big bridge along the beech road during the day this spot is filled with peoplee jumping off the railing into the water but at night no one goes there no swimmers or fishermen or even kids looking to get high jim and i stood by the side of the road listening to the ocean pown the sand the wind blow through the dooms we peered into the darkness hoping to see headlikes but there was nothing just the moon and some stars and a gnawing feeling we had made a big mistake after about twenty minutes of standing around we finally saw car pproaching get in front jim said and try to look small pathetic this was not hard to do the car flew by us kicking up sand which stung my legs crap i yelled but then the tires locked up the car fishtail it skitted to a stop about a hundred yards away we ran to the car it was a big white cruiser with four doors i yanked open the back door jumped in and slid on my butt to the far window there were three people up front the driver was hunched over the wheel and bore his haire and a thick affro a woman sat in the middle she had straight blont haire with the crooked car running down the centr another guy tall his head almost touched the roof of the car roade shotgun thanks for stop and i said we are head ed oak bluffs tno one said a word i turned to the open door where jimstill stood come on i said get in jim hesitated he looked into the car and shook his head back and forth then the driver began reving the engine ti saw my brother take a deep breath then he climbed in and joind me his doory barely clothe when the car took off we move fast swerving in and out of our lane no one talkd the entire ride by the time we reached oak bluffs i had decided i did not want these people to know where we lived right here will befine i said just pass wabam park down near where the seeview hotel used to be the car did not slow down thinking the driver did not hear me i tried again we to be let out now i said we drove by ocean par the flying horse's carsell and then the harbor with all the boats tucked in for the night in their berts the whole time i keptd asking to be let out trying make it sound each spot i pointed to was when we really preferred but there was no reaction we just kept moving eventually we passed the last house along the methodist camprac wete a sunday before i climbed the stage ot the old tabernacle and sand with my cousins before a crowd of hundred raindrops ce falling on my head we began to climb the hill that let out of town and i grew silent jim took up where i left off recently his voice had change and he had a new deep barratone when his voice crapke making him sound a little kid again he stopped talking too i tried to convince myself i was just a joke scare the crap at af some kids on a boring saturday night and i almost believe this but then about fifteen minutes outside of town we took a left turned to a graveyard jim and i knew this graveyard we had relatives burried there old wailing captains who helped settled the island back in the sixteen hundreds we came up here sometimes with our grandfather to pay our respecks it was a heavily wooded place with trails that twisted deep into the forest during the day it was fun to run along these trails jumping out from behind a rofk or bush to scare each other we had never been up here at night though i grabbed my brother's hand and pulled myself into his lap jim hugg me tight and rested his cheek against mine he had recently started shaving and i could feel a hint of razer stubble this helped call me down jim was the older brother he would know what to do the car swerved and began circling a large jesus statue near the front to the graveyard i was thrown from jim's lap and landed in the opposite footwill i scrambled back up as fast as i could but before i could reach my brother's lap again jim opened this door and jumped out o the car we were still moving fast nd he opene door flapped in the wind i felt a hand on my shoulder and looked up it was the tall man his sfingers were strong an dug into my collar bon i dupped back into the seat well and crawled to the door the man still held me by the shoulder but i pushed as hard as i could with my legs when i leaped fom the car he lost his grig for a moment i floated in the air when i hit the grown i rolled for a long time wi got up and ran towards the woods i could see a light in the distance and headed for it the woods opened up anto a small clearing nd tere was a house an a party in full swing lots of people stood outside drinking round a keg as soon as i reached the lawn i turned around to lookd from my brother he wase still back in the graveyard running down one of the dirt road to the car by behind himjim i screamed jim over here he crad had formed around me but i did not look at th i just kept screaming my brother's name and te he was there bursting through the woods and running across the lawn until a clothes line flattened him i ran to him kneeled down and put my hand on his chest yoka i asked ye he said you tbefore i could answer a tall kid with thick glasses squatted down next to us what the hell is going on he asked jim and i stood up began telling ever what had happene while we were talking fourguas from the party ran off to the graveyard the car's headlights were still visible moving through the woods looking for us there were shouting and then the headlights disappeared when the guyes returned they said the car took off before they could get the license plate the tall kid with the glasses walked to the keg poured two beers into blue plastic cups and offered them to us jim and i chugged them down and asked for more later two women gave us a ride home i refused to sit in the back seat rode up front with the driver her name was betsy and she had long bround hair and tan skin her father on the flying horses and i had seen her round town on the drive home she rubbed my hair put her arm around my shoulder when we reached our house betsey walked with us to the front door and stood on the porch while we told our parent what had happened d mom bent down her face was level with mine dad stood

man had grab me and got out of bed i changed out of my pajom as in to genes my favourite green basketbald teacher then i lay down on the floor and slid underneath my bed for a moment i felt safe and hidden but it did not last i got up and walked to jim's room when i got there i realized i did not want to go in i continued down the hall and stood outside my parent's bedroom i could hear them talking quietly together i almost knocked on their door instead i turned away moved one to the front room where my youngest brother ted slept ted was six years old he would been asleep when we came home and did not know what had happened i crawled into bed with him and started crine really crying that i had to stuff of pillow when my mouth to keep the noise in ted woked up but did not say

boweled one right after another and on the surface i'm sure i seemed fine with it then at night i'd returned to my hotel double lock the door and stand under the shower until all the soap and champoo was used up the people in the next room must have wondered what was going on an hour of running water and then this blubbery voice i do believe in spooks i do believe in i do i do i do i do it is not luck i'd walked into this completely unprepared even as a child i was fascinated by death not in a spiritual sense but an inesthetic one i hampster organy pid would pass away and after bearing the body i dig it back o over and over until all that remained was a shoddy pel that earn me a certain reputation especially when i moved on to other people's pats egor they called me wicked spooky but i think my interest was actually fairly common at least amongst adolescent boys at that age deth is something that happens only to animals and grandparents and studying it is a science project be good kind that does not involve homework most kids grow out of it but the passing of time only heightened my curiosity as a teen ager i saved up my baby sitting money and bought a seventy five dollar copy of medicolegal investigations of death a sort of bible for for ins at pathologists it shows what you might look if you bidden extension cord while standing in a shallow pool of water if you were crushed by a tractor struck by lightning strangled with a spiral or nonspiral telephone cord kit with a claw hammer burn shot dround stab or feasted upon by wild or domestic animals the camptions red really great pom titles my favourite being extensive mill do on the face of a recklis i stared at that picture for ours on end hoping it might inspire me but i know nothing about poetry and the best i came up with was pretty lame behold the recklers looking pensive mill do though is quite extensive on his head both aft and fore he maybe should ug got out more i know nothing about by ollogy either the pathologist tried to educate me but i was too distracted by the grotesk my discovery for instance that if you jump from a tall building and land on your back your eyes will pop out of your head and hang bight bloody cables those joke glasses i said to the chief medical examiner the man was nothing if not professional and is response to my observations was always the same well he would sigh not really after a week in the odtopsy sweet i still could not open a deny's menia without wanting to throw off ut night i'd close my eyes and see the buckets of withered hand stored in the morg secondary cooler they had brains too a whole wall of them shelled preserves an a general store then there were the bits in pieces a forsaken torso a pretty blond scalp a pair of eyes floating and a baby food jar but them all to gether and you had an incredibly grigt secretary who could tight the wind but never ans er the telephone ut lie a wake thinking of things this but then my mind would returned to the freshly dead who were a most often whole or at least whole ish most of them were delivered naked zipdop bin identical body bags family members were not allowed inside the building and the corpses had no contect on connected to the living they were these strange creatures related only to one another a polise report would explain that missus daniels had been killed when a trock lost control and drove to the front window of a hamburger stand she had been a customer waiting in line in cases hers i needed more than a standed report there had to be a reason this woman was run down as without one the same thing might happen to me three men are shot to death while i tending a ch ild's christening and you tell yourself sure they were hanging out with the wrong crowd but buying a hamburger i buy hamburgers far i used to anyway this medical examiners office was in the western united states and a city where gons are readily available and drivers are known to shoot each other of her parking spaces the building was los slung and mean looking sat on the far edge of the down town area between the railroad tracks and a rubber stamp manufacturer and the lobby was the potted plant and a receptionas who kept a can of mountain glan air freshener an her desk drawer for decomps she explained meaning tost who had died alone and rottered a while before being fownd we had such a case on holloween and elderly man who had tumbled from a latter while we placing a lightbalb for and a half days on the floor of his unair conditioned home and as the bag was unsipped the room filled with what the attending pathologist termed the smell of job security the autopsy took place in the morning and was the best argument for the buddy system i had ever sennever live alone i told mi tbefore you change a light bulb call some one from the other rome and have them watch until you are finished by this point in m stay my list of donts covered three pages and included such reminders as never fall asleep and a dumster never drive a convertible behind a flat bed tro never get dronknear a train never get old i had not timed my visit to coincide with holoween but that is the way it worked out you think that most of the casualties would involve tricker treaters hit by cars or done in by tainted candy but actually the day was just any other an the morning we had our decomposed senior and after lunch i accompanied a female pathologist to a murder trial she had performed the victims autopsy and was testifying on behalf of the prosecution there were plenty of things that should have concerned me the blood spatter evidence the trojectory of the bullets but all i could concentrate on was the defendanc's mother who would come to court whering cut off genes and a ghost busters teacer it could not have been easy for her but still you had to wonder what wood she consider a dress up occasion after the trial i watched as another female pathologist collected maggets from a pinal column found in the desert there was a decomposed head too and before leaving work she planned to simmer it and study the exposed cranium for contusions i was asked to pass this information along to the chief medical examiner and looking back i perhaps should have chosen my words more carefully fire up the kettle i told him old fashioned skull boil at five p mit was of course the fear talking that and a't pathetic desired to appear casual one of the gang that evening instead of returning to my hotel i sat around with the transporters one of whom had recently been ticketed for using the carpool lane and at argued unsuccessfully that the dead body he was carrying in the back constituted a second passenger it was just the four of us until around midnight when a tipsy man in a datona beachs weatshirt came to the front gate and asked for a tar when told no he gestured toward an idling car and got his girl friend to ask the young woman was lovely and flortatious and as she pressed herself against the bars i imagined her lying upon an autopsy table her organs piled in a glistening heat beside her i now looked at every one this way and it worried me that i'd never be able to stop this was the consequence of seeing too much and understanding the horrible truth no one is safe the world is not manageable the tricker treater may not be struck down on hollowen but sooner or later he is going to get it as am i and everyone i have ever cared about it goes without saying that for the next few weeks i was not much fun to live with and early november i returned home and repelled every single person i came into contact wet gradually though my gloominess wore off bi thanksgiving i was imagining people naked rather than dead and naked and this was an improvement a week later i was back to smoking in bed and just as i thought that i'd put it all behind me i went to my neighbourhood grocery store and saw an elderly woman slip on a grape she fell hard and after running to her side i took her by the arm you really have to watch yourself in this produceile i know it she said i could have broken my leg actually i told her you could have been killed the woman attempted to stand but i would not let her i'm serious i told her people die this way i've seen it her expression changed then and became fearful rather than merely pain it was the look you get when facing some sudden and insurmountable danger the errant truck the shaky later the crazy person who holds you too tight and insists with ever increasing urgency that everything and love can be un done by a grape tite tere e

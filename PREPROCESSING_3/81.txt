the menshvir show sponsirby expressiv hepian privacies a right not a privilege defend your right that expressivvepianta coms flashman the massshooter in louistian mane is still at large he his done extraordinary damage eighteen dead thirteen injured lives ended lives destroyed family's rect in america such events quickly devolve into the usual argments those who argue for gun control blime the weapon carried by the shooter they point out that he was carrying in a re fifteen and that he had a high capasiny magazine they say that means gunlaws are too loosin that if they had been tighter the shooter never would ave bee able to obtain the weapon gunright's advocates argue by contrast that the shooter was mentally ill that according to the washington post he had quote alarm people around him that he was hospitalized and receive mental health treatment this summer people who knew the shoter told investigators that quote in recent monts he describes hearing disturbed voices and increasingly become ficated on the bowling alley and the restaurant or he allegedly open fire it is uncleater where the shoter got his weapon if he did not have a criminal record a federal background check would not have stopped him from getting a weapon anyway but man also has a called yellow flag law that requires police to get a medical practitioner to evaluate some one with mental illness and identify them is a thread tbefore the police can petitionar judge to order a persons firearms seized if ever somebody would have qualified for use of such a law the shooter in this case would have qualified in the end the argument's fort an against gun control are not generally about the efficacy of any particular policy least not one t comes to mass shootings masshotings are statistical outliers the vast majority of homicides involving fire arms in the united states are committed with hand guns not long guns act ive shoter ovents constitute a very small percentage of overall homicides well he mediate tend to cover large scale mas shootngs the louiston shooting they tend toig nor mashooting cen cities chicago despite the fact that firearm tomiciderte for black americans is some fourteen times higher than that for white americans now the arguments for gun control ten to central lies around one particular argument the argument that no one could quat needs in a r fifteen or any gun for that matter that is the argument the present an biden routinely makes to those grav right ling american say it is all about shapin america capian americas indeprenden say if you want a fight against ta contrinito f fifteen you need a some little more than a gun the iy d the idea we still alow simio amout wris sick tis sick hit has no no soco the val ster nun not a single sol to rational for proe un if you want a protect yourself get a double by al shock gon have the shells o twelve gag shack a promise ho is ever coming in his locker hou do not need a or fifteen it is harder at am it is harder o use and in fact hou do not need thirty rounds to protectso by sho kon in none of that is true none of that is true also notice his language there when he says no one eed to semi automatic weapon that is enormal an gun tht is a normal rifle a semiautogmatic weapon just meens that every time you pull the trigger the gun shoots that is all and then it reloads that is that is what to sem my auto is but is bidon right on principle i speend part of my day yesterday with my wife and some friends at gunrange while we are there we worked it my smith and wesson amen pe shield my millimate or my mosberg five hundred chockon and yes my a r fifteen why precisely were we at the gunrange mesim beause i love the gunrange it is because since the october seventh terror assault on the gaza envelope anti semantism across the west has sky rocketed i currntly have full times security on myself on my family probly gren to have to have that level of security the rest of our lives but it' not just mee petty much every jew i know who can obtain a weapon is now ttempting to do and they should as all law abiding and responsible adults should owning a weapon is in the end the only protection against the darkness the jews were murdered raped and kidnapped in the gosa onvelopeere largely onarm is rael has extremely stricte gun controlaws in the wake of the massacre tens of thousands of his railies are now seeking to arm themselves as they should over a hundred thousand is railies have reportedly submitted gun lice ences applications closer to home the story is the same there are evil people who seek to do harm to innocent people on wednesday morning for example a man was arrested in studio city california after breaking into a home with the maziza that is a a scroll on the door post of jewish homes marking it is a jewish home the man was screaming free palistin and killd jews in trying to kick in a door now new york jews are being told to stay indoors by security sources over chabat hecause prol commass protesters ecided to descend on brooklin onchavat afternoon according to seowhile live dat com jew should avoid walking around crownheights a heavily orthodox neighborhood according t the anti defimation legue anthe sment ac incidents ofe increased by three hndred and eighty eight per cent this month year over year why would not every jew want to carry under these circumstances people of decency on all sides do want the same thing here innocence protected and the dangerous disarm the question is how best to achieve that gol simple minded statements about blanket weapons bands are not the answer and those answers make even less sense coming from many of the same people who see the police as the problem no i'm not going tobe giving up my ar fifteen because a mentally ill person who never should have had weapons committed ahane is hacet of evil in fact that is precisely why i keep by weapons tbecause evil people doing evil things are not stopped by parchment barriers in just a second we will get to the political response to the mass shooting and man wich of course has followed all the traditional hall marks of the debate first pure tak recently announced they wuld alleviate ten million dollars in veterans at by veteran's day thanks to your support they are fifty three per cents that goll with two wees to go thing about this theust militaries made up of one hundred per csent volunteers these are men and women who willingly sacrifice everything they have for this country when theyre done serving they return home to a tight chob market and outrageous living expenses that is why i'm happy a private company pure talk has jumped into help when you switch two pure tocks lightning fastfive to network they will donate a portion of every new order to this excellent cause you can make a real difference just by choosing superior self on service puretalks plans started just twentbux month offering on limited talk taced more data and mobile hospot just go to puretak dot com slash chipiro and make that switch but's rally together showin wavering support for our veterans is it pure talk dok com slash chipuro switch to pure talk to day its the right move it is the american way visit puretalk dot com slash chipro again thits pure toktok com slash puro i use purtok for all of my calls great tower notwork which weans the reception is really good plus i'ms having money plus i'm helping out coza pure talk dot com slash purigal check mauring out pure tokto com slash chipiro tod a bega as for our usual arrangemen these shootings almost invariably involve somebody with obvious red flags obvious obvious red flags and then the media decide to ignoral the red flags in favor of the idea that a hundred million gunners ought to give up their guns because in the end the ideas that you should trust the government to protectin now i do not trust the government for a couple of reasons one i do not think that they can protect me in the first instance soere i live great sheriff'sdepartment excellent police department everybody one forsemen is excellent and what it is can take hem a little while to respond to an actual bad thing happening d it does not matter how good they are it will take then at the very least a few minutes to get to a place and that is too late for the people whare in that place her's all very speculative until it happens in a place where you are which is why at mi sengog have to gaz o carrying we have security and we have haf the gi's carrying that is a good thing that is a worth while thing whenever somebodices as well good guis with guns done stop bad gos he guns ktnow the answers they do they it is ot it' always such a weired argument they'l say things wup you noug't really stops the bad gav a gun is either he commit suicide or the cop stopon why that is because there is no one on teene who a had a gun sthey to wait until gui was don shooting a bunch people for the cops to get there in shootoguy or what y can await their furtlegaticoment suicide i gout of the kindness of his heart you think that that is what isgoing to stop this thing an the reality is once again that every one of these situations in involving a masshooter is a situation in which the person has all sorts of indicators that they should not of had a gun in the first place and somebody drop the ball somewhere along the way which really speaks too a a lack of belief in the actual social fabric becaue if you see somebody around you who should not have a gun somebody around you who has severe mental ilness you ave an obligation a moral obligation to report that to the authorities in the moral and and the authorities ove a moral obligation to try to get that person tha care they need and remove from them the ability to have acsess toal weapon that is your moral obligation it is a thing t you should do by the same tokan it is immoral to remove from a law abiding citizen who knows how to use a gun his means of self defense that is immoral the first wrigte any of us have is the right to self defense and dofense of others obviously we whenever oneof these shootings happens obviously motions runrally high and you see some politicions who decided thei'r going to shift their opinions on politicaliss ou not because new evidence is emmerge but because they are now emotionally struck by the issue i'm not a big fan of this type of politics if your positions changed radically not because new evidence demerge that the debont your prior position but because you are just responding more emotionally to the issue that is not a good reason to shift your opinion on an issue it is not evidence is supposed to decide your positions on the issues well there was a congress person yesterday and jer golden democrat from man who reversed course on gun control now main is a democrat dominated state t has democratic governor it has two democratic it has one democratic enter one republican senter and it has a democratic legislature here is is jer golden who is a main congress person who represens louist and now coming out in favor of gun control which is the politically safe thing to do after a mass shooting obviously but again there is no new evidence that is ben provided that this would that what form of gun control wouldhav stope this from happenin sereis what form af gun control the apparently already had guns known now hiw obtaine the guns and we do know that he was literally institutionalise just a couple of months ago and somehows to wit access to the weapons what laws on the books would hav changed this here is jour golden advocating from ore laws anyway nonme on is wy o on a nesa an the one is by this sat er is mas cim mom downas man to te gien mone me ar weri a o to geti on n o i do not really understand why he saying it is his responsible what is the law that he failed to pass tat would prevent to this christmurphy of connecticut senator long time advocate for gun control he then actually stomped on this guy that is the also th way politics worso even if your virst position th then the people who reflect your new position wal stompon here is christmurphy going after yesterday i do not know representative golden personally i know that he is a pretthe conservative a member of the house of representatives ah and he is coming to the same reality that many others have whichis democrads weapons do not deserve to be on the streets of america theu can protect people second a memth rights but just make sure that foks do not have access to the weapons of war but i wish it did not take members of congress to have to experience amass shooting in their own congressional district to come to thes reality i'm glad that representative goldens made this decision but why does it to have to happen over and over and over again mean do does he have a solution that w stop thus from happening over and over and over again there some fifty people who are shot in chicago over the we get nobody new story about it because not as spectacular does not grab the headlines in the same way those were almost invariably with hand guns tyou do not see christmurphy talking about any of that and again this is the easy lier's way out of the dilemma the real argument tha that people onleft that they are honest one ahaves than knowinch ve gun that is the argument they really wane a have they doft on make that argument because they understand that to losing argument but that is the argument that they actually you want to may instead they decide that they are going to reverse entgineer an argument where the greatest danger to your life to day s an a our fifteen wet if the grist ingeure my life is not air fifteen in the hands of a crazy person at the greatest defence to my life is in air fifteen in my hands i can stop the crazy person senters him came he is doing the same sort of thing from virginia says we have sickness in this country son't happen anywhere else we have a sickness in tis cunt for saulsont true does not happen anywhere s that our mas shootings that our terrasaults the sorstuff does happen inother country's but if there is a sickness in this country part of that sickness involves denying sickness denying mental illness pretending the mentalilness is just different brain orientation i suppose to what really is in in many cases a danger to self or others here is it centericane anything this just reopens a won that never heels for all virginians when we see a report of this kind of shooting tragety we all remember a that tragetyat virginia tack and many sence that and it is just it it is just sickens your soul amming we ever sickness in this country around goun violets and it is a uniquely american problem many other nations do not have the problem that we have ae states including virginia have finally taking menedful steps to deal with the the cogress thus far is generally teen unwelling to again many of these mashroings ive a crin californiash has extraordinarily strong gunwas use to live there meanwhile crrechon par in the federal level she is doing the same thing she says let us work to ban assault weapons again the weapon is not the problem the person who is carrying the weapon is the problem everyone knows this let us work together to ban assault weapons and high capacity mangazines let us work together enact universal background checks require safe storage of guns and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous individuals who have no business being armed with ha weapon of war but those people have no business being armed at all at all the weapon is not yet the person as always is the issue and again there is a counts or side to this which is that law abiding people while legitimately afraid and should be legitimately afraid of bad people in the night need to own weapons i am one of those people my wife is one of those people wm is by nature a very gental person she is not somebody whe is pertictally comfortable around fire urms she is learning to use fireum she buying a fire m because she wants to be more comfortable she feel safer and she is not wrong we get a lot of thrats sheis not wrong it is more in this momentarily first every hollowing parents aren' cerage to check their kits cansy for potential tampering but what

shipping ts again the case that very often is just made pretty openly by members of the left es that we do not guns guns or bad or that gun no one needs a gun that is the case made by a personame tilor austin harper over the atlantic today the title the piece is how much blood is your fun worth i saw the gun violen tepidemic and my relation to it as a gun owner as an abstraction then a mas shooting happen in the little city where i work is a person who is from louis to ma the entire article is about how this persin is a gun owner and how heu was always in favor of gun control but now he is really strongly in favor i've gun controis is the honest truth is that i've always viewed t gun violent epidemic is an abstraction remote for my own life choices mi many gun owners i'd always supported stronger gun control if the requires wrtten in practical exams and dozens of hours of training to earn the right to drive him moter vehicle i've never understood bhy the same weu should not apply fire arms my vieuws on gun control of also been lonkish academic an nature it' something i care about in ave written about but f never felt deeply that changed yesterday can say has stronger feelings right now and then guess to this if you had asked me be fore yesterday wyiown guns i would have fet you the same line i'd fed my liberal friends on my wife and above all my self for years i w'dhave told ou my own guns for hunting for protection for blasting clay pittions out of cloudless october skies iw'd ave told you my own guns beause i come from gun family and guns hat guns are some te only things i've left from the people i love iwould ave told you about the rifle my holler born great depression surriving grandmother kept under te bed the twenty gage mi grandfather used to bring home thanksgiving turkeys i woud hae told youmy own guns because im a hunter and i own guns because i wriht things that sometimes make people angry but it is only now that gun violence has visited my little corner of the world that i have been forced to confront reality a truth that as been there all long but that i have refused to admit i own guns because i them and beause i'm an american i'm alowed to an oon stops me my own guns because gunviolence with something that happen anywhere else and not somewhere close to me he says that he is responsible and he says yesterday's vents having made me changed my mind about being a gun owner the reasons that motivated me to own guns in the first place are no different then yesterday the shoting an moist an change my mind about being a quiet gun owner i've spent years of my life making apologies on be half o my gun nut acquaintances si jus have question he is not giving up his guns right i mean in the end this guy is not can give up his guns but he is going to lecture you about your guns that is the idea here he says the reason that people own a our fifteens is becouse they are fun or because they are a toy for some people maybe that is true but here is the ottom line i have a right to on an air fifteen my reason happens to be a retty good reason which is self defense and defense ofothers but i've a that that right is broader than that and the reas on t's broader than that is because i cannot prove two the authorities that my need out weighs thering to take one my gone i know this because for f i knows for a fact when i lived in loss angelis i was one of the top tar gets of antt metic dat threats in two thousand fifteen two thousand sixteen i used to get dethrets all the tine iin i knew fairly intimately the people at the f b i in loss ancialist because they have been my house more than once in order to pick up at least one time powder from my house other times to in vestigate other mail that it ome to the house i know the fpaatianswere i live here to a but the difference is that in florida i can get my gone i can go out i can train with it and get good at it aen i can carry it because it turns out that thrat is notious to me in my home when i was in ow s angels ime me sy the process that i had to go through this is why the right is broader than just my need because it turns out that whn the authorities to find the need very often it just obliterates the right when i was in loss angelis i literally wants the elipity and i plied for conceal carryperment can steal carry permits in los angelis are almost impossible to get really really difficult to get you have to demonstrates a need what does that mean it means juft to demonstrate a need that is beyond the response time of the ela pety i sapameeting with elipety i go in i bing in a binder i'm tong o binder this thick of dethreats thick binder of dethreats i sit down with somebody working for te elipity and i s are walking through thethreats they sail kay will get back to you that couple weeks later they deny me the perment why because they say that all those dathreats olh they have an actually acted on them yet an i said right that is the entire point they have not but when they do i want yard in fact that pointod out them that the f be i had ar rested a person who is sending dathreats to me and don'll c donel from junior among other people the would arrest of that person that person andat picture of mine comfin ther home that person had body armor and a map of the general area where we live tand hofs prety much ready to go and th alipety said yesbut he was rested which is a full catch twenty to we catch the guy that means you are safe we do not catch the guy well you should't have a gone because after all we could a e cat the guy this is why the second amendment exists and en increasingly violent world particularly for people me youon't about things getting personal gun ownership is personal to me this person hays gone violenc os personal to him becuse it racks the communiuary lived because gone violence is personal because violence and threats are personal tgun ownership is personal to me and i do not believe i'm the only one namerico feels that way think the founders felt the same thing an just one second will get to why it is personal right now first policy genius makes it easy to conbear life in turans

and they are liars mean it it is amazing it is truly amazing to watch the par battle that is rupted on social meedia first of all there is no question that algarythmically commas supporters are getting a giant boose right now there is just no question at that is happening on a wide variety of platforms unfortunately i think including acsbet certainly including tectoc beyond that commass and m they just openly lie about things much that yesterday a homs spokes person was on the b b c the b b c of course is a ommas friendly outlet they are perfectly welling to run with nearly anything

thing that is is happening is not happening yesterday the bid administration for some unknown reason decided to allow the aronean foreign minister to arrive on american chorce an thand threaten th united states from the united nations a an institution that shuld go the way of the dotoburd we should blow up the building we should sault the earth the uent is a garbage organizations in a garbage organiation for decades to mouth piece for thurdworld dictatorships in any case hereis arons forn minister yesterday warning at the united states that if israel goes into the gasistrip the fire will spread well by the way if thif they really want threaten th united states at less we do not want war with ron because it cost time and resources and money and people we do not want any of that the letturs be clear about this if aron started up with the united states that war would be over in about a millo secons the united states military is not to be trifled with and the fact you have these tin pot morons wer out ther threatening the united states is deeply insaulting an speaks to the weakeness that they proceive in the american body politic andamong our political class here is arons forn minister te inne yor and the unit tecnation i fa frankle tugame canpemen wa no maneting pigenofa in panfin tat we do not te contuexpaten ofte a in the retion at i wa if tegenofi in gatte continus they e not befe fontifi it is ali homand weasia is ala rtion westatiis their region a they own it weave alone by by that they mean presum the elsewant the destruction of the state of israel well as it turns out aron has now been tat targeting americans throughout the mida lees in fact over the course of last a few weeks there've been double diget strikes on american facilities by aronian proxy groups john kurby was asked about that yesterday said how exactly is jobidan pushing back on roun first first cor be admitted the ustroups hove actually sustaind serious brain damage from from these particular strikes here h was yesterday admitting the situation iarone i ahack you as tru ta we restime what id he mein a taca ti i sa and e ser it we will wa respi yet no tella oe her napoleon we have responded in retaliated in the past quite aggressively in fact back in march and as the president at a we will not hesitate te pretec ter trups in o facilityes boinan do it ant a time elarcun in a manner of ar accusing and the decision to do it it we do it is his as commander cefin his alon case what exactly is tat responsible yesterday we found out a little bit the uus carried out air strikes accoring to seanen targing two facilities at link to arronean back milicious an eastern seri on thursday according to a statement from defen secretary void austin following a series of drawn in rocket attacxagans suus forces in the region the statement said the facilities been used by the iy rc g on that ther'd be the o ranian is lon mic revolutionary guard and if filiated groups the strikes were carried out by pair of of sixteen fighter juts using precision guided munitions thet tarrget a weapons an amalstorage facility an obocomal near the bord between syria and a rock now ostin is attempting to down play the conflict because he does not want to be drawn into an open conflict her tho cost as we say time onian blood ostin described at the strikes as narrowly tailord in self defence he said they were different from the ongoing conflictin goza which of course they live in what is happening right now is thet ron is protting at americans in attempt to get amarica to tell israel to stop in the gosestrip which is not going to happen he directly accusderon then of having a role in the attacks on yous forces and quot oron wants to hide h tan and teni its rolls in tese attacks against our forces we will not let them again the bindministration over all doing the right thing a pushing oron off the ball telling them do not do not screw but when the rubbers can meet the road that is goin to be if israel goes in to goza which presume we will happen on the course next week or by by allofillble information when israel goes into the gosestrip if husbla opens up a second front on thesis really bore will the united states stop husblo from doing that cause cusblot is in eccistential danger to the tate of israel it is not just that they have two hundred thousan rock is pointed at various sighes around israel threatening tens of thousands of not hundreds of thousands of hisrailly livs thousav tera tunnels that presumably strike into israel as well if sleeper sells that hey been working with injured ans omaria the west bank if the united states which st wishes to get that conflict contain e united states is gon to have to get directly involve probably at that point because if they do not than israels gangoholhog it is e ither can be the united states containing the thing or its can be israel devastating it is opposition and maybe bring in eron which then maygo reginal that that right there is the biggest problem the bindadministration nets tit continued to demonstrate a stiff upper lip and a stiff spine if they do this thing will remain contained which is the best interests certainly of the united states and meanwhile mike johnson is the new speaker of the house democrats are moving to try to under caught him as speaker suggesting that he is an extremest of course this is their next move ad thing te can have tough time wit this because mike johnson is very personable fellow jimmy raskin democrat from maryland he is not now accusing johnson of opposing democracy and suggesting at the same time he wants to dan the regulatory state by the way these two things are in conflict banding the regulatory state means in a republic it means up holding democracy the regulatory state is not elected it is appointed he hasing an understand the contradiction what he saying here er's picker mi johnsin your thoughts how well you cannot get to the right a mike johnson tin the magercaukus am if's just the the thing conceivable than you cncet the rightor a an the're people whor deply more lunatick than h he is am and he is got very good manners and he is an able lawyer but am when we say he oppose democracy we know that fro m his giving a legal closh and finish to all do trops arguments about electral fraud and making the independent state legislature doctrine parcuman wich shom the supre fortfortunately di not fight arn good good luck with this argument that the johnsen is a wild extremist but this is the line the media ar going to take own thing that its going to have very much play meanwhile in other stupid congress news gan our congress is filled with dulles jimalboman has now pled guilty to pulling a fire alarm remember

fewling the rises just what is not speeks volumes about thy economies trajectory the key driver of normall e conomic growth which is real private fixed investment meaning i invest in a business it is flat since quarter on of twenty twenty two the residential side is even worse because real privat investment there is below prepounds emic levels because the housing market tornratures are continuent cause the incredibly high mortgage intrest rates right now were exactly is the investmen search coming from inventory firms see in flation continuing and they are stocking up right now ks then won to

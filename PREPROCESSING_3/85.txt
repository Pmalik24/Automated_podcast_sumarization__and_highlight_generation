the venthvir showsponer baxpressvy pian protect our alline pravcy today express vepiantacam slashmen the first rule of politics is this never run directly into a tree while kicking yourself repeatedly in the nuts republicans in congress seem to have for gotten this rule two weeks ago representiv macgates of florda wo ong with linelight seeking compatriotslike represent of nancy mace decided it was times to get rid of speaker of the house coven mc carthy sure mc carthy ad only been speaker for proximately five minutes tand sure in that time mc carthy had defeated jobidon in a stand off over a continuing resolution and was preparing to pract concessions out of sent entemocrats that amounted to a cut intiscressionary spending plus border funding but it was time for mac carthy to go why because of the establishments that is why now you may be asking what is the establishment it towns bad well apparently defining the establishment it is a little asking someone to capture the wind in a bottle or to trap starlight with one's hands sometimes the establish means republicans ho are in favor of tiscal responsibility that establishmen tody polryan sometimes the establishment means republicans who ant to estan the size an scoplic goverment that establishment rhino george shall be bush sometimes the establishment means republicans are socially conservative that establishment stuge mac pens sometimes the establishment means republicans are socially liberal that establishment poen suesan collins sometimes the establishment means people who are hawkish on forn policy that establishment dones linsey ram sometimes the establishment means people r dovish on forein policy that establishment dufis john huntsmen well the turm establishment used to have a meaning it used to mean a persent with power who is too conciliatory to left wing positions but during donal from's presidency when he was the astural president we learn that power had nothing to do with it daeltrum the most powerful person on the plannet was not the establishment during trums presidency we learne that friendliness to left when positions did not make you establishment either after all it was done al trump who declared that entitlement programs the single big estrivers of america's that we are off the table for escussion what makes some one establishment to day the answer insufficient posterig that is it that is the whole thing postering see the only way to avoid being labeled establishment these days is to get nothing done but to yell really really really loudly particularly about the establishment to be anti establishment it is to complain about losing elections while doing nothing to win them it is to estaut that the game is rigged while refusing to even en gage in the game at all tbeing anti establishment has turned into just wining it is about showing what you are against by posterin and then telling your audience that if you posture theatrically enough waver hands around lot your opposition will just surrender passing legislation now recognizing reality doing any of that is surrender to the opposition hell you can even vote with democrats to take down a republican speaker of the house with no back u plan and you will be considered anti establishment all because you yell about the establishment now here is the thing that is fun and games in the commentariat after all in my industry it is easy to remain idealogically pure the beauty of what people me do for living is we can speak i what we wish would happen what the best of all possible worlds would be we can point out where our politicians are falling short of our principles we keep pressur on the politicions that is our job when it comes to congress purism is a recipe for stagnation and is aster that is because believe it or not americans expect that budgets will be pased they expectet legislation will be crafted and if you do not do these things americans will put you in the minority status in the halls of power permanently now because re publicans have to deal with a very slem majority in the house a democratic centent and democratic precident any speaker of the house we will have to fall short of perfectly performative opposition being speaker of a fractious caukis faced with a minority position in the upper chamber and white house necessarily means cutting deals not just postering that was true for ckevenmc carthy it would have en true of steeve scolese it wouldhave been true of jim jordan to if matgates sudenly bkim speaker it would be true for him as well our congress though has now been filled with people responding to the incensive structure created for the commentariat get a tension and money for posturing not legislating you yell about the establishment i eat any one who does anythng in congress and you win points according to macgates ceven mc carthy was the establishment and that meant he had to be d fenice strated in favor of well some one or no one or maybe some one who is i no one we do not actually no actually yet whell we do now is that the speaker will not be cevemc carthy he ove the seventy eight per cent herodage action score and will note be steve scolese he ive the eighty two per cent herdage action score or jim jordan who has the same eighty two per cent herodage action score maybe'll be tomemer who also has an eighty two per cent herdage action score but probably not and probably will not be patric mc henry who also has ineighty two per cent herdage action score at will not even be mackgates who has in eighty four per cent herige actionscore actually it will probaly be no one for a good while longer meanwhile jo bidon we will work to ram through one hundred and five billion dollar dfence package that includes sixty billion dollars for you crane and ten billion dollars for goza all will take is peeling off a few republicans to vote with the democrats again now who could hav helped stop that who could prepose sake a single issue spending bill on forn policy e speaker of the house but we do not have one but at least the establishmen was stop that is the important thing and there is good news if re publicans keep losing the way they did in twenty eighteen and twenty twenty and twenty twenty one and twenty twenty two then i can have to worry about being establishment because they will not have any power at all note that none of thus has anything to dowith principale it has nothing to do with conservatism or victory it has to do instead with applause and cash and fame but for many people in the republican party that is apparently good enough ich should not be re publicans can still win they can still push the ball ford for conservatism but to do that they need to think about how to win not merely how to postur and yell and get on t v they will meed to stop running directly into trees if they do not all they will lend up with is a minority position in congress a democrat in the white house and a terrible terrible ball ache in just one second we will get to tom mc clintoc tomc clintock a very canservative member of congress now ritten open letter to the people who defenistrated mc carthy ask

spectacle bes on friday jim jordon he stood for a third consecutive vote on his speakership and he went down in flaming defeat not becaus jum jorn is bad got but because this calk is is unbelievably fractious it is very difficult to attain two hundred seventeen votes when you only have two hundred twenty one all takes is five people to peel off and gran stan an fun rays in order for a speaker to become in possible to republicans hoe been operating without a speaker for the last three weeks now the problem with that of course is that it makes it very difficult t consolidate against jobidn's positions to take a quick examples i mention befort jobin is now proposing it one hundred and five billion dollars supplemental defence package that defence package lums together a bunch of things that are not alike at all it lums together some border security which is good and some time want security which is good ad some israel security which is good with sixty billion dollars in u cran security which is n and ten billion dollars in funding for twomanitarian concerns in gossa which is super duper bad now if you had a speaker of the house because bills generally are supposed to initiate in the house you could split those apart you could force demicrests takan up or down vote on fourteen or twenty billion dollars for israel and then force them taken up or down vote on the sixty billion dollars the jobin is asking for fre gren you could force them to take ap borter a bor vote just funding the border alone at least get them on record is to whether they support that or not you might dun up with a craftsandwich but at the very least you det people on record as to what it is in the bill they actually support bu republicans cant do that right now because they do not have a speaker and this is now irritated tomiclantock who again is one of the most conservative members of congress from california a super emmigration hawk by the way tomiclintock and a here is what he wrote is a letter to the eight republican to voted two get rid of mc carthy and they voted with all the democrats to get rid mc carthy for some unspecified reason no one can can understand heres ready wrote quote dor wayward colleagues your letter of october twentieth ind which you graciously offered to martyr yourselves as long as you can get your way i's perhaps themost selfless act in american history they they all offered that dome they were going to vote with the team but only if they were willing to suffer censure suspension or removal from the conference he says this i was certain our republican collegue who refuse to vote with the republican majority woul have been inspired by your stirring example of party discipline and loyalty to vote with the team as you eloquently phrased it i was frankly stunned when they did not i do not understand why a handful of our fellow republicans could not see the simple fairness of the principle to which you have been unswerving in your devotion heads i win tails you lose we should have been moved by your willingness to suffer censure suspension or removal from the conference to enforce your personal preferences on the overwhelling majority of your unenlighten collegues we should ave appreciated how you and two hundred six house demicrats saved us from a republican speaker we truly do not deserve you but says tomc clantock to again he is's rang this letter to and he begs can buck to birchit you cran macgates bob good nancy matesin mat rosendale huarthy people who voted against mc carthy the first time to take him dep i say yours sir tomclantoc says your sacrifice is not in vain you have succeeded in replacing the outdated concept of majority rule with an exciting new standard that a speaker must be elected by ninety eat point two percent of the republican conference some day i masie will be born ontos who can achieve this miraculous threshold and on that day your judgment will be vindicated and you will be hailed is the geniusis that you are i think we were all truly humble to learn that your quote fidelity to republican virtues and principles remains on wavering who could not be moved to tears to read that you offer your self sacrifice sincerely and wit the hope of unity with purpose with this in mine i modestly suggest yo planier martyredome in the only way the truly matterse to have the wisdom to see the damage o have done to the country and have the courage to set things ripe efore it is too late i in closed a proposed resolution that perhaps one of you can offers who begin the fourth week of national paralysis as the world burns around us your secret ad mihrer dac and againd the basic idea that tomiclan hes ing what that hell is wronvy people why did you do this the is no prpose do not macgates for his part he is notsart why should mackates be sorry why not why lake really he is making more money he is reckened in off the fun raising he says the he says the establishment a lot i dot that term he loves it he is at lot well yesterday a piece of the wallstr journel by molly ball says quote wit the capital an chaos and the speaker's position going on as third week of vacancy represent of macgates surveye the consequences of his actions and declaredhy had no regerts i have extreme confidence the flort a republican said that we will have an upgrate at the position while i'm i'm sure he is confident that that makes perfect sense any majority powerty is bound to have division says the walstry journal but the uphevals that have rack the house chyopieace ince january our less ar reflection of any co here ant faction and one man's singular will gates does not have a possy heis not a member of the freedom coccas his anti maccarthy grusates have not been joined by marjeric chalor green only half the members who forced who joined him in forcing almacarthy were members of a group he assembled to blockmacarthy nine months ago t's many republica ns the heirsheld gates is personally responsible for not only sparking the coran cas but setting a destructive president the continues to hobble the body a small minorities as sumbled the block any speaker from being elected but he insist he is about outcomes not headlines he says he has received a flood of approving fee back from conservatives across the country cas does not scar me americans ecline does you wrone on social media late thursday now again you gates suggesting that he hatlec as i sedbefore using your power in order to leverage concessions from a party in favor of conservatism i'm fine with ship roy used matgatesis seudo rebellion back in january in order to do that yet a bunch promises from ma carthy many vwhich were good that is owwas happening here matgates is simply playing a game and the game is you become more famous your ont ve more and you raise more money and ou raise your profile more if you yellow establishment really laud run into a try and this has consequences this is not a good thing by the way there nine republicans toare now running for house speakers this allgan go grate they include tom amer of menisoda already people gates have said the'r not con vote frammer represent of kevenhern of oklahoma who chairs the republican study comitte a bunch of the called moderates in the republican cauks probably will not vote for him he voted to overturn the results of the twenty twenty election a bunch of new york republicans are nock on vote for him because of that represent of pete sessions of texas who chared the house rules and national a house rules comittee and the national republican congressional commitee he said that he would be running for speaker as well he also voted against certification of the twenty twenty election again that is can be a big split because for a lot of republicans in order to demonstrate fuelty to donald trump yed to vote against certification but for a lot of republicans wo are in the purple destricts you need to win in order to maintain a majority that do we really want a speaker who is gon be saddled with that represent of austins got of georgia emerged as a surprise speaker canted at last week he ran against geordan in a conference wide vote and got almost novotes represent of byron donalds of florda who ise a relictive he is a secons from congressmen he is become famous mainly as a as a

publican are busy neeing themselves directly in the grin repeatedly the world continues to spin and dem and bad things continue to happen over the corse of the week en comos in the gossisstrip they decided they ware going to make a piarmove now this piar move was design for to purposes one is to try and by time to stop and his raily ground invasion inso the gossesstrip an trying at the media back onside the media have been itching itching to get off israel side after largest masker of gusince the holicos and get back ond to the well moral pare cycal of violins comoss really does have some legitimate concerns train likethey want back on that train bad that can tasted and comasnows that that is purpose number one purpose number too is that kotar which is a regime in th mialease that is very hevily aline with ron and his sort of a terrorist home base for negotiations the usually put the political wing tin kotars o for example when the united states was negotiating with taliban they were doing it in kotar kotar has a home base for komaso is malhania whos te political leader of komas hes staying in a fivestar hotel in otar while gaza is getting bonds he is over there is a kotzar we startand get significant outside pressure as they should to turn commass over to the americans and to stop playing footse with terrorist groups and kotar is making the claim that they are the home of negotiations and the negotiations will only be fruitful if theire sort of left to their own devices coms thid a bi of a favor to kozar which makes sans kaskozar also passes money to tukomas and im and commas released two american hostages over the weeken they do this late on friday afternoon the to american hostages happen to be lip that when i say happen i me the they released partially because of this a related to reporter for en b cnews which again is a way of tryin to buy off the medium here was tem here was the ten b c koverage of the release of the two hosture member there till two hundred an twenty two of them remaining including babies on monday the group postedividio of a woman and made an offer to release foreign hostages ut seenour homass oficial then told and be senews the group is willing to release all civilians and a duel nastrais that with the condition ter o all of the civilians including the isrally civilians i'm sorry if are you coud i just clarify this you say you are willing to release all of the civilians including the isrally nationals if there is the stofin s and what you asking for in order to do that do you want the air strikes to stop as that the condition that our our viewers might hear that and say that this offer does not mean anything that if you are not willing to carry it out then it does not mean anything or you could just release ell the hostages right now by naan enby see news covers it and then israel will not stop the aggression they will not sut's really israel's fault of the hostages i bring how that hamasnos exactly what it is doing commas nos that if it releasees a couple of hostages every often they got two hundred and twenty two of them if they release a couple of hostages every often then maybe the world will hold israel back from going into the gazistrip now as we will see the buy dministration is sending mixed messages on all this and the par war is part an parcel of all this commasage commas committed the wors tetrosity in decades and now they 're trying to buy all of that back and make everybody forget about that because here' the ell even ifthey release all the hossages to morrow there r still fifteen hundred dedjues we are butcherd and mutilated babies murdered in their crebs and all the ress of it and commassibasiclly expecting that the world wil then tell israel to stop that is the mathier and comass is trying to run piarap the piarap is we will release hossges ever often and thn the world will po presser on the ise realease you stop and leave us in power now by administration for its part is sending som mex signals 's on the one hand they are correctly suggesting that the comass terras have to release all the hossages on conditionallist that is what blincoln said yesterday well first cristan we have been working on this from dhey ont i engaged with son different partners in the resion an sending clear messages about the need to immediately and un conditionally release all of the hossages and it was gratifying to a to see that don jutis an atily ron on were released yesterday i had a chance to speak to them as well they were a they sounded don a the strong of mind strongos spirit but a there remain many others and we are hopeful that that more release but the bottom one is this they need to be released eachn't every one of them now unconditionally at that is the right message obviously but even if all the hossages are release comass still has to go and that is the game the comasses playing right now now reason comasshas to go of course is because what the're a tempting to do is obscure what just happened a couple of weeks ago israel has now done something that it has never done they have that they held a press conference to day where they had all members the median the room and they showed them the full go propote footage from various commass terris showing exactly what they did tos rally civilians on octomber seven and it is terrific stuff i mean truly herrific some of it is been described to the general to the general public here tu zazaka is a their first responders in israel here thu zaka volunteers recalling the atrosities that they saw on the ground when they went into these is rally areas tat had been ravaged by comass wway the r hows we o the ca ao se ther a o or ther o wa haa hans a a ala wy wa soso boy o i se a thithi se the as han a se o ors why wo oswa whoos cors or who i iso wo oo i iso lo er i s iha thi o o the is o caso these descriptions that they they just go on and onme eyes torn out fingers torn t all the rest of this sort of stuff israel has a friensic pathology center and they they have gone through all the evidence now theyr m open to th media and what they found were people with charred hands of mars revealing where the victimstands were bound behind thei backs of metal wire before they were burned alive one of the images in the sli shows a completely charred mass of flesh which a first glance could not even be seen as have their having belonged been belonging to a human being whose only after the set scand was dawn of the charred flesh that experts could see what exactly they were looking at and it was a parents any child bound together burned alive by comas terrace two spinal columns were in the stee skan one an adults final columon when a child's spinal column teyr bound the other by metal wires in a final embrace before they were set on fire according to chen and doctor ten cogel whose the head of the national center for friensic medicine in teloveve he said the proportion bodies re receive toward chard is high many ofe gun shot wounds in their hands showing they put ther hands ups their faces in defens many were burned alive in their homes they are burned alie because their suit in teir trak yatn their throats meanig they were still breathing when they were set on fire cogel explained that the age range the victims pands from three months to eighty or nine years old many bodies including those babies are withoutheads asked if tey were decapitated cugel answered yes although he admits that given the circumstances difficult ascertain whether they were decapitated before or afterdeath as well as whether they were beheaded by knife or had their heads blown off by arp g which isreally the big question your seing this from the holicoston iar tody well what were they really behad with a nifhno of their publichset alive if they will not bet if they were just if there was a baby lat its had blown off by an arp g obviously a very different story the reason thenm bringing this up again the reason israel also is bring this up again is to remine people that even if the hostages are turned over comas has to go tisrael has to do what it has to do two get rid of comas and as well see lest is already sending mac signals because this is what many in the west do they refuse to see the evil in front of them and they refusedto understan how the middlyst works which is that if you do not obliterate the evil to day it rises up and hits yu tomorrow israel for its part has ben intensifying the bomming onmultiple fronts and preparing for this gozac grounds operation theire still significant disagreement apparently within his raly circles over whether to going on the ground right now or whether to waited out to essentially keep facilitating movement of gosin civilian south said they can then hit the tunnels because the last thin israel would to do is put two thousand soldiers in harm's w ay in a in a high lee dens urban in viremen that looks much moged isiu according tothe wallster ternal israel rampd up its boming of targton three fronts including a rare air strike in the wessbank as humanitarian aid trickled ins the gosi strip in a international effort to ease the hardship the conflict has wroght on the two million civilians trap their not again one of the thngs that truly amazing about what is happening in the gosistripr now is that i have never seen in my entire life a war in which the party that was a grest agains is now responsible for the civilians of the party that is that is the agressor party during world war too doyou remember a lot of conversation about german civilians and how the eir that how the allies had be very very careful of what they did in froms of killing than osies in terms of german civilians thewas not a lot of talk about that was thrvna talk about that after nine eleven you remember all the talk about we nee to make sure tha we have humanitarian convoys ettng into cobbl during during the postnine elevin period i remeber that either when it comes to this all the sudden its israel's responsibilities deal civilians that are really under the auspecies of comas that again is a game that is being played by the international community in order to i would assume attempt to smuggle in more resources to comas which has been stealing these resources for literally decades at this point international efforts according to the lalster gernal remain under wagh tof free hosages and gosan prevent the fight from asculating into a regional conflict as will see the the united states is trying to do that by both bribing and also by threatening in northern israel a bunch of northern is raily towns have been evacuated cury ochemona which has twenty twothausan people was fully evacuated in the northern front because o the possibility that husbela tempts to gettin the war and start firing rockets into the north of israel that of course would mean a major escalation israel also is taking the gloves off in a way that it should have for the last several decades is taking the gloves off with regard to terror sites for example over the week end israel struck a mosque compound in the west bank they did that because they knew that weapons were being hidden in the mosk an a major taratack was being planned rom theirs the it themoss this of course is the reason why palcing in terrace to hide in mos is then they had de claimd the israel's striking religious sits is the very favorite thing to do meanwhile again the united states is is sort of sending a little bit of mic signals tony blinkan sectary of state he said were concern at the possibility that ronian proxys to can ascullate the war against the united states whathere is the reality they should be a lot more worriedabout asculating he war against the united states then we should be worrid about the mesculating the war against us yous to be purigly frank about this if they fire on it on american worships every one hus belo will be dead n the united states is not a power to be trifled with and the fact that we are constantly andv pussy footing around this wy all well what we are worried about a ronian proxyes escullatin aganst us they should be a lot more worriedabout os esculating against them considering th united states military is most powerful fighting force in the history of the world bar non tav a military budget that is the rest of the world's combined times too they if cusbal lod desides that they want to get it on thit bytheway this the message wou should be conveying them is you want to do this do you really want across that lone do you really wants you that because it will be a giant's foot against a mosquito man here is twenty blinkin theug again the mexsignals here are are tretty pretty re markable tension is very high in the region are you changing your security posture are you pulling any you ask personal out of the area margart we are concern at the the possibility of aronian proxies escolating their attacs against our own personal our own people we are taking every measure to make sure that we can defend them and if necessary respondecisively i mean i'm glad if necessary respons et again this very easy the present united states in his laspeece you should have said we do not want you t ascalate you should not want you asclat is viewuscalat youwill be dead in that that is howit works in ththeleast and pretending otherwise heis really really really done by the way israel is is saying some of that sort of stoff near bar kot who is a member of the the government renow ies israel's minister of the economy he warned oron that if they get directly involved israel q cut the head of the snake off which is what is rael has to convey if they do not convey that then uron will in fact get in and it is worth while moting here that there is in fact a a common interest not nesserly among aron but but even among e ron and not asculating this thing right now the math is this eron has much proxies those proxies include tha who these in yemmen includen husbalon the north of israel include the syrian government include the lebenees regime whichis cosbala and the incluecomos commoss was not sppose to succeed this way the entire goal of this terrace attack was probably kill fifty juesing cannapfive and instead of kill fifteen hundred jews and cannap two hundred and because of that commoss is now an ecestential danger and oron would prefer not to have the night on its chessboard knocked off the chessboard but that iswhat is going to happen and aronna has to consider whether it prefers to lose its night in the gosis trip plas another night in northern israel slash southern lebanon in hesbalo cause if it esclates that is where this is going or whether it just concedes the loss there drant they are desperately trying to spend their way out of commass losing control of the gossis trip and th only question is why the west is con t prevent israel from doing what it needs to do in the gosis trip i think i've fath of the united states not kin to do that because again i think everybody has an interest in seeing commasfall including by the way egypt how do you notice because it actually over the we gen the idea accidentally hit in egyptian outpost and egypt immediately said we get it it happens fathe war for all the talk about how the intire aerberald is united against israel that is not really true basily of the aronian proxies who are united against israel the sounes toar if commos gets taken out wherent we cannotst stay that we are happy about it but we are pretty happy about it were we are pretty much o k with all of that theunited states is seekings about another way which is by off komoss i try and try and pay off tyou's get now this is a strategy that is doumed to failure is a very dum strategy yuyuyou cannot buy off eron you cannot buy off comm oss ou be giving the moneyan they will use it for the worst possible purposes and yet and yet youre seeing again this attempt to win arab support by somehow looking is thogh youre putting clamps on the state of israel when in reality wat the united state should be saying to israel is you do what you need to do and we will push everybody else off the ballf but if you a pure to be holding israel back if you appear to be no trying to tell israel to back off then what you'r really doing is your provideing fodder for the called arab street if you keep saing to israel over and over and over you gots do not do not violate humanrize do not hilt then you are playing directly into the narrative which that there is some sort of human rights comparison between the state of israel and its enemies will get to that momentarily first everybody knew its life in

to day again the west is sending these mixe messages and attempt to sort of contain things now the wayv thyou acth contain thngs in the leases you say if you step over the land i'll hit you hard that i will bomb you ford into the stone age that is what you actually sayin thm at least if you wish things to remain contain because that happens to be the reality and this has been true for literally all of middle eastern history force and threat of force are the coins of the realm in the mat eleast they have always been that and the west is too shy these sdays inc the less lik well what a fleet what i fleet tolk alout human rights do you think the chomas cares about human rights you think a ron cares about human right for that matter even the countries that work allied with do think sout your abet cares deeply about human rights i think not i thing not the car about realistic interests thay care about what they can do that is whre they care about and yet you'r seeing can of this reird push from the west all about human rights and encouraging israel to follow the rules of work understand the entire basis for the terraced opposition to israel is trying to get israel to quon quot obey the rules of warr ind waighs that no other country wood while violating the rules of warriorself this is the way this works jo bidon again it is the sort of stuff fit it it is why having a a dottering president his not gan again again bidin has not been horrible on the situation thus far but he is just not good at this mean he is not with it over the week en he was asked whether israel should delay the graund invation as whe is walking up the stairs two irforce one trying not to trim anda and he said yes which jude that is a confidential military dis custion that you are having with these reallye government tha's not something you should be spilling to the press this is buying time for commass obviously but no no i know is rs laver grand vation in sing anol the hostage now er a case of then they tried to walk back whot the president was far away he did not hea the ful question the question sounded wouldyou to see more hostages released he was in commenting on anything else whell maybe that is true becuse i mean the guy is aihty or maybe he should shut up when he is walking up the stairs me go going quitly he is perfectly happy ignoring most questions as he walks away from the press why this one tony blincon then tried to walk thot one back again these sorts of mix signals do have ramifications in real bloody terms have you asked theis railly government ti delay in order to give you mor time to prokar the release of these hostages first s step back for a second because it is important to remember what happened it is incredible how quickly that get's lost because it was only a couple of weeks ago that hamas invaded israel with ah it is terrice fighders and slaughtered and i use that that were very deliberately slaughtered many a people again then women young children babies aold people a you name it and they continue to rain rockets down on israel what i was there a few days ago we are in the but we were we had to take shelter a couple of times because i te satrockit is from mamass my poat is this no country no country can be expected to tolerate this oht to live with this and as we set from the start israel has both the the right and even the obligation not only to defend itself but to try to make sure that to the best of its ability this cannot happen again now probem is the de opposing point of view thes sort of what is it but hezing ino cycle mot that point of view is incredibly strong the states frmen much that blincon had have a listening session with all this little buddies over the state department as moreons il which an amazing thingwen firstmall what is a college camp cept hav listening sessions with your employes not having e listenging session my imploy yes of whether tisport terrorism or not that is absurd it is absurd hi's a blingon tried to walk it back but then you have the mixs message that is coming out of he byne administration which is but there are many good people on every side i'm but booth s to mytad they are good people on on both sides you might say loid austen these secretary defence who is been very strong is hing israel hould bable to defend itself then he keeps adding this tag israel has to follow the laws of war you knowyou knot a noticed i noticed that the invasion of a rock cost hundreds of thousands of civilian lives hundreds of thousands if not a million civilian lies i noticed and there wais not a whole whole of lot of talk about the sort ofstuff and a rock by the way had not committed a direct terrorist assault on the united states of america but here is loid osten lecturing these railies about how they have to be if to follow the rules of wark com oss literally slaughters babies in their crebs and then takes other babies captive but it is its israel that has to continually be warne about following the laws of ward this tenent this cenon languageis nonsense to your point ach tarded tin as to be that a sess the carefully assesse and we need do everything we can to make sure that civilion ar nat a nat tha injered aat tren an the right thing to do is to make sur that a we account for sovilians at our planning that we provat carders for for theyr movement out of the battles fage that we are not tat that destroying protect it tat an propertys and tat that we are possible tan i think ther's raillis shave been doing this sat for sometin again they are professional force and we will incoura continue to encourage them to make sure that they are doing thange ti an corts let the law war now they neverybody looking over their shoulder and telling them to do things in accordance with the love wore that is the bakening this sort of delusional cycle of violence israel has to be encourage to do the right thing meanwhile they face down a murderous terraus group that et calls for the genicide of all guse all over the plane that sort of stuff has consequences jobiding did a lot of this last week when he gave his address re talk ot how these reallyes had to be warned over over not to take revenge nine eleven now that they to be warned about the the the mistakes of nine eleven the israilies have to be told about human rights that is to be lectured small school children about human rights meawhile the people that fay saying are raping women and take them captive biding over the weekend he tweated out a that this is the the western at tempt to go back to sleep the twoestate solution is dead the reason the twoestates solution is dead is not because israel wants at dead if israel could have hands it over control the godestript to egypt woud do it to day if israel could hand over control of genina to jordint would do it to day israel has no interest in governing these areas because israel is not one govern these areas they are violent and very difficul to run and yet the reason thet twostate solution is dead is because of that it is because these areas are very violent and very difficult to run because they keep electing terror groups for example and have heavy levels of support for the terrigrupe we can all pretend away that the civilian population in the palstin into areas of the west bank that these are full western liberal minded people it is a lie it is not true you'n pretend that about the people the godstrip also a li also not truendso when you say there ought to be a peace process with cone quote the palacin in people the only people you can negotiate with our the representatives of the palisonian people far in history theyve had the following re presentives the palsinian authority led by oser ariphot followed by the palsonian authority led by the holicosan iromachmobas is lomiche hot natural terras group and comas in atural terris group that is theire entire leadership class what dor you jablig tbout two state solution for will gets ta the wages of that in momen eks again it sets up this false binary that makes im possible for israel to do what it eads to do to preserve its own security first i've been talking about my helicks mattress for years i've had that helics sleep mattress for what a decade at this point it really is fantastic i sleep grean on it y wife sleeps great on it and now helixs is introducsing their newest most high and collection the helicsy leat helixyleat harness is years of extensive matress experties to offer a truly elevated sleep experience the helic leet collection

trie out for hundred nightsress free got nothing to lose had anove to helics sleep dot com slash ben to day and get twenty per cent off all mattress orders pluss two free pillows for my listeners to get started get what should have happened with the comas attack is the west waking up to what the threat is and thow have a bunch of consequences in terms of middle east situation it would remind the west that the called free palistine movement is in fact a pro terror movement that hates the west and seeks its destruction that is a realit you pretend that away or yeu cet but it would mean that israel would the far less pressured to make concessions to terrorist groups in terms of what the west would do itwould mean that the westwoard serious ly thing bout restricting itsimigration protoculls mean the number of radicalized is lomic imigrans from northern africot in the midlast over the course of te last twenty years in europe is astonishing which is why you are seen jin giant rallies o cross the westles thos are million thaes are not mainly left wing people theyre some left doing hangers on where two stupid to recognize that the first people get beheaded if the racamoslemstake over are them but the reason tht you are seeing for example a one hundred thousan person procoms rally in londod that is not becaudes you have a bunch of people in london who are moderit muslins qhar just a little upset about th human rights situation in the midleast as he as you have imported hundreds of thousands throughout yourp millions of raticalized islamists who hate the west i mean that that that is to reality ne co pretend again you can petend that away but it is really stupid to ou nto pay the price for it in here is by the way what the vidia look from london and me london covered blanketed hundred thousand people protesting in favor of comass according to the guardian hey said thousands but look the ize of this crowd and it is astonishingly large the metropolton police estimated a hundred thausand people arenticipated the rge the sins that tay free palistine by that they mean by the way all of israel should be obliterated and m again hes a're not all u nice left wingers who just went to the wrong university a huge precented to the people are new imigrans from the middle east and from northern africa who hate jews really really ha jews and that starts in th mat least and pretending that it does not is a serious mistake jobidon or example yesterday he treated out and tretegically he is trying to he is trying to have it both ways hi traing say israel sho defenditself but also the people that it is fighting with very often ther very nice people there said to every one's nice if we could only just come together sey treat out israel has the rght to defend itself we must make sure they have what they need to protect their people to day and always that shouldbe thend ofthe tweet that hould be but it does not at goes on for two more paragraphs quote at the same time pri'ministern intonal when i have discussed how israel mus st operate by the laws of war agand the is this lecturing hecturing tone here if we do not tell israel to stop this then they will be horribly genicidal that means protecting civilians and combet as best they can we cannot ignore the humanity of inocent palistonians who only want to live in peace that is why i secured an agreement for the first shipmen of humanitarian sistemis for thassistance for palstonian cevillins and goza and we cannot give up on a two state solution first of al that is a wild mons equiter ththe the end werasas we cannot give about us with chom you'r tong at oblibere obliterating com os a terrorous scroup what the hellar you' talking about that is far as ignoring the humanity of nnocent innocent palistonians who only want to live in peace they are two thingstat are happening they are one heis thrusting the responsibility for civilians and gossin not on the legitimate government of goza the comm oss right i if the united states t attack by form power the russians you knowis responsibility it is for safeguarding the cevillians in the united states america our government that is t our responsibility is our russian's responsibility we would hope that they follow of the guneva conventions but we have to assume that they might not and stoud be our job to make sure that our civilians are safeguarded that they are provided for that is what any legit tht's literally the job of the government but n the gosistrup apparently does not apply you get both ways gis be a terrorscroup and u have no responsibility for your own civiliant population also the suggestion beneath all of this is that again commosst a few bad apples sto few people who are bad apples that there is no actio which is why a two state solution is possible after all if it turns out that commoss of few bad apples and the palcing an authority is a few bd apples and is lomagy hot as a few bad apples that then really nd lions tend is a few bad apples and has be laws if there just a few bad apples govermeng yet lot of them but but the really just a few batso peace is still possible just in trudau a more on he teated similarly along these lines he he treated out quot tat's members of the palsin and arab an black communities gathered for par asterday wanted them to know this we know your worried an hurting we are here for you we will not stop advocating for civilians to be protected an for international law to be upheld yes that is ii can think of a few civilians who are whare er in fact i can thnk of civilins were burned alive baccamass i can thing of them but this sort of moral equivalence language is what people are comfortablet now i shorn a point out here that these called piece partners here are not pieace partners both govern mentally as well as yes the civilian population injudea and cemaria in theguess bank there is no evidence whatsoever that they are seeking in negotiated piece steal in which the state of isral gets to continue to exist the evidence does not exist for that it is literally non existent the same thing is true in the gozis trip here for examples of palciny an authority minister yesterday oke at the palcin authoritiese are the call moderates these are people that jobidns calling up this guy is thehead of the military wing of the palsingan authorityies whold fata and here he is what he says an englishis in the name of the pata movement we only want national unity they would be national unity with commas by the way here he was yesterday w oe er they seem superpeaceful i feel the two state solution is imminent do not you meanwhile by the way again the lie that gosin civilians are entirely dis connected from comas this does not mean by the way that israel should carget civilians they are not it does not mean that they shuldn't attempt to minimi civillin casualties which thy are that is why theyre pushing people south toward where the electricity and water are still running by the way shops are still open in sonther gosip wut what it does mean is that this this lie that basically it is a few people at the top whare the probemen the rest the population they are just western liberal we can either import them into the west or we can forthe israel to make concessions that ends of the palicinian stakes afterall are not we all the same underneath it is a lie it is not true for example this is vidio from the goaza the the cammass attack from gazam on the ise rally mochovian these are is kiled fifteen hundrd juws and this vidio you are going to see a lot of civilians it turns out it was notchos card carrying mebers of comass heavily armed ind uniform it turns out is a crapload of civilians here' some f the bidio eure people walking around by the open bortagasapasa the these areall the a gozen civilians they will civilians ah they are sell it these are members of camass and civilians o are riding on their trucks people celebrating next two members of comass civilians some of them are on crutches going intwo juisharias to steal things many civilians people riding bikes kids bikes directly out of the jeuish arias stealing things these areall of the uninvolved gazen civilians again the the this sort of attempt to creet a hard idea logical distinction between the gos and population and commas is ridiculous the idea that again there is an idea logical distinction that can be made such that isral must make concessions and that is really what needs to happen here an that and again that the west should accept hundreds of thousands of palsin refuges for example that is can work out well for the united states or for europe that is ridiculous by the way youknowho place thits for all it is worth members of commass for example this is a vidio of mem these are female members of comas and dum this is a the first is from october seventh celebrating the massacre yous are two women in a comaskiere celebrating te massacre wearing full on coamas gear and carrying weapons and firing into the air and in the second vidio below youwill see the acting for the cameras when the is really boms fall on goza this is the of coursethey know the game it is called civilian on civilian off icivill a civilian civilian off when it is time to celebrate rocets falling on his railies civilian on throw on t throw on the civilian garb the minute that the western cameras arrive obta that them celebrating as and jus are murdered and down that this them is them weeping weeping we lawi cannot beleve these really atrocities all it is ilet tons of ios this emerging from goza huns of them an no another one there is in here is another oneof the gozen civilian shouting alahuokbar as the rockets are fired from goza into israel and then crying because of the isralies fighting back a ala a gat's very happy about the our rockets being fired into israel and flash forwardi cannot believe the atrocities thei're taking place i just i cannot believe it its just an it' devistating this is the guy they show on baby sram thire's the kind of person the shon babe sy crying from the insideof a hospital whet the on't shows the first aff re celebrating the rock is being fired into israel this sort of double message is what continues to allow the west to blind itself on a routine basis just constantly blinding itself by the way while we are trying to get the the humanitarian eight into goza it is worth noting here that commas is literally literally right now corn ganci blinkin preventing american citizens in goza not tha not the kinaf erab americans were in goza commas is trying to stop them from leaving we are smuggling them aid and athe same time of commass is trying to prevent the american civilians from leaving but do not wory these are many many wonderful people in terms tot what is happening in gaza i know there are inascimated five to six hundred americans there is there any chance israel let some of those americans out or egypt alout semilos americans and you are exactly right and to dat at least hamas has block them from leaving showing once again it is total dis regard for civilians of any kind a who are who are stuck in goza well and me there is a shock there is an absolute chapadory guys havmin really the two o tthe peace process to two states slution muskinsu of is now sure's then we send that mixed message to the western public the public gets the mi message the public gets the mix mssage and by the way they are constantly being told things that are untrue about the nature of of many people wh immigrate to the west just you take a quick example there is a poll from an organization called signal the this poll pulled americans on wide variety of issues including the palcinians and one of things that a found is that four example muslem americans in the united states according to this pole have a pluss sixteen that favorable favorable rating four palsinian authority president macuadabas and a net four per cent favorable rating for the leader of camass americans by the way are forty seven points under water on the leader of the the commass terrist organization but muslem americans are four points over water on the leader of comss also it turns out that muslem americans unfortunately a majority of musliem americans according this signal pole are not anticamass which is unfortunate apporent apparently a majority f muslem americans have a positive view of gassa not only thout it turns out that a majority of muslem americans tis agree that israelshon invaged gossip a majority a large majority fifty eight per cent muslem americans agree that commoss was justified in its attack on israel fifty eight per cent when it comes to again the lie that all humn beings think the same way and have the same values that is wrong and it is a stupid stupid thing to believe but americans are injusting it which his wive for example there is a new pull from the lostr journal and what it shows is e twenty twenty two survey twenty twenty two survey seventy five per cent of americans have a positive view of the is raely people fifty one per cent of americans have a favorable view of the palistinian people om i'm just wondering what that would be based on sere's a yyou can have an unfavorable view of people and also not believe that they should be mistreated or harmed it anyway but what it is that separations this idea that again everybody just wants the same thing everybody just w love to have the sae we all agree on all of these things by the way this new pole from the walstr journal shows that if your under the age of thirty a broad majority do not support israel in its war against comas the this statistics among young people by the way are just eva stating because again when yu indoctrinate people in a post colonialist idiotic wile left wing wretched of the earth mine said this what you went up with tthere is polling data than now shows that young americans perticcarly are heavily sympathetic to actual terrorism according two this poll from harvard herris tha but this harvard haris pole shows that here is the question do you think the commass killing of twelve hundred is rally villions in israel can be justifyed by the grievances of palistinians or is not justified the older you get the more sanuar on this question if you are above the age of sixty five ninety one per cents they not justified if you are between the ages of eighteen an twenty four a majority a majort fifty one per cent f people aged eighteen twenty for believe that comass is justified in murdering twelve hundred civilians justified fifty one per cent if you are betwen theages twenty five and thirty four barily minorty forty eight per cent believe that that is still justified that is insane by the the same the same exact pole says do you think the attacks on jhos were genicidel in nature or notcenicidal eighteen to twenty four sixtey two percents a geniidl which is wild sixty two per cent of young americans eighteen twenty four say that the attacks by comos were genicidl but fifty one per cent still say they were justified which is nuts which is nuts but again this is what happens when you indoctrnate people into the belief system of multi culturalism all cultures are equal all cultures are equillent now a gain this has wages and neffects into the west when you import hundreds of thousands o people who believe this sort of stuff things ten to get pretty ugly and thes wive seen mass protest not only in london but mass anti israel protest in york city mass antismetic protest in yoursaty hears what itlooked over the weekend is in brooklan people im they geting rough wot the police officers but you nof nobot deal because theyre they are the right political persuasion at very wisis free press very of course is a a azionist and in jew and at her office is t the free press somebody came by an an grifeeted outside the offist f jews thet obviously people who los t they have territorial disputes meanwhile a a a woman who is a detroit jewish community leader name mante wool was murdered over the weekend the police have yet two established who exactly did it but they are th they are jumping to the conclusion that they know the motive which is interesting i'm weu'll find out whether that is true or not but certainly tensions are running incredibly hig accoring to the washington free beacon and it is raely harbard business schoolstuden was a costin harassed a mid a gassa die in on campas here is what that looked w d ift ta ther throin t he athe also in skoky skoky is most famously the site of a neo notsy march in which the left suggested that one has rigt for speech an al the reste but y the nunionats he is the neonionatzes i they arrived in skoky as well they are supposed to hold their protest actually and im in downtown chicago and then they saw that the jews were goin to hold their protest in scoky which is a hevily jewish part of chicago my grandmother you live there and im sin of scoky pretty well and im very very jewish aria of chicago naturally go or the jews are m if you wanta targa jews is where you go two people were taken into police custodown sunday evening after one man electurally fire a shot in the eir you are demonstrators why do that happen apparently his car was surrounded het is rally flags on it and people started ripping the flag apart off the car and surrounded the cars who felt scarecelo got ou ofthe kirn fire to shot in the air he was arrested im but tim the fact that they are going to jewish arias meaning the the antisimies are going to jewisharias an ore staur trouble bat of course is a not a shock heres wat it look this lor lumer have proms of war but this covern is is is good and necessary and again they went to the jewish aria that is the whole point i love the palistinian and here' supporter shouting shame on you after e massocerringyou know twelve hundred jews come os tan thas that next perpesent sotenshens are high the good news is again when you cultivate not only people who are terr supporters in the west but also a bunch of useful idiots in the last that is very helpful the your times of populated entirely by useful idiots this is how you have useful idiot mishell golberg writing an entire column called it is impossible to know what to believe in this hideous war a no i actually now what to believe in who to believe in this in the ideous war ashly i actually that i love the throwng up of the hans i do not know i do a i'm sure mishelgulberg they know they know that if if you if you accedetly finder self le gocestrip they will know to do with you becauseyour last tem is golberg it turns out obviously it is too much sjus just us noitably or youhve nick kristov we must not kill gosen children to try to protect israel children no one's killing gos an children exept for commass which is putting its children in in the way of bombs but nicholas cristof again looking for that moral equivalence that very comfortable luk warm soft embrace of moral equivalent the crisis in the mbolice is a notty test of our humanidy asking how to respond to a grotesque provocation of which there is no good remedy and in this tast we in th west are not doing well the acceptance of large skell bommbing of gaza and a ground invasion likely to begin suggjest palsinian children are less er victims the valued by their association with amout no it does not it assumes that the only way he soverens tak can protect its territories by taking out terrace o mudera citizens that is what it assumes that is that is literally the untirething but again that soft squishy moral relative smas everybody's favorite and then you have people who are we have been hinting at their anticenatism particulary with regard israel for quite a whild dave shi pell comes to mone now everybody including me was willing to overlook his space jews routine in which he suggested that of course the jews where the big colonizer is in th middle eased and he basically perited all of the anti isrel antisoninists antijewish nonsense that has been promoted around the left wing for years and yearsand in one o his old specials and iccoun't look the other way and as i ull cay whatever you knowhe is commedion apparently he was sort of standing forkomasand of course calling israel human rights violator at one of his shows last week and bunch people walked out he suggested israels to giant human rights violator and all the rest of this and you can always count on holliwood to contribute it is bit moreonsin hollywood now all all all the best people it all of them all all your moral exumplars everybody from malisamalano who took a break from standing for abortion to stand with terrase apparently she likes dead babies across the board asee got a lissmalana you have david cross if people hassan minhage recently spotted falsifying many of his personal stories about american anti arab sentiment jeremy strong who is a is far up his own rear that he a he has become totally familiar with donkcolan christen stuart macklamoar mark ruffalo who in by the way i would trade any of these people franin of the hostagers and gos right now at 'll see how they enjoy it over there ryan coogler thedirector of black panther susan surannon no shock there runimara john steart who is it just ta despicable human being wandasykes rosario dasin cape blanshet andrew garfield maharshaa a'l lee america forera recently the star of barby wakeen phenix all these people signed t e letter and what is the letter say the letter says that israel must stop it must stop you must leave the terracin place they weore letter to the president quote 's your president we come together as artisan advocates but imost importantly as human beings witnessing th devastating loss of lives and unfolding horrors in israel and palestine we ask that as president of the united states you call for an immediate deescullation and zeasefire ind gossa and israel before another life is lost there is a zero mention in this entire letter of camass there is zero mention of what let off this conflict this is the way by the way that moral morons do what they do what they does they just ignore the beginning of everywar it is really it is it is it is a fun way to again escape moral culpability and the fact that you wed in fact ar a fellow traveller with cammas to do all of this stuff makes a really easy youst ignore what started th whole thing theyen doing this for twenty years come ass fireas much o rockets at is really's villan centeres israel retaliets ho the violence must stop sang ghat what what let ofthe violence if you can ignore it then you can just move right back into that warm bath of moral equivalence but here is the reality th moralcolans does not exist and gess what realityes gin to hyou directly in the face if you continue with this nonsense the west has a tchoice thay caneither wake up or they can continue to to facilitate moral idiocy in the name of tolerance it is not sjust can be jucso pey the price for that one by the way ardigie the

as the economy begins to soften and the cranewar drags on trobidons poll numbers show his vulnerability the will re publicans be able to take advantage and benture of this is the bench vero sho e benchpurish responserbas pressve pien pretect our all mine pravsy today expressvy pianti com flashbet reveen alot of speculation for a very long time that the economy was going to soften in now it is finally begun according to the wall street journal earnings for the nations biggest companies are poise to fall for the third straight quarter or hurt in part by the cline in energy prices i exactly antwy technically in arrocession presumably because consumer spending remains pretty high bes while the inflation in the economy these while the extra dollars that yuiton blue into th econom cause the easy mony policies the federal reservitaces wile for that t wash its way out of the economy but as that happens consumers are not going to be able to out pase producers producers are starting to cut back they are seeing the riting on the wall theyare starting consolidate their gains and theyarestarting to realize that if they continue to expands their actual manufacturing their actual production thn they are going to under cut themselves and you are starting to see earnings to clines for virtually every major company the members ofthe esson ke five hundred according to the wall stroturnal on pace to collectively report of five point two per cents the cline in earnings the worst performance since twenty twenty revenue is on tracks ries yerp phen six percent from a year ago but that is largely due to inflation at this point some of this is due to the decline in oil prices for example the energy sector is taking at right on the chin but it is also happening in materials end its also happening intack apple sals fell for the third consecutive quarter amidsoftening teman for consumer devices the only areas that continue to have quarterly revenue growth are areas of helf care communication serviceis real estate is continuing to sort of hold steady at this point but we are about to see more of these companies report bad earnings and that means that the economy is likely to see a down turn in the coming quarters employment numbers came out on friday their weaker then expected that of course is not greatly a shock because as we'ave been saying for monthyo on this programm what goes up must come down the idead that overyheated economy was not going to crash off the cliff was always a rather specious presumption meanwhile on foreign policy the cranewar continues a pace according to the near times u cranian forces struct two bridges connecting russian occupied crimea to the rest of you crane on sunday part of a broader pattern of attacks on and around the penensula tht i sought to scramble critical supply routs for the crumlin and push the scope of the war infresh territory the zall part of the ucranian offensive their hoping that they will push the russians back much that the russians will come to the negotiating table the question at this point is what exactly the russians are asking for because everybody knows the lines of the negotiation here and they also recognize that there is a missillimement of incentives the west keep saying that st lens he gets to make the deals lens ke keep saying their will be note deal until the russians are off of all of russian territory and the russians keep saying there will be nodeal if they are trying to put if they are being pushed out of what they consider now to be formal russian territory namelying crimea and the donbas region sundays attacks intured a driver and close traffic on a second bridge to the east of chon har near the small town of henichask according to the gu vernor of the region vladimers haldo whos russian god one of the strikes tor three holes in another road way as well you crame to arn forces took crad for both strikes on sunday another departure for them typically quoy approach as lansk an other top officials emphasize their new amis to force ordinary russians to face up to the crumblan's worst things are likely to get worse before they get batter meanwhile the american public do not have their heart in this any more by poles a plurality of americans are not interested in an endless level of support for the crane mar or really for much more support than his already been given at this point and russian and chinese forces are also upping the anty over the weak end a combine russian an chinese naval force patralldinear the cost of alaska in what youus expert said appears to be the largest such flotila to approach american shores apparently eleven russian an chinese ships seem close to the illusian islands according to us officials the ships tnever entered yus territorial waters there wre shouted by for uus destroyers in the p ate pasidon air craft it is historical first said bren saddler senior research fellow at the heridac foundation given the contect of the lorn u crane intentions around tiwan this move is highly provocative a spokesman four theus northern command confirme russia and china had carried out a combine naval patron their laska inspecify the number of ships or their precise location russia and china are uping the anti and meanwhile the by deministration really has no plan because while they are asking for concessions from china while they continue to fun the war in eu crane there is no offramp with regard to the war in eucrane to low us to shift focus to china and meanwhile china is realizing that it is going o be boxed in both demographically in economically in very short order all of which spells the possibility of future conflict now let us recognize something it is the unpredictability in change in merica's forn policy from weak and passive to aggressive that really throws people off kilter and the fact is that russian ever wouldha invaded oucrane if it had not been for the sins of the former bidan a ministration one which ares vice president of the united states you remember that russia actually invaded oucrane originally in twenty fourteen that is whon borokobamos president of the united states over the week and obama did anothere flawning interview with the glowing media in which he clai that they did all the right things heres christiana amon poor one the worst sudo journalist in the business asking barakobama about american forin policy when russia first invaded crimia and part of what happened whas both why but also morkal whoi give enormous credit for hav to poll in a lot of other europeanse kicken an screame to impose the sanctions that we did and to prevent prudent from cantin e n thro the don bus antwerd the rest of your crime i actually think thatt given both were you cranlas out of patimman word be your god monso was not the time o we held the line o canles be clear they did not hold the line and the entire attempt to hand over crimea two russia in the first place was deeply tied to barakobamas pathetically in transigens approach with regard to a run who is trying to con to deal with ron a newclearseal thron he wanted russia t help broker that deal untill he was willing to hang crimea to the russians in order to make sure that that happen and then when there is another russian advance in you cran this time tobidons precident of the united states we can see why russha thougt they wre going to get away with it again it is confusion in form policy that leads to all of these prots and all of them are serings you stack up with regid to jobidons administration the poling number show that he is really really weak right now heis pulling even with donald trump in michingan in most of the major national pols right now donald trump is running about even with jobidon the latest national poles have yobiding up one according te insider advantage tide according to your temsiena up three accordig to he moring consult and trump up for according to messengeur herisaks that says the jobidon is running extremely weak right now an he should be because polichies are absolutely awful and when you linked out with the fact that the hunts orbidan scandal is not nearly over and could easily break into the man stream over the course of the next year and a half democrats should be running scared if act your taringcy if you cracks in the base for the democratic party representive jake ashing closstemocrato masschusetts he finally admitted on national tevy that if hunter committed crimes you should face penalties for that hunterbidon committed crimes tonter bine to pase custis aan accountability for those crimes which by the way f the sentans that i have heard vary few republican say about donald trum from much more massof crimes this pokes the thesession i would say on hunter bidon is really just the walker of what about a to the republicans are tryine to the flact to diminise to the tang adonald trun trong vhe grave crime of conspiracy a dens the constitution of the nated faith gan this is going to be the great mister rac to buy the emocracts is going to be to donald trump and the question is to whethe republicans can take advantage of jobidon's weakness rest almost entirely on whether the republican base is going to nominate a person who is going to make the entire subject of the next election about his various foibls and legal

that the rest of the country believes they believe about donal trump if you listen to republicans in the base talk about what is going on donal trump in the myread trials that' been brought against him the trial in manhatton the trial in florida the trial now in washington to see when republicans talk about this they say that the subject of the next election should be the corruption of the dogey and i agree then ideal worl wou' be talking endlessly wit then dapendance about the corruption of the do jaine t weapons ation of lon forcemen in the use of the f be ie to go after nonal trump begining in twenty fifteen at hehe houst of the hillory clintin campagn all that all that should be highly relevant is that going to be the topic the bread and butter topic upon which americans vote or are they simply going to make the general decision they always make an every election it which is do i this guide do i trust this guide do i think this person is likely to lead to a more stable america where i can send my kid two school knowing they will be safe and wher i can have bread on the table i thout those of the real big questions and re publicans can win on those questions because democrats have made the country less safe with regard to crime tbecause democrats ar threaten your kids in terms the values they are promalgating at schools all those questions our questions republicans can win but not if they never talk about it again if the censer issue in twenty twenty four is weather the do j is being mean to donald trump for political purposes or whether donal trump is in fact committing criminal act that is not going to be a winning formula for republicans in twenty twenty four it just is not the only way that is woinning formula is if many democrats stay home because they are just unhappy with jobidon the donal trump squeaks by but that is not a recipe for a sort of broad based electoral victory that is ha recipe that relies on lock and you only start our business one othans we we seid the vere beginning of of daily wire was luck is not a business stratigy whil luck is not a political stratigy either and the idea tha you are going justs going to luck in to twenty sixteen again the basically jobidon will not visit wis gonson or he will not visit michigan that that he will just go absent in the election where the democraticgan to stay home again ther'e are couple factors the militate against that one of them is the factor that a lot of democrats remember twenty sixteen and they remember that when they thought hilery clint was a ninety nine prercent lock to win they did not show up an to donal trumpin can presedent number two thori clin in the poles is running well ahead of where jobidon is running right now if you are a democrat you understand there is a very real risk the donal trump is going to get back in the white house which means yofre very motivated to go and vote again when it comes to the message of the campaign tdemocrafts are gonett be able two basically shy away from whatever is the supposed corruption in the ojay the elege cruption corruption i think is very real and very parson they'e metble to shyway from that in just talk endlesely about donal trump and donal trump loves to talk abut donal trump in the entire electorwill be about donal trump if the elections about donal trump he is going to lose if the electionsabout tobidon he is going to lose this is not a particularly hard mouth again whichever candidate is the subject of the ref rundum we will lose nobody elect jobidons of there din about jobidon at the time they pull the lever there can vote for his oponent and if they are thing about donal trump et the time they vote they are pobably going to vote for tobit what exactly has trump been doing wha just what you would think he is been doing sure he is yo handling his legal troubles and sure he is talking about that stuff but he is spending zero foka s at all on his actual political opponent all of his folk is right now an agan he cannot blame him for this because if you are hit with eighty seven charge is or at evertis if you are it them you youould also spend al of your mental energy thinking about that sort of stuff and presumably truth socialling about that sort of stuff at all and ours that now trump does that even on a good day but on a bad day he is for shur going to do that but the problem is again that were donal trump puts his spotlight is also where the media are happy put their spotlight and were democrats are happiy but there spotlight if every waking hour is spens ontonal trump's truth social talking about how much he hates an ancypolocian jacksmethin my pens that is not a recipe for electoral success and here is the thing i want jo biden not to be president of the united states any more i think he is a terrible president by the way on neven think jo bidon is reallyin control iofve done ministration i think that the staff people nmasknis for while choactury runs the the bidon administration and the answer is basically everybody whos staff for barokobama i's a really fascinating in of vie over atablet magazine with david garro who is a biographer of barokobama hoeur tobiography in twenty seventeen a barokabam those largely ignored by the medio bs t was not complementary that biography o barokabama included the fact to barokobama and he is youngerdays with pretty rapidly antismatic that which is not a shock he set in jer my rate church for twenty years as as we will know that he wrote love letteris to his groal friends in which he talkd by fant sees gas it to all sorts of really salacious and ugly material in that biography by david garro who is a poets urprise winning historian by the way and a david gerrot says in n interview with tablet magazine that jobidon is not running large parts of his ad ministration obama is he does not have to pick up the pone becas all his people are already in the white house they hold the aronfile tony blincoln does not rob malley is just one person bret mac garc and should pear on israelly somonico in justice is in rice runng do mestic policy it is turtles all the way down their obviously large parts of the white house policy making that belonged to barokobom because their staff by his people who work for him and nos out report back to him personel is policy as they say in washington again this a biographer barokobama david garsas to me this is very odd an kindof a spooky arrangement spooky because it is tappening outside the constitutional framework of the united states government and yet somehow 'as been placed awful list of permitted subjects to report on which the pretty good indicator of the exstent to which the in formation we get and public reactions that in formation is being successfully control that of course is exactly right but one of the things that is thappening here is that were not talking about any of that stuff the only thing that we are spending our time talking about presumably thes donal trumps legal troubles which we will get to in just once si going to latest on that first the economy is really on sort of a razors adge un clear which way it is going to go i'm big into diversification particularly into assets that are likely to a crue in value over time days igo are long timespons or masterworks de liverday

access to skip the waigtless simply by going to masterwork stot com slashmen again that is masterwrks dot colm slash men important dis closes in rists of in vasthing at masterworks dot colm slash c d go check them out righ now masterworks dot colm slash bent om meanwhile the trump team is getting ready to go to cuaurt and thay have a bunch of different defencis that theyave ben putting forward one of donald trumps lawyers thame john lawrow e's been all over the news making defencis of presiden trum he points out that presidenen trump's expressions of concern over election regularities that is all first amendment protected material he is pointing out also that the actual statues them en broaud in the indictmen against donald trump are not actually properly formulated very likely there may even be a preempt of appeal to the suprem court to try to get this thing stop a sap as fast as possible tha is been courage by people ranging for markle of indicentor might lee in u tot a florry of intres in statements on sunday from trumpet is legalteen previude hin the might seek to ofend the form presidents against federal conspiracy charges according to lowrowl sundan a b cees thatd the government will never be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that presiden trump had corupt or criminal intent that is what this case is it bout now that is again that that is the legal issue and whether it is true or whether it is false we are going to find out donal trump has the deck stackd against him no question becase the judge in this case number one is a dedicated demacrat who ashry served to the same lawfirm as hunter bide an apparently because this is taking place in washington t c which the very un friendly area for jury selection apparently seem trump luss to get the thing moved it to virginia becaus thy believe that washington d c is a place where trump cannot get a fair trial and of course there is only one of three trials the trumpets truntly under going and we are expecting the georga t to drop a indictment on donald trump any moments hat'll be four different trials over the course of the next year well all that is true and gain all that is it really is outrageous a gare not thit ther just to go through each case once more te manhanton e a'es case s absoluty species it is garbage this one about stormy daniels and donal trump supposedly taking personal money and spending it on stormy daniels to silen ter as supposed o campaign money its it is it is all ridiculous it is well beyon the scope of the manhanton he did it any way because he wants to be famous it is a ridiculous case that wen sho be thrown out smmarily but it is a manhattons who could get con victed the one down in florida about class vy dockments of pretty serious case because donal trump ted the criming on tape do not do criming on tape first rule of law with that set should be prosecuted the political cases it shouln't be proscue because hillery qlint was not prosecuted for essentially the exact same crime but in a cort of law could donal trumpy proscuted sure but is also in florita which is a much more frendly territory for donald trumpsince one the state twice and then you had on up to washington t c and n incredibly weak case brought by jacksmith on the january sixth matters again if yoe want to bring a thargemendightmen that is not actual criminal trargington bother to bring that charge becaue he coudn' prove it to instead he bought a bunch of ancilary charges ranging from obstruction of justice to fraud none of those statutes really seem to applyt all of that can be true and at the very same time on a political level all donall trumpeted over the weekend all he did over and over and over is justreet about this tnd that is all the selection is going to be question for you and am normal conservative or normal andipendet is is this top of mind for yous this the thing you wake up every morning outraged abot for certain person is the population shore is that population larger than twenty five thirdyto per cent i have serious doubts that that is the case considering again that a solid majority of independence think trump should be invited andthay on eally care about what the charge is o me very hard to convinced tats independence not only should trum not be invited he should be elected because he is being invited tht is a very very heavy left and gen i encourage republicance to think pretty seriously about who they think is likely to be jobidon not just about who they think it feels good to nominate thoes are not the same thing over the weekain donal trump started at going after the judge in this particular case he said therei's all caps there is no ad an get a fair trial with the judge assigned to the ridiculous freedom of speech fair election's case everybody knows this and to she we will be immediately asking for a cusal this judge on very powerful grounds and likewise for venu change out of d c judd shot can of course is in a pointe af former president barocabab and gen i'm not saying that trumps concern here is not wel predicated i think that it is as emason be see legal analist if a henderson says this judge his trumps worst nightmarei me that is true this is a very left wing judge obviously in trank turns tamen seis trumps worst nightmare and she is legal teams the worst nightmare on discetety real when i say it the black woman with a law degree is at vertial unstopable forse what it comes to the just tis tis then here is e reason why te takg u em on is ben se tat te to tete in forms to discrimination discrimination bason ginder discrimination basion rase the expecting tem on the lawn chems tot how thingsor actually suppose to work then you put thim in in vironment with a s ceople get mis cheatin based on who they are every single day of their career now you have got some body walking into hert cort roes thangill hang on is tacon i di ser te the te chetin differently be as i used to be sipret cowerfur person an expecte comis stipret cowerfor personangan that is not going to work on her ow gay the fact that the left is excited about this judge demonstrates that trump is exactly one hundred percent right again the case that this person is making is that because of fridentity as a black woman this will make her trumps wors nghtmare which is the opposite of being a good judge what immeans to be a good judge that you in partially decide the case in front of you not tha you look deep within the wells of your own sool and then come up with some sort of jerryrids explanation for why the bad orange man has to go to jail that is exactly the emison be sianals to sant to again trumps complaints oure well predicated here about the judge i think there is very little doubt about that the question for re publicans is should that be the basis on which the elections run it does not stop there of course because the posters keep coming and coming and coming over the week n ll gets imore on this in just one second first gi tell you really really rough weekend our baby is doing to have on told he came down with r s v m trouble breathing that meant that we are up a lot of the night lik pretty much every night over the weekend and in those rar r moments when we ots to lie down we need to go tosleep right away and here is where helics sleep at mattress was really really useful i

liksleep got comslashmen with helics better sleep starts right now case o this was not donal trums only complaint over the week ans o donal trump also sent out a a missive saying in all capital letters if you'l go after me i'm coming after you totally on clear who exactly he is talking about here the the implication seems to be that the deo jays coming after him sofies presedent of the united states afterward that heis going to go after corrupt members o the geogei wich is not tirely within his purviou that however sent jack smith spiral wing chatsmith is the prosecutor in this case the special council he filed the motion he the in in the motion he set all the proposed to order seeks to preventness the improper disemination or use of discovery materials including to the public such a restriction s particularly important in this case because the defendent has previously should public statements on social media regarding witness's judge's torniyes and others dosociate with legal matters penning against him in recent days regarding this case the defenden has issued multiplepos either specificlly or by implication including the following if you got for man coming after you if the defendet were to begin issuing public posi using details or for example grandjury transcripts obtained in hiscovery here it coul have a harmful chowing effects on witnesses or adversely effect the fair administration of justice in this case trump later defended the claim he said it was not about potentral witness is who was not him threatening people he said thatit was forequote the rhynot chinal loving dossonestspecial interest crupts and super pats lik the one's funded by the coke brothers and club for no growth which may very well be the case but again this is just how things are gong t get litigated all the way until all of this is over he did not stop there he went off about his a civil rights being violated again i'm not saying that donal trump is wrong about any of this i'm just asking whether this is an elect toral strategy that seems to be worth while here was donal trump going off on his a civil rights being violated an montgomery albamaraly on friday the only civil right thate bin vinatn in this matter mi sive ri thes of the countless people the biin that cime in this sip en persecutin they are come in is o the markis inter the people that do not get it the get the younw the visious this man but wis sgader and whith cotre than they are now again all of this maybe finand well and good is it the sub ject of the election i feelik ofm beatin a dead horse here but the horse are not tad yet in the sense that people keep saying over and over that if the election is ronon this basist on al trumple windnd i just do not see the evidence of that over the wee gan he also went after veriously nancy plosy and make pence on truth social he went off on nancy plosed caus nancy plose suggesced tat he looked a scared puppy which is definitelye getting his goat and trump put out on truth social i purposely did not common on nancy plose's very weird story concerning her husban but now i can because she said something about me with glee that was really quite ficious i saw a scared puppy she said as she watch me on telivition millions of others that did not see that i was not scared nevertheless hi mean a thing to say she is a wicked witch whose husband's journey from hell starts and finishes with her she is a sick and te mented cyche who will some dhay live in hell all capital letters who ze again i ask you whoi's this win over wisconsin michigan pennsylvania who is it georgia arizona who are the voters wor well now that he did say that she is a sick in the mentat cychel will some day livin hell ad that her husban's journey to hell starts and finishes with her now i'm totally in this sou be one thing if you are running for reelection he is now running after an election that he lost in he is gan afe to wind some additional votes who does he win over with this and meanwhile he is going after make penc pence who is said that ehas no plans to testify against trump over the week en to mike pence he he' said that and then trump came back at him and said wol it is finally happen little mike pence he is runnin out of ningnamesly staring to cycle through the symnic names over hember there is litte maca lemace bem and then there is criket hellary is now crooked je she is now recycling them which is good for the environments is little mike pence a man who is about to be ousted is governor of indiana antill ike him along and made him v p has gone to the dark side bro the power of the dack si sad never told a newly an bolden not base on his too per send numbers pence to put me above the constitution or the mike was too honest he is de lusional and now he wants to show hye's a toughguy i once hore ta major magzinarclonmike it said he was not a very god person i was surprise but the article was right sad how many people has don ald from selected for positions a power who turn out not to be very good people is it pretty much every one shee tha th man has the worst selection in a in personal in human history or it is turns out that he crosss sword to th lot of the people who went up working for him because he does not do the right thing very often with those people he also ran throughout fellow republicans over the weekan here he was suggesting that dup it is o the republican's fault that he is being indicted right now which again is weird con sidering that is really his own ocaes democrat'sfault and it is his fault but it is hard to blame say m rondasantis or marke rubyo or chris christy or mike pence for what donal trump did to thinks can be tr once he can be un fairly targedinn also in many's cases of pritigood classifi docman's case jude made his bad and now he is having ta lie in it and it is not pleasant and he should not be given to frenchal romen from hellery clinton but blaming othe republicans for his own failings that at' some point w ol republican voters look in him and say you are a little responsible for your own actions here no a little but when they dited the ppolitical opponent and they did that i should know that lobs eroff he is a crokcan in compitet they and he should not be allowed to be esin and the republic is better get to and they better get smart because most of e look a bunch yo week jet straht ow and you got to get to and smart and you have to fight fire with fire you cannot allow this to go on it is othe republican's faults the gi was present in for four long years and he alowed his entire justice department apparently to be completely run through with people who hated is gots and did not thit but now it is the fault of vrando congress persen from iowa that is it ye again is this a winning electoral strategy i ask you this over and over and over i'm not con a stop askyou because the only thing the matters to me the only thing the matters to me its what the policy of the united states looks going forward don trumps personal packadillos and his myriad foibles i was going to put those aside when he was doing good stuff for the country the question is is he can have a chance to do those things again by being re elected president on the basis of those things ind sdonon trumps campaign for reelection is actually very simple things were better when i was president jobidon has been a terrible president you want a folkass on my legal stff i'll take car of it an corpics i'm big and brave and strong and stoic and ill just take care of all of it in court and if they come after me it is because they'r corrupt but the real issue here is that jobidon is a terrible president and every day from now untill the election i'm an talk abou wa a terrible presiden in jobidon is and not coin look at the the sort of victimisation naritive here i'm not going to focus in i'md how the biggest story in a merica's how people are being mean to me legally speaking i can handle that i'm ae big boy a'm very rich person i've gone through these battles before i'll continued go through tese battles but the real issue here is jobidon but trobidon does not ever seem to leave presiden trump's lips anm that is going be a probem with him in a general election and if trump fans and and re publicans decide it the chief fact or in terums of conservative loyalty it is somehow following trump down the primrose path to losing i do not see that here i do not do not see how that works it seems there is certain not therster number of people who are who are very into this sort of thing th the rockam stockam robots of it more than they the idea of actually taking jobidan out of the presidency over the week an lir trum the ad the president's daughter in law she a shofs talking about hoa trump is stoic and hes standing up to he baggis anta an she got a big hand for this from republican crowd on handidy i saw my father and lot to day i sawhm on the way to the plane i sawm get off the plane i think a whole world the who hi donald tonway i that is a pretty nighcan i well say abad it is now that i believe that donal trump was made for such a time as that is because any other perse that what hi hael he is fighting for everything american io case i just have a question who what would it mean to crumble i want cut a plead deal what'od hi mean to crumble at this point just just purely on a factual level he is being indicted and now he is defending which is usually it happens wen some ie gets invicted and then defends and again when comes to the dcy indictment it is complete bull crap the jacksmith is putting for one comes to the florida indictment that is his own fault he did not have to keep those documents he could hve given the documents backs the natinal arcives and as i say un just prosecution sure becase it is politically modivated at the same time what would hav ben a smart thing is not to keep the documents and not to step on the rake in the first place but our re publicans can arun on that basis i want to see the dat of the shos that the indictments actualy make him stronger n general i kep huring this i see no dated this effact i see a lot of dat of that sugjust that trump is stronger an a primary becase of the indictments becks again a lot of re publicans emotionalle are resonating to him being un justly persecuted i feel it too i get it cay when a re publican is is being targdat by his political opposition to be put in jail for crimes that any democrat could cmitnt get away with that is political prosecution we all know it and it is terrible does that meanho when an generalelection i keep asking question over nover becaus pparently no one else will i've set i've get to see president trump articulate a pland for how he wins re election how what is his plan he is pending all of his money literally all of it on legal bills right now hes spending none of it ofn building up the voting base necessary to actually when nelection he is not spending it on ballad harvestin he is not spending it undore knocking he is not messaging with regard to pressan bitin at all a the predictable effect of this is the data i'm seeing is that it could be a really really rough year for re publicans in twenty twenty four why well there are some early special elections special elections can be a bell weather for how the actual elections of twenty twenty fourgo the twenty twenty three special elections i' been going horribly for republican far i wonder why could have something to do at the fact then instead of folcsing in on jobidon and his terrible governments that every one hates o tworing to the bulls we are not folcsing one i oda on that i' goring to five thirty eight they did then numbers quunchin they found in thirty eight special elections held far this year democrats have out performed the partisan lean by an average of ten per cent romping in parts of the contry thet typically support the party and cutting down on geope margins in red cityes and counties two for example the democratic handsidet and wasstont was conson state assembly special election last month lost by just seven points in an area ore publicans have a twenty two point adge nore trump beed bidon by almost seventeen points in twenty twenty in a new hampshir special election in may for a state houseet the democrat one by forty three points that is far beyond the twenty three point edge in the district and these are not good numbers for republicans and for comparison of porting five thirty eight democrats out performed the weighted partisan lean by about four per cents in special elections held between twenty eighteen mad terms and twenty twenty elections when bidin one white hos by four pont five per sen bu democrat's under performs in house races now they are up by ten per cents in the special elections does that mean that necessarily nothing can change no it is still really really early but thereis no question at this point that if donal trup runs an election campaign that is base solely on his invitements that is probably knock in a redowns the benefit of republicans and i ask once again what is the plan for victory here ill get to more on this in just one second first mytem knows i need my black rifle coffee i spoke earlier

trumpens up thenominy and get the race presumably that you want theswy newsweek is promoting the idea that dont rondosanc is mout ith a large number fr empty seats at a meeting greet event in iwa he ab went tou seetor falls before eating breakfast at the vintent family restaurun for heading to a meetin gree to livestock off chin in campa but then there is a veralphoto shon on social media that chows the dornt lot people who showed op at this point the journalist timmiller who is very much a a sort of bulwork type left winger i'm a a quase con sert i supposed conservt he aded a cavy out setting for what it is worth to sans is doing bunch revents this we can not all ave been this spars tis the reality when y reboot and have to do grind it and have to grind it out blots of small events let ron be ron deal oke butt again it is pictures this that the media are promoting meanwhile you have politico with an entire article to day to santisis that con serve to poffe lis m has left some doners chafing when rondisant s on veiles economic blacfro lassweek he presented himself as conserveto populist a sceptic of corporations inside a party off an o lied with them but santiis redoric has not's always matchis record as governor he is done an share to support corporations has presidential candidate has relight on contribution from tightans of the business world bhe tanshon between these two impulses was kept at bay for months as to santis looked well position to challenge ton trump for's parties nomination but as he stumbled and continued warring with select corporations disney and but light big business is starting to show signs of irritations again the new narrative that is going to come outs on new is that do santis is aray done for that the campaign is ardy over and the reason thatyoure seing te media mirror that is because despite the fact that it is only august there is not been a single debate yet and we are still six months off from a primary if thing killed the santis in the grate all right now ther really in anybody in the wings the onlye other candidate's right now in the republican party who are already in the race ar pulling in single digets if you look at the real clear politics pulling average right now ton trumps at fifty three points even te santis at fifteen points heveinchs drop of light three to five points over the last two months the vague run asuame has jumped into thurd at six per cent and make penceis at five per cents in iwa by contrast trump is running bout twenty seven points ahead of te santis in new hampshir he is ron about twenty four points ahead of te santis to santis is in second place in both of those nominating contests right now a none of theother candidates are clocking at more than single digets in any of those in any of those races right now the media can nock to santis dawn tosizes then the idea would be that trump waltzis to the nomination which at this point is apparently sort of the plan now is that going to be again it does not have to be to santits but it it can be trump but trumpis and a half to shift his campagn a wave from everybody jump to my defense because that is how i'm going to protect myself to here is is what i'm going to do to stoptrobite shere is one men do to stoptrobitin name the thing please i'm waiting for it uk an meanwhile just demonstrating the in sandidy of our racial moment i say the media are absolute garbage at pretty much every thing on matters of race this is particularly true the way that this works apparently is thit i suppose black people all over the world can be as racis in antisymatic as they want to be according to the main streemedia race is iman antisemitism or bad except the pending on whose performing them the reason i say this there is an amazing headline in the yur times is from a few days ago about a long that was sung at a giant political rally at a leftis south african party rally that party the e f f is it run by personame julius malemma who has been challenged in corp before fort racism and he started chanting kill the boer a kill the boer b o e r is a reference to killing whight people perticularly farmers in south africa according to the your times to vidio clip of that moment shot across the internet was seized upon by some americans on the far right we saidit was a call the violands that notion really took off when elon musk the south african born billionar who left the contryes a teanager chimed in is there openly pushing for juntiside of white people in south africa well i mean yes i mean clearly if this had been a white party in south africa sing kill the black people i mean i do not know thet is out supersubtle what is going on righte here is the headline from the yer times over kill the boer song ful's back laction south africa and you us oh it is the back lash that is the story it is not that you have full scale political parties in south africa calling for the extermination of white people the story is the back lash the sub ahead from the yer times right wing commentator's claim that an old antipartite chance is a call to anta by violents but historians and left wing politicion when brace it satiould not be taken literally oh we do not take thot literally you see kill the white people we do not take literally whell we do take literally obviously is when a naskar driver retweets in a a george floid meam that is only taking superliteally and we destroys career over the weagan naskar suspended a driver name noo gragson why well because he a pured to have leked and insensitive mean with the photo of george floid on social media legsty motor clup announced gragson suspension sayings actions gunot represent the valleys vardime naskars had graggsand violated the stock ar racing member conduct section of its rules which doysin part member should not publicly to spars people based on their backgrounds i'm graggson did not a drect drass the elege meanbut y knowledged his actions itshati'm disappointed myself for lack of attention ain actions on social media apparently the post shas a photo of flod's face and includes a reference to his death the immediate response is that he must been racist to repost the mam which again not sure why that would be rasis that is supposed you just gosh not quite the same thing the same media who will declare that this naskar driver is a racist and must be extrpated from american society in his job ther'e the same people are kill the boere is actually a subtle message about the evil's of white su premisy according to the yur times the channele s born to time when black south africans were fighting a violent racis regime and was made popular in the early nineteen ninety's by peoper mokaba a former youth leader in the african national congress but in twenty twelve the an see they distance themselves from the song and they expelled mister malemma for his incendiary statements apparently the m the this is all not a bideal according to the in yor time despite the fact that again the song was actually band i believe it is been declared a hate speech song in south africa for years and years but now we we have to cantot go back on that because the meant that the right wing americans recognized that perhaps there are in fact people who are black wlar racist against lhites in place south africa a if we notice that than the song apparently is good again that is that is the way that this work meanwhile in a in other aspects of race tat are terrible for people everywhere the chicago mayor brandon johnson is focus lazer on crime problems in his cities o there is been mass looting all over the city of chicago in recen passed and the new mayor who is not lorry lightfoot he is mal lorry lightfoot brandon johnson jacshe scolded a reporter for calling a massluting mob saying hat this was racis language s agan the way that this works in the medion on the left is if you say that a mob ran sack to place that is racis if you say kill the bower that is not racis thats subtle political messagin that is not appropriate thats tok tabot mobaxtions i did not say that that must go what im ot on the sicon ca respectfully these large gatherings these large igatheris is hod on e secio a promise you we have time o talk thit is importanly that we speak of these dine anmicsiad appropriate wa this is not the offistate what has ectually taken place this was the thon aros atout then canal sunday night group for wounded at convenient store more than three in dout than teen agers were aret not amoban twaeralerin and at lease towa dan i rome how many tean agers how many teaners that that is a lot o tean agers om not amob according to the chicago mayor at's just datchess gray yet it turns out that the soff bigotry of loexpectations leads to increased racism at also leads to increased from i can meanwhile only tag by the soff bigotry of lo expectations the level om antisematism that is tolerated long as it comes from black laftis is truly astonishing it reallies an amazing amazing thing and the way that that antisematism is treated in the press is of it is a white fan of donal trump or white non fan of donald trump whos white to premisis then antisemism is true deep scorge if its coming from comas hasbela if its coming from any of the radical middle eastern muslem groups that seek to destroy the state of israel then's more o political question than whiping the jus off the planet and of its coming from prominent black people than it' pretty much not a problem at all we just ignore it completely by the way this extends all the way to the very top of how the mediate treat people i mentioned earlier in the day this interview with a historian taved garro about barokobama iso the fact that barokobomasantisemitism was overlooked for literally years is an amazing amazing indicator of just how easy people on e left go when it comes to antisematism coming from members of the black community tablet magazine covering this davitamiels is the is the author he writes co there is a fascinating passage and rising star david garrofs comprehento biography of barokoboma's early days in which the historian examined toboma's accounts in dreams from my father of his break up with his long time chicago giral frien shilemiochiager in dreams oboma describes a passionat disagreemen folloing a play by african american playright august wilson in which the young protaganis defenc is insipien to brace of black racial consciousness against his girl frien's white identiby liberal universalism as readers we know the stakes of this decision will be come more than simply personal the black american man oboma wills into being in the scene would go on to marry a black woman from the southside of chicago an and mishell robinson and after mew yorik rise when election as the first black precident of the united states it what garral documented after tracking down an interviewing sheelameociager was an explosive fight over a very different subject in yagrs telling the quarrel that ended the couple's relationship was not about aboma self identification as a blackman the impetes was not a play about the american blatics black experience but an exhibit at chicagofs spiritos institute about the nineteen sixty one trial of ant f icman at the time that abomaan shili visited the spiris institute chicago politics was being royaled by a black maoral aid namesteive cokely when a series of lectures organized by looseferri consination of i slam accused jewishcoctors in chicago of infecting black babies with aids a's part of the genicitle plot against african americans the episode hihlated a deep rift within the city's power ashalons with some prominent black official suporting cokely others calling for his firing in yager's recollection what set off the quarrel that precipitated the end of the couple's relationship was abomas stubborn refusal after seeing the exibit and in the swill of the cokely affair to condemn black racism whell acknowledging that abomas embrace ftf black identity have created some degre of distance between the couple she insisted what opset her that day was aboma's inability to condemn cokely's commons it was not obama's blackness that bother her but that he would not condemn antisematism well i mean yah that again is not a shock remember that barokobama sat in jeramia rite's church for fully for full on twenty years fullon twenty years as at any shoh that he would not condemn antisemitism back in his younger days whele the latest example of black antisemitism one is being ignored one is one is not being ignored as much jamie fox over the weeken groe a post on instegram san quot they killed this jude named jesus what do you think bal jue to you followed by the hash tags fake friends and fak love the actor lators leaded the post not before being accuse vantisemitism on social media because of course they killed this jude named jesus very often tat is used by people who doft jews very much trefer to jews genipher aniston liked the post before us he leaded and then she a she unliked it and said i did not this post on purpose or by accidents apparently was miraculous more importantly i wanted be cleared my friends and anyone hurt by showing up in their feets a d not support any form of antisemitism a truly do not hate tolera he of any kind periad now fox postan apology said i wont apologized to the jused community in everyone who is offended by my post i know my choice of words has caust offence i'm sorry that was never my intenie said instead he was refering to a fak friend who had betrayed him aapparently there was also speculation that this sort of phraseology is used frequentlyin the black communities suggesting they killed jesus which sometimes in imprecation with regard to jews or jamie fox backs off that one meawhile cardy bjes gets away with surnlest outrageous jewish sterea typing available cardibe and again asa as a person who is not a connissour of her entire uver a cardiby who is a deeply on intelligent human being she tweeted out the other day a picture of two casitic jews and these jews are in the full o cositic garb probably in brooklan one is wearing a strimal which is the can of furry round hat that you see sometimes a the other is wearing a a a a black hat and is also wearing i e a a beccasha which is can a long black jackethies the anamology thes sinthi go back to polan om anda very stypical if steratypical picture of ultra orthodox jews and she says remember dot do dot do do do ot what exactly s she referring to apparently she is referring to a line in her shakespearian song biken had i in whicsha she says this a soppo pod a to he gtta uga i'm lawyer is a jew is the wine ry lawyers a jew he gon an get my money gan that this the idea being that be cut there is te e typical jewish seriatype that that jews our disproportionately lawyers son a steritipis that is true jews our dis proportionately lawyers doctors accountans the're a lot of different industries in which jews represent a disproportionate shari of members of the industry what is actually serytipical an ansemetic is the implication that if you take a picture of two very hositic jews that this is somehow representative of herjewish lawyers now we actually have pictures of her jewish lawyers i her jewish lawyers look secular reform jews at the verry very bast to these look the jews that yu just saw on the sreets of new york and the idea that all jews are the same is is a hellofa is a hellofa steriatype if i was wow i nt rappers and thn i just posted picture baracalam an aricolder you billic that is a little rasist is not it tat's an otthe little rasis cardy be however says thiskount ofstuff on the routine and no problem whatsoever and this is true through out unfortunately rap culture this stuff is posted routinely by people ranging from ice cube to cardy be and everybody's couse it hi whatever is ireally big git while i mean it would be if we are tungm out any other race attacking members of any other race this is that the fact thit is let off to hook is astonishing to me but again it shows that when a racial preference in racial hierarchy is create in the name of intersectionality ugly things then occar cand meanwhile the a the science crowd is out there continuing their work harry's razors our good friends at harry's you remember harry's harry's is the reason we wanch i hate harrys harry's razers used to be a sponsor on some of the shows over here and then they realize that our host did not believe that men could magically become women and vice versup and they pulled their advertising and said that theydo not our audience basicallyso we waunch i hate harrys and we have well over a hundred thousand subscribers who buy our razers instead of harry's rasers well i thing is time for more of you who are harry's razers subscribers to consider i hate harry's sod com after harry's put out a piece of social media advertising celebrating quote my first pride with facial airs this is a women who had her breast tissue carved out of her and that had hormon treatment to grow facial hair and is now using harry's razors in order to shave her face that tat those are a trans gender stars that are happening right there ghrowing up i always is envious of boys going through puberty getting fashaland lunning howt shates as his person i love grongabarn maintaining it havin't fasal hand grommingretine is most gender affirm thing to me the job harrys you have turned this young woman into a deformed young woman a really great job you you have you have celebrated the mutilation and selfmutilation of a young woman that is just that is just tremendous a foks if you do not wish to actually give your money to those people perhaps you would to give your money instead to a company that is not hate youre gots but i's all part of the push for science that we have been seeing i sell a neal to grasstson we have had on the sunday special before and we had not exchange over transgenerism in in which noegrastison something became very very unscientific expressing many non verifiable ideas about what constutes manhood womanhood i now he has a decided to go even farther here is it neal o grasstison talking about talking about men and women competing ag against each other in sports on the michael shurmershell it is a little weir that we split people by male and female in this way i'm imagining a hundred years from tor looking back do back a hundred years ago the split poisen girls in that could compete than expect that just bek count of a little weir a o on nele because that can matin thon o we as i can imagine that too but the differences are masti on ave again i've seen the pictures agas at isnit ollage restler isenm but the average won an i an te ali a the average woman restler is not can beal to take down you when you were in youre you'r pega maybe ast female you se it your you are an old man on the porch in the rocking chair right men i'm tell now ow i a telling you not a telling you you are criticising something that is indeed of modification you mean human biology that is at any to modification anside breakit o scienctis neel to grastison but women and men on average o not perform similarly with regard to athletics which is why venus williams and serenalans it their asses kick by a two hundred rangs man who is smoking between sats and there are the greatest women's tennisplayers probably ever certainly serena is meanwhile here is tneldegratison trying to explain away his lack of science here is a more complete take on what exactly generar is supposed to be according to astrophysicist neel to grastison point is ap parently the ex exs exs wy cronasones are insufficient because when we wake up in the morning we exacgury what ever feature we want to portray the gender of our choice either the one you are sign the one you choose to whatever it is and now here now just tu a tiabea on this i say to you somewhere i read somewhere i'd think i read that the united states was a land where we have the pursuit of happiness yes suppose no matter my cromisole to day i feel eighty per cent female twenty per cent m ow or good i what poult o make up i' good a good a to morrow i might feel eight y per cent man i remove to make up at ar wer of mustal shirs why do you care whet why do you care that i care do what you are ging to do and then live in the world and also recognize that this does not make you a man or a woman his not scientific i've today i feel ice an astrophysist an eighty per centastrophysicist to day to morrow a wake up do not be ten per centastrophysiist in the day after i will not be astrophysicist at all what does he care if i walk into a lab and stare performing the dop of nastrophysicist what is that matter mean after all i'm identifying his anastrophysi tist what exactly is the problem but if i also put on a white labcoat and i and i we are we are to wine sure what if i do all those things that would that make me natera i'm unight identify that way it wuld make me feel is scientificized you feel the science happening do ou feel it happening in real time here from neil to grass teison and if if all womanhood is is make up and dresses then i have some bad news for the future of human reproduction it turns out that that is not the case meanwhile again the scientists doing their best to not to science the american academy of pediatricts according to lostr journal plans to review the efidence for genera forming medical care and potentially amendit is policies that help guyd doctors and clinations providing the treatmen to transgender youth an oda mazing if you would done the damn research in the first place and cared about it as supposed to simply dictating that we should shoot children full of formonet than cut off their genitals thou't in amazing if you get done the liita research first but apparently now it was more importanthat they do the the most tolerant possible thing which is to refer people for physical meautilation rather than mental hell treatment that they clearly require look a time for some things i in than some things that i hate things that i i today over the weaken i had a lot of time to redson's hosin the hospital watching my childbreith is really a terrible weaken but i did read what was a phenominal book this a book by immortels call a gentleman in moscow and it is the best novel that i've read in five ten years it is terific it is really good it it centers on a a guynam count rostov whose sort of an old school rush in member of the up te upper class beef and he ends up being take in by the red soviets in the aftermathe russian revolution and tried and then confined to a hotel and he is not stuck in the hotel metropole for literally the rest of his life that is his sentence that he is going to be he is ging be sentence to live in a fairly small room in this hotel for therest of his life ne's not aloud to leave ever and the entire novel is about what happens to him in this hotel and the people that he meets and how he finds meaning there and it is a beautiful novel it is truly beautiful not just bieg as the witing is terrific because it really really is but also because of the generalize take which is that yes there are things that are worth preserving from the old world and those things are worthy of care and that perfectionism and how you approach everyday tasks actually matters and that y you have to open yourself up to experienceis o family and child bearing in order to find your most purposeful self and also of course it exposes the tremendous evils of the soviet unionbut does in a really subtle and a an amazing way it is it is truly a masterpiece a gentleman in moscow highly recommended by amar tolls a this one is recommended to me my friend andrew clavan who has am interesting taste of literature ihehe his a hitrat with me ofabout seventy five percent this one is one of his bespects heure for mean tis book really work the read a gentleman in moscow by amartolsco pick it up today okay other things that i i ask you which way western man this ta picture of the prime minister of canada who is now getting to vorst and a it is picture of him with his son at the barby movy and i just have to say are the chinese quaking in their boots at this point he had tweeted out were team barby and is a picture of him and a a pink swetcherd that is his love you more and his son who is wearing a pink teeshirt and star shortz and there gazing bizarily and creepily into the camra right in frontof the margo robby rying gostlling poster from barby here are your choices the people whar team barby or the people who are not team barby yes this is union know where i stand on this but where do you stand on this and am and i ask you should does this speak well of the future of the western world is this is this were things are going are they going amazingly while a russia russia and china just ad a joint military exercise near alaska and meanwhile the head of canada is tweeting out bizar votes himself with his son from the barby movy and saying he is team barby ah the future is in a best of hands but i love it when people expose themselves for who they are in just intredou can can you imagin it man fidell castera must be turning over in his grave to see his son acting this way cat time for some things that i hate already magan reppeno one most irritating people on planned earth a she had an opportunity to push the united states women's national socratim into the next ramound now she is most famous for having blue hair and also for really hating america i'mean the national anthem is bad and america's a deeply sexes in races place evenogther payin her wai to much money to play sport no one has ever watch except once every for years when we all pretend to be interested n women soker an all the rest of it well repeno apparently had a penalty shot and a she messt and the united states lost and they got booted by sweden and a bizarly enough shes started and of laughing and smiling after she missed the shot and she'n miss by little she must by a lot now to be fair to a tomagan reppino now theyreall these pictures tat are going around of her laughing and smiling and all the rest of it and tom she i yow people react in bazare ways to terrible things happening to he'm som nockin a blame her for a laughing and then crying people do react in weird ways tobad situations if youv ever ad to tell somany truly horrible news you can do not knowhat to do i get that the proba agin rpino that is knowing is that she is magin repino and she is asked after blowing this game she is asked about the most important things to her her best memories from her career and her best memories from her are absolutely obviously political is there a memory that stands out to right now in this moment oh hum i mean probay equal pachance u left to the final m and i think there saying equalpay but con ben saying a lot of things i think this tem is always fought for much more an that is been the most rewarning part from me of course playngin wor cups and wenning champion ships in doing al that but you nough to know that we have yus i really special tind ti do something that is really change the world forever ithi that is not most to me and the players in this lockroom here they are just getting sarted and to all players i've played with obviously u what it is to be in the gind it is the best part i mean wil present in bidin treated out you us world national coptime you have made your country proud congratulations on an incredible run tere seem is something spectioal on looking for to sing how you continueance spire americans geve written determination on and off the field hat's the worst per formance in years a present biding of course had to sign in because he is big fend of magan reppino where we all pretend that the women's socratime is even remotely similar to the mensocrams completely different sportin oms wayless revenue on on for youre basis done matter mag r you kow continued be hailed by the left as a heroine i get the proble magin rape nowis not suc amistippenalty shot lot's people ini's penalty shots and h promise not that she reacted weirdly when that happens when badstuff happens badstuff happens the proble magin repe kno is that she is kind f a terrible person and tha she is spend her entire career pressing forr theide that america is a terrible horrible place tht has made her extraordinarily wealthy and famous for playing a sport that no one carees about world wide yeyou want to know th the evidence that no one cares about the sport world wide that the united states winds every year that is that is how that no one cares about the sport world wide because they are seven people in the united states who take socer seriously compared to the rest of the human population for winning at that sport that means that half the population in the rest of the world then you

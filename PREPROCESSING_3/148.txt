rafa next and a seal you suse youngest sister is about to give birth again hurshana i really wanted to talk to usiph sister a seal once he got the malta rafa she was the whon useph was thinking about the most talked about the most the funny sister the emotional sister also the one most usep resourceful determined useph told me one o seal settled in rafa she quickly started taking things into her own hands first of all the ten useph felt they were too crowded and lout a seal bilt her own tent with her husband every time yuseph went to visit the camp she would find everyone in a seal's tent hanging out she began to rebuild other parts of her life there too a seals an nurse pheple in the camp began bringing her their medical questions she wouldidvise follow up try to sorce medications for them when she could a seals tent became part living room part clinic useph had always told me a seal was his youngest and most stubborn sister but when she arrived in rafa he added she is also the least fased difficult things do not rattle a seal which es why the moment shed called him crying and ling to the bath room was alarming to him yes she she was when it does not compy she does not complat you was what as set is the wok be tween wy sister i look i loo jus se as the most wise she is young wat she is ex she she she is in lot when there shin about the she she to look i i im i i spok about about the she and trusty wl she os uit was really hard to reach a seal io i a seal this is a i fin any hi fimally the famous sister the in her net is o key now war oke did i luse you it was not oqe than that ti citaty bal e one ilas toke there was no inner net at the tents and hardly any sell connection i try d cath a seal on the inner net at usip's office or on her phone i ahi can you hear me aoke we wuld dy oke ok i learned things in scraps of conversation that were maybe two or three minutes long some voice mammos tack messages just as a seal had managed her situation at the camp she took control of her plans for child birth too a seal told me she would never been fearful of child birth she seen lata births as a nurse she was actually working in labor and delivery in gosa city when the wor started she would imagined it she could do it she said when it comes to helth care matters i'm capable of controlling the situation for myself and those around me when she had to flee her home leave behind the doctor she loved and the hospital she would planed to deliver in a seal just made a newplan she found a new hospital and a new doctor in connunus when matfell apart and she fled to rapa a sal brought usi int her planning process in rapha a seal and usif worked in tandem they figured out where she could deliver a small maternity hospital they mapped out a rout to the hospital raphas seal packed with traffic and people now it can take hours to get across the city usiv studied routs and gugol maps and he practiced driving to the hospital on back streets through farm land and bumpy dirt roads a seal did not want to bring a newborn back to the tent in the cold usive asked the annarsey if a sl in the baby could stay with him and the other staff living at the annarsy office just for bit after the birth they said yes at the camp they got the bath room up and running four days after a seal arrived i lead january usif in a seal had a bath room a rout to the hospital and a postpart in plan there was only one thing a seal desperately wanted that she could not make happ in herself she told me an arabic when we were finally able to talk for a longer stretch futa hada habat it the co caa taa i mota i've always preaed that i will not give birth until there a truse i do not want to start experiencsinglaberpain before there is a truse god woidink it toul happen every day there were small glimmers of a possible truce tnegotiations were under way for a sease fire between israel and hamass it was the last week of january a seal was due february forth with er without a truce a seal and usiv had a plan then five days before her du date they had an unexpected dry run that tested their plan a eal had contractions in the middle of the night usef racer to the hospital t was a false alarm the contraction subsided but for the first time a seal got to see what it looked inside the hospital o te mad ha anmos fisfer eso ma can ena hin jeckeny sbe when you ented the hospita there is an un imaging o be number of tisplace people it is full of displace people when we were standing at the door there was a woman coming from abasan and connunes they were displeased and she came to the hospital e laber he water had already broken she was standing at the door waiting in line because there are am five or six beds inside and they are oldfot she was waiting for her turn to get examined even though she could not stand the baby came out why she was waiting at the door you saw her give birth asea ya in tha baby is oul niya ya the baby is old an the baby came out and the lad her down on the floor to deliver the baby right there there were no beds a not even in the maternity woor they lad her down on the floor and the midwife or the a doctor came to delever the baby with her on the ground owo in frent of you catod an ca a wu my gan ya i feard that i would be in her pace i imagined my self in her pace waiting for my turn to go in for laber but then for it is a happen at the door that night in the hospital everything suddenly felt very real to a seal she was about to give birth in a tiny hospital that used to have around twenty birts a day and now sometimes had one hundred she would be delivering her first baby in a city that had two hundred thousand people just a few months ago and now had one point five million she was about to give birth in a hospitl in the middle of a war that had killed six hundred people inside medical facilities and obliterated the vast majority of healthcare services she was about to have a child in a war were more than ten thousand children have been killed far a seal could not get one pregnant she could pray for a sease fire but she could not wait for one a seal had imagined her birth clearly before the war but now she was imagining it and we she never had before what if she delivered at the hospital on the floor what if she delivered in her tent alone what if is really tanks came in to rapha while she was in labor what if she was naked pushing a baby out when in is really soldier showed up at the door tor her tent tha ki bad e in ahead the hataabig thinking about this spy its sef tatstuddered in my heart that i could give birth and see the soldiers tha the mer siht of the soldiers kars me and what if after she delivered her baby she started bleeding one horrifying thing a seal new was happening in gazarit now is women who hemorhage after birth are sometimes being given his tireactamies i've talkd to doctors and a midwife and gaza who told me this is happening s happening for lot of reasons hospitals do not have the routine medications that help stop bleeding after birth they also do not have staff the staff they do have do not have time pregnant women are coming in mou nourished sometimes with injuries another complications and theyre going into leaber severely in nemac if they hmorhage after birth which happend sometimes things quickly become life threatening theyr using his directimies in gaza because his directimies can be the fastest and safest way to save lives of all a very real possibilities a seal was now imagining this was the one she feared the most she deliver her baby start bleeding and they take her uteros that night in the hospital she begged a doctor for his attention is it safe here a'm a medical professional she said please help me the doctor told her if you can deliver somewhere else you should a seal walked out of the hospital to the car where useph was waiting and told him i cannot have my baby here ar gred tree to theo i i don tink e ha te cobitro biin

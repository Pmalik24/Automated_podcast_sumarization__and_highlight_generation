the bench parshos poncer baexpressivepian protect our olmine privacy to day express vepianda con flesh men in eighteen fifty nine a human rit actvist in henry to nans who later cl found the red cross observed the aftermath of the battle of solpereno between french pemontees and austry and armies in northern italy whose shock by the treatment of wounded soldiers on the battle field he work diligently to bring together a variety of governments to sign on to a series of ruls governing the treatment of captured and wounded soldiers sign in geneva an eighteen sixty four the use would become known as the first geneva conventions it tok another eighty five years however before the world began to think about the treatment of civilians in war time in hor at the german treatmen of civilins during world war too the geneva conventions were expanded in nineteen forty nine to protect non combatants civilians this was accomplished in the fourth geneva convention designe to protect civilians by encouraging military actors to separate themselves from civilian populations the nineteen seventy seven edition protocols made clear the use of human shields was absolutely forbidden by the rules of war article twelve four states quote under no circumstances shall medical units be used in an attempt to shield military objectives from attack article fifty one seven states quote the presents or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be us to render certain points or areas immune from military operations in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield favor or impede military operations article eight two b of the nineteen ninety eght ic c statutes has quote utilizing the presents of a civilian or other protected person to render certainf points areas or military forces immune from military operations constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts the purpose of outlawing human shields is perfectly obvias no country can be expected forego its military aims in order to protect civilians deliberately placed indanger by the enemy to imianize those who use human shields would incentvise every one to take human shields which weue then necessitate the death of more civilians in order to achieve military goals and yet the legacy media and the political left have been doing just that they know that commass has ben using human shields commas brags about it over the weaken is really defense forces discovered rocket launchers planted directly next to children's pools and playgrounds can see thes the children's pilliausy rocket launchers located directly next to before lrocket launchers tter directly located five meters from a children swimming pool is reason that they are doing this ethey also found rocket launchers located ti rectly nexto eightgian playground currently comassis preventing the evacuation of gossan civilians to the south of the goda strip here is iresident of gaza admitting as much on tape s is good who sent us back we cannot reach the south on that is the first thing secondly there are cars ovattesa an do not allow youe o go south we are between transitions wetween going out an staying here what can we do first of all wusenu bak in the northsays an ideef officer andthe goen resident says semme ba ck i cannot say the sent us back why cant set they will be killed ifhe does the idiaf offshas but a lot o people left or the south an never came back the gosan residence hays they have cars that go around the to blocked away we do not have a car the diaf officers hays have you seen or heard of this did you see or hear it gos hays as talks about thn schools talked about schools we are refugeees in the schools comemoss is blocking people from leaving for the south now over the weeken is really force is struck an ambulance commos immediately claimed that his rael had been targeting the wounded the media then began to parrot this ly here some the vitio i can see these are owful pictures obviously well as it turns out the ambulance says has raels beeng used to transport terras which of course is well in line with commass practice in fact here istape from twenty fourteen of come oss literally loading up an ambulas with terrase here it is ye can see it uis areal footed tru hes aur terras foare leaving a house their arm is ot go i p and they are getting on an ambulance ias been long time practice and both to man sinaria les bank the and in the gosses trep igu e up up the usambulance has in order to transport specifically because they know that ten israel hits the ambullencs on world will pretend that is rals attempting to hit wounded meanwhile over the all shifa hospital the home base for commasses military headquarters below which is likely stored hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel for use by terras the electricity is still on despite claims that the fuel has run out not only that large crowds of gazens have congregated around the hospital to cheer on footage of cmmass members firing on his railies those agains see that youre seeing thousands of people watching a screen that is been put in place the electricityg stolon is h't can see ths is footage of come oss members firing on is really troops the gian crowd watching outside screaming allhua far you may notice the ages here is a lod of young military age men who are standing outside right here prenominantly and they are watching with ful electricity available the tape of commass fighting israel and this is not shocking cme oss not only keeps military headquarters under ground underneath hospitals it literally built one hospital the intonetian hospital above terror in for structure it heard already built to capitall off comm osf spent the week and attacking his raily troops as those is really troops where tempting to openin svillian corridor from north to south the idea f was working to open the roads civilians could leave come oss began firing morters and antatang missiles of them the story here is actually very very simple israel wishes for reasons both moral and political to minami civilian casualties among gasan palisinian arabs come oss once more dead palisinian arabs the difference is why the idea has made twenty thousand phone calls dropped one point five million leaflets sens four point four millio assamas and six milion voice messages urging civilians in northern gaza to evacuate temporarily for their safety here you can see tape of them draping mass masses of leeflets and pamphlets telling people to leave the area whel ga is there dropping the segse huge palats of papers ther ar then are being air dropped on to cvilianarias telling people to lea tesn te omooning downs an filling flow telling them to get out never in the history of war has something been done this in terms of warning civilions in this fashion nhet never has eight has one army opposing a military forse send as many warnings two civilians to get out you literally cannot name another time the is happen no comas claims has some sixty five hundred female and child civilians have been killed thus far we hven't in verified any of those numbers because comas routine ly lies about this sort of stuff comases advocates point of those numbers to suggest that israel is killing a dis proportionate number of civilians despite the fact that comas that wants them to killd the civilians in reality despite the insane situation i which israel finds itself israel is being asmaticulous in its use of military force as any military in human history but sake a few examples but s look down the road of history at least two million german civilians died durng world war too at least three hundred fifty thousand were killed by strategic allied bomming up to eight hundred thousand cjapanese civilians died during world war too in the coree an war estimates place civiling casualty numbers at one point to milian during the vhe anom war some three hudred sixty five thousand civilian styed during the gulf war sommo retween a thousand and two thousand civilians died at the hands avallied forces during nato bomming of ugaslavia at least twelve hundred civilians were killed you mar member the meric was not attack before either of those last to engagements during the afganistan war at least forty six thousand civilians died during the arock war those nmbers were atleast two hundred thousand brakobama's dron war killed at least four hundred civilians his libia war killed at ley six hundred the ron ises may have killed several thousand civilians those are just wars involving he united states when it comes to military action in the maeleast more generally the nmbers are astounding the saudies have killed at least twenty thousand civilians in their bomming campagn an yemmon wat least eighty five thousand children have died wit starvation during that conflict in syria at least three hundred thousand civilin to died at least twelve million people have been displace tpackastan right now is this moment deeporting some wone points havn million affgancivilians not becaresabout any of that tere's not be a single protest about any of that no one cares however hundreds of thousands millions nay billions of protestrs seem to care about the jews even though the jews are avertly attempting to avoid civilion casualties whilcomasies as many dad palistinian arabs as possible and yet the media continuedt pretend the comas is not to blame for civilians being killed that israel somehow has the magical undisclosed ivility to kill terrorists without killing the civilions that terrst use as their shields they have the herry potter avility to cast spells that just killed the badguies here is burne standers idiotically expressing just that idea howere set his isral at destroy hamat post attack inis an inthant to teliantan israil with out at herdang killang and assent man wan man an cheltran when a hamat is hiding behind them and putting than an danter how does that work rai that is th exactly we right question t yes the military express which i am not one why cleally yo they ha tis ras a rigt to and e tou omas as one that is what is goiste the coin is re they got a dew with that why the got o beyon thatter way then killing thousand o men wemenat choes a once again he immediate consern is you got u how the cos in the blomming that thi's amazing sufromburney sanders there openly saying that he as no idea what is reall y supposed to do that he is not military man but he knows there has to be this very reminiscente of when jobidening company talk about police taking on badgising to ang to shoot him in the leg if you do not what the holier talking about this sounds good but if you do you sound the sounds a moron hus burnesanders is in fact a moron because he has always been a moron this ly at is really somehow being indiscriminate in its use of military forcethat they have secretly a better way of just killing terras but not killing any one else well the thing is that that fury justifies everything up to an including the geneidl octombersome of the tacks that is the point to create a retroactive justification for those attacks in the public mind if the jews are the kinds of people who drop boms on gasand babies just for fund then what is the big deal the commass shot babies directly in the face and rate their mothers before murdering them that is the case being made by the congress women from comasrocy to toleap who spent the weaken defending commses genecidal slogans she treated out quote from the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom human rghts and peaceful co existence not death destruction or hate this of course is a l from the river to the sea meaning ejordan river to the mediterranean sea palstine must be free is a slogan about freedom in the same way that the nosi slogan ar bat mach fry was about encouragement to work ethect work makes free what thasshe ment those the os the sign over oushfitz the only side culrently advocating genecide is the palistini inside of course it does not take much to get palisinian advocates to admit as much here for example was the palisinan ambassador to the ucha explaining this weaken he would not condemn comastetrocities at all palsinian authority has not condamned hamas atequetly and tos at togre staven

de liberate and this has been tis evy min te te cencsence its establishment oga he is a liar and in evil human being he is literally saying that he will not condemn a comasis massacre of innocence and then justifying that by claiming that israel is targening's villions which is a lie again the only way to justify comases evil is to accuse israel of similar evil which is precisely what rachieta to leave is doing shoed put out an ad targening jobidon is suggesting that he is supporting a genicide we stand with isre this is reshetesleap add of corsuggesting that israel is targening cavillian and that she shows much protest no piece on stolen land which means by the way the destruction israel is recheted to lea tadiet i marican people ar not wa a a t per tan toli in this add is supposhe demonstrates ioin that jobida is backing wic a uonat went genisin and wes tat that wor an aav a but i is inis gon ga i want to thank pigeden bargon or uni and thi ad continues for wile than finally she just concludes by accusing jobiden of she she literally is putting in her own ad people chancing for the destruction of the tate of israel and then claiming that israel is pursuing genicide accompanied by jobiden here is the thing the goe for those who support coms is not in the end to truly convince everyone that israel is morally inferior to its opponents because that is not possible you cannot convince any one that any one is morally inferior to comas is to convince everyone that comasin israel are morally equivalent that israel is on commasses level as to justify comases atrocities in that game commas is most ardent advocates are joined by politically savy but morally despicable figures barakobama brakobama spent the week end pretending the responsibility for omases evolize with lelve well it wiv with everyone here he is with his fellow dolts over at pad save america you have to take in the whole truth and you then have to admit nobodys tands er clain then all of us are complicet to some degree i look at this an i think back what could i have done during my presidency to move this forward as hard as i tro i've got the scars to prove it but there is a partome thit still sang wone was there something else i could have done that is the conversation we should be had that jus looking backward but looking forward now of course obama himself is guilty his hands are not clean he handed billions of dollars to the aronean terro recine he allowed them to spread ther cash and their terror all over the middle east from yemmon to lebanon while simultaneously giving israel the back of his hand in june twenty fourteen when a camas kidnapped an murdered three is railyteen atures including one american dul citizen barakalbama said nothing for three weeks then finally called on israel for restraints heelso to lada shipmen tof hell fire missilesto israel in the middle of israel's twenty fourteen war with camas then on his way out of office abama abstain from boding on youan security council resolution rather than fedoing it that resolution demanded that israel stop building in all of judasamaria and isjerusalem and cred an incent of structure for the boycott and t e vest movement from the state of israel as an is rally official sed of the time quote veuus ad ministration secrelly cooked up with the palistinians an extreme antike is raily resolution behind israel's back which would be a tail wind for terror an boycotts an effectively make the western wall occupied palistonian territory abama's hatred for israel was in fact the significant factor in building up both aron and camas leading to the catastrophe of october seventh yes barakabama does personally beare a share of responsibility that is how at he means he means that every one is responsible for october seventh which means that camas is not responsible it is a cycl of violens a morally relativistic cycle of islance requiring israily concessions this is the sudo sopisticate take it is the radical sheek take it is re peated by nearly all of those in the legacy media including for example nicholas kristo wll get to him and his idiocy in just one moment first we

policy establishment is moral equivalents moral sor nicholas kristof as piece over the near times a truly awful piece in which he ad mitst the quiet part out lad in than tostignors its the pieces title losing hope in the west bank he says when i was a lost yun backpacking through the middaleast in nineteen eighty two i met two palistonian university students on a local bust an west bank we got to chatting thinvited me to their homes i jumped off the basan spent ta day with them in the jumble dallies of the densely populated dishe refuge ye camp thed a good time together they told me about their arabic studie o bathlaham university outatching a scheme to study arabic myself an kiro we were all excited by education and full of youth and dreams i wrote their names in my addresbook we never made contact again until now after forty one years i dug up my oldaddressbook and found their names i wondered awe they still alive have they moved abroad what do they think of israel khamas and america they located them their till living in the same at refuge he camp he saidit was wonderful to see them again ber our reunion was alsay window into palistonian frustrations the world has changed much in for dekas but while i've travelled the world and had fulfilling career they remained stateless stuck in refuge eu camp fearful of his really settlers and soldiers worse they have much less freedom to day than when i met them in nineteen eghty two none of this leads him to think for just one sane waight wait wat change in nineteen egety two and two thousand twenty three one thing that changed is the handing over all these areas of the westbank to th palisonian authority the same palsinian authority nicholas kristov wishes had more authority in nineteen eghty two the alsonian authority had n zerel authority in the called wesbank israel had military rule over the entiraty and in fact as you conceive from thi statistics if you happened to live in the palistonian areas of the westbank under the governants of the palsinan authority or significantly poor than if yorn is railly arab living israel proper which wy literally knos railly arab wishes to leave and move into palisinian governed areas bt nicholas kristov ignores all of thapicis an undercut his argument is as back then they could travel easily around israel and find work there on weekan they could relax on his raly beaches ase to drive to tell of yev for the ay machmu told me now they live under a stifling system of check points and passes that make traveled difficult even within th west bank aw the october seventh komas terrast attack has made everything worse why do you think that happened why do you think that happened because of terrorism because of the palsonian authority because of komas tbe cause of palistonian islamic gehad nicholas kristov admits that these two men these supposed moderates his friends engage in all of the worst blood libles bacus quote when the conversation did touch on politis we frustrated each other they were certain that they explosion at gasas all ockhley arab hospital was a deliberate attack by israel we know thats not true we literally know it it was a palstoniana's lomitcihadraket the fell on the hospital the conversation says kristop became more tents when he got to the commas attack of october seventh quote people were happy all over the arab world not because of the killington bloodshed but because it was the first time the gazens could achieve their dream of leaving gaza said one of them kristov said i push back and noted how bruall komas terrasm had been and how many is really cevillians have ben canaptor killed sala and machmud said they morned the israilly deaths but wondered why the world was not equally outrage thet palistinians had ben killed in cumultively greater numbers they were disappointed by my focus on comasses barbarism we are not trouble makers they said we just want to live freely everyone else in the world im well clearly not since what your actually want is to destroy the state of israel and you side with comoss sold there is that but nicholas christophic nors all of that in favor of moral equivalents all of this moral equivalents leeds to violents comas knows all that has to do its get enough pallisini arabs killed in order to survive and preserve itzel the palising aun authority by the way nows the same thing terroris know they'e allies in the media in political circl to do their dirty work for them that is why they are brazen on the streets of our major cities they say the quiet part out loud all the damn time they know surisophisticats will parit them we will down play their sins we will treat them as brave emissaries of a revolutionary cast they are freetsto pursue whatever evil they want because of their allies in the media because of their allies in politics and tey do pursue those evils and more people die in just a second we will get to the strets of the west wis re now dominated thy were dominated over the week end by hundreds of thousands of people whare actively rooting for comas in actual honest godgennicidald du hating terrors grup it' an amazing

afraid because the west has been completely taken over completely and utterly taken over by enormous swathes of people who hate the west atleshhas been honeycombed most ovios example comes in london hundreds a hundred thousand people maybe showed up in london in relation to a pro commass rally bout eleven people were arrested but the footage shows fireworks being launched at the police it showse british flags being yanked down it showse it shows every monument in lond in basically being taken over and by the way how do we know that in infatration has taken place because apparently a police adviser one of the police advisers to the metropolitan police a person named aticmalike who chares the official advisryboard for scotland yard was leading the chance of from the river to the seat again the sit the a person who literally works with the met police he is an adviser to the cops and here he is chancing the genecitle slogan from the river to the sea ha a ha waaawha ot yo o na no no a no ea waooa wya wha ao wha o no wa aa a that kis an adviser to the cops at the met police chancing that genecitle slogan here they were taking over trofalgar square y can see them raising the palestinian flag on the on the tube underground signs you can see them climbing on the fountains introfalgar square a gain look ot the size of this crowd he is are all comaspans because those the people they are protesting in favor of rember these protest began before isral as hev ben doing anything in the gossistrip theyre done in response to liberately to comass people are climbing the fountains introfalgars woll wear te cops where the police they have any control of their streets over there and thes all partan parsel of a radical series of protest that began across the world in twenty twenty qhen por intersectional coalition the gecolan eyes coalition hat was desin to terrid part the west and western liberals are two blind to see that that coalition rides yet the battle way this colitions been riding agether since the sixties pretendin that this is something new is ridiculous the black panthers were standing up for palistonian terror back in the sixties there is nothing new under the sun mean while fireworks ore being fired at the cops introfalgar square as well just do chan themshuing fireworks into the air some them wore shot at cops protesters shut down whitehall in great britain as well is im walking down some the most stori streets of london taking over the streets is a lot of people wo lov terrace that is forshore on the tube chance broke out of a from the river to the sea apparently people being harassed inside the subways as well e man owha there is only one solution into fight a revolution ins fight by the ways a violent uprising thes the people calling for violence in the center of london is what they are pand and lest you believe that these people are they do not commas not that they are really really comass one counter protestor showed up wit they sin thet said commass is terrist that time was promptly ripe down whois promptly assaulted by the crowd because of course they comass they are fully in favor of comass and it it would be very easy to make the cays theyre commas is really bad and to free the palcinans o require the comas surrender but no one's doing that i've notice zero people no one is clamming comass should go away theyre all in lovi comas they are fine with comass pretending otherwise signoring the evidenceof your own eyes and ears the sky sign ended up on the ground and at being torn apart by the crowd and just tincase you do not believe me protestors we are bragging about comass there are a her someof the protestors in london amasa tha cas e cosca terras oganization you think te you case by the ron decision of course its no camas the terris its thamedica the terris no and that is titis teris em nahamas i amerithes era fe i they ar freedom iisthe no terris a the media praten to be o they the'r freet that not the medius pertraying them me sure they war go procameras to literally shoot children in the face the forty five men of idio that is been seen by virtually no one far the the actual snuff thidio that was made by the commass terrace is agregious and unwatchable that almost no one can watchin and does contain vidio of commass terris confronting small children were in disny pajamas and then shooting them to rectly in the head if those people according to these people are not terras or s misunderstood what ad the send with wile the sended woitd the next morning theyr there is a monument alled the senataf in the center of london it is supposed to be a warmemorial for the wars head in briton worlds words one and then eventually world wor too it was decorated with a a bunch of it was decorate with the bunch of reeds ands how the protestors made sure to take those reaths andthrow them on the ground because this is what they actually think of the westit is not just bout israels about you it is anyone who belies in western values is their enemy it is why you heard that protestor a second go saying america is terrorist weresmblee yucaos terroris e reet ha nok ta and they knocks reathes down by the way british police officers durin this protest we are removing british flags from the streets the'r re counts of protestors wo shut up whering military uniforms veterans presumably they show with british flags in the police told them you need to take away your british flags was not to offend the barbarians who are supporting comas the er oewsters o oiani s a ir hune cas s o r eaand yet wheny ma a hundreds o hotas thee flags you ons iave word re woanges es re wa there it is there is the kee there is way more of them than there are of us that is the end of

propalcinian protestors to to the streets of berlin standing in favor of comas t the germans have been pretty good in germs being in favor of of israel in this conflict as well they should be

with palistinian flags his to be a statue of am general pershing who is he general of the allied forces on woll were one this would be a a a guy dress a terrorist whose attempting to a stands up on a statue of the arevolitiary founder here is som terrorus whoive va peoplere dressing teras who have put palstinian flags in the hands of war monuments and on revolutionaries there theyre profediing vidin gaza three gaza people covering their faces the have decorated ben franklin tith the palistinian flag which i would be kind of astonishing i think the founders here they are what putting to fea the terror assymbol on benfranklin hard thing of anyon whould be less in favor of the fea than then ben franklin but does not matter where the cops by the way where the police this person of cors has at covered his face tthese are the people walking your streetsvokes these o the people in america many of them imported many of them left wing allies this is the coalition the colition of people who hate western civilization an which to see it torndown and the're just using the latest convenient excuse which is israel procomass protestors were chanting we do not want to state we want forty eight which is to say forty it was the stabishmen of the state of his real thy want that reversed again they just say all the quat parts out loud and then wait for suito sofisticates nick kristov or tomass freedmen or barakobama to pretend moral equivalents i mean after all can we really take sides one side size they wish to destroy all the jews and destroy thestate of isral the other side says we would to have piece but run ou a piece pirdner cannot we find a middle ground cannot we find a midle ground between this sguy who once to murder thiscguy in this cy who does not wonto be murdered they are ha what can this guy give over here here here is these hese moral morally destitute people chancing about the destruction th sate of israel r h just openly chancing the sort of stuff right the it again openly chancing for wht they want but obviously israel that the problem is it is complex it is just complex meanwhile procomos protesters diside to discale the white house fends wi chou looks kind of insurrectionary i notice the'r only eleven ares apparently climbing the white hous fense and dum not only that they had up bidin staffers who wo join the protest of course because the democratic party has been thoroughly seeted with people with no moral calculist what isoever he i te gies is ifide in at your sctaff demands a seasefire hese are all federal staffers and tese ar congressional staffers all of whom are standing with commoss yes should you be concerned about the west falling absolutely since all of the people whoud see it fall are oure backing all this the goodness is they have many very intelligent people on their side speaking to the crowd including mackelmore then that is the thriftshop guy has not o anything sense thers te fos ti ti ter t a i her os i iee e ar wort walif tie an e an thre an ma tto is they told me tie why they to me myretir t s to i thas ti tit yi to e ta en i mo en lae e tetie ir oh he knows enough that it is a genicide me dispide ifact to dis clearly not a gennocide he knows enough to note to genocide also i have to say that it seems we have now reached a point where if all if if it if it walks lie an antisemit and it is walks an antismit it is probably in antisemit flash back to twenty fourteen it is what makelmore dressed up as in order to supposedly avoid the crowd he dressed up as a derstermere looking jew long hook knos beard hes did this fre concer hou's ripped on it at they had nowas an mistake who just t it was it was in accident i i i have doubts now i've some rectro active doubts meanwhile the question is really in practical terms how much pressure can be brought on the by deministration to push for some sort of thee seas for by what ron is now pushing for a seasfire which demonstrates exactly who wants to sease fire the answer as come oss here is deputy national secure master john viners anglus and we disagreed the pressure campaign against bind well there can have to now have asmine here the presen has been under growing pressure from democrats here at home to do more and the fighting i seen protest as well probably the harshness is consen preceeded to leave a must show which he put up on frid to sa jobide an support of the channiside of the palistony an people the american people will not forget by and support a sease fire now or do not count on us in twenty twenty four i response all look we we strongly disagree o we with some of that masting and with someof the terms used to describe this conflict but what i will say i is we know that this is a conflict about which there are strong views a on all sides including in the united states including a frankly even i within the united states of a divide administration about a a the conduct of this conflict wont it maybe shou done they should a kicked out the anti sa mihes from your colition be you decided insteads to humor them an put them on the cover of magazines and now you'r stuck with them and that is a real problem because it let us be real about this on a realistic level this conflict is not going to end tomorrow it is going to take israel time all people ware urging israel to rushiere understand the more israel rushes more civilians dide the more miticulously planned israel can do this the slower they go the fewar civilians dy the faster they go the more civilians nigus they gan any war here in fact is a member of the ide of thes ide of spokes person major terown sfealmen saying this is going to take time itea soldiers are set to be closing in a goa city riht a how soon e major do you expect the idea will conclude it is operation against a mas in goza i think will not that its can a take a a a great deal of time and the reason on sying that is as worger to be we ardy provided in formation to morrow by the way wereging to be providing more information i to you into your viewers you walkin unit your chasing ta caris wat you just got at our soldiers and ther were bolging at overson with dat you chase them enjoy goling with civillions and we do not want ta shoot i to their civilians there you open the door at hopkers and you seek two shouts from ground wet no one that you lookd on with sdout tey go down forty fify feet under the ground to a wat that is a a soperty in order for us to succeeding e liminating them and trying to provideis least catualties of course on our sde have the goslen tovilin this is tha rede we difficult operation sice israelsing over and over were trying to reduce cevillin casualties n the met to being but we dut but we are angry you that you are doing that si we do not believe you meanwhile the by administration continues to simultaneous ly push the line that israel casi tofind itself and also to push the line it isrel us to do more in order to

blink and pulling the chain that isralul be going hog wild just killing palsinians villiangs willin nilly whih of course is untrue ba mere peat for the thousandth time itsrael has complete airo superiority in this region complete there is no air force in the gosistrip there is no air force to speak of in lebanon egypt is not interested n going to war with israel which means israel has willi newly air power over the strip if they wish to kill hundreds of thousands millions o people they have the power to do it they are not doing that hey'r ging their own soldiers killed in order to protect palcinians svillions and meanwhile you have the west pretending that it is the oposit why again to re establish that moral equivalents and just a second whene gun get to the twenty twenty four race jo bidons palling numbers are terrible the reason is poling numbers are terrible is not because of this current conflict it is more because when you set the world on fire people ton not the it

is doing a very very bad job his poll mumbers are in dier trouble and that is largely due to the fact that again if every election has have set a thousand times the regh erendum on one of the two parties right now the refrund mas on bidon when the worlds on fire when everybody is looking at the news what they see is an economy that seems to be stagnating at least may be on the precipice when they look at world politics they see an on going stale mate an neu crane they see a conflagration the ae least thats largely created by america's eron policy they see proms with china and tiwan domestically they see tremendoust descent they see serious gaps between how many americans think about pety much every issue of life and then look at the president and they see a very elderly man who does not sem uable to keep it together and right now feelk the poles it is reflecting all of this according to a brand new new york times pull which is panicking the hell out f democrats the results currently show jobiden losing two donald trump by margins between four and ten percentage points among registered voters in arizona georgia michingan evada and pennsylvania his had only in wisconsin by two per centage points in nevada he is down ten fifty two to forty one ashou don eleven in michigan he is down five to trump forty eight forty three in georgia he is down six to trump forty nine forty three in pensylvania he is down forty trump forty eight forty four in arizona he is down forty nine forty fortd trump in wisconsin he is up two what that means is that if the election were held to day and these pulls were right donal trumpwould win with in access of three hundred electoral votes every sentence of this new times sana poll is horrible mews for jobidon voters under thirty favor biden by only a single per centage point his lead among his banning voters is down to single digets his advantage an urban areas is half of trumps edgin rural regions women still favor bidon but men prefer trump by twice as large a margin lack voters are now registering twenty two per cent support for trump in these states that is a level unseen in presidential politic for republican in modern times in a remarkable sign of gradual raciual reliment again this is the yor times between the two parties the moreti virse the swing state the farther bidon was behind he led only in the whitest of the six the world is falling part under bidon since spence or whises of fifty three earlds electrical substation specialist an pennsylvania who supported bidin an twenty twenty but stwitch back to trump i ruch ma that much rather see somebody i feel can be a positive roll model leader for the contry but at least senting trump has his whitz about him another ominous sign for democrats his voters across all in comelovels fell bidon's policies had hrt them personally voters gave trump a seventeen points advantage rhaving help them and biding an eighteen point disadvantage foraving hurt them seventy one n per cent of those poles haid he was too old to be an effective presiden that is n pinion shared across every single demographic and geographic ruin the pole including fifty four per cent that people say the voting for bidon sa hes tool for the job only nineteen per cent of supporters of trump viewmas to two old only thirty nine per cent of the electorit over all feels the same sixty two per cent of voters say bidon does not have the mental sharpness to be effective voters fifty nine to thirty seven said they better trusted trump over bidon on the economy that is the largest gap on all issues thats twenty two per cent positive margin for trump and by the way nearly twice as many voters says economic issues would determined their twenty twenty for vote compared with social issues a bortion or guns those economic voters favored trump by sixty two thirty two only two per cent of voters say the economy is excellent voters prefer trump over bidon on nemogration by twelve points on national security by twelve points on his raly palcinian conflict by eleven points by the way that demonstrates once again that bidon is saddled with a coalition that is at least in part anti israel trump has no such probems trump is h most prosoral present modern times and is theleven points more popular on the issue than bidon is vote fifty eight per cent majoritys support more economic and military eights you crane that did not seem to benefit bidon on broghter questions of fitness to handle for an affairs the gender gap o national security is enormous men perefer trump sixty two two thirty three that is a twenty nine per cent positive martion for trump by the way leshue runs the bast if any of these candidates right now a the is generic republican generic republican runs amazing generic republican is is tremendously ahead of of donald a o of jobiden at this point cas all people want is just in all ternative now what that means that the math could easily change the pole also shows that if for example tonal trumpart is is to be convicted of a crime duringy twenty twenty four than those poles change pretty dramatically what it does do however for trump in the primaries is obviously it takes away the largest to argument against him by both nicky halian ron to santis which is his unelectability if the argument against trump is that he cannot beat bidon or that he is the candid at least likely be bidon when their poles the come out showing that trump is up on bidon in prety much all the swing stages obviously that argument gets under cut tand this by the way should show trump something which his the more gou are out of the headlines the more you are likely to win if tunnal trump hides in the basement from now until the election he will be president again it is pretty much that simple he needs to run the reverse biden strategy now is trump capable of doing that maybe maybe not but he should he should stop posting on truth social he should go in the basement he should let his lawyers do their work at he is various trials and he should be quiet an he should let every one focus on the fact that jobidon is terrible at the presidenthing really really bad especially because therre new revelations about jobidon on the corruption frunt thatare gon continue to plague him ani mac carthy has really god piece over at nationalr view he says would the american people have elected jobidon if it would ben widely understood that bidin was bought and paid for by the chinese commeus t regime the question presses because as it turns out the income ant president actually is what the media democrat complex falsely claime the prior president wase a clandestine agent of a hostile floreign power scandalous as this story is it is just as in feriating jobiden's collusion with china is back in the news because the house oversi comitte has just released its latest report showing the big guy as e recalled from twenty boblinsky's texts actually did get at least one ten per cent payout from the bidin china scheme precisely matching his stake in the venture as was sketched out and in notorious made twenty seventee nemal this only news becaus the paper trail is now catching upwit the outlines of the story as an mc carthy rights thanks to the exstensive excavation of bidon financial records by senters cruck rassly an ron johnson followed by dogget reporting of the neuro post the altlines the story were publicly available before election day twenty twenty but the story is gotten only more damming with additional evidence onearth by the over sy comittee c f c a shanghai base energy conglomerate with which jobidon and i family join forces was china to described as thinly vailed arm of gisian pins monstrosor monstrous regime what xadrat toe camophlage who as run by e jon man wit the bidons deemed a protege of g how could be otherwise c f c's position as a privilege private company was established by the regime intwo thousand six all of this was knowable three years ago prior to the election not only thaut his pretty obvious that bidon was being bought an paid for by c f c if c f c could brandish cordial relations and business partnership with t bidon family other thargets of china's blandishments ould be more willing to transact it was a fact as animc carthy that bidon c f c sceme was not an abstract lan t was the dirty done deal in which the regime backed company lavish the bidons with mountains of money the scandal ous wright there to s in october of twenty twenty americans did not see it and mericans in believe it becaue the bidin twenty twenty campaign and congressional democrats and the media tried to prortray all of this as russian to s in formation but that was not true turns out the bidon's dealings with c fc were already under way in twenty fiftee which is when jobidon was still vice president apparently jiman hunter bidon did not take c sc money during the obom years cas the op optics would beenterable but they were mift that c fs was already using the bidin connection to further its objectids they believe c fc owed them they expected to be paid and that was already in the works and as it turns out jobidon did get money on may thirteenth twenty seventeen james gillier sent hunter a now famous mal that sketched out the structure and splits in the c fc skeme including ten per cent for the bigguy the bidenside believe the deal hebomentum hunter biden's discussions with ye indicated that at least for starters thereouldbe a quik ten million dollar in fusion of capital interesting then that when jobidon bought his rehoboth beech mansion less than a monthlater he paid two point haveen four million dollars in cash rather than taking the mortgage there is a problem thou the c f c funs it did not actualy materialize and desperation sed in in that is wen hunter reached out two c f c and said i'm sitting here with midad in any event hunter admonished the hads of c f c m concern that you av veu er changed your minded broken or dea without telling me or that they are unaware of the promises an assurance tht had been made he said do not mistake kindness for weakness the following day he was assured that ce f se would be willing to cooperate with the family and again the money did in fact change hands and things are goin to get worse for jobidon before the election if if donald trump stays out of the headlines and that is always he big question at's always the big butt will donald trump stay out of the headlines right now again the hadlantr are obviously taken up by the war in th madeleast it is quite possible they'l shift back to donald trumps legal issues as the year goes on tha's what democrats are betting on if dont here' the thing even if those things move ford if donald trump just stays a waiy from them if he does not say anything he can easily be president again or theoredically republicans could go more toward u nojanaric republican which would be more toward to santus or nicky hailey helping along that effort as i will governor can renalds she apparently is going to in dorsed to santus at a rally into moin on sunday that is very early right now obviously to santus in second place the latest pulse show him tide with nicky haley at sixteen per cent reynald's backing te santis in iwa is goingto carry an owful lot of wait it is going to sink haley back in the third place you would imagin as i've said before the big problem with with hailey is that if to santis drops out a lot of hi supports can go back to trump a lot of that suff his knockin gover to haley which will basedly con firm trum sleed if hailey were to drop out presumably a lot of that sport would go to to santus in any case trump is way ahead at this point all ready coming up we will be jumping into the mail bag if you are not a member become member used coach piroa check out for two months freaonal anuel plans click

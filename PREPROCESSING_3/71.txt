the benchvirsthrorsponsor by expressof vepian i talk about the most over single show why havn't you gotten o vepianet it express vepian right nou express vepianta cam slashmen the goal of the current wave of procomas protest is very simple the goal is not to protest in favor of palistinians of course if it were protestors would hav been out in the streets for last twenty years pushing for comases alsters since comas was tealing literally billions of dollars and using it to build terror tunnels and rockets and they were killing anyone who oppose them the goal is not even to make a political point really politicians may try to translate the obviously pro terrorism in antismetic messages of these procomas protest into political speak hy try to make it about a sease fire or negotiations or two state solution but that is not what these protests are about these protests are about intimidation it is that simple the size and virulants of the protest is designed to intimidate this is why the protests are not generally calm or peaceful they are generally rounded hey are very often violents the involve assaults on police officers and on jews unlucky enough to fall within arms grass yesterday a procomas raly in new york city for example ended with the procomasnic hitting a jewish man in the head with a chair this of course is not a raran hate crimes against jews are up over two hundred per cent in new york city the procoms protestors wi'll descend on the museum of tolerances in irony almost too thick to believe in order to assault jews and reporters watching a compulation of comases atrocities in the gaza envelope all of this on the eve of the anniversary of crystalnached the kick off a violent nocuatrocities against jews in nineteen thirty eight here is what that look you can see people screaming three palistine trying to bee people up as they enter the museum of tolerance musedom tolerante by the wight its right on peopeuple of ar isan one less jewish areas of the city and pro palistine protestors procomas protestor shut up to tried be people up of course we have seen these tactics all over the world protestors attacking police officers in london defacing historic statues and putting the cafia on ben franklin climbing the walls of the white house we have seen protestors chancing openly for the slaughter of jews calling openly for the destruction of the state of israel itself on campasses across the nation jes have been surrounded pushed around threatened here as yu sealet yesterday my almamater where one woman scream to beat that ping jew as protestors beat up a pinata of his really prime minister benjamin intin yahoope he can see them mun beating an pinato wit stick and nd screaming the top of their lungs youn see a one gyt com mup grabb thea itinahopanada and star cuncing at meaning it while everyone sheers in the united kingdam jewish students are now fraed to go to class according to reporter e town smallmen quote in bristol a jewish suden was told you and your family are money grabbing murdering muslin people another in birmingham received an instrogramassage from a stranger warning quote may a slow and painful death be granted to you and every other zin is you a university rabbi also received a direct message on the platform quote you massacrd innocent muslems i hope you die too in warwick a jewish students whatsap group was inful traded by at least three different people bombarding freshers with the message shown to me including fng dirty jewish calisrael gotino humanity n mud ring ba and free palistine all that was spald wrong of course over it am i te last night a corting two students there jewish and is raliamatee students were physically prevented from attending class by a hostile group of pro comas students calling themselves the c a a the inthe administration warnd them to clear and get out of the way or they would be suspended they were nod none of this falls into the rum of politics it is mere intimatation it is show of strength it is a threat the idea is very simple there are millions of us the camas supporters we are in your streets we are in your classrooms we are in your companies wou'll say and do anything we exploiting your western weakness you will import more of us your sons and daughters will join us in marshing against your values your law and forcemen organs will wash us passively as we do all of this and you will do nothing that is the mescsage the goal of the procomas protest and rallies acrossthe west is make jews and western allies afraid by showing they have no limits prochms forces in the west hope to force their enemies into acquiescence their goal is to play on the emotions of soft head liberals who quate anger with justification who believe that the angrier the protestor the more that anger mas spring from oppression the only way s relieve that anger therefore is to relieve the supposed oppression to surrender and the west is filled with those who woold surrender the latest example comes curtesy of the washington post yesterday the washington post removed to comic by famed cartonis michael ramiras here is what it look for those who cannot see it is a camas member it is a camaspokes person and tied to him our babies an innocent woman in the corner you can see a picture of the leader of casbolag and a and pausing in flag and this comaspokes person is saying how dair is ral attaxivillians this of course is an accurate kartoon this is indeed comasas strategy to hide behind civilians particularly children while claming immunity and the depiction of the hamas figure is based acamas senior oficial gosy camad whose most recently seen explaining away the slaughter of jews nd then pledging trepeat that slaughter here is what gosi comad looks in real life and here is wht he looks in the kartoon this is very obviously gosi camad no matter the cmasnixs in the washington post offices promptly intimidated the washington post into fully pulling the kartoon thase on false accusations of risism editorial pagederative is shiply said quote a cartoon we published by michaelr mirs on the warn gossa ar kartoon whose publ cation i prooves was seen by many readers as races this was not my intent i saw the drawing as a caricature of a specific individual the comasspokes person who celebrated the attacks on unarmed cevilians in israel however the reactions the image convinced me that i had missed something profound and devisive and i rogret that again it is the reaction that convinced him it is not the actual content it is the reaction the angrier people get at him the more they must be justified send ap mudallo a staffer at the washington post celebrated on the company slap wedallo un surprisingly it is pretty obviously arratical procomasne her twitterfeet contains allegations of his raily gennicide and blams israel for the bomming of the allokley hospital those palsinan islomicche hod perfeed contains precisely zeroe condemnations of comas but the post cave to her and her allies they din't cave to her because of the inherent content of the ckartoon in fact here is another carton that' still up on the post yu to page ire's a cartoon that is effectively a blood lible falsely depicting prim minister bedjuman insyahu punching a palisinian baby tin thdefates whele ignoring a comas terrorists the caption reeds israel pounds coms targets in goza the idea being that beeby is looking specifically at the terrace ignoring the terrorist to punch and presumably kill the baby that is a blood libel it is still up on the washington post you two page this is the story in the media o these days they will defend hitler supporters who hade israel but they will dump cartoons that label comas terrorists that is presumably why the york times spent its day yesterday defending stringers quoton quote who ere participating in comases terrace attacks of october seven they are litteral pictures of some of those stringers carrying grinades to the actual attacks must not upset the aslomic radicals and the alomograticals know that the spineless media will cave to their emands that is why riters invaded the offices of the york times yesterday according to the yorktalinews quote a demonstrator set off a smoke pom at's about thirty others breached the lobby were witnessis said security guards let them briefly chances one witness sad quote it was fifteen to twenty of them doing the actual damage with guitic pictures the i would set up is camera and then they would be spray painting windows here is some footage of what it looked last night outside the york times building an inside wit th near times building is it the giant crowd tgather right outside of he yor times building chanting theylso make for to spray paint of con cop cars with three gosa and where is onfer marmbual being arrested why is it become open season on cobs thelso spray painst at a cop car with id f c k kag since when is tax pair funded property open season for procomasnecs the protestors who entered the york times building claimed agains t all available evidence tand they were invading the times building because the times was somehow pro israel which is absurd the n york times is most antie israel publication in major leggacymedia saying that the times is somehow proisrael is saying that prov da is two pro american now the protestors know that tey're not all the ways stupid th a purpose of their many riot was simple keep the ew york times intimidated believing that the anger they are demonstrating must be the result of some sort of oppression again that is how orks in the media the angrier the supposedly oppressd perceen the more they deserve your acquiescence and surrender intimidation does work all of this is reminiscence of the sharley hebdos scandal of two thousand six when that publication printed a cartoon of mohammed the profit saying quote it is hard being love by jerks amid the massive protests french president jonk shirach condemned the magazine for quo overt provocations well you knowt that sperd a bunch of terrorism against charley habdoh in to thousand eleven the offices were fire bom by hislomic radicals in two thousand fifteen two his lomic raticals murdered twelve people in the sharley at do offices the same people who in two thousand six were claiming the sharley ebdo as the aggressor by two thousand fifteen ere out in the streets saying jes we sharley habdoh which was a lie they were never in favor of sharley ab dose speech they are in favor of weakness weakness breeds ogression the aggressive push because they sent the weakness this is what we are seeng in the streets its why randomor alleyes now feature overt threats to kill jews there is one in florida yesterday at's poin o right now to killyou hamid om os you right now i go min c for his people he says he would go to the gosestrip and he would kill you this sort of behavior is absolutely run ofthe mill at brokomos ralleys this is not a peaceful mark these are not just people who are chanting for political cease fire the intimidation is the points it is the reason for increasingly violent attacks on jewes internationally it is why thre is an attempted shooting at a montreall jewish school yesterday what should the west do the answer is to be unintimidated do not cave in to the raticals if they get aggressive they should be confronted if they get violens they should be arrested by law inforcemen that is literally the job of law inforcemen if they are not citizens and thy support homass they should be deported to countries that better reflect thei'r awful values no more weakness unless you want more terroris more terro supporters and more dead innocence hain just one second we are going to get to the west continuing to start to cave because again the oppressor oppress matricks is the death of the west it is thet ethewess will gets that one second first venerans sday is upon us our frends over a purtock meen working towar lleviating ten million dollars in veteronsette thanks your support they are over ninety per cent to that goll to day thinkg abot this thou us military is made up of one hundred percent volunteers these are men and wome who willingly sacrifice everything they have for the country when they are unserving they are turn home to a tight chob market and outrageous living expenses that is why i'm happy that there is a private company purtolk that is jumped into help when you switch to purtock's lightning fast five tou network they will do not ite a portion of every new order too this excellent cause the can make a real difference just by choosing superior sellphon service and again i use puretak i know how good pure tlk is pure toks plan starc to twenbux mont they offer on limited talk text more data and mobil hot spot just tun in over to pure talk dot com slash chipuro and make that switch but's help eas the burden on the many women of given much for the country is at pre tak dot com slashapro switch to pure talk to day it is a dofor you are making yourself on coverage better andyursa money and at the same time theuctually helping fello american veterans it is the right move it is the american wy visit puretak dot com slash shipuro today go check him out right now and meanwhile the weakness of the west is being made apparent pretty much every single day all all these talks about how israel these more humanitariam pluses they need a sease fire morcuman attempcas secures the thing israel right now by the avilable data is being more targeded in an urban area than literally any army in human history the actual ratio of tereris killed to innocence killed i's probably about one to one and that is awful that is terrible it is also entirely because commasses strategy isto hide behind civilians knowing that if theyn get the media on their saide that if they get the leftese on their side if they can demonstrate anger in the streets that there will be an attempt to call off the dogs ther'll be an attempt to preserve commass in its position of power that is the goal here and again they the the goal is to intimidate this is why you have seen a wide spread media attempt to pin jo bidons personal unpopularity on his upport for israel but that is not where the data are the reality is that bidon support for israel is quite popular in the united states the american people do not support commass the reality is that by eighty for to sixteen per cent in the latest harvard cap terispol american support israel overcomeoss and just as many believe that israel is justified in its response thi to say pece written by mark pen at the walszr jurnal he is a polster an adviser to bill in hillry clinton the is not coming from republican who wishes to see jobn win is coming from a democrat who wishes to see jobidon win according too mark pen he says it is true that the sixteen per cent who support comas include many democrats as eighteen to twenty foyrolds split only fifty two to forty eight in israel's favor but are those democrats going to vote for donal trump who move the yos embassy to jerusalem in the end they will come home as they always do bringing home swing voters will take more than israel policy israel ranks seventh among the issues of chief concern to american voters if jobidon can mac progress on the other priorities he is reduced to running a negative campagn against trump but the reality is that jobidon's israel position is actually widely popular that is why you are seeing these protests grow in size in virulence as they attempt to convince jobidon that if he does not push israel off the mark thn they will somehow lead to his defeat dezwisu rechueted to lead threatening that her followers arn't can vote for bidon again mark pen is corrack where they ndevil for trump fromis most pro israel present i american history bar non this is why you see jo bidons staffers weaking routinely to the media an attempt to under cut him in the york times today remember this the yor times we should remember a corting two all of theses protesters zapro israel newspaper which gain insane they printed a story to day called is rally forces have limited time an gosa yours official say who ard these people quote as senior bidin officials push israel to do mortem in my civillin casualties general charles cue brown junior the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff set on wednesday he was worried each civilian killding goza could generate future members of commhos which by the way this is the dummist argument tyou ever here it is really a stupid argument that that is the same argument as omy gashiuna during reld war to if we killed to manianatses and to menys villins get killed wal were killing anazis were just goin to create new natsies it is the most self serving catch trying to argument of all time thany one worry about the when we are killing everyone icisrael almagosh if we kille to many members of isis yunomy people it is gon aradicalis millions people all over the world would be radicalized by is taking out isis that is not the way this works again what creates terris is hope of defeating the west that is why they multiply when you think that a movement is going to lose you typically do not join the movement but according to the near times general browns comments offered a rare glimpse of division between israel an the bid administration it came as the united nation secretary general antonial guttettas sed the number of civilians killed in the gosestrip showed him there is something clearly wrong with israel's military operation against comas now again these staffs that are coming out from the gosestrip are solely from commas commas lies about the stuff all the time they label cmas terroris as civilians all the time very often you will see a stacomous lik eighty people killed seventy of them civillings and it turns out seventy themerteris and ten of them were civilians becaue it''s just a guy who is eighteen years old with a gon but he was actuall us rorring genes and teecherk is not uniform according to the nerr times however the level of carnet has deeply shaken israel and shiped its military response the longer the is rally military campagn continues the greater the chance the conflict will spark a wider war several officials in the bide administration side that of course is again a lahi actually if israel radically ascallates and starts going wholehog just o get this thing done with that escallates the chances of a harsh response thes been low level conflict in te midalies for literally my life time my parents lifetime as long israel's been around the only times it is broken into war is when there is an overt feeling the israel can be overcome it is the bidad ministration again is going wobly that is not particula shock and that is due once again two all of the public pressure thit is being brought to bear by procomas protestors and their allies in the media this presumably is why tro bidnans out they are saying i've been asking israel for longer pauses for humanitary causes israel is literally taking multiple our gaps in the middle of the day there is lot's o tape of this and there are gardings civilian corridors is o comascarding the civilians it is israel spending its own blood an tressure to guard civilian corridors sthet palisinians can walk from the areas that israel is targeting away from those areas antown sout israel has now set up a field h hospital four palistinian arabs on the beach in gaza why because when they are gone there can ave to going to all shiefuk as all shef a hospital has been camses military headquarters for literally to decades when they do that ther 're going to have to move sick patieonts from one place to another come oss meanwhile isu's waitig for israel to killdems that can brags the cameras about it but here is jobidon doing this silly routine about how israel meads long or humanitarian pauses o a but if commoss is not actually going to release the hostages that is just allowing them time to regroup and re arm the only reason he is doing this is once again the by administration is trying to play it both sides they are trying to say yow were proisrael yawerback and ins true they are nd at the same time they are simultaneously under cutting that by claiming that israel is violating human retrichs not true by claiming that israel neads to do more to protect civillions evenol israel is doing more militarily to protect civillians than any army in history including the american army in places a rock or aft gannistan again all of this under cotes it it actually undercuts the ability of israel to finish off the bag gies now there is going to be response by the west to all of us that that response is slow boiling when it comes to a head it is going to be really ugly will get st that in just one second first the

meanwhile the west is going to have to respond at some point to the fact that it is honey combe with people who support actual terrorism and that starting to happen already in europe it is goncome to a had tomorrow in london london has seen hundreds of thousands of people protesting in the streets for camas screaming about how israel shuld be obliterated screaming antismetic slogan firing fireworks at officers defacing historic statues attempting to deface the senataf which is a central monument to the dead in world were one and then it was extended to world war to tomorrow is armisto stay in luondod and again they are epecting a giant procamas rally the goael of that is again intimidation and it is expected that there is going to be a fair bit of controversy maybeson vilands because some of the people gon to show up to couns er protest are our people where a tempting to protect those monuments when the people who is come under fire is swella braverman she is the home secretary she she is excellent swella braver min bythe way anuen she gave a speech at a i recently all about all about the failure of the west to take stock of the people entering the country she is totally right about thus well now sheis under pressure because reshi sounac is thinking about maybe dumping her she wrote an article accusing police of byas and allowing the procomas protests she claimd that some senior officers apparently play favorites andapparently the prime minister did not sign off on all of that downing street says it is still investigating how the article containing in flamitory comparison between pro palisinian mobs and marches in northern ireland was sent to the times for publication sunac is not firing her yet she claim that mob protestos were largely ignore by officers even wone clearly breaking the wall that is one hundred precentru and you can see it happening in real time and we have tape of it we have protestors literally firing fireworks at officers in london and the officers doing nothing and meanwhile telling people who are holding british lack they cannot put the british flags right there we have vidio of police officers in london a resting people for saying the procamosnic should be deported and meanwhile you have procomas protesters wcho are intimidating breaking windows doing what they do naturally all of the controversy's about swell a braverman noticing this to the way that this insanity works is it swella braverman noticed and that means that she is bad according to the uca independent reshe soonack is under pressure to sack swell a braverman after she defie downing street by publishingan article accusing those police officers a byas over protest in support a palistine but that is not what the protests are about my friend douglas murry is pointed thes out if youctually look at the tape of the protest this is not a quottin pro palistine protest it is a pro comoss protest that is why they were not protesting against comass five minutes ago every one understands that even if you are an advocate of the two state solution which get his fantasy land tgiven the fact that the palistinians themselves are incredibly raticlises n have no desire for to state solution but even if your fand you would be in favor of comos being gott in rid of but nobody is actually talking about gettng rid of comass id is very very likely actually that there will be some sort of conflict the royal british legion has defended pro palistinian demonstrators right to protestomen a furious row over whether a rally should be allowed to go ahead on armis to say the royalbrish legion has urged protesters to be peaceful and show respect as morner's flock to london this we can to remember war dead in a statement the arm forces charities at the british arm force to play vital rule and protecting the rights and freedoms of everyone newcase society including the right to protest whe're not aware of any protest during the arbiall remembrance vents we hope events can go ahead over the we can without disruption yat we will see yat we will see apparently the latest prokomss march through london is due to take place not only tomorrow but they have now mapped out were exactly theyre going the six organizing groups behind the demonstration had faced calls from the at police to postpone thei're march on the grounds that would clash with remembrance services first of all if you have a march that is going to clash with the remembrance service for fallen soldiers in the uk that should say something about the marchers that should say somethng about the marchers if they are marching for piece and love there would be no clash with the possibility of people who are who are marching to remember war dead tit is pretty obvious the orientation of many of these marchers the met's commissioners tor ark rally ultimately decided to give the march a green light the loscrd by parliament are clear there is absoly no powered bam protest said sermark he added the marchers had shown a complete willingness to stay awagy from the senetaf and whitehall and have no intention of disrupting the nations remembrance evente aheh we will see if it goes quite as they think it is going to go meanwhile ren lapen over in france i's beginning to gain more support because of thist the simple facts th matter is that france which has an extremely large muslin population they the muslin population of france right now 's about three point for million muslims isabout five percent of the total population pew research center predict that the muslin populationwal rise to between eight point six million whic is about twelve and a half percent of the country in twenty fifty this one of the grolling thrats that people are perceiving because again they are in tire districts of paris that again is very controversial to say but its realities are no gozones people leave them alone the police do not want to go in there the same thing happens in ares of london by the way there certain precincts wher he police just do not want to go in fact under the highmagration senaria that pew research estimates they say that the per cent hurewoul be the percentage of muslins in the e u by tw enty fifty under a high migration sinario thority per cent of sweden seventeen per cent of norway fifteen per cent of finlan twenty per cent of germany eighteen per cent of frants twenty per cent of austria seventeen per cent of the uca at those are very very high numbers because again a huge per centage of this population as we are seeing from thse protus rt now is not in fact assimilating to western vallues even under a lower estimate those are big big numbers and the blowback has begun nd your starting to see rightwing parties who are gaining credibility because of this marinla pen who is the the leader of the national rally party originally founded by her father scholmarila pen cholmarie was a pretty vicious antisemic marine has not been at least an in police or practice and marine is trying to now join she sho again was in a run off for the for the leadership of the country in the last election cycle and she is now joining in an anti antisematismrallilic to fight antisematism because the case thet she is making is that frane is imported too many radical muslims which of course actually happens to be true a cornincs the associate press french far right ly to marinla pen has set up a cocoffiny of criticism over her plans to attenday we can march to protest rising antisematism in france pri minister elizabeth born numerous political parties end citizen's ar to attend that sunday marshala pen has said she in her national party rally party also will be there the paries cern presen jhorn bardella said in ian interview he does not think jomarila pennis antismetic a remark that revived the lenkh between past an present government spokes percen oliva oliviate verands had wednesday the marinla pens party does not have a place at what is dup is a grand civic march fights sat everybody is free to show up again one of things goet to happen as you see a rising a rising level of radical muslem ac tivity in the west you are going to see parties marinla pan who are going to start seeing electoral electoral victory that is not thing that is going to continue to happen becase it turns out at eventually the we can ascend aventually people in the west get tired of this sort of stuff and the blowback is extremely real it will be fascinatig to see what happens to morrow in london thye'll be a very good early indicator of just where the west is going if the curint stadis of weakness toward radical is slum continues i can meanwhile an jobidon is continuing to have serious electoral problems ill get to those in just one momen first venteranstay is now upon us is time we step up and help give back to those who have served our nations aren forces is t where black rifle coffee company comes

coffee dot com it is indeed america's coffee oka jobidon is having trouble on number of fronts the media are trying to cholk it up to the israel commass war that is not why yous having trouble in fact is approvalratings are basically stagnent theye been stagnant for quite a while because he is not very good at the president thing i'm looking at his approval ratings right now and what you see is the jobidon's approvalrating's right now basically the same as they were in no back and july of twenty twenty two nothing has really changed bein pretty stagnent the reason for that is because they are a bunch of boiling problems one of those probins continues to be illegal imigration in fact take emerged yesterday is not him ogood for jobin tibomer gjesture of llegal immigrans on their way to the united states and as they were marching they were cheering jobidon's name that is every republican attack ad fom now untill the election just young men a mhan's entirely young men there ret not nolout of not a lot of women in children an at in that crowd i'm these are these supposed refuges and they are cheering jobidon's name you en you connect tat to the fact that the illegal migration is but it is bad the texas literally had to this week absorb land in the real grands an attempt to stop a legal immigration according to the uche daily mail the texas general land offsonouncin april state troopers could clear out two islands near egal pass five months later land comissoner n on buckingham added another in frontin thas part of operation flat top texas pointed to old maps that claim the islands in te middle of the reo grand were always part of texas frontand island is the largeest the measures about a hundred n seventy acres one's full of lush greenary it has been stripped to dirt and line with barbed wire in the past week why because the legal emigrants were showing up and then they were using ths as the launching point to cross the reol grand front an island notice the singlemost dangerous spot on the southern board is clear to patrol buckingham treated on november first lieutenant cris oll of eras told news forsand in tonio the reclaimed islands were mostly used for a legal border crossings he said we see the influxs of e legal emigrans coming across they would use those pieces of land as a refuge notas mexican magrants either data from the departmen of homeland security showed thousands of chinese migrants illegally cross the reo grand by way of mexico in twenty twenty three by the way thei're terreris threats who cross the reol grand to it turns out th when you cannot actually clear people cuar crossing the border you have anoidea who they are frar tell soldiers have ben crossing the borg using these islandstho texas literally hade to claima islands in the middle of the reol grand just a clear them of the possibility being used for a legal imigration meanwhile in you'r latest plorable illegal emigration crime story jas shaw reporting over at hot air this week ice managed to arresting he legal emigran from hondoris in virginua he was charged with fell in eurape by force threat or intimdation aobduction by force and assault on a family

he is not going to run for re election in the senate in west virginia west virginia is a very very heavily red state whet's virginia in fact is the state tdevoted most for donal trump in the last election cychlel yesterday mansion said het do not run for another term in west virginia hes seventy six years old but that is n't meanthat his political carers overs well see he may even pose morofa threat two jobidon then just that his turm ends gjanuary twenty twenty five which means of course that he is going to his seat will be up for election in twenty twenty four hure y wats in nouncing yesterday they would not be running for reelection in the state after months of de liberation and long conversation of my family i believe in my heart of hearts that i've accomplish thize set out to do for west virginia i've made one the tomplis decisions of my life and decided i will not be running for reelection to unite estate senate but what i will be doin is travelling the country and speaking out to see if thereisnan interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring americans together to the west virginias whoave put their trust in me and tought side by side to make our state better it has been my honor of my life to servyou thank you cay mansion out in west virginia what is that memeans republicans pick up one seat remember hes senate right now is split fixty on forty non democrats to republicans that is he flits n ow gout fifty fiftys that means public that is pick up one more seat now here is the thing there are zuro republican senators facing reelection in purple states in states that trump lost in either of elast to presidential elections there are six tdemocrat senators wore facing reelection states in states that trump one in at least twenty sixteen or twnty twenty sen purple states six senators up zero republicans all democrats rite six at sixlo senators are democrats what exactly to ose races look or they look unless republicans bolot which republicans have a magical way of doing i mean it to it i have to say am astonished t the unbroken chain of republican failure over the course of the last six years or in arizona purston sentima announce that she was gon to run asn't independent that is bec os the democrtic party basely under cut her because she was making too many deals with the other side having too many conversations with mit romny and the while that has now opened up a three way race between crston son mut is independent rubin gyago as democrat and cary lake presumably as the senate opponent in arizona now carry lake just lost the gubenatorial race over there is quite possible that she ould even lose in a three way race that senima would pick up some f he moderate re publicans and that she pick up someo the moderate democrats and that she losis butke gayago somehow sneakson that' can be of very hotly fought race an uncomfortable one f republicans because republicans have decided n t arizona to sjust more cowbell is the solution apparently meanwhile over in michigan democrats have a seat is been vacated by deby stabna she is announced her atirement she is reelected in twenty eighteen with fifty two poin three per cent of the vote depending on who republicans nominate michigan and the morban state of te michigan republican party they could theoretically when a seat there is con be difficult michigan of the michigan republican party is currently bankrupt they do not they do not have any ability to take out at is my understanding and not only that they have had a history of nominting candidates just wildly under perform in general elections but that is only two states there the other states montana is a traditionally red state john tester is secking reelection in twenty twenty four he want in twenty eighteen with fifty point three per cent of the vote but he is going to be on the ballat presumably at the same time as trump in twenty twenty four do ring in twenty eighteen as democrat n republican state not quite the same thing as running at the same time is republican president who in montana should have some cot tails to culd easily she republicans pickin up thatsy that would give republicans a fifty one forty unine majority in ohio ohio stolla swing state kandes sorta but ohio is deeply red trump on the state widely in twenty sixteen and twnty twenty sherd brown is looking for reelection he won in twenty eighteen with fifty three poin foure per cent of the vote shard brown is a much more formidable candidate than pobly john tester is in montana however is that a seat the republicans could win if they do not run somebody terrible sure that is definitely wenable seat again ats can be a presidential year pennsylvania republicans look the are actually going to run somebody good this time that presumably would be dave macormic whos running for the senate in pennsylvania democratic sent rebobcasy is looking fror fourth term he is reelected by wide marchin in twenty eighteen but the state seems to have gotten closer along these lines at maccormic is good candidate in wisconsin sener tammy baublins up for reelection agains she one widely in twenty eighteen the question is to whethe republicans will select somebody who is sort of more middle of the road misconsin or to win the seats or were they get out the vote in why marchin in twenty four is ror th question trumps can have t ave cotails of trump has even if trump does not have clotells republicans have a very good chid of retaining the senate however if trump does have cottails republicans could theoretically walk away with fifty three fifty four seats in the united state senate that is the current situation that is very bad for jobiden in th democrats obviously but jomansion retiring f om the senate in west virginia giving up his seat presumably to may be governor jim just iss o re publicane as not just the probem for democrats in one sense it is a big probim for them in another which the jo mansion could easily join a no labels ticket the is been a lot of talk over last couple o years about a no label's third party tickete taking votes away from jobiden and that could easily happen mit romney has now retired from the senate jo mansion has retired from the senate and there is a wide spread push to run a mansion romney or romny mansion tickete as a sort of third party alternative that is very risky for jobide a mean super risky for jobide because here is the thing he has a certain locked an level of support it is not all that hige his locked and level of support is probably somewhere in themid thirties meanwhile he got donaltrump his locked and level of support is probably in the low forties to mid forties there is pobably fifteen twenty per cent the vote that is up for grabs in between there now if there is no serious third party challenge no serious third party candidate then probably those people split in favor of jobidon that is typically what happens an election r donal trumpis an vall however if there is a plausible third party alternative that change is real fast right now robert off kennedy is the junior is is sort of the default what if there is a third party guy and in a lot of palling heis up in the twenties in one place up in the thirties which just shows the wild disfatisfaction the american public has with the current political choice is being offered them being in a non functional eighty year old and donal trump the o tese of tese are not choiceis that the broad swath of the american people are intoe the party bases in the re publican party loves trump the party base in the democrat party doesn' al obide byt the filic tor stuck with him an's that a lot of people or sort of in the middle and dissatisfied with both candidates and to the possibility of a cone qua moderate ticketes a a party crossing ticket thotbu mansion romny unuransee i twenty twenty five per cent the population that to ga very serious look at that in come dis proportionately woud imation from jobide inside becaus again donal trump has a higher level heas o heas a higher floor heis a lower ceiling and e has a higher floor donal trump a ju jobiden has a lower floor and a higher ceiling just electorally speaking that is what although because it is poor performancs his ceiling may also be really low at this point according to the ner times whe mansion plans to do remains mystery his closestates an advisers insist they do not know a conservative democrat who as served is one of his parties key votes in the senate he is long kept his own council on his biggest decisions and made up his mind at the last minute mansion is florited this year with no labels roup tht has made noises by runing a centress candidate for the white house no label'e official set on thursday mansions announcement had taken them by surprise hough they commended him for stepping up to lead a long over do national conversation about solving america's at biggest challenge regarding oure no label's unity prasinnential ticket we are gathering in put from our members a cross the country to understand the kind of leaders they would to see in the white house said the group in a statemen some allies o mansion our skeptical hi'll run for one who cost hundreds millins of dollars to run a credible independent or third party campaign but he might just because of the high levels of dis satisfaction for months this year mansion is cose iued up to no labels according to the narro times which far has secured ballad acis in twelve states in an attempt to offer an alternative to bidon and trump the group's present mancy jacobson has told potential doners the group intends to select a republican to lead it sticket a decision thtwoul exclude mansion if no labels maintains that position one candidatewh's openly teasing a no labels run larry hogan he is been trying to push that he has no level of support mansions a bit of a ifferent story even see democrat's panicing about this by the way democratsman panics about no labels for quite a while here becus again they look at jobidon and they do not what they see the the realities that are setting in for jobidon are very real and very terrifying he isgen have to figure out pretty quickly what his strategy is his strategy by the way is going tobe just attacking donal trump why that works are not is going to be very much dependent on the new cycle and if you are democrat runngagains omaltrump you do not want that to be depended on the new cycle jo mansion must be scaring the pansoff democrats right now artiguizes thrust the show continues right now you are noc on one o miss it we will be getting into the washington posed which has decided that only fans women posing newed for money that

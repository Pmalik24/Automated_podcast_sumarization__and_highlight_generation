welcome to the hubermanlapodca science sciencepaceto r ing i'm andrew hubermen and or professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is jocko willink joko willink is a retired navy seal and author of numerous important books on leadership and team dynamics and the host of the jocco podcast during his twenty year career with the us navy joko served with seal team three as commander of task unic bruiser in rhomadiirac and elsewhere in the middle least as well as deployments in asia and europe after retiring from the navy joko used his experience and knowledge gleaned from his time in the seal teams as a way to develop tools that anybody can use to develop their leadership skills both for leading themselves and for leading others that took the form of several important books the first of which was published in two thousand fifteen and is entitled extreme ownership how u s navy seals lead and win he is also authored several books for kids about leadership personal development and how to navigate various aspects of life i've read both extreme ownership and the way of the warrior kid and i found them to be immensely useful in terms of actionable imformation and understanding of one self and different kinds of relationships both in and out of the workplace typically guess on the hubrman labpodcast are scientists and or clinitions it was some time ago that i was a guest on the joco podcast and during the course of our conversation on his podcast we quickly realize that many of the science space tools that my laboratory has focussed on and that i've used over the years and shared on the huberuman lab podcast had direct overlap and parallel with many of the tools that joko and other members of the seal teams had arrived at independently that is without knowledge of the underlying science and in fact he had many more tools that he had incorporated during his years in the seal teams as well as in business leadership in family and elsewhere in life that i quickly realize it would be an enormously valuable conversation to have him on this podcast in order to share those tools with the general public during to day's episode we discussed numerous tools that joco has taught and used over the years in a number of different contects including tools for generating more physical energy and for generating more focus and cognitive energy and for navigating sticking points that is how to deal with lack of motivation how to deal with difficult relationships in the work place and elsewhere nd perhaps most importantly how to think about and navigate the self in fact we spend quite a bit of time talking about this notion of the self and once self identity and how self identity plays into our ability to engage in actions of specific types consistently over time where it can hold us bac how to gain better perspective nd how to help others gain better perspective that we can work better with them and them with us we also go deep into the likely scientific mechanisms underlying why the tools that joco teaches and uses are effective in fact onething that you will immediately notice is that joko was writing things down and i was writing things down throughout the conversation and that just reflects the fact that he is not just an immensely powerful teacher he is also a practitioner and an avid learner he is always seeking knowledge we kick back and forth our ideas about what likely does and does not underly different tools in techniques focassing of course mostly on what works in the practical sense in the world what i can assure you is that by the end of to day's episode thanks to jocofs immense generosity and curiosity you will come away with a large number of tools and much richer understanding of how to navigate and inhants mental health physical health and performance in all aspects of life before you begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching ind research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desireand effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science backtolectorolite ratio of one thousand miligrams that is one gram of sodium two hunder miligrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elemente dokcom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elemente dokcom slash hubermen and now for my discussion woild joco willing joko willing welcome thankstravemyman i'm superexcited and superhappy to have you here im glad to be here i know that you and i did five and a half hours on my podcast aschedul is clear let us go let us go and actually and people w see the joco go drinks a this is not some sort of promotional by me but these are that the energy drinks i drinks o this could be i called the bring your own go hodcast am it is the energy drink i drink and no i'm not told to promote that or paid to promote that just the one that i drink there ogo im nopun intended i was just saying to our producer a moment ago that rarely do i sit down into a p odcast or somebody that skilled in podcasting lek reemen would be the only person that i've had on this podcast imblyve who is also of podcaster since you are a podcast r many other things i confess onm a little but intimidated well it is a weird thing to actually call a skill because it is something that i just kind of start of doin it is something that you just kind of start of doing it' something that lecks just kind of start of doing and i never practised it i did not sit down before my first podcast and think about how i should deliver things i just kind of did it maybe it is us lock more than skill well you and i i should go back further than that conversation that we had on your podcast think it might ave been twenty fourteen twenty fifteen and you were on the tim farrest podcast and the time i was living with my girl friend wehad moved from sandiago to the baarea re living this little tiny apartment and a basemen in oklin trind to save up by a place but rent of place that was decent to live in and we both knew a lot of team guis sheu knew more cim guis than i did in sandiego a dayted a few tis to be direct i'm great woman dos gas were cool to me imostly and im iremember when i saw the photo on the top card for tim's podcast woas it was your face i said do this gy from sandion she as note but if you had to draw a navy seal that is what you draw i think for a lot of people you embody the're notion of a number of different things some of which you talk about but some of which when you open up a bit and really get specific about work in the military and work in daily life and what it is to be you but really what is to be a human being some important contradictions also remurged right ivesee discipline as a fhene that people associate with you it in my view and i think in the view of a lot of people you embody discipline to day i deafly want o talk about routines but also mind sets but also things that you do and ways it you approach things that might i'm not contradict but not be obvious to people might im be a lubit counter intoitive and in addition to that you have a lot of different aspects your life in dition o running business is you'r a family man you have children and married a long time and it is yeu hve a lot of knowledge from different domains of life with your permission i'd to dive into all of them over the next twenty six hours let us dive great i'm fascinated by this idea of sense of self i feel all of us can look back to a time early in life when we first had some experience i' could be i in art class could be fishing could be sport does not really matter i'm what the exact experience was but where we first realize that ther're really cool things in the world something i turned us on at the level of excitement or maybe scared us or something that do you have any recollection of such an event may be not the first one but you ve remember hearing or seeing something as a young kid and maybeu could tell us how young and just thinking youmore of that please a lot of times when people ask questions along th this line of when was there a moment right when was there a moment that you realized discipline or when was there a moment you realized leadershipper when was there a moment you realized detachment kind of the questioner when when was there a moment you realized for lack of a better way saying it i'm a person rihte up mama i'm a person with my own thoughts and i can make things happen and for me all thos answers are usually fairly graduale there is a little thing that indicates you get a clue and then you move a tla bit further down that road than you get another clue and you move a itla bit further down that road andyou get another clue a that is what i would say for me life was you when you are when i was a little kid i was kind of slowly discovering that i was a person i was a human i remember u my mom took me shopping i i was probably about ten years old and i needed to get pants for school and my mom took me shopping and when i went to into the store there was a girl that was i n't know wha the're called in a store a retal sales girl she is probly about sixteen and i started chatting her up right and and i kind of recognize it a little bit but i sort of did not to and i just was chatin of this girl and i was making a laugh i was hapven a good time with the whole thing and you' t puttin on the pants and spinning around and she was laughing and i remember en we left the store with the pants and my mom was sort of talking to me about the fact that what what were you trying to do to that girl ias i was thinking myself well i kind of o that girl she was pretty i why that popped into my head but i just rememperthingin ey ben there is the whole world out there and i let us go make it happen y it is a great story cause it i think it really speaksis a thing that you mention which is that when we first start to ralize we have a sense of self it has something to do with causing effect on the world we can have an impact in some way ont on things outside of us outside of our home yoi latelyha bin reading a lot of psychology and i've been listening to some mere content and i i deust ley want to talk you about a study that you covered i relate to these i'm it is a brutal experiment with these kids that either had stutter or did not have stutter i want to get into ta lobit later but what we do and how we treat people an how a we received fee back and give e back has a big impact but i think some of that happened just in own relationship to things in the world that the old a hungarian psychologists i'm learning hav this idea of two kinds of people they lerally thoght there were two kinds of people there are generators and projectors and generators are people that are just from a very young age they realize they can impact other people positively negatively and they they wont create things in the world they want to generate stuff and i ca while i can acha build stuff and break stuff and blow stuff up maybe but also help things and and then they are these projectors that to just kind of reflect on what they see and they made the really important point i think that it is not the generators are good in projectors are bad the world needs both that they really work in a kind of symbiotic way but your story captures the essence of what it is to be a generator which is that by doing certain things you can have an impack and it feeds back to you and it is likely that they receive something from it as well ye and where this all came to fruition as i as i now piece together as youre talking through the stuff look when i join the military you join the military and you get a blank slat no one cares where you came from no one cares what you did you were the captain of the football team cap on the socratine kdown cares don cares what your grades were no one cares what you got on the essay teas or and do not cares about anything you are a blank slate and then with that blank slate it is hey if you do this thing if you perform this task and you perform it well youill get recognition you ill get you will hopefully get more control over your own destiny which is the ultimate in compensation for for human beings to have more control over your own destiny is the ultimate compensation you do not you and i were talking before it record you can have all the money in the world but if you do not control what you are doing every day or at least you do not control most of what yofre doing tis than it is not worth it the recent people tryin make money they can have more autonomy in their life and in the military it becomes very clear an it became very clear to me very quickly that if i performed well i actually got a lot more freedom with what i did even in boot camp if you pass an inspection in boot camp you do not have to redo you are locker or you do not have to make your bed again because you did it right the first time and yu have an extra fifteen minutes and and for me really that is when i started to realize oh what i'm doing right now is not goito impact not only what is can happento be in the next hour but in the next two years three years five years and i think that is the biggest miss that we have when we are growing up and i know you had your challengees and tribulations as you were growing up because you didn' realize oh what i'm doing right now is gan effact where i'm gin to be in the future and it did not cappen until you were out a high schoo when you went to yun your college and you il waiht a second i can actilly put my life together in a positive way when you are fourteen you are thinking haywonomen to do tomorrow that is pistically future operations or ottein on atour heads to morr ort and i's weares where mi can get the sellar be wish curves in mig in ahead scape wording and where we do not play the dio games to night or what girls are gento hang out that was kind of the mind sat it for ye and then at some point you you learned and did i oh the way the the the actions that i take now or either gingto positively impack my future f there can negtively and pack my future and the the the more i focassed on doing things hare not positively im pack my future the better my life became i think that is a very huge lesson to learn that i know i did not figure out for quite some time at the idea o investments in withdrawls runderstanding that early in life interms of health behaviors and intellectual behaviors and and your poin about the militaries are really interesting when i never thought about the military that way that there is is blank slate when you get in there a and before we started we are talking a little bit about the kinds of mindsets and people that the military attracts and a lefeu to elaborate on that again you mention on something interesting this s notion of garrison interesting word in its own right am what kind of people do you thing to military attracts and then within the military you start to see some kind of predictable bifrications where certain people go down one track and other people go down another i've a few friends from the seal teams is as we both know and i've heard sometimes about the distinction between officers and enlisted guise this kind of thing but maybe this question ofm asking is were across the board for all of military and for a really for people listening whether not they are interestin military or not for their own for their own life i thn there is an interesting less in this idea who is attracted to the militaries it people who want to in still order on themselves or is it people ant an stil order on other people we are both yother's there is a a really good book and i did i aint up doing about four podcasts on this book which is called the psychology of military incompetence when i first saw thon a manzing title i known when i first saw that title i thought to myself all this is some some academic that is going to look at the military an bash it and but i did a little research in it turned out wit the gui that had written the book i cannot think of his name or now you was a guide that had served in worldward to was wounded an ming the sguy had this cound er wa yo ware talking about and it is really an obvious concept ont you think about it and his base the basic premisis this the military when you look at it from the outside it is this orderly place it is a place where everything has a place it is a a place where if you have a certain rank on your shoulder you will command respact and people have to listen to that is what it looks it is an attractive place for people that have an authoritary in mind set for people that want o just hat do not do not do not question what i'm saying just shut up andowhat i tell you do theres people that love that there is people that want to live that you have worked for them i've worked for them we have we have experience that those type of people throughout our l ts that authoritary minds that that just want to bark orders and have people listen to them and when they when those people are fourteen years old or sixteen years old or eighteen years old they look at the military and they see a uniform and they say people saluting and they see orders being carried out and they think that is where i am going to go and i can get the respect atite to serve and the military certainly attracts people that and those peopler that have that highly disciplined and orderly mind set can do well inside the military especially in garrison and i had to wee gan we are tok about this early of the word garrison i do not think there is a civilian equivalent to this word but it basically means the non combat situation when you are out on the parade field when you are when you are going through schooling where there is no combat involved when you are marching those kind of things wwe call that garrison it is in the rear it is not in combat and the people with an authoritary minds that actually do pretty well in garrison situations why because things are orderly and you can predict what is going to happen and you do get a certain issue of gear and that gearis going to be delivered on time and you are going to shoot this number of rounds down at the range and everything is going to go according to plan that is what garrison is and those people join the military their attractiv that and theyan't up doing well in peace time now unfortunately for them combat is a lot different nothing goes the way it spose to go the bullets do not get deliver on time the enemy has a vote on the way things are going to unfold and you went up in combat in being very chaotic situations the type of person that thrives in combat has a more open mind has a more flexible mind is paying more attention to the in put that the're receiving a suppose the some one of the authoritar mindsthat they do not listen anybody else they make up their own mind they bark orders with some one that has a more open mind set they are listening they are they are taking in put they are evolving they are plan and those type of people excell in a combat situation now unfortunately and's a sort of the stereotype too you take that that dog of war and you put him back into a garrison inviroment he does not do well right he is not showing up on time from the inspection he doesnt have his he does not get gen get his hair cut he does not have his weapon clean the way it'xppose to be clean cause he is got his weapon ready for combat not ready for inspection and and you get this there there are thes to different types of people and of course with those two diferent types people tos degrees going one direct ionother but what you hope for is some one that can play the game on the garrison side and yet when it comes time to gointo combat they can also open their mind be flexible be creative that is what you really want is you want some one that is tvery good at solving problems and to do that you need to have a creative open mind to figure how weregngto do with something i think that is a stereo type the stereo type is that everyone in the military is sort of robotic and falling into the hierarchy and we bark orders and people fall orders and that is just not true there is an element of truth to it but is not the whole truth and certainly if you look at it history the people that are that excell and combat are the people that may be have a littla bit of a rebellious streek people that have athat that are just more creative and more open minded some of my friends from the seal teams a will sometimes throw out stereatypes about the different divisions in the military is there any truth to this idea that arforce types are one way and marines are one way and o navy is one way armyis a certain way sort of a general contour personally or is that just kind of inside ball joking around it is a little bit aboth i mean certainly the marine corps is steeped in tradition and you if you if you make a guess at what a marine went wen if you meet or if you had a had to guess what a marines on to be you you proging me pretty close i mean marines have a incredible programme to in doctrineate theyre people into the culture of the mrincor and the mrincor has not incredibly strong culture o powerful culture i love the rincrive work with the rinkcor a ton and they are outstanding as a generality certainly you could make those assumptions about the marine's general ta now das ti mean that everymerineisthe same now absoly not samething with the army samething with the airforce samething with the navy you have got these kin of stereo types that exist for reason a you noit is interesting to it is one of my friends named ben miligan wrote wrote an incredible book called by water beneath the walls which i've given him a huge hostle about becaus its the worst title of all time but it is it is certainly the best book written about the seal teams history and where the seal teams came from and and it is interesting it something that i had heard from a seal officer that had given a speech years ago it is change command what he said was hey listen you was trying to emphasize why the seal teams were good and one of the things he said was in in the army youe talking istorically who is hay in the army if you start to lose a battle you can just retreat run away in the navy traditionally we are fighting on board a ship and if that ship if we cannot run away we are fighting if we lose we die seals cannot quit this sort of this little over the top expression but when you take that litle bit further when you look at the history of the navy if youre youn if we were in the navy a hundred and fifty years ago you would have to go on deployment you would take your ship and you would sail somewhere and you wouln't be able to talk to meanyg moreso you would have to understand what it is you ere trying to complish and din't you go out there and make it happen that is decentralized command and that is something that exist in the seal teams without question very decentiralized command and that is one of the one the absolute strengths of the sal tems is you have got leaders at every level inside the orgaization that if they do not know exactly fut not told what to do there can a go aka i do not have been told witl do bomica figured out and that is one of the strengths of the sel teames we do not we also we have more doctrine now but when i came in the seal temes there was no doctrine was all word of mout and the army in the rinkquar if you have to conduct an ambush you can pull out o manuel and you can look up how to conduct an ambush platoone ambush ow to conductit and it is all written very clear and ar great docunessits the fem seven tack eight infantry platune in squat i think it is the is the army doctrine sill nerns in your hyppocampus firing and yes it is imbedded ind there forever and it is a areat manuel and you can pull that thing out and you have a place to start from in the seal teams we did not have that at all you would hear from your plotune chief this is how you condoctrine i ambush and he had heard it from his potune chief who heard it from his potune chief who heard it from his potune chief and opportune chief was in ve atnout its gettin pass down but you can make adjustments to it and you you can you can alter the pland a little bit because hey the terrane is different or hey the the the night vision we now have there is changes that we can make because there is no doctrine not having any doctrine in many ways is a strength also it can be a weakness because if you have got a new platoun commander that is never done a a an ambush before and he has no idea what is doing is platune chief has been out of lute for a long time and he does now what he is doing there is no way ther's no reference there is strengths and weakess is just any characteristic right everybody's characterisic youve got strengthand you have got weaknesses and your weaknesses can be strengththan you strength an be weaknesses but to get back to your original question are there stereo types inside of each of the military brances sure but are there outliers in each of the military branches there are absolutely and that is why you cannot judge a book by its cover for people tis saying this who are not in the military maybe have some military lineyage in their family or not but who want to understand a but better about how structure and lack of structure can boast support being effective in in life in relationships in daily life in fitness in business in school i thing goese of the big domains in creative endeavors thing nold be useful for them to understand a little bit about how you in particular balance discipline instructure with dare i say lack of discipline instructure woml you can actyyu tos say the word freedom rightcause that is what it turns oye or made even play iou know i bring this up in part because i've seen some post that you put up of you you will plainlay guitar with friends or music one of them was attribute to su one who i either was killed in combater it passed away you' these moments of connection between people sometimes ar working together but sometimes are in relaxation and play in these kinds of things i think it as a really important post for people to see that while jocka willing kicks back with a guitar not tring to take over stages maybe you are maybe of a plan then ing can do you pily be the one but what is the balance for you in terms of structure and lack of structure and i'm not an ask for your daily routine we know that you get up early you train but i do ave some specific questions i think would be helpful in putting some meat on the the kind of a the notions about you and again this is not a picking to your life but more to to grab wha it is to pick into your life the a question i asked you in the lobby as it is one that you kno having seen iour content for a long time and really benefited from it i was curious you get up early at about for thirty train every morning how long do you train for and is there any global structure to that and of course everyone needs different programs but dou is it wait training one day cartio training the next day or you combining the as always an houras it always half an hour i think people would benefit from getting a little bit more understanding of what that looks for you with the cof yaht that everyone has different needs levels of you background et cetera but i'm intensely curious about this and i certain i'm not the only one you want talk about wait lifting or rock and roll on the guitar i want to talk about em let us your let us talk about the most structured first party your day and thenless i'v but the least structure party your day a least of the parthy you can share with the with the world yet i waking up early and i'm going to work out and depending on what is going on that day if i have an early flight i might work out for eight minutes right i'm might going and do two thousand meters on the roller get get a sweat going hard as i can and then i'm done and cause i got t go catch a flight that could be happening maybe i'm supposed to go surfing in the morning i wake up the waves are terrible and now i've got nothing to do if i'd planned out to be serfing for two or three hours and now i'm nock to go surfring ston to go i'm to go lift than under go playing the jim and do a bunch of stuff i mus spend two or three hours an her i love doing that the work out could be anywhere between what i to say eight minutes and three hours and it could be anything i between i i fully enjoy the the physical aspect of working out if i have more time to spend in the jim i'll spend it i remember my dad saying at one point if i retired i would not know what to do and i i i'll think myself or you serious right now your if i did not have aything to do i'd spend six hours day in the jim i't speen four hours doing you gitto i could fill my day i could fill every day with just physical activity things that i just doing but that is wake up early get a swat going and do i lift yes do i do cardio yes do i run yes o a sprint yes do i lift heavy waights yes throu i sring cattlebells yas i ah i do everything and and anything and i enjoy all of it and i'm not really good any of it they are not i'm not really good at any one aspect of physical activity i i there is people that are infinitely better me in every aspect of and am mot tos talk about othisgies a world classlenon and there is a guindin fred down the gim that conde lif more than me there is a guy when i was it filtin too thre was a guy who is iwe five seven and he look kind of shobby and he was older than me and he could run faster than me he could bench more then osgis er at there it was e bothersom yet there out there they it they got some engine in ther related to something a i do think ther genetic differences in terms of peoples rasilients and work out but even jis grip strength is highly hihly subject is genetic influence is maximum grip strength but of course there is a huge range in what people can develop but a guarentee your grip strength is is greater than mine uem people ast me this all the time who ould win n arm wrestling betwen your jocgl my jocco who an intriges of jocco uninisalon a technique an arm wrestling i have to imagine theire putting their body behind the weas there is actors tha there is legitimate tachnique in ar wrestling there r for me yet yet there is no if we could bring a female arm wrestling here that knows how arm wrestle because i'm n a har arm wrestle either and she would be both of us a because there is a lot there is a lot more tachnique an arm wrestling than then most people recognize there is all these little games that are going on there is all this little arm position that you get just everything else it is tachniueere's a lot of technique an arm wrestling lat's good to know i did not know that about arm wrestling i think we all start off with some genetic prediiuspositions both good and bad for different things and then there is as far as we know there is a huge range base through narral plasticity and mustle adaptation at cetera in what we can obtain never on genetic predisposition a serve as a barrier no one knows also what the upper limits of any of these things are and some of the best examples we know from sporting certainly from aced amia our people who knew they were at a disadvantage and just worke tentimes harder than everybody else because they had an ax to grind with their gunetic disadvantage which is really coolid at the face of it i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag one is a vitimin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundation on nutritional neens i've been taking athletic gren since two thousand and twelve some delighted that there sponsoring the pod cast there is my storry taking athletic greens and the reason i still take outhltic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me in the probiatics that i need for got health or god is very important ats populated by got microbioda that communicate wih the brain the mun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiatics anathletic grens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in additio n i let it greens contains a number of adaptigens vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundation al nutritional needs are met and it taste right if you to try oth let it greens you can go to a lett it greenstock calm slash humerman and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up out let tit greens while you are on the road and the car on the plan et cetera and they'l give you a year supply of vitem in d three k too again that is a let it greenstock cam slash humermen to get the five free travel packs and the your supply of vite him in d three k to you get you get the training and do track your training and in a detailed way ar you keep at track o lifts and i si right down what i do and i'll right down ii right down what i do everyday and that way i can go back and say what was i doin back than cause i might go through some phase where i'm trying to do more polups or i'm trying to dead lift more and i'm trying or what t whatever the whatever the thing is i'll go back into gothe thet board of ded lifting after while let us face it if you just want to be a good dead lifter you are not going to be that fast right you are you are gingto be slow on long runs you do not want to go too deep into dead lifting andyou'lt also do not want to be good at long runs that you cannot dead lift go a good a mo wai i got to go through phases ndnot gettinto someth for a while not gettinto something else i do log down what i'm doing i can look back and say oh dan i i'm i'm notteven close to strongers i use to be me to get back to that i'm fastening by the concept of energy thinks when the most interesting aspects an all abiologeol o psychology and all of life and what when i say energy i mean im the distinction between being back on your heels flatfooted and forward center of mass and i get the impression and i think everyone gets the impression tyou are somebody with a lot of energy and i wonder whether or not you wake up with a lot of energy and you feel you have to burn it off with this physical activity and and work and other demands in your life where do you find that you wake up and your energy is kind of neutral and exercise and physical activity gives you energy as i think this is one of tha kea things out there i think that acts as a barrier for people doing more with their body because they maybe they dn't want tire themselves out or may they do not feel they have enough energy to begin with it is also feeds into this idea that owyou know somepeople to have a lot of energy theye really physical and other people are not on but ju say on most days you wake up feeling you want to burn off energy build energy what is exercise mean to you and ther may we talk about some of underlying stuff going on thircs i think both my find and interesting i would say it is both right there is noway acosideran say oh ye every day that alarm clock goes off and i'm oh ye let us rock and o o certainly that is not the case it is also certainly nop the case at every dow wy o god not aget now i that' say most the time there larm crock goes off and i do not think ubunch when my lar cock goes off i i con't i i do not think ubunch i do not debate with myself not negotiating i i just thing goes off and i'm doi in what i'm sorse to do sort of robotic now this this much i cannot say when you go and work out your can feel better you wi'll get energy from working out you that is that is a guaranty if you go work out yn feel better if you go break a swigger can feel better you are going to get more energy from it and look you got a go really really horrd to were now you feel more tired when you are done and even that a'm you con ta go pcycho i'll do that occasionally but i do not do that on a daily basis you will at the end of a day if i wake up lift run sirf and then i do you get through the afternoon at the end of that day i'm tired and i feel tired abut normal day working out just makes you feel better ge definilt gives you definili gives me energy i should say cause i gess i mot everybody nowit is i think it is a very important point because one of the things that we are learning from circadean biology in a time of day effects and sunlight all that stuff that we tuck by n our podcast that you have done intuitively right this whal we have ri res canteras the last time we had a conversation is that many the things that science is telling us to do an that we emphasise on the podcast this podcst you have been doing orre built into military schedules and one of them as this notion of waking up early and getting physical early in the day and i supose if we were to just throw one blanket rule on the table to encompass the broadest number of themes it is that once every twenty four hours we each and all get a big increase in this release of the one one cartis all whicheverone says o carts all it is terrible is can burn you out a drean oll burn out all that stuff but it is a non negotiable peak and you want it to arrive early in the day and viewing sunlight physical activity calfene and in particular intense exercise all amplify that cortis all peak in fact i think it is the numbers i'm seeing is just sunlight biewing gives you a fifty per cent increase an that course all exercise on top of that another fiftey to seventy five per cent increase is tis huge release in this wormone that everyone thinks it is terrible but actually sets as huge wave in motion for the rest of the day which gives you more energy higer levels of immune function more folk et et cetera and does indeed as you mention in your example of your daily life sets a time or that about fourteen to sixteen hours later you are sleepy which ust what you want fourteen to sixteen hours later unless of course you are running vampireshifts in the militarior yoron shift work but most people are not of course i think the idea that movement and exercise gives us energy i think it is an important idea and it is something that i was frankly i was hoping your answer would be that as opposed to that you wake up every day and you just wanter just attack the world bec's you have much energy getting out of bed because frankly i never feeld but i always feel better after i train always nd of course there are times when i crash in the early afternoon if i train really really hard but usually that is when i i over calf and ait to an outrageous degree and then i do not nourish after were i over nourish this is the other thing that eating the whole rest in digesting the digest word in there is meant to for it isthere for reason which is that when we eat a really big meal we ac sual nead to slow down i hate to get into daily schedules at the level nit paking an nutrition is about the most controversial topic on the inner nect a but d you nourish after you train and if you do do you do it to the point where you cannot look on mostly full or on for you thin eit really nourish yourself or you find that eating slows you down i find that eating slows me down and i would say again thi it is weird how some of this stuff is the mame's i got in the habit of wakin up early and working out is caus if you do it before anyone else is awake than the camp bother you wen you can get stuffed on right you go to seal team and you get there before any eelse is there no one can say hay can you help us with us hay no one sent you any meals you get you get that time you get it done and and an it is yours right i remember when you were on my pon cast an i do not wear som glasses when i run in the morning because i sweat and it fills my sun glasses it is not because i want o let the you ve light into my eyes that is not corus all e right nout for the cuorters all i did not know that it is cool that i know it now but i just did it because i do not li have t sweat in my some glasses cannot see i just run without am put a hout on ut as far as eating i doft to do physically act ive things with food my stomach that is just the way it is ye me and i do not want it and what really keeps that in line fror me is i'm dooing you yot to an afternoon and if i'm eatin a big lunch by the time the afternoon rolls round i'm kind of i got food in my gud and i just do not that feeling no i do not eat a big meal until i'm kind of done with the physical stuff for the day which is usually at night six seven ofclock at night which i guess there some bad things about that i eat too ate well the data say if you are yow thits gat we can go down arout o whr this and then somebones on to pull up some little clinical study and the another on the counters that and i think the datas sentially say that having a regular meal schaduel that allows you to sleep well at night whatever that means for you and that allows you to be active in focast when yeu need to be active in focus that is the ideal schadu i when i'm working with clients ic ar the leaders of consult ti company that is lon't fromt when i'm going to work with a client i'm not eati ecause because there can be asked me questions were to be diving into what is happening inside their business there is a lot of stuff going on it is a lot of cognitive work i'm not eaten for podcast i'm not et before a potcast to performer o going ofpoct gotsom not eat cause i do not wanto have a bunch of food o my stomach i want o you dn't you get a certain level of mental clarity when you havent eaten a bunch of food goone out on missions i never would eat before i go o out on a mession i would eat when i come home you get home four ofclock in the morning three ofclock in th orning from doing operation cool that i'll eat cause in a ment i'm in a doi be brief for fifteen minutes clean weapons and then you would a big meal go to sleep cool yet i do not want to have food in my stomach when i've got a perform or execute anything again i think that is just kind of a fluke that i ended up living that but that is cindhow i live te fortunate flue for all of us because abecause much of what you enbody and what you do i think centers round this idea of discipline of course but also energy it is it is it is the intuitive sense i get about why people are drawn to your messaging and what you do and how you do it energy we know of course is coloric energy i think that is what most people default to they go that how many callories are energy and how many calories in that you need calories to fuel things but the energy that you are describing i think it is the one that well it really maps to eastern traditions more directly thol yenin yanthing yenanyen i was get that wrong which is the notion of nurl energy and there is a particular cluster of chemicals in us as a fancy name call the catacola means but that is dopamene a penafferon which is a drentlemane and nor up an effort and then you have got courtus all and those for hang out together and basically give us enough energy to run our brain and body for fifty days fifty days the i dea tha you have to eat before you train sure for some people that might work better than others but i think what people do not realizes that any time wore ou taking in coloric energy it takes nurl energy in order to digest that and put it into storage and the way you describe your day of yet i also do not eat before i train a hydrate in cafanye i have been drinking these before i train i have to limit myself to tub cork cause otherwise are lican already quaking a little it aam the second one but iave a pretty high cafy in tolerance i to train fasted also and then i find it gives me energy but then the moment that i eat a meal that is a little too large all the sudden i'm i'm out of energy and what is the deal this calories or energy reuso us to have energy in order to think and move and i think i think a lot of the world has this backwards and this is not a push for intermittan fasting or any particular style of eating really i do not care of people are carnivorovin does not matter to me whatever works i happen to be an omnibore but i think it once people understand tha energy to do things is nurl and yet of course it relies on having glike agin and all the stuff round but nurl energy is what is really about then your schadul and the way you function and the way you describe your scadl really makes a hun of sense you described getting up and lifting running surfping enjugitu in the same day on a day that you are hydratin correct oh yo notlit is that is vital and i know in the teams in the seal teams there is a lot discussion about hydration as importanteven though you ies i knowis must be able eat sand and survive on sunlight and dirt and drink your own blody it is hydrations could take in seriously right y anan different people need different amount of hydration and i unforsunurs wong i always need to bring water water in the field which socked cas water's heavy and i have friends one of my friends tony be t f tony you go in the field with a cano cope and hagin and coffee in his can d gok three strat days aserterate desert rat man you cou jissurvive and i would always have to b bring its on a water nig i sweat a ton when i work out or when i'm doing anything that requires physical physical out put i'm gt a i sweat atone i've tor dern't drink a lout of water for sure but not evones the same now ye i think if most people focas more on hydration and movement they would find they have two i'm an a venture guess heres is not a scientific study but to to four times more energy than if they focussed on coloric energy in what to eat yet i think the cool thing about this you are usin the term energy and what is cool about this is you or i i create energy right i create energy by i said by going to the by going lifting in the morning by going and doing burp you go to berpies you go to a hundred perpes you are creating enrgy you are going to be tired you cno be sweading but you just created energy that is stuff is its tolly trun got there is neurow science to back it up i achalything about devoting some of my lap to this one of the best examples another a familiar territory for you is cold water yin nowadays there is a lot about ice bas and cold baths and showers and all that and iways likely to say it listen it is all just a reliable source of inducing a drenaline release and you get out of a cold shower you have more energy and that energy couldnt have been coloric energy it is a drenaline and i again i'm it is fair to say i'm upsessed by the ideas of identity which is low bit how we started off and i want to get back to it and energy i feel identity and energy can account for seventy five per cent of what it is to live a good life if you can master those because then it all seems to fall into bins it is of course you need sleep why we will to restore your neurl energy right at some point you just fade out of naral energy if you do not sleep sleep then falls into a particular bin with a particular purpose nd then exercise becomes not awaits burn energy but as you set to create energy we ave share strying understand why this is if you will indulge me for second on some narow science i we did not talk by this last time we have narl crcuits that controll deliberate action we have narl circuits that control deliverate actions that we forget that we are doing walking and then we have narrl circuits which are called central pattern generators and these are the uneral circuits that love to just work on their own and in the background jus cun a hum in the background and take care of all the stuff heart beat breathing and movement that is repetitive if you you are just marching and you do not have to a just your casans much or mae your hiking even and step in this rock that rock once central pattern generators get going it is very automatic and we know that once central pattern generators get going there is the release of those catacola meanes those three or four molecules that then feed all the other naural systems the collnremodulayers for reason cause they set the gain higher send you go out for a run or a jog or a hike or something and where you peddle or you row and then you are whole system is is at a higher ar p m when you say create energy nour sciences are stryinners shim what that is repetitive movement that allows you to forget the motor commands that ae required to generate that movent you might think about your roas stroke or something that but you can do it without thinking much you come off of that and you now ar set at a higher ar p m to do more deliberate stuff and none of this again involved eating anough probhydrates are making sure you ha enough keytones ore enough protin lik its ou got plenty of that stuff provide you nourish at some point every twenty for hours or we weant i think we know te lobit about the science behind jocko willinks schedul now but i will ask this are there certain forms of exercise weight lifting verses cardio that you find give you an especially big boost in what were calling energy an here this could be cognate of energy could be physical in to put a a readiness for the next thing at first i got a back you up on this i't of backing up you are you are you are science you haver giver rock march put on a heavy weight and yet off yu thereyou sorry interrupt yea peterotea got me into this he got into doing a long sunday instead of a long sunday run throwing on a light weight vess or a ruck and going off three hours and the first twenty minutes i find ialways want to go faster and get it over with but then i've learned that the real pain in it sets in around an hour and then the beauty sets in around ninety minutes rey i could do this all day all night and i never won to stop see that is when you were describing how this chemical these chemicals get released and once you are in that automatic mode cause in the seal teams you are doing maritime operations for a month and you are going to do some it kill house shooting and you are not caring to munch awaight and e you go out to the desert and now you are putin on eighty pounds and you are going on day on you get out ther're going eighty pound rock march and the first freek and seventeen minutes the first twenty three minutes just suck they just suck and what was beautiful as by the time i was twenty three twenty four years old about oa tis ging o sock for seventeen minutes and minutes or can to be i'man to be a rowe ot and it does not matter any mone i can just keep going for ever its at's sounds what you are saying is what i experience my basically my whole do not life there is goin to be a little braking period mentally wrwhere you think of this totally socks and then you just can keep going for a really really long time and it is not that big of a deal to your question of is there any form of exercise that gives me that energybook i i would have to say the the high intensity sort of anna robic blast whether it is on the biker on the row or or your swiing to cattle bell hard something that that last ten fifteen minutes that is a really good way to youd' peik my mentality for the day do you do the cold water thing imand you discernly toa lot of in buds amid you you force yourself into cold water iving myvei've a cold bath on my house and i get in everyday hallong yo spending in ther usually around five minutes five minutes before you train we are after noin after thes some i have not played with yet and yor me i'm i'm such a i i do not to make a bunch of effort for something for me going downstairs gett into ice tub and i guess you only need to do it before you work out y only go minute right do minutes a three joe and i've been texing back i' forth abou this there is a lab at stamford crag heller's lab that works on cold in performance and the athletes that stamford mainly the the cross country team in the football players are doing cold before thei'r training because of the huge increase huge long lasting increase in dopamen and a drenalin that 'ecaused by that they are finding it increases performance mainly by waking people up again the fo it creates energy is and students you never on things o athletes are all supermotiv ated this is no pick again stamford athletes in particular a lot of athletes are excellent to what they do because they are very lazy when they are not training this is true not all athletes but a lot of athletes ar and the really good at resting and recovering they can train more but a lot of athletes have a hard time getting in to into gear to to train every day and the cold is a great stimulus right it is a force it is a foreshot of the spresso constimulus without all the jitters i think maybe going there for a minute would be cool before work out i we will say this i had i had a long work out and it was a saturday which means on saturday i do to jis through kind of in the morning round ten ofclock and i have a long work out went for a long run it was hot and i just got in the ice bath and a satn there for seven minutes the deep chill i got out then i went right to deduce to my felt awful i felt absolute awful i cold and it to me n extr three rounds to get warmed up again that kindry left a bad taste in my mouth for tree work icing but i wan t try that short ofll talk in another front of my o no only go a minute before my ot of that a tro if it is really cold a thirty seconds to a minuteis ging to get you the this big release in a drennal ind and and dopamen actually one time i did try to know the yum the the chamber that blast cold aron you the crio the other cry when i did that for for a minute or whenever and that did make me feel three work out pretty good yet i think that the the whole notion of cold for matablism meano people say well it is not that they giv an increasin metabilis as far as i'm concernd the main function of the cold for most people is going to be the discipline of doing it the sense of resilience that you can build up over time just being familiar with having in the drendlin in your system and then the fact that the dobaming increases are huge and long lasting an they two point five acs increases at there is a colliga ind at stamford on olempcy runs our dual dignosis a diction clinett shoeuld a patient getting off cocan ediction who deside to use cold ice baths as a way to accont of assist himself along the way it was not get dopamen from coqaning more you wouldside to get it from the ice bath the difference is is coqang as you the sharp e increases and the decreases the drop you way below base line what if people do they go seek more crocane it is really pernicious that way whereas the ice bath and and col chowers will give this long ar clasting two to three hours or more and that is really something to treasure the idea tht you can basily save on your heating bill give yourself this huge dopo mean increase and i think everything points the fact that it is healthy and good but i mean obviousy it is working for you to do after your training i think all the the gimerats who want more hypertrophy youre tryin to get an extrayou know eighth of an inch on their tryseper whatever they freak out cause they hear that it can inhibit hypertrophy and then for whatever reason tere is this at sorm i doing it wrong well i mean get clearly your you are doing no you are not i your i do not thing your hypertrophy is suffering i actually am of the mind that if you'r training really hard sure getting in the cold afterwards might blunt some hypertrophy that is what the data tell us any gallopins kind the experte on that literature but frankly i do not know any one that trains really hard with the weights and they gets into the cold that looks their suffering from hypertrophy i know a lot of people however who love to point fingers at and poket cold exposure thise seems to be a big thing on sociar m e of peoplo do not the cold love to point out the studies showing that the cold screws up everything and most of them look they need a few sets in the gim a to me and o feel coha pokat them cause i feelike all of these are just tools right and im in any case i i'm a big fan of deliberate cold exposure mostly for the nuural effacts again i'm obsessing over this concept of energy and it' something that i i cannot help but ask is that it is the cognative side of this in the kind of the the effects of winning and losand you obvously have a lot of deployments u and a lot of wins whatever in the contects that men it kill the target capture the capture the hostage cetera and then as is the case with war theree been some cases of losses right you have lost people maybe there were targets that were not accomplished right this kind of thing you have posted about these and tese are always things that are hard to see but i think it is really important that you post about people that you have lost right because first of all these people serve but second of all that things do not always work out the way that wewe want ed sometimes to really catastrophic consequences there is a theory and biology that when we win we somehow get more energy to win more through the release of no surprise dopamen and some related molecules in in fact testosterone in both men and women is another close cousin of the dopamine system afshu released from the same general or the the patterns of release are from the same general areas in the brain believe it are not and body but when we win we feel we can keep going ireyou look at the team that wins in'ts they will play another game the superable winners are you magine theire jumpin up and down and they could prod play another superbole losing we know can sure can drop things testosterone and dopa mean for some period of time but when you were in the teams what was your observation about how winning and losing would impack people in the short and long term in other words would you observe people that had a quick reset button and could you say that was terrible and then transmute i guess i'm getting intoto the at the the eastern language nout convert that into energy to go do better the next time res we also see people military and in the civilian world that a loss in particular severe losses thasely set them down the path of less energy certainly is in less callories in that most of time is the other way they start consuming more calloriesan that does not get them going again this notion of energy and om asking windsverses losses what did you observe and from the perspective of leadership and may be more importantly from the prospective yourself how do you work with that how do you calibrate winds and losses how do you transmut losses into energy these winds we know convert to energy but losses oftentimes can sap our energy way way down i think to start with i think that the selection process to get into the seal teams is going to weed out a bunch of people that cannot recover very quickly from something bat you probably heard these type of stories before the kid that was the star of the football team the star of the basketball team the captain of this the captain of that he is been winning his whole life he goes to buds and he quits because in buds you are you are you are not going to win you are certainly nokingto win everything they are ging to find what you are not good at and they are going to exploit that and you are ging to lose this what happens a lot of guyes that may lose and it disrups they are they are mote ov ation they are probably just going to quit and that is why you get this massive atricion ray with guyes that are studs i mean were talking a division one athletes division one afwic division one restlers division one footballplayers division one runners and swimmers they all come to buds they all quit not all fo quit but they are's plenty of examples of the highest level of collegian afh we in sports that translate very well to what you are doing in in basic seal training and they quit and sometimes it is because they do not know how to lose thy do not n how to recover from a loss and they are they are just i think already and once you get to a seal team you have got people that are generally speaking goin to be pretty resilian when it comes to dealing with a loss now o that i 'm use get use you talk about losing people you are friends with this gu you meet this guy and seal training hay the sguy seems a stud o he just goin to quit and and you are gong to lose five six seven people eight people people quit fashionn keep track of em years gan a lose youre's going to get used to it there is that now once you are in the teams and what you are talking about us now you start taking much more significant lostan i lhose narratiou lose of wone your friends and there is what from a leadership perspective you have to you have to pay attention to when you are it a leader in any organization you are basicaly in charge of the mob when it comes to what their moral is they are they are a mob and they feed off weach other just a mob riting in the streets can all we can break this whendllis break all the windows and thnthey move this mob mentality and that happens with moral inside of a team and you as a leader cannot get caught up with the mob you cannot let that happen you have to detach yourself from the mob mentally that you do not get caught up in theyir emotions and theyr moral because if you get caught up in their emotions an you g caught up in mirat their moral you cannot correct it we go out on a mission the mission goes great we get do a gun flight kill a coup of bad guives every one's o kay hive fives every one's feeling great you come back to base hey we do not need o dee brief that was perfect hey we do not need to geter gear a maintain we can just go to bed weat we are alsom that is when the leader has to say oh we have got the mob and the mob is becoming slightly arrogant heges re'll quick that was a good ob but there' some things we could not prove but you got a braing that mob back and bring them back to centerline same thing in the other direction you got or n operation it does not go wele you got an operation you take casualties now you come back to base you see guys moping around you see that the spirit startin to break and same thing if you if you are part of that mob you will be you will be with them your miral will be breaking your spirit we breaking you ever look n oh i see what is hapening heges listen up that was tough did not go the way we wanted it to go we need to learn some lessons he're some things i can do better what can we do better to make sure that that never happens again what can we do to make sure we have the opportune to go out and avenge our brother on the battlefield what can we do to move this thing for it as a leader went comes to winning and losing you are generally going to be the person countering what the mob mentality is cause when te mob starts winning they want to keep winning and they might get arrogant when the mob is losing they might start to lose more because the're attitude goes down the drain that is we have to pay attention to from a leadership respective for for me personally i think i know what i did when when i lost guyses was focus on are i we need we need to celebrate the life we neednt't move the morn vul loss and then we need to go to work we need to get er gear back on wed to lock an thotor weapons we need to get back out there i know that that is what we needed do youno often the best way to contend with with problems with issues with adversity is action i's by taking action the more you sit and the more you wait and the more time you spend with that adversity with the upper hand inside your head thet the worse it is going to get for me always taking action making something happen it does not have to be huge it does not have to be some mammith of triumph that you are going to go and go in pursue but if you say heyliss'n this what happen did not go the way yo wanted it too were't get er ger back on were to go back out we are to were to woing to do this other mission and that is that is what i think i think taking action and it is in in your personal life too something does not go the way you wanted it to go you did not get tho job you wanted you 't get the higher you n get the promotion you can go home and sit there in and and dwell on it that is not get you iny progress or you say ok gat what me do quick analisis why did not get that promotion oh it is cause i did not get this qualification or i headn't jump through this gait ook ec what do notyou lett lemmit lem me look in t how to how o i get to jumpthrough that gate next time i woll get to promotion youstare taking action action for me is a cure for a lot of proms that we havein life love this because the image that is surising my mind i'm i'll share it with you and tell me where it agrees with in may be violet us what you'r when you tell me but what i wet's imagining in when your time at leadership in the mob is a bunch of candles but not wax candles these are oil candles you hing about a winds he you i coun be an op go out in wen it coun be a team it con be an individual taking in examine the get in a plas it it does not matter but there the riding hive in those winds we know crank up those catacolamens and it is as if the intensity that flame starts going up as a consequence that is natural but the oil in the candle is continuing to burn down you need to celebrate winds but you are burning that oil and we'r really talking about here is how to moderate and then weclaim energy and i was imagineig you is the leader who is a cagees great but listen you are burning that oil right that oil is what you got you the win let us not just clamp it we can uno do if yo if you this bombsin may be celebrate in some other ways but then let us reat let us take the energy we got and put it to the next thing rather than just go crazy drug's of abuse in particular drugs that tapping the dopening system namely cocanin and fedamine and just cause there is no way to avoid this it we are being true to the biology the the energy the dopamen system was design for foraging for all sorts of things food people that overindulge food or seek out food saxs people that overindulge in these things they y those things and again this sort leans to eastern philosophy a bit but there is western or ascience or norscience wich ou to say to support it you start to deplete these dopeming systems the base line starts to drop and 'm imagining that the leader you in this case is saying listen let us ton it down use the energy that we have gained and put it to good use rather than just burn it up an joying it and then of course went after a loss when the ise i sort think of the candles going dimmer and the but the oil reserve is still there an i'sak how do you start to tap back into the oil reserve well you have to have shy ramp the candle up again you cannot just sit there waiting for the the a the intensity the flame to come back youes shoeu have to do something in order for that to happen maybe this is not the best analgy cause it lackd sort of the exactly what is that the person turning the intensity up and down on these candles but that is what comes to mine and in eastern traditions there is this ide a chee of energy energy to fight energy to seek mates energy to seek food energy for sacs energy to for all of it is the same energy and i actually believe that the energy that theyre referring to are these catacolomens i really do now there are other energy systems too relating to child rwearing perabond ing oxy tose and all the kind of fuzzy warm stff that is superimportant and when we would notexist as a species the way we do if if we did not honor that energy system also and that energy system that we normally think of as love as upposed to forward center of mass senergizes with this system nightly when you are r working with in training with and a people that you love this could be your your brothers your systers whatever your family there is i think there is an amplifying effect on this whole thing right if is just for more dopa men just for more money just for more winds just for more trophi's i'll never forget this is inside when i was a kid i had this weird experience where tony hawked dad rescued me from a scapeward contest in wind of vista the linvis to boys up everyone else left i was left there alone i was fourteen cause my home life ot that time et cetera and he was where you an o laman take the bust o lancaster i know this guyninas non o you are come into our house zergase we took me a tony's house and i went into tony's room that he would grown up in tony lived in falvric at that time and the room was not filled with trophyes the room was trophies and i remember just thinking wholly canlike and when i think about that and i think about what a healthy person tony turned out to be to happened the bless to knowima lil bit it is amazing cause a lot of people that had those trophies whatever domain of life they converted all that into wasod just burn the oil down in their candle he is a guy who is still going in his fifties right ammit that is a little side story but i think this notion of energy to me is important because as you said when we move toward action and we complete something the oilin that candle starts to get replenished and the flame burns hotter what you are talking about and i'm very interested a this now and i dn't now if there is there is already been measured or not but what essentialy were talking about it is a confidence lovel right if i go out and win i feel good about and it et let us am dona jugisyturniment and the first match i wat then i submit the guyand thirty's taken down semit him en therty seconds i'm feeling good i'm feeling confident right what is that mean my dopamean is up cause i got that victim my tastosteroms up cause i got that victory my confidence is up cause i got that victory same thing other direction if i go out first match and i lose to somebody mi dopamen goes down that chemical thing goes down my confidence goes down and what what i have to do as i have to learn how to maintain a level of confidence because if i get overif i win that first match win the second i some one on to kill this nex sky and i go out on sloppy and i do not care that is when i get caught if i get told if i lack confidence i go up thin there is nothing ey'll do to beat this god is ging o be horrible of course i'm ging to get smashed it is it is a similar thing that were' talking hat i just wonder how much if you start measuring cause if they say hay if you win your tastostram goes upright and then if you win more your testaostrom goes up on your dope me goes uphi your confidence is going up but you can get to a point where your confidence is too high and now you are getting sloppy and i y do not care and it youre you mention cokane you you see vidios of people that are all coked up and t i can just they they they can do everything all pulliver confident right they are over they think they can kick your ascal i that that is too much dopa men too much e go too much confidence the other side f the spectrum is some one that is on some kind of downer drug and they do not feel they can do anything they are lathargic their confidence is low and they are just depressed there is an interesting tyin between dopa men e go confidence and probably tastosteron that you get from winning and from losing and once again as a leader from a leadership prespective you cannot get wrapped up in that you cannot you cannot get wrapped up in that you have to detach from t you have to beal to take a step back and then if you are good even as a competitor you will say oh have that last match was easy but i need to prepare for the next match i cannot bring over confidence look i dont want a lack to confidence it is a balance right it is that it is that flame on the oil burning lamp that you are talking about that you want that steady flame you do not want too much going to burn out control you dn't want too little the flamal go out yet realliere we talked about this notion that the some these older hungarian psychologists had which the notho of generators virses projectors and their idea as that people divide into these different categories in the world needs both it is not a that one is better than the other but the world absolutely needs both and there is is idea now theyse on some narrow science and some other sychology that i've been lathing in to which is that generators know how to tappen to this system and they love this system i think that is your story about being taken a shop for pance thand it turns out to be a trip to shop for it a number of different experiences for you right a really telling experience i having it having an action effect on the world and something comething back to you that still sits with you inside in fact there is a do not a mean circuit they are still related to this young women or then young woman at that time some people are generators and i think that they are more tune to this dopamean system and as were having this conversation i'm guessing that about the estimate is that somewhere between fifty and sixty five per cent of people are going yet i get it more workoutsis gingto givme more energy i need to do more of that i need to when i'm back on my heels i need to think about the things i can complete et cetera and then the other forty five per cent or thirty five per cent might be saying how really get it now the ideas that the projectors can tappen to te same circuits everyone has these catecolamean circuits dopaming et cetera but that they tend to be more of observers in the world and they being partnered within simbiotic with these people now this starts to take on kind of stera typical masculine feminine things but this exists on both sides it really does there might be some biases right by biological sects there may not be right we could argue that it is poby an argument hey'll get us into more trouble than to answers it does notreally matter the point is that some people are perfectly happy to be in the company of people winning because they feel good to see other people winning they to be a support staff that is what makes them feel good other people would rather stick hot forks in their eyes then not be the person engaged in the activity may'm not every activity but the activity which time it h generators in the projectors i think that in the context of moderating these systems it is key i mean it is key to have a long arch in a career path military science or otherwise i think it is key an every domain of life and i think for me one thing that i've learned both the hardway and i've also benefit from the posive experience of i think in relationships thas con be romantic relationships but also friendships and in family the're because there are generators and projectors almost always in those kind of simbiotic relation cut a yow romantic couple or a family that some kids are more generator some or more projectors just by by something who knows maybeit is hard wired may be not as the leader of your family i'men ass one of the two leaders but as a leader in your family in i can make any assumptions here as the leader your family and also as a father in particular how do you apply these same sorts of ideas when your kid is gone of down becaus 'shard to be of fourteen year old or because it was a bad day or when they are up right i think the upstates are as interesting as the down states yes got the degree got the wind how much do you let them celebrate before you haylisten you just got yourself another couple milly leaders of oil in your candle we can do with that you can burn it ere yougan a save it for the next things you can climb the staircase well clearly it is a very similar thing to what i just talked about if your kid is doing well and and wins the restling tournament and is i want the resting tournament and what they want to do they want to eat if triple chees petes henry they wene to go crazy and you as a leader and as a and as a parent and as a friend need to say aman i mean you did good that was ossip yet a great day but let us short think a little bit about next week to how but we just have a few slices to petes at right as a reward this is this the same in any situation that you could be in interacting with other human beings you want to be the perse in that kind of moduates the the confidence in the ego or the way you put it the dopa mean and and the celebratory activities no matter who you are and and this goes with yourself as well you you do something you have a success and you say al that that that is great a but all glory is fleeting and i need to get back to work and you look and do people go too far without sometimes yes absolutely sometimes people they they do not stop and celebrate it all and those the kind of people i think they get burned out eventually because they never say hey that was ossom we had a big went cool high five they do not even say that i think you do not as a leader as a friend as a parent as a spouse you want to be able to modulate that help modulate that do not shut it down you now your kid walks off the restling mat wifor a hig five and you say you could one by more no i'm not talking about that or your kid walks off the mat after losing you say you got when yo deserve now you have got to be the counter the counter weight to the emotions that other people have and and i think that when you are when you are doing a good job as a leaderas a friend as a spouse whatever you are doing a good job as a counterweight they that is a good way to look at it you want a you want to provide some balance for people to make sure that they do not get out o control and you you notice when people have a downfall it is normally because they have surrounded themselves with people that there is no count er too there is no counter balance yif you were my best friend an i you i went out drinking last nightad had a great time and partied all night and met a girl an you are ha yallit is do toagainst night eventually where we ging to be working o be in the gutter somewhere but if you say hey you that was ossom but don remember we got school on monday right ad you kint o pull me back that is we we got a fine balance in life and ourselves and in and we got as much we cannot provide balance for other people because people are motional and e et caught up in what theyre doing and you want it you want to keep people balanced think one of the reasons people are really drawn to your message and i put myself in that category and i merry twenty fourteen was a very different picture from me does not really matter what the contour was but was things were were working but they were not working the way i wanted them too and i remember arriving at your condent first through the temfarrs podcast then jock but then thea a ventur the jocka willing podcast jo rogu an podcast os a be to one's at colice introduce me to you in your content notas really a case of at the time i did not have a lot of friends that we are doing similar things to me or that matched my daily routines in a way that im i could kind o senergize with in this way i think one reason why you are helpful to people is that not everybody has these friends som you can have the friend that is let us go out and tie one on again lot people do not even have that friend or they hve a friend but they are not really close with that person there' some ideas nowadays about eighty precent a males do not hve a close friend that they cook i do not know im mean i'm guessing girls and women feel the same to that t a lotstuff is superficial and there is a lot of communication bu not a lot of connection ight and i think that you and a few other people in the let us call it social media public face public facing space serve as architypes of the friend that is going to tell you when you are up great but let us clamp it after a while or that when you are down let us get going and hear's how you get going and i do want a high that because i think it is really important and it is but one reason why people are drawn to your message and the message of some other people who are out their trying to do somilar things but you in particular because yes you hav this military background very intense military background war time background but also you bring it into the daily routines that certainly applied everybody most everybody can acts us non he did water mi one would hope a there is another dimension to this that i want to just bring up and get your reflections on as it relates to military work school relationship family et cetera which is this somewhat counter intoitive idea but them once you hear it it makes perfect sense which is that even though the catacola means are responsible for drive and that that is what we are really about when we are forward centere of mass and we have to control the level the intensiy o the candle on the level of the oil and i do not know what those actually map too exactly we could probly figured out an we really parstit but that is the theat the idea here the analogy in a kind of surprising way we know that for sure one way to restore levels of motivation drive enthusiasm and to some degree confidence that things could be different is through deep rest things sleep right when things are really really hard when kids are just th they are fallin o part it is you put him to sleep they wake up and they delightful that it rung around the pajamas when the're little and a teen ager wakes up after a good night sleep they might be a surly but we are back adults are this the world is falling apart go to sleep make up oh i might be able to manage this kind of mind set sleep and then the other one is we know that play the sort of that the kind of physical activity or mental activity where it might be a little com editive but the stakes are low and it is really more about connection with the activity or connection with somebody else we are going to play a game of whatever you kow will not play just with lakkaso kick my asked when tou jid do with ether y you'l beat me up both of you kindly but you will do it but a rear to play a game it is just usly how we might be loo competive but the stakes are low right we know that play and social connection and sleep are basically the reserv war wit the location that you go to refill the oil in the candle every single time and for you where do those things play into your routine youn you mentining can go horrid all day and then in the evening is it dinner with family typically if you are at home and what is that look i know whe're con a parsing and i do not want o carve into your you'n you'r personal life too deeply obviously they are boundaries there but was that look is it everyone at the table phones away and you are talking about the day wors it yet sure with us a little bit of what that looks as i think it is not important a contour to what you are about and what we are talking about that most people just do not have a window into yes o first of all 'min just the refilling the tank with games i mean that is wor jugituas i you are ging o go and yofe n have social connection with people you are not talk to people that you are going to joke about whatever than youe gingto roll you'n have a good time rolling youre into get all sweat on you are on to feel good than yre ging o hige five there is huge that that is there and you are brain is kind of off when you are when you are training you get to at a certain level you are you are not can be thinking any more sinthing with surfing you go surfing and you you catch a wave em in you'r you are not thinking about oh i need to put my balance over youre now it is happening in you are having good time i would say that restoration for me comes from those two things for sure andthenyouhvming my my wife and my kids when i get home in enent my kids are older now and there out of the house except for one a and what when i was in the navy when they were young i went around it all there was not any we would rarely have dinner together cause i was gone coming homelay you are working all the time you can never e get all your work done i'm training you get to it was we we rarely eat dinner as a family when i was in the in the teams and now when when i'm home and we can eat together for sure my my daughter that is still at home she is going we st out there and yeat dinner and talk about just normal things that people talk about how to conduct a night ambe ashore nolet us talk about normen normal daily things and and what is going on and you kow my daughter that is she is thirteen right now than she she talks me about ll konsstov and it is alsome ii'm definly enjoying that aspect of be n around more then i was when i was in the teams and i just we did not have toher we did not happen i would take my kits you gitso i tod yoge to classes when i could when i was in the teams a would dou work outs with them in the morning if i had time on the week ends for sure stuff that with my kids that is kind of what i did but now ye i we mmy wife is awsome and she is a great cook now because when we first got married it is questionable i just as harassing her about this the other day it she she got she is an unbelevable cook now and it is alsome and when we first met to by her own admission she will tell you she was not i ge she from england right and there is not cooking what were and and i hood over there at least when i was grown up in the few times i made over there that the food was pretty dreadful a in thit u there were some exceptions to that but and they drank a lot over there youi've been to some scientific meetings over there wit they would start with sherry in the afternoon and and beer after work it was outrageous man the amount of alcaul and take was just absurd ye sorry brits ait is my unten't get on uchi i did not eiso an alcaw lout you were angry that of a sogas basy said once you get past two drinks a week you'r strting ahead into territory that is an and to pleat your health see got you lot of other things office a they drink a lot ye the brits drink a lot i i've spent time over there with my father in law my brother in law and and we defini'lly drank al lot i'm glad i do not live there a d had to drink wuti do not have to drink with all the time i'd probably be dead you were straight adge grown up right ye ame welas it when iwas a kid and then when i join the navy i i started drinkand that is part of the culture that i bought into and you do not likei wanted to be a good seal and i'm looking around at the guises that were con sidered good seals oh were drinking iofol ge that is what that is wa were doing and that is what i did iu feel i i think my a mi looking back now i did not really i did not think of it is a big geal at the time i was not well first of all even when iwas grown up and i was did not drink and did not smoke did not do drugs i i was not a guy put an axt on my hand although my friends and i we we all did not drink in smokes we deafily look i was listend a miner frat when i'as a car mails i i get it but i was not af go running around telling every one i was straight ead but i was on that path for sure andthe when i got in the seal teams s i ol hav this this is a different culture i'll not use to ad i didn' really even and reallyeven understand what drinking was i mean i never i never had been drunk gon the heall teamsas look i will not you ol once i turn twenty one li ke wit thi i these guises were in a have fon and i cond of just ok coi that is what we are doing a and then i drank a ton walls in sel tams and thand as i ben i the i retired from the se ams and when out we basically wint it every bar that we would normally go to iyou as seals i think we closed out the night at the pack shores no be and when when when home that morning or woke up the next morning work dow and then i just kindost stop drinking because and and now i just deaf i be now i just do not really drink any more oh that is that yet when ti have my lav in sandiego for five years ats for my lap started i deafly saw o team guis in bars you ges we come come in and take over why these were take literal take over you you basely i would not leave cause i would not give them the satisfaction or meithe the disatisfaction but it is all frostrating you are in there your haven decent time and then just ists enormous packatean gises comes ins or i may be sound close out the night sometimes i've friends with enough of em that but yo if you are not really a part of you are not really a part of it i always knew that and understood that one thing that i think really comes through now especially but throughout our discussion and all the things i've seen of you and it gets me back to this thing that came up a the beginning i'd really to re turn to is that you seem to have a very strong sense of contect and self i to say it i'm not a psychologist em i here to play one but what you just described was that oce in one contaect t made sense to be straight edge you mention minor througat great band straight edge band but when it came time to youn you run around with your friends then and it made sense to be without a'lcall or drugs are anthng at that stage and than you get into another contact it is oqe i can do this i can drink and still perform well and do all things that need to do and thn when that close is out i'mine i when to do something else and some people are that because they are kind of a camelion right they they are switching themselves depending on the contact than they are kind of getting accents when there in one location or another but that is not you it all i get i can tell with with certainty that is not you ad all that there seems to be a very strong sense of self that when we have a sense of self that is firm we can go into different contact we can even change our behavior but we do not lose who we are which means we can always re turn to that the image of my mine is i i've done an elubitous cupidiving not a lot but they are during some of the more advance training for osside this was not seal training it of course was ean a following a line in the dark a night dive n you are falling a line and sone as you are navigating with tools but something you are following a line under water and this idea that you can let go ot that line but yt you remember wher it is yin can re turn to it that is cond of how i imagine the sense of self because in different contects most healthy people modify themselves a little bit we act differently at a wedding or a fu neral than we do in class or withaut with our friends of course important part of being a human function of human seems to me that from a pretty early stage you had pretty good sense of self now i do not know if you sit in your room and meditate on who is jocka willincon touch that that that central corrd of self i'm guessing you do not but as i say this i have to ask was there something in your up bringing your parents or or was it just kind of how you always magine yourself as ye this is who i am no matter what happens around me i kind of know who i am even if i'm engaging in some of the behaviors that i mightnot do in another contently i know who i am cause i actually think that many people do not have a very firm sense of self or ther sense of self is rigid that they can only operate in this narrow trench of one domain of life and they and a very very isolated i'd looke for you to cant a share with us what your recollections are a cound the first time you realized i'm ni yel i'm good in a bunch o ifferent places i'm safe for i'm whatever cause i things is also relates to confidence i'm glad you are giving me the benefit the doubt on going in the teams and and bein a man looks go to drink in and i have not really drank before and seems these goes er have not a good time wit to have o god time with these guies and that is kind of what i did right am as far as and i look at it now and unfortunately for me i look at alcohol now as just i've seen i've seen it destroy many people that i've now kind of look at in go man i do not i do not think people should drink u and look i get it i'm i'm kind example ic i used to drink and go i't have a good time ad it was not at ping of deal to negatively impack me in some dramatic way but i have many friends that it is horrible for it is all but ruined their lives and it is totally legal which is kind of bazaar am i think that figuring that out when i look back in it and the colture in the seal teams was feiry there was very alcohol centric and part of that is because iun all that you got it just a fraternity is alcohol centric or a or a a football team is ow could you get a munch of young dude that ar goit to drink and have a good time it just sort of a a young dofd kind of thing and unfortunately iit ends up ruining a lot of people's lives and they make bad decisions in to do stupid things and it is not good and i think the cultures moving away from that a little bitines seal teams you knon't mi my alcohol brief used to say u nicely to tell my gis if you go out you guld o do i you get put in jail for a figt you get hurt because you are doing something drunk you just did alkitis job for them you just did alkottas it they want to take you off the battle field and you just took yourself off about fwil you cannot gont appoyment now and ad that would always hit guis nd i think that that is the seal teams kind of leaning in that direction more realizing the negative negativity of alcohol i wish i would have realize that earlier i wish i would ave be a better leader and recognize that an earlier stage and recognize that just because i was kind of getting away with it meaning it did not really i did not did not wake up tie one of o thatter can wecd get tr i never i never y had that feeling i wish i wouldnat realize that there is other guise it do and there is people that can operate and be functional and it does not beally im pack their lives but the is lot people it do not and i do not think it' work the dice roll to to start drinking i do not think it is worth the det's what what he get out of it i think that over all that is why if you when i think about alcohleges think about all the all the all the lives that it is ruined nd i do not it and i wish i would have done a better job of saying what this probably not good and we should not do this and unforcing i did not and i trying convey that message as much as i can now and it did bring me back to my roots because when i was a kid it was alcohol is weak and you look at these guis they they do not know what they are doing they are acting idiots i'm not going to be that and as i got older once i got al the siltimes i kind of went back to that a as far as kind of wear i became me i i just actually have to kind on give a lot of credit to the music that i grew up listening to and the attitude that we had back then listening to hardcorn music being able to stand up against what other people were saying which is what you are doing when you are in that scene and the whole di wy nature of it hey we weaknes do this ourselves wekjust make this happen for ourselves we do not need any we do not need anybody else we can do this and that hard cor attitude an sticking by your friends and standing up and gettin fighting that iswhat you are ging to do that is kind of my attitude and i got interviewed for a documentary that they are making about hardly flant again and and the cromags and when when i was a kid and actilly through my whole life that was that that music is the sound track of my life and i always would have that music running in my head but to your question i had something in me that when i heard that music for the first time i was ulka that her it is you do not hear it is this is i hear the beadles i hear the grateful dead i hear the rolling stones i hear the whoever and you go oki hit is fime but when i heard hardcorn music for the first time when i heard the crow mags i heard o nostic from i heard a bad brains i thought it was that was just it was part of me already and then it was the attitude and andagan you can listen tof my podcas with harly fland again the way i've yewed harly flanting in the way i've viewed the crow mags was not the way they actually work i' bean you do harly was doing drugs i' me horrible drugs use on hairn everything else but his image was was straight edged kind of spirits will they had all that stuff going on and i thought o kable that is without i hdid not kno i mike a kid living in the woods and connecticut i i've just can hearing what i'm hearing he listen to the lyrics listen toe lyrics of miner threat listen to lyrics and you ok thi stuff i agree with the stuff and i i just think that that kind of kind of set my my knd of said a dat in my head of being o k with being outside being o k with saying no being o k with being rebel being o k with not going along with what every one else is doing and that kame thi became very important when i was in the military and i looked it what leadership might be telling me to do and might think myself hay that does nothing a good idea and having the the werewith all to say hayboss on not show this a god idea not to be a jerk about it but just to say there might be a better way to get the stone would you think of this or haboss can ask you a question about that i i think if i had to trace it back having black flag my war side too on my record player for a year and a half straight that is goin to lev e mark and i think it left the mark on me i love what you just said and when i say love i really mean it because as we both know we share a common love for sertain music in particular minor threatans sone stuff from the punkok seeng in particular for me the north east punkcrok seeing the bruisers y i'll barr from the bruisers now people knowm as the least in for the droptic murfhys we cor that is the brews and we we we run the risk of going deep down a rabit hull of of music that most people mayre may not be familiar with tethough must people hear the drop cakes but i'm right there with you i mean i remember the first time hearing stiff lo fingers or rancid and eveen bauncing souls i for new jers not even bauncing sorry sir it is arry behind i gregg no thel ballancing souls an going yes that that is me that is it kbut as you said it was already kind of in you it is a recognition and i bring this up and i want a high light itn not because we share this although i do find that to be an amazing kinship that we felt right away and was we probly riff for twenty five hours just on that but it brings him back this idea that certainly is not my idea i shu the first time i heard about it was from robert green who wrote the book mastery and i'm some important writings i very what was it i think it wasly forget how many laws of power but those books rober be mastery's actuly a book that i highl y recommend people read because it talks about mentorship in finding mentors an the fact that were supposed to break up and move on from mentors and that mentors are not always people that we know or that know us et cetera amazing book really a but he was the first person i ever heard describe this idea that if we think back long enough there is some seed moment it was shopping for the pants tat something it was but also music where you see something an it s yes that is me and i'm nat and then that becomes a sort of sound track or visual image or something for your life that you carry for it with you the nurrow scientists and me wants to say that that is the first time that we really tap in to this dopamine system in a way that is unique to us because every child response to food with a lowl bit of do not beman when we are hungry response to warmth when we are cold response to at warm a dry diper after we just wet ourselves which we all did i not maybe jocka you change your own dipers ah but i'm guessing it soe one change your diver at one point not an image path we need o go down but the ideas that we all have these universal sources of kind of having our needs met going from discomfort to comfort and back again which is basically childhood but at some point something comes along that we really feel as unique to us and it maybe the thing that everyone else likes maybe it is top forty or whatever it is maybe 's the shoe that everyone is wearing and it that seems good but i do think that there are certain people who are kind of ten or twenty or mabe even a hundred n eighty degrees off from what everyone else likes in the that thing is what is really cool and it is a felt thing and along the lines of felt things as oppose to things that every one values what are your sources of motivation and i'm going to guess that some of them are internal we coul point ahead or we could point o heart does not really matter but when you think of sources of motivation do you have a palate of them that you can dip in to do you even feel the need to dip into them or as it really just all about action steps throughout your day or if i can even venture unto t the somewhat harder stories that i've heard you talk about you sometimes think back and it listen omin a do this because your bunch a guies that or dead now that cannot and somemon to do it because i can what are your what are the paints on your motivation palite if you will well you pro you probably heard me sar that mot motivation is not something that i am going to count on because it is just an a motion that is can ta common go and it is just feeling happy you feel happier ant now maybefeel happy in fifty minutes you feel sad now maybe feel havn fifty minutes feel motive ader right now you might not feel motivating fifty minutes therefore i cannot rely on it i'm not going to put any n icin put any money on just being motivated because it does not really matter to me the daily actions that i take are not from motivation there they are just from discipline leke i said earlier ire not gong to get up and go through some big debate about well relash you i really feel doing this now i do not feel doing but his matter somps can to go do it now if we start to look at sort of a broader movement through life and continuing to try and move forward and move on a my budy seff died and he was tha dealt u po tune commander in tasking to bruiser and he he died in two thousand seventeen and he was an a parishut accident and it was it was i mean it is deafily unexpected a and an also he would already been through multiple deployments a was with with us with me in the battle or mody he then went back in osotter city in and led a ton of very dangerous operations and then he did other deployments and was kind of done with his deployments con a done and now he is just talking about when he is gin a retire and he is a couple years away from retirement and i'm talking about pay working to work together again and it all seems we are on a prettygood path to just move forward and then he ends up dying in in a ina parashute acconn and he is a guy that was really just kind at youyoyou are not going to be able to replace and he a any you kee cannot there is a uniqueness to him that is you are not gan tifind and au ni've got some stuff that he wrote he was an incredible writer and i'll tryin write something him i cannot we cannot do it cause he had a bigger vocabulary and a more articulate way of writing and i cannot write anything as well as he wrote he was incredible at guitar he played guitar played you calaily sick an incredible at playing guitar and he is a total knuckle dragger a total meet head knuckle dragger his nickname was unfrozen cave man because he just he just a you kno look a big cave man and yet he spoke french and could recite french poetry and was really good at learning languages and he was an artist and he had you what sensenesigia is that is emerging of the sen siscipe we they can see colors and he did not know what it was other i see colors out most people can see colors i sorry that can hear colors and and can associate particular colors with soundly i pertular keys on the piano it is it su it is pretty rare yet somepeople think they have it but true sin as thegics ar pretty rare but they do not have to fighte for this traite ajus kind of emerges for them he did not know it but one day he was tanking me and he was embarrassed to tell me he is wit is weirdess ou when i when i think of numbers i i have colors in my head and and i go whatd yeu mean hn' he says hollow was zero and i remember seven is yellow do notremember any other but he he just rattled off one to three for fives or seven eight nine you kow he says hollow white clear all o e kno just rattled off these colors he had this this he had that sencetion and it gave him some kind of weird ability to memorize numbers he would being a bar and talk to some girl and he saiy what your number and he would just neve know it for two years he would just know it and that also made him incredibly good at playing gitar because now the scale and the fret board of a cuitar as this it is a mathematical thing that he has all in this weird this weird coloration scenario going on there is he is this guy and an and very a very emotional guy a very emotional guy who would i was talking earlier about being a balance for some one i had to balance this dudou on a daily base is sometimes he would be mad about something you one one day i hate the teams i a always guyse and id say in i'd get a man and the next day ile never getting out of the tean now he he would oscillate that that and i would tell him hay your haybro you'r oscillating again and just w would do anything and he and he loved his guyse and would do anything for his guyse and when he guied where i whereat is wereat is it is not as funeral it is before the funeral woulds the yem the open casket thing the wake thing and myself his brother alec lafe bab in who i wrote exstreem ownership with in jpy to know who is one my brothers who who works with us at as on front hours with us in remodiand was very close to sath an and weir every one kind of cleared out for us and we we go in there and i think j p gave him j p had one oose memorial bracelets with guy's names on it that it died in j p a gave that to him and think lafe gave him some sirf waxcaus also south was a was a surfer and and i gave sa his black belt cause he start a train to dister with me and he had he had his purple belt he would gotin his purple belt i gave his black belt and im and every one just quiet and you knowt j j p was telling ta story the other day im and and i just said we will not fail him meaning that him mark miky cris saf and countless all their guises they it they are not here they do not have the opportunity the things we do they do not have they winl'l have the opportunity get up in the morning that is what it is maam i will not fail tos gas thanks for sharein that im ye hink ot anyone less in this feels what i feel right now which is it is very clear that the the depth of emotion for people that we care about and lose is has everything to do with our love for them there is just no question about it it the grief and love are and intsimately tied theyv there direct reflection of one another and i you knot i hesitate to got a stay on hard themes but i think it is really important m for a couple of reasons last time we spoke whit was in your office and im your podcast and after we wrapped ut whwe started talking about some people we know and somethings that had happened in your community and cont as spooled into some discussions about things thad happened and nearby communities and civilian culture and one of the things that perplexing i think to people i including me but maybe with time less and t at this ition came up last night in discussion i'm at home cause of some recent events not close tomme but shis that y some people go through things where there is loss they go through life in there is hardship it must people experinc some hardship certainly some more than others and every one's in a while and far too often and even in the sealtin community and even in the varies communies within the sealting community where one would never expect it mit these a highly train tight community hard guides right that is the language some we sometimes here but as you pointed out theyusr people often th have tremendous emotional depth and i'm glad t you brought that op cause i think we ah he sometimes think of his motion as weakness but you are there was a time not long ago forty fifty years ago where emotions jealousy and intense he think the character sunny and the godfather heu will get piste you fary it on fist right thas pretty emotional response where intensity an emotion were kind of interchangeable words right at some level com to be direct there've been eyes come out the seal tams iv been surprised to hear they kill themselves and yesterday there was a major suicide i did not know this sgyde and presume weas he followed each other on socian meou but t i admittedly was not close to him to know him dof know him at all in fact thes name was twitch or something in use the sky was a yous a a public facing figure but listen happens all too often and it even happens in former operators and suicide something that fascinates me and intrigues me and scares the hell out of me because for the life of me i cannot mapit to any specific thing in the brain or body that were aware of and yet my i've had several friends committ suicide had undergrativise her cmmited suicide the point is not them were theire story the point is what in the world dictates whether or not somebody who has a community who is doing well and then less well thesides to off themselves to end their own life verses decide i'm an a keep going and this is i'm raisingis o the question i wish i hadn'nt answer i you tohave ideas oh it is time perception whet these people are misefeeling miserable that they feels kan to go on forever but then you start reading the literature on suicide i've start to go into this it for those aor you that can stomach it and i do not know that i want to recommend this movyn but i'm juscin to say it exists they movin the bridge where they fixe the camera on the going gate bridge for a year turns out one person a day on average tries to jump off the talk to a goid who survived it by the way he jumped off the moment he went off there he have thought i wish i had not done that he survived his kid with by poler by puller disorder specially mails twenty to thirty times higher incidences suicide massiv yincrease the point is that there' something that happens in the brain where' somehow people also will get the idea and you hear this that this is something they are excited to do where that they are going to right the world somehow by doing this or that somehow it is a gift to themselves again i'm not encouraging anybody do this ownry very clear but these are the things that you hear and sadly your community has lost a number of people through suicide and yet they are lot ag guiyes that thrive and more as a templet for trying to understand mental health and depression in suiside what are your thoughts on why some people seem to thrive and some people just go all he way down clearly there is athat is a very complex question and there is probably a lot of different answers in i certainly am not one to be able to answer that question however u probably where my where my thought has gone on this lately because enof i've known some guys tit've killed themselves and i've beend totally shocked but and just been talket completely in tolly shocked that guys that i knew killed himselves guys that y you would think of this guy would would never do this a millionears and that is the feeling i've had a lot about a lot of the guys that i know that have killed hmselves i had aa woman on my podcast name sara wilkinson and she is an awsome woman and she was married to a seal his name was chad i did not know im he killed himself he and and to hear her describe the storie thut the shocking thing about the story is that the guy that she knew n the guy that she married was not the same guy that killed himself something happened to him that made him a different person and look the're they are getting all this information now about c t and the the the brain trama that you go through and people or exposed to that and i think if you have ever seen you george forman he seems tolaly normalinga to go right and mahamanaly not much and i've i've known fighters and you can look at any number of boxers that have had a career and some of them are fine and some of them have some real significant what is a pugilistic there is is pugilistic centril right they have they have been punche too much and have problems different people you can expose different people to blast blast in pact and is can have a different in pact over time and i think that again to hear sara explain that story and what she saw from her husband and how different he was when they got married compared to where they ended up it is tolly different it istolly different person im had another a friend of mine on who na marks copone and his wife came on with em and she said the same thing the guy that she married was not the same guy that was ready to killhimseffin and he did not thankfully if it was a different person and it is not look if that get yo fred is married to some woman and fred an jessi ca grow apart over tuime an and he ands up with some other girl it is still the same guy right is still the same guy that is now tat they grew apart they are gettin teforest we get it but the way that both of them describe their husbands as being different people it that is what is stuck with me more than anything else i again i'm i'm throwing this out there only because it is what i've observed through the people that i knowt and and seeing and hearing those stories of people being totally different and and i've known a few people wone my friends dave killed himself a never i never would a guess n millionears that dave would kill himself it just it does not compute it does not compute and my suspicion is there has to be something going on mechanically or camically with the brain that causes them to get into a mode were tthey are depressmt do not see a way out and that is the way they feel now and again what is what is interesting about this as we aren to talked about the fact that the selection the selection process weed's out guys that a're going to take a loss and not be able to get get up aain no you have got seals steals can take a loss and get back up again that is what you learn how to doin bit r that is what you you'n't learn how to do you you have it anif you make it though that training you have that ability to take a lss are i cool shake it off get back up keep going they are going to do that you now you have got gus that are taking a loss ney do not see away out any more in fact to such a point that they'e ging to take their own lives it is o i my suspicion isnat some point the'reging to figure out that that this exposure to exyou know to the adrenalin the explose explosions all the time and meand you go out to arrange just just in in peace time you got to arrange and you shoot to karl gostofv and you are arrange safety officers you go out there with every guy that shootin a kargustoff to big giant bazoka looking weapon and every time you shoot it kind of rattles your cage a little bit wolf you are a range safety officer and you are out there and youre gin to watch every one in the platune shoot three of those it is con to have impact then you go rseas and you are breecure or you are part of a breech team i'min ot a time whe're one of my guys wheat we are we are doing an assault on a compound i'm on the ladder most buildings in a rack have a wall around em the way we would c nduck these rates put the ladder up you the assault the breach team would climb over the ladder and i would go right behind the breach team and i would stand on the ladder i'm looking at the building observing making sor thres no one waking up makes there is no threats and then as i'm watching this guy in particular he puts the breach on the door explosive breach he is gon a below the door up he is got his little team with him he he puts the breach on the door he starts to back away and thre's an obstacle are was a frecan table or a long chair something he could not get around it homs at it is dark mme it is the middle the night's two ofclock in the morning and i'm all one whr e's goin to do a seem kind of stuck for a second and i just ehim lay down and i'm oh he is he is going to take this thing and sure enough three or four feet away from this breach point he lays down and just clacks off this explosive charge and i jump over wall and as i'm going in i tunip you do not get the rest of pletune to goin commence us assault i look at him he is y you look he just got hiddn't had of the baseball bat in guess what he did the next night another breach on another target guess we do the next night another breach on another target you get guise that have that exposure which is i mean every seals eating a breach i ma't you are eatin flash bangs you are eating breaches you are shooting fifty cows you are you are you are eatin some some tromatic brain injury but then you you must have some people that have some sort of genetic a propensity to have this negative thing happen and and i i can only guess man that this has something to do with it because otherwise we would not be herein many of these stories and nd of course we are just talking about the seol things we are not talking about the military rit large which is in the same exact boat i'm also nervous about the social contagion of suicide within the veteran community i i'm nervous about that it is one of the things it makes me apprehensive about talking about it but i obviously oug talkd about a had people on my poncast to discuss these things but i i am worried about that social contagion of man fred didn it he got all this attention and he does't have to deal with anything any more i'm going to do it too there is got to be some level of that going on as well it is it is it is a horrible situation yet the social contagion pires one that hits home from a different dimension the high school i went to which is name isnan important by gun high schogu an n gun high school is famous for being one of the better public high schools not that i attended as much as i should of i tell you more about the curbs in the parking lot that i could tell you but the classes i took and that is just not incurging people to not attend highschool please do it took a lot of really hard work to climb back up to where i should have been when i graduate but e has an infamous repretate reputation i say a reputation as an infamous school because it is one of the high suicide rates i any the schools in the country because there is a train tracks that run through town and that bthere was a kind of a contagien of cuses thrown themselves on the train tracks this was happening a lot this as written up in verious newspapers at cetera fortunately t seems to have die down again i'm also hesitata i talk about this because no one wants to spark this but there does seem to be something about lack of ability to see into a future obviously or the future that people evre seeing into is dark that somehow they lose touch with the idea that emotions come and go you seit it about emotion about motivation hemotions comind go but some hout people lose touch with that and then i i will venture a guess and here i'm hoping someone to in a figure the soud at some point s we can have a more concrete conversation about the mechanisms and what to do about it but i think there is also something about identity about loss of a place to put one's energy iu some something useful in the world an ot if you are genera you wor you are talking bout here aguises that that are generators right they are not projectors they are generators they they live to have it affective action on the world for good and then and o killing themselves in youth it is a lotle more complicated to put put a finger on caus what what is going on there we assume depression but then in learning more about suicide there is also this kind of excitement of for certain people about solving something that seemed unsolvable any other way and again i'm not certainly not encouraging this a strongly discouraging people from taking their own life obviously but something about time in the loss of perception about time and one thing that we know for sure here we can really hang our hat on something is that if you do the ferenzics on somebody that was suicideall attempted or took their life in the preceding days and weeks the're sleep wake schedule was completely wacked they they exit the normal routine of most people they isolate through inversions of time and i do wonder sometimes whethere not the vampireshifs as there sometimes call the night time employments and the back and forthhemand that is a lot for a systemty a na shift workers kill themselves far more than on shift workers i'm i do think there is something there and again i'm not saying everyone eeds to be in bed by nine and up by fore and no although that would be a great schedule for most people but i do think that there are some universal laws of what makes the human body and brain healthy and if you violate those laws long enough we see to er with desruption in your scheduls you run the risk especial if there is a predisposition there and then other factors start to layer in ayet i i and i ought have to apologize cause i do not have any real answers or more biology or psychology to firmly throw out this except the the warning for people who were bypoler and know somebody with bypoler they are twenty to thirty times more likely to kill themselfs and mails and particular more likely to use i methods that will kill them the first time as suppose to survive there is a big a sex difference thir the theyou throw alkoholl ind their too im you kno a and markes has run in organization now where they are taking they are takin fats down to do the psychodelic im wit a cal a journey your tat this is better in selitions yet i i there a great organization ye and i should men to very by partis an organization i went attenden one event at on cornado and they were people from the far left the far right politicions and everythng in between talking about how critical this is there is not a political issuss a is a mental health is you ye and even when i reflected on markas talking to me you was talking about how ye's kind of in this downward spiral pardf lhy downward spital he is drinking everyday and u'm thinking myself man i did not think of it during the show i kind was thinking about it afterwards how is thinking man you drink if yofr drinking all the time you are on a downward spiral that is one thing you should just stop let us stop that immediately i just wanted to throw that alt than i i think when we that is another sign from the outside looking in if some one's self medicating with alcohol it is it' it is not a good place not a good place they are not a good place in tha they could probaly ou some holp i appreciate you saying it again we did this episode on alcal i went into totally open minded i'v never been a big drinker i've had i can drink or not drink was never really into drugs at all you have dable a li bit when i was younger ever grat it frankly brain is plastic early on i did not need that never did hard drugs never touched coqane and fe ameanor anything that im and if i had i would say right i an comfortable enough in my position life that if i had i'd certainly say but i think that it is pretty clear that alcalls bad for us a certainly passe a certain your to drink week limit people specialy w that propensity for alcallism or who are dealing with other issues that is especially that case for not drinking i and i guess that we got into some a hard territory here but i i think if this conversation chuse up in awariness to anybody which i hope it would im either people that are in that space of wondering if they should continue or not or that know somebody who might be i do think that the takeaway is very clear which is that there are ways to avoid these traps and to avoid making these traps worse and i think we regular sly wakes scaduals understanding that and i wrote this down that you have particular have said several times thy rather than looking for sources of things outside you a job or relationsbut which are all great but as sources of energy your motivation or inspiration to use action as positive action as a source of energy i think is it just a if i would ik coud put that up on a bill board in time square i would right and i put your name next to it which is that action is a positive action is a source of energy that then you can recycle into more things i think ye going back to the fundamentals i ye an and positive action is when you have to contend with something when there is something that you are afraid of right step into it move towards it that that is how you are in ta solve that prom you do not you do not solve problems by running away from them you solve them by moving towards them and figure not what is going on and and i me ow caulse obviously a clear way to avoid the problem at least for the next four hours and you wake up in that promise still there and that is not that is not good but yen we have got u some kind of a problem and listen then we caun get go down the whole path of talking about the indirect approach which is a theory of combat which i completely believe in but it also applies to you interacting with other people if you have a problem with some other person to think mister plaggot i do not prom of t andreom to go confront him on it and that might not be the besolution in fact it is probably not the bessolution for me to go confront you with the probicaus now e can have a confontation it might be better for me to take an indirect approach and not confront you but insaid engage in conversation with you about something that is may be adjacent to the problem that i have and then eventually that builds our relationship to a point where you start to recognize oh i bet jockl feels something about this thing and we can move towards a solution instead of me trying to punch you in the face with some truth that i believe first the truth that you believe now we are engaging combat and that is bat theres can to be cafiuleties i'd rather take an indirect approach and build a relationship where we can solve problems in a more positive way love that and i love it because really speaks to the power of thinking carefully and being patient an a lil bit slower at times i also heard you say something earlier that still flagging in my mind which is not thinking too much think seems to be a time where thinking too much is very dangerous and again we can keep the discussion that we are having about mental health or can even just call what is mental illness i think everyone would agrees suicide is some reflection of an unhealthy state we can keep that in the bashop as we talk abyu this but this is not neserely only about that you seem tohave an ability to yoengage in things without thinking too much and yet also to sit back and be pretty a observant and you have talk about third personing of the celf i'd love to talk a lo bit more about this even thogh it is a topic you delve in to before and in particular the topic of meditation i've been reading more about meditation i've meditated for different stretches my life different mounts of time and they are too basic forms of meditation that i only recently learned about one is a focuse attention meditation your sitting closingyou eyes focsing on your breath body body surface or even a visual target in your environment and just focus and we know that that enhances one's ability to focus you do too late in the day it also enhance your ability to not fall asleep i wit lop you'l do not realize the meditation too late in the day if it is a focused meditation you are just ramping up the activity in the prefrontal quartex it is a gre tool for an getting better it focusing but then there is also this type of meditation called open observer meditation were you purposely do not include a target in your mind or in your vision or in your hearing and you just sit there eyes closed your eyes open and you go into a place of whatever comes up whbut you do not hover there too long the goal is to not hover on any one thing which sounds deliberate attention defas it disorder but it is at shy a pretty cool method it turns out for restoring our ability to engage in focus but also for one particular thing that you mentioned ourlier whiches creativity in creative problem solving which of course requires accessing was you say more colors on the palate than your vision might be on realizing others alsoall these other colors over here in the parifery that i'm missing to the hiper focus do you meditate if you do meditate is it more of an open monitering or a focused meditation and if you do not do it kind of standard meditation are there times throughout your day and your routine and your week where as i'm describing in this it maps to something that con of feels open monitering or focused meditation yes or no i do not meditate i haven ever i do not think i've ever actually meditated for one second in my life and i and i refuse to e if not that at all i do i sam harris sent me is ap and he and we are going to upon cast is i'v do i'll do it for two weeks and wi'll do upon castan and i'll be more enlightened ind everything and i didnt even give sa hrris to weeks you no i still oh sam harris two weeks on his ap of meditation we can see how it impacts me but no i i've never done it before i've never tried to do it and that being said if the goal is to take a step back and detach from what is going on i do that all day every day theo that is that is something that i've talked about it something i tried to teach you i tried to teach the young seal leaders not to get caught up and what is happening right in front of that but to take a step back detachd from the situation detached from their emotions see more of what is happe you you you are talking about seeing more colors of the palate well on the battle field i want people to be able to see more ankles more maneuvers more opportunities more of what the enemy might do more perspective that is what that is what i always tried to achieve and i i'm sorry i apologize i cannot give you any good discussion on meditation cause i have not have not tried it no apology necessary but i will ask when you go surfing you are sitting in the water waiting for a wave are you focust on one particular cation on the horizon or you cut of incune of i a open monering just enjoying just bouncing up and down in the water where is your attention juring activities that ye surfing oftentimes surfing you you you your monkey mind than youre jost not thinking about anything samething with you did to also with surfing yunin for waiting for a wa 've you are you are your mind is just going i mean it is it is in another universe sometimes as you are sitting there waiting cause you are just looking out at the horizon and your you'r mind me my mind i'm think at bom all kinds i i i've to come i've to come home sometimes in mike write notes because i thought of this i thought of an idea iv thouht of a prorspective that happens to be a trudict through that happens to be s talking to people were i some one's talking about something of mike iggn an idea writ i rret that down have to go and write it down i've i have notes in my phone pages in pages and pages of notes in my phone of ideas that i had and i righte him now you voice memo things oo i typeem i ii only need t a type seven words on on and then i have the whole ideas in my had ii put a lot into the notes in my phone as well and it e prody looks gibberish to a lov he wutd i i go back throughim when him on the plain specially problems i was challenged with ten years ago or something n i look i own i'msteal with the same thing difference an same same me right you there is that we had a a amazing psychiatrist on the sho i but i'd loved it to hear a conversation between the twou the two of you his name is a paulcontis trained ot stamford and harvor's a mazing i i shal talks openly about the the tragy that his brother killed himself which was what drove him into psychiatry and he is interesting ui because he is obviousy highly educated incredibly smart you wrote a book on trama but he has incredible knowledge about a number of other areas of psychology including narcisism socio pathhe he is works in a lot of really interesting domains with interesting people that everyone listing on is pacas would recognize of course he is not in reveal who those people are but and he talks about the fact that you can look at different people bit he was ictaly the one that shared with me this notion of generators and and i'm projectors and directi me towards that literature but when he him on the pocasy you kno he talked a lo bit about that is tut what he talke mostly about trama but then we are tling about ways in which people engage in the world and different archetypes and how you start looking at stories throughout historyand you truscing the same themes over and over right i'm westerns this idea a gui rise in to town and does some repair work defeats the sinister person or things that are imposing on the tin that rides to the next town it is always an ends with tha it is a going to keep continuing in the but then we got to this discussion of relationship he talks about he said this on the podcasts of a patient who said i've i been in ten abusive relationships and he would say to that patient know you have been in one relationship ten times right which is essentially it is all about yourish you right that is i'm not you i'm not pervosely did not point at you for those listening and i think that those features of ourselves that we bring from condition o condition can be negative or that can be pause ive one thing that is interesting and i here i'm not trying to solve a or understand the sealteam community per say but i think they represent an important archetype because they are selected for this ability to take a hard conditions and a failures and turn them into winds that is one of the selection cried teria seems seems to be they are finding who has that capability i see a lot of and happen to know if you people from the seal teams to get out and do really well melly great business is youre shining example this and they have a family and you a got german sheperd to ye we will talk about animals and lobt a dog is you serve and you train and i'm sure you have your dark places dark moments and challenges anybody else but things look to me the'r going pretty well and then i also know people in the se from the seal teams oket they do not go down the path of suicide fortunately but it sort they do not do as well as i would have thought and i'm certainly not picking on this community i also see this from people were professional athletes i know kits it we are phenominal in high school i me these were early admission all the ivile schools cause that was what happen in the town that i grew up in and i look at them nown on whow ih it did not somehow it is not working out and i think it is importnt for people to hear that that yes winning creates the propensity for more winning tthen why do you think it is that in a community where people are trained to solve proms adapt and make things work some people flourish outside the military and some flourish lass and some we already talked about really go down that the dark traps what what do you think it is the quality that allows people to be really adaptable in particular cause most of us live in a landscape where we have to deal with people who are not us people that are not good it what we are good at and sometimes that is an ouset sometimes it is not you seem to be particularly good it understanding the human animal and working with that again this is a broad question we are going very broad band here an we will get narrower and again in ia bit but id love your thoughts on why is it how is it what determines whether or not somebody thrives in novel environments i have to start off ut just by saying i wrote a now as you are talking i just put seal and then i put the not equals sign cause you cannot say that a seal equals anything by excellent point it is i mean there is guise there is guies theat have been n the seal thimes that are are murderers there is real murder murders i rapis and murderers that went through seal training rapous murders and their imprison for rester lives that that is of thing there is people that have ben i the seal teams that ive got kick out of seal teams for drugs and i mean you you name it and we have got thand we have got got that are just lazy if we got guise that it just nphysicians you could say this about physicians the're been sociopathic am i serial killer physicians and then they are ones that are in therwrl countries right now that would would not accept at a billion dollars to stop serving people at the level of the basic medicine that they deserve there is the fy others there is the seals that get out and just volunteer to go help in the worst places in the world yofve got a full spectrum of people to say a seal equals success ain' any domain the only do main you can say that they are successful as they make it through basic el turncause guyse make it though basic seu'l tain an the're not good seals that happens you get guys that make it through basic seal training and they make it through seal qualification training and tmhey make it to a sealtam and bay get kicke out of the seltings cause they are not good seals they wan't meant to do that job that happens all they have provin by makingit through basic heal training as they can kind of sock it up for a while and there is also guise that make it through basic seal training cause they learned how to maneuver through the system they learn what to do in what the minimal requirements wearn how they could scape thoughthis there is guise that it is it is not a huge number but they are absolutely there we see them in science people that go to a lab figure out who the director of the lab is at the level of psychology and this is ashal on of the more dangerous aspects of science it ashaly negatively impacks all of society i'll just say it and tany scientistwill know what i'm talking about they find the big famous labs they figure out who that leader of te lab is and they get that person the data they want they might not make the data up but they will certainly discard the data that do not fit by that which is one way of making data up by exclusion right it is not literaly painting pictures of cells that are not their something but that appens a lot and those people often go far they rarely go all the way because pretty soon theyr reputation expans to the point where people go ye i knowone can repeat that rs all that but these people sit in very high positions not at stamford right i will say i do not knonw any on my collegues at stamford t that meet that o those criteria but you see them and you see what they are doing and they'r basely solving a social engineering thing they just happen to be doing it in science now why anyone would do that in science i do not know these you do not get rich in science he certainly they get famous but for whatever ison they figured it out that is where they areging to do it ani'm sursy and law firms i'msure you see in every single them may he r now you pointed out that there is some people that make it to the ivy league schools tey graduate from ivy leagu schomen they do not do well and to me that is h very similar to some one that might make it o the seal teams do well te seal teams and then they get out they do not do well it is probably cause what i talk about earlier whene when i want to navy bool camp here is what youre got to do if you do it well you will be rewarded well if you are in high school in your dad your mommindad say hey yif yu do good in high school you are gng to get into this ivy league school an you get in atout ivy leage sch here iswha you need to do in high school you to get good grades youd to be part of the gleeu club you need it whatever the things are that you got o do you got a speak a different language ou got a o volunteer in in guata mol in the summer time yu got to do these things thn you will get into the good cause whent you get the good college you got to get this degree wenteyou gt that to gree the thethey have had a path laid out for them of boxes to check and they go in check the boxes tand when they get done no one has put any more boxes out in front of us they do not now what to do and thend that can certainly happen from in the from some one in the seal theames ore someone in the military that what theye been hate this is your mission this what you got to do here is what you need to do do well check te box check the box check the box check te box in his time to retire and there is no one putn a box in front o to check and unless some one in o some guise get out of the seal teams nd they go in to a big corporid struction they kick ass becausethe're some on in the corporat corporat world saying heh here which got to do next and they do great and that is super good for them and the actually really it i'v talk to guy the other day you's a fol on in a corporation es doing a reat job kee he likes what he is doing it is ossum but i think you get some guise that that they they do not really have the open mind to see where opportunities are and theyd youkno one thing as nice about the sel teams is it is there is a lot of you get a lot a freedom o maneuvere right you can really do a lot of stuff that you kind of want to do and when they look at the corporat world they do not see that they think a i no i'm nockin to do that but then hey're not quite sure o how to take the next step i think that is why you might see some guise that are not supersuccessful because the do not really know what to do and they do not really have a mind that is open to look for opportunities and and also you got some guise that success for them as the're can o hang out with ther family and the'r gin a getting good shape and the're gongtoe run some try off lans or competin cro whatever theyr going to do the're gon toe go do it and that is what they arelooking to do you oh which is which is also otum go take time go in joy your family man you gave enough to your country go go hang out your kids that is success as far as i'm concerned to i agree there i know far too many people who are successful in their professional lives but who have very diminished personal lives and it is not a pretty picture they you mention the the parent kin o driving the kid do this do that in that senario i isense tones of fear it is all about not being a failure it is not actually about love of your craft or what you enjoy pretty early my science creer i i learned that the're sertainpeople are just amdisious they's to win and ay's to joke around it is not polite but iseeo you knigt we should all just tell that person that i new cool thing is tryin understand the biology of and i wofld say feesees or something and they would prolly work on it they have yeds the grayst thin cause they ash yey do not care what the're working on for them its just the hunt and i learne that actually people that can serve an important roll because wel there is ashy hole micer bym they are ashly laves ot do work on feases forgive me my micer collegusthat work o micr bams but in all seriousness people who are just ambitious can be very effective because you put a prom in front of them it is a dog though just retrieve it is o u go as oppose to love of retrieving a for retrieving sake its i you give you give it that same dog the analty here you give that same dog a hih jump in tha in to high jumping rit nor whatever it is or div in under water but i think of people more animals and more different dog species we as your case was with music particular music and communities or example of chopping for the pants and that sperince it the first time you tapin to something it really feels kind of unique to you there is something here to be able to find work that includes that but also is hard and also allows you to evolve over time i man i think that is hat's the real that is the real gift that i think most people are seeking and of course there is kno short cut to that except perhaps one which is to be able to sense the difference between ambition and there is no better word for i les just call what it is which is love i i love this and the reason i think that love is powerful and heare i'm sounding likes freedmean but i do not mean interrelational love i i rean tore of the being able to sense what that feels is that i do believe that it allows us to tap in to an enormous number of things that fear alone an ambition alone and just being hard driving person alone will not allow us to tap in to things adaptiveness creativity and there is and i think there is a really obvious reason for it which is that the one thing we know about our species is that we want to make more of ourselves han to take good care of our young whether not every one has kids are not is irrelevant the point is that every species not only wants to do that but mean to do that and the feeling of love is really what allows us to be adaptable i do not think there is anything that trains up adaptability as much as being around kids you just have to be adaptable right cause there one moment ther up than they are down than they are disappointed you knw you and you shared really important story about loss of somebody that clearly you loved and that clearly loved the community he worked it was not just that you gos loved him its that he got he loved yougize and i think that being able to tap in to these feelings of love for things for people and for experiences i think is critical and i do not meditate much these days but i have heard of this love in kindness meditation and i was sound soft to me i is thinking gosh what im mis must do then float levitate at the end and weare of more whatever it is cai'm now what is the thing but i my friend am whofm fortunate to call a friend not trying to namedrop your mown very fortune call rick rube in the music producer a friend and he was the one who start turning me on to different forms of meditation once i mention before in this idea that there are forms of meditation which put us in touch with what he calls the source now this is really getting a lo mistical but i think this all maps bak to the same thing which is that there are sources of dota mean and the other narrow transmitters in us that give us kind of a superpower to adapt to anything and i think it is at least includes love because that is the most adaptable emotion by definition because of what is required for revolution the question therefore is in yourself and in your observation of people that you have worked with did you ever sense that just being hard driving was kind of it was great but it was limiting did yu ever sense that by liking the people you work with you could perform much better even if they perhaps we are not as hard to kind of barro the the common parrel answe around this they were not as hard as everybody else that because you each other much that you can kind o do anything well if you have a team of ten people and you all have a great relationship and you get along well and you are going against my team and we all hate each other and where osan went the team that loves each other is goingto win i was hop is it is not in close it is not a matt of fact if you work for me and you do not me what whatl kind of performance are youong to give me it is gin to be tough what if you love me and i've looked out for you and i've done everything for you and i've taken care of you what con o performance or youngiv me of everything og i die for you yet earlier you you aske about the human animal and human nature and this is part of leadership i o ask this question ove day by a as workingwith a company and the guy says how do i identify what are the characteristics of some one that can execute and how do i identify those characteristics in a person that i can get those people an i said well first of all the characteristics are f the characterstic that everybody's in your obviously some one that is driven some that communicate well as can make things happen thess it thos a pretty simpleito know we know what they are how do identify im it is pretty simple as well i give you a task i give andrew task t's pretty simple task if you get it done cool give you l a bit more complex task do you get it done yesk i give give the same task to fred he does not get it done he comes back with h wunch of questions he slow rolls if you have got all kinds of excuses in promise i give you an even more complex task you come back you get it done and then i'm ein a realize oke andrew's a guy at that makes things happen he is a guy that can actually execute any little bit what you said in min there certain breeds of dogs but even that is it tid them not as as as different as human beings are right there and there are some now there are some guyes i've got andrew who will make things happen here is the problem with andrew when i say hey andrew here is this nebuless idea that i have can you turn this into a reality and you are itwere to start i'm not sure we ye want me to go meanwhile i gave it to the guy that did not make anything happen with specific taskit i gave him and he comes backas as you mit say hy i got this nebulous idea can you su you heas o ya and all the sudden he takes it he says haf figured ot a way to make this happen you might have some one that is very good at executing bu they are not very creative i'm miht have somebody that is very creative but the're not very good at executing what' i do i build the team where i've got and youand fred and they work together and fred comes up with good ideas and we bring him to andrew and andrigles and executes him that is what were doing from a leadership perspective is wereh letting people's nature execute and purpl were putting people in to rolls where' thei'r nature is beneficial i'm not going to take some one that is shy and intraverted an put him out in a lead sails roll i'm not going to take somebody that is boisterous and extraverted and put them into a cupicle where thereging to be looking in spreadsheets all day clearly i'm not goingto do that what we have to do as leaders is we have to find the right people for the right roll and we place them into those rolls now does it mean that i abandon all hope that the guy that is an intrver will ever develop more communications gills now m can work with him and over time we will get him a little bit moving in the right direction but i'm not going to take somebody that is a a total introver and turn them into a lead sails god that is not going to happen any more than on a change tiger stripes that is what we have to do is we have to help people as leader's gote to help people find the roll and find the thing that they are good at now does that mean if i have some one that loves their job they are going to do better at it absolutely does it mean that if i have somebody that is drivin just by achievement that the're gongto be good at thei'r job no in fact but th they can be there is gin be certain rolls i can put him in right if i've got sales noter i neen to hit and and andrew super inda achievement he what he wants to be the golden child tho wants to have his picture on the on the magazian that we put out about our industry cool i can throw this task at you and yet you are going to go and get it the problem is if there is something that is ging to take more perseverance and the reward is not that high or it is a long term goal you are probably not the right eye for the job liking you are job is absolutely critical and if you love you'r job you gingto be able to you can to be able to most likely excell at it now you could be an unfortunate person that loves you'r job is not good at it that happens occasionally tr i receemes i i i turri ta ye very rare it re minds me of your scapeboarding career yeloves a p is you just woren't that good i was not good t ohe kno what i loved more than scapewoardin i love the community right i was in i love the community i was in and i put any n i proly wouldhav gone to the industry side or work on a company side and not been on lescap actual scapeers at or justcape word for fun there is a guy in the scape work communis names jim thebo an he iski tat the i not hid in secret in in that community he is in amazing guy and he is sort of a early on left professional scapewording to run a company real deloghs o munch of other companies he is amazing got and he told me tht wed become friends recently he said he realize he was not going be one of the big guises butk he knew he want to be in thes communy he found his place and i think everyone in scape warn looks to jim as thug ey who care he is he caries he truly cares about the sport and about the people and he learned to kind of just wrap his arms and his hartd around the whole thing and it just works and i do thing i'm everyone has a certain place i in a communiyern a team i think that as you are describing this aft to imagine that people are listening and thinking whil this team thing is awsom it is just amazing i wish i had that ad i'm fortunate to have that in my podcast up had that my lav as certainly in the my podcast team out i i would say these guys go i go i it it is not just it is te people at pressbuttons around cim and take photoes they go i go they go it is over and i'm fine with that i should love that because it is it is yess it is about the podcast but and about the in formation in getting it out there but it is as much about the team and working together just it was escape worning i hole fthem better a podcassa was escape where i kef getting broke off as the scae where to say in scape waring too often but i wont to ask in your family life do you look at that as a team you think this is my team and the're different and how can we sennergize and you have got a look at everyteam that ote of the strength and weakness is of the team and who ise can be good at what and how do you put people in positions where there ging to be able to xcell i mean what is a name tebo is a jim thebo jim fhebo ye imagine if he had a men tor that was onlya sam listen you got to be a proscater this is your only opportunity there is nothing else and he did not have the ability to take a step back and say hou know antman i'm not back i'm not going to be good enough but i really love this industry it luckily for him he figured that out and you talked about the super power of being loving your job ththe one thing i claim to be a super power is the ability o take a step back in detatch which i guess it is going back to your meditation thing but being able to take a step back and look at your life and say man i'v been scape boarding longer than that guy and he is better than me and i' been scape boadin longer than that of the gui and he is better than me i'm probably not going this probably not the right job for me what could i do whet i could use my skill set and obviously he had some motroponoral spirit an and was able to figure that out being able to be a part of a team and it is goes to what i was saying earlier about the mob being able to be part of a team part of the mob part of the gang but still have the ability to take a step back detatch from that and a sess what is the best way for this team to move forward i mean you could have this brilliant idea that from now on you are ging to make all of your pod casts about the milacular structure of whatever and the rest the team probling to pull you aside inso hayman i know you really care about that and that is allsome but everyone really wants to hear about this other stuff let us tie it in together let us expand what you the specific than you aont talk about being able to take a step back detatch and see the bigger picture to me is the true superpower of life of life and it is it is a lot harder than it sounds and this goes back to when you ton't sort talking about people that are having going through struggles in life right and i've described this before as youkow if i'm looking at you and you are you are in a bad state right you are depressed you are sad you are moping around you are not getting nything done and i'm looking at you from the outside and and i'm thinking for me i see this storm cloud around your head right i see the storm cloud around your head and you are in there and all you see no matter what direction you look is storm all you see is darkness i'm outside i'm looking about the hayman that is git is got a great education he is healthy he is got a good team around and he is got all these things going for him but you in that state you literally cannot see anything but the darkness of the storm and that is what is scary about when people enter that mode is you can look i can look at it from the outside and be andrew you just got a move four fee forward and you are gin to be through this thing and yet youre might hear me say that you' ano jock im looking head there is nothing but darkness helping people move forward take action and be able to get that perspective detach and get outside themselves get outside their own heads yours ten farris that get out your head get into your body that is one way to do it take action go do things but it is it is very it is very scaring i'm sure you have had this experience where ou're talking o someone that and they are balg down in whatever problem it is whatever stress they are und er and you are looking at i'm going ayman it is goin to be o cay you can clearly see that whatever they are whatever is bothering them and draggin them now you can clearly see hel lot t time's relationship right the the girl of the guy they they got dumped and you got paymant that person was a disaster anyways you are better off without em and they cannot compute that they are stuck there or maybe it is the school that they did not get into or the job that they did not get and they get rapped up and that they cannot they cannot get out of that storm and it is it is it is such a helpless feeling to to sit there and tellsome one hey you you you youjust move a little but towards me and you'r in a ge get out of this storm and it is much easier said than done and and that is why trying to engage with people in trying to give people that super power of detachment where they can take a step back and say what you are right man that that girl she she was not who i really thought she was i should move on yes but easier said than done and that is oneof the biggest challenges i think that that we have as friends and in parents and a teamates is helping people learn to detach learned to see the bigger picture learne to see that the the problem that you have that you'r whole world is actually not that big of o deal you when i wrote i've written about you kid's books and one of the things that triggered me to write kid's books is realizing that you do not what one day my daughter came home i's my oldest daughter and she came home from school and she is i she says i'm stupid what he mean your stupid shei'm stupid i'm dumb why do you think that know it what ever grate it is when you'e must to know your times tables i do not know my times tables i su oh wellhow much of you studied she kinna gave me the the the confused look wht you whwhatd he mean studied i sud have you studied yet if you made flashcars to to learn them and she did not she had not she thought she should just know them from yer to teachher wene over what they are now she you do not that some other kids in a clastid and and i'm sit nicenia cool wll just we will make someflashcards if she make flashcard she learn her ttell timestables and forty five minutes and we are good but what struck me was to me alls i ownt o bid deal to her it was her whole life and then i got to see that with my other kids somebody said something to them in the recess yard and i all screw that kid dinn't wit the there do not worry bout them but when you are that is their whole world and that unfortunately does not only apply to kids you would applies to do nots as well and they get this problem in their world that seem insurmountable and massive because that little ego system that theire stucking is their world and they run into this problem in that and it is just ruptive in that world and they do not know how to get out of it noe i did a podcast talking about these ego systems at people get into right andthere is all these ego systems yeurn nego system we are we are both in it a shared ego system of podcasting and we could be all my gosh you lacxs just came out with a new podcast and it is been the biggest success and what can i do to catch up with wax and and althe i could get really by you could get raly by we could be bothered by that to think man i'm a failure meanwhile you there is people that do not listen to podcast us people that do not even know what a podcast is and yet it is our whole world if we let it you are in the academic world he you go you you'ro professor at stampford which is a big deal in that world i know people that do not give a rat's ass they could not they do not know where stamp for it is i get that all a the i do not know whise thanfer that iit is nobody deal in the sualtem same thing somebody has a problem in the sealtins and they think this is the whole world and i blew it and and now what are they goingto do when you are facing a significant problem in life relationship a prom with a job you gont remember that you are in one eco system and if you are step outside of that eco system no one really cars and you could gog over to old hey totally different eco system and and find happiness there but at least outilize that to get out of that storm crob that you are in and you areging to find that there is plenty of light out there in the world move towards that and it is going to be a much better situation in the spirit of authenticity everything you are saying it is directly home for me i do not know what people's perceptions of me are i actually try not to spend too much time thinking about that and just really try and stay and touch with the source and i really do believe in the snotion that our love of things is what can generate energy and i try and use action to generate energy but also i happened also love exercise that is an easy one there for me but i try and stay in that mode but i'm to be quite honest i've spent much of my adult life and probably too much of my teen age life an twenties we are not quite in adult right in your twenties at least that i certainly was not in challenging relationships that admittedly we are challenging because of my roll in them also of course right and each in every time i remember thinking moving on from this is this insurmountable thing in part because i 'm a caretaker and i cared and it was not just about me and a selfishness it was about wanting to right all the wrongs of that persons past you nov found myself trying to be a time machine for people ive found myself trying to fix their family lives i've found myself doing all of that and also ignoring all the things i need to focas on in terms of bettering myself and making shrow f showing up correct and on and on and i'm there are data in the world of in the form of these people that that know me very very well that i think would say that in a whole lot more right i'm the point is not those specific relationships but each in every time some one would come along and say listen if this is not good for you it is not good for them or this is a bad situation or this is not serving either of you well but i was my opicthis big and th not even to strov you of the world sand speck of the world and tryng a solve cause that is my natial i resolve thas im one solveit o mana solve it and sometimes things were solved for some period of time and sometimes they were not and i think one thing that just as a confessional i will say i'm i could really learn the art of detachment i could really learned to focus on that more if that is the proper language wort i think i'm pretty good it adapting i thing 'm pretty good at finding good people an certainly love my team an this and that all feels natural energy althouh it is hard work you labin in the podcast but i think the the sort of a tendency that have as a problem solver is to assume the every problem can be solved and there fore staying on this problem until it is solved is the answer and maybe the artof detachment in getting some perspective would help because if i look back i certainly do not regret the experiences i've had but i wasted far too much time and that frankly have probably wasted far too much of other people's time trying to solve problems that could not be solved and i think without going into this in any more detail and of course i you are not o you can send me a bill at the end by the way i think thi thi solestions are freeman yes i think that theing a problem solver's great being forward center massis great i think learning the systems of the brain an body and understanding psychology and in learning about oneself the oracle had it right know thyself in ways that you can maneuvr functionally in your life and career in relationship at cetera great but i think there is also a downside to being overly fixated does ik my bulldog costelles be chewing on something chewing us in next an i know yos chun on is foot in you'r hay and you would hafe rip em off as own foodne b case that chew reflects was just strong that sometimes it would turn on himself that is kint o how how it feels yei wrote a book cald leaders oc travety intactics in one of one of the things that i wrote about in that book is understanding what is important what is not and this is very very similar what you are talking about looking looking at a problem and takin stap backing on it well e is is important or not and be is it solveabore is it nt and see what is the orowhi on getting it solvelem let us the efforts cong to take to get this problsolv an howins is reallygan t impact my world and my life if i focus on it knowing and understanding when something is important or not is a very good skill and again it is a skill it is directly related to attachment detachment because when you are in that relation it is nothing i een tolln people ily the the the the solution to your problem is not going o be found in the problem i's not cant be found in there you have to get out of the problem that you can look at it mak an assassment and you can assass how to solve the problem or whether you need to solve the probler not i mean there is a lot of things in my life for a now orit shrog my shoulders gok but it is ook o some one saying this roder that carry on no factor move on and then occasionally you go not ok ik this is something i needto content with thes something yo deal with thiis something i need to shape or a jostor move or or solve to use to use your word an reason i lafe when i say that is because sproblems you have to get in there but if you take a step back you can use ly sa o little adjustment here little djustment there and that things can a sort itself out detachment is a superpowerment certainly is and it is certainly one that i needs o focus on more i'm i'm grateful for a bringing that up is this is the a biologist in me but iu a what is your process for engaging detachment or for disengaging is it a active process re yo you i 'm get a detach from this im wene t put myself in a situation that is pulling on me there is is gravitational force and i'm getting i creatsome imagry in my mind of walking away from it do i physically walk away from it do i out sorce it to somebody else what it what are some tools for detachment theo this is one of those situations where you and i had a discussion about the science and t a practical application a line my original experience with detachment was and this is one of those moments where you no i sad a lot of time's things are just small moments over time and you make a littleadjustment this one of those moments in my life and i wrote about leadership'straging tactics where i recognized in a moment what detachment was and how helpful it was i'm on an oil rig doing a training mishion my whole platoon is in a skirmish line looking at a a large area of the oil rig that were sppose to be clearing again thit is not combat this is in the ninetees tere's nothing gone onwads doing training and i'm standing in a skirmish line and by the way i'm the youngest and most junior guine mipletun and i'm standing there looking down the sight of my weapon and i'm waiting for some one to make a call and tell us what to do and i wait for five seconds and i wait for ten seconds and i wait for twenty seconds o no one saying anything and we are waiting for eig leader in my platoon to to make a call to tell us what to do tell me what to do and finally after thirty seconds which seems an eternity i cannot take it any more and i take a step a a a foot one foot step twelve inches i take a step off the skirmish line i look to my left i look to my right and what i see is every other gui in my platon is staring down their weapon staring down the sight of ther weapon which means there field of view is tiny it is a twenty degree field of you you are looking down the the scope of your weapon ore the sigte of your weapon and that is how big toere field of yews tat i'm looking i'm thinking oh there is my platon commander he is looking down the scope of the sight of his weapon there is my potun chief he is looking dwn the sid o his weapon thre's my leading pettyoffsor he is looking down the side of his weapon there is my sistem tun commander he is looking don every one in the poatone is looking don the side of their weapon which means they all have a very narrow field dovision wel whn't i take a step back and look to my left and look to my right guess what kin a feeld o vision i got i ot a massive one i can see the whole scene and i can see exactly what it is we need to do and at that moment look as a new guy you need to keep your mouth shut you do not say anything and i'm thinking well but no one else is saying anything i muster up all the courage i can and i open my mouth and i say hold left clear right which is a basic tacticall call non't no no this is not a patan level genious maneuver it just the normal call to making a situation that we were in i say hold left clear right and i'm expecting to get kind of slap told shut up newguy but instead every one just repeats the call hold left clear right hold left clear right and they we execute the maneuver and we finish the clearience of this oil rig and we will get done we get the the top of the oil rig which means we clear the hle thing r on the heelo deck at the top and we goin to debri and now i'm expecting look a now hen to get told ay what weeyou doing you can ned to keep your mouth shut and instead the potune chief goes a hay jock o good call on the cellar deck down there and i was kindlike that is right but then i thought to myself holl on a second why if ofm the youngest most junior guy in this patoon why was i able to see what we needed to do and make that call why did that why dit that just happon and then i realized it was cause i t took a step back to ouse a your turm i broadened my field of view which allowed me to think more clearly cause instead of being hyperfolk is to narrowly focust i broaden my range of vision i took a breath before i made my call right i ad to take my u take a a nice breath to to speak clearly and i realized that taking a step back and detaching i got to see infinitely more than even the most experience guise in my patoon and i started doing it all the time in it i started doing it in land warfare i started doing it in urban combat i started doing it in all these tactical training snarisy jus just training is te igns start a doing these trainksners and it always allowed me to see what we needed to do and then i started doing it when i was having conversations with people and having a conversation my porton chief an i can see it hes start to turn a little red in the face and i we wer we are about to argue about something i o it a second i'ml take a step back looking vhote he is gett madright now and he is the potoon chief you better just doescolate this thing real quick nd i a know at chiefe that sounds goo ine l take a relinea relook at the plan or whatever and i started to do this kind o with my normal life was ton not get wrapped up in my own emotions not get wrapped up in the the the gun fight that was happening right in front of my face not to get rapped up in the details of what was going on but instead take a step back detach look around and then you can make a bet much much better decision and it is not it it is expenential you if you are looking down the sights your weapon and you take a step back and you look around it is expenential how much more you can see ellison if you are the only person in the gun fight it is gon be harder for you to do that causd you got o be focussed on whatever you are shooting at but when you have sixteen guys or twenty guies the're all looking the same direction it is very easy to be the guyticoes on to take a step back look around make a call when you talk about the mechanics when i teach this to people now the mechanics of it take a step back literally you are at you and i ar a meeting there is bunch people the starts to get heated argument i will literally push my chair back away from the table change my perspected perspective open why in my field of view the otherr tho thing all t in in the siltimes you do not want o you do not want a sound panic on the radio for a couple reasons number one because when you panic on the radiots can cause of the people to panic number two if you panic on the radion you sound panic eveh con to make fnny you re don' you get back for the missionever t go towaye you sounded a baby out there what would i do before i would key up my radio take a breath and here i'm manoually slowing down my breath i'm broadening my field of viou if you are in a meeting or you are in a you kno you are at the at the supermarket parking lot and some one starts to yell it you take a step back take a breath broaden your field of view detatch from those emotions that you are havenng and make some space and that is that is how i go through the mechanics of detachment now i can tell you it now i mean when when when you do this all the time which i kind to do this all the time i do not i do not have to step back but when you are starting to be ald to try and do this absolutely make a and not say in hre's another weird little new ants thing lift your chin up and put your hands down now this is not not ta combats such a rase not not ta fight but here is a thing when when when i get defensive what am i gingto raise my hands upand put my chin down it is a fighting mode if you and i are have not a discussion and i'm startingto get heated n ofm startin to likhe oh he is not listening to me instead of me putting my chin down and and put my hands up up to i can put him in your face a little bit no i shall not take a step back from sa put my chin up i changes my perspective a ltta it more changes my visuill perspective just bt e change in the angle of my head take a step back put my hands down a nopping into defensi i actually when o hear what you have to say and if i start listening to what you have to say and not talking it is very hard to be detached when you are talking 's another key component you wanted to tatch shot your mouth i'm in meetings an i in a bunch of different companies i'm running ab i have a bunch nat i own't a bunch diffent companies i'm in a meeting in my companies i'm not the one that is doing all the talkining in fact i'm doing mostly listening when i'm in tasku at bruiser my asking it i'm not sitting there giving the entire brief now i'm lettin the portune chief in the potune commanders give those briefs im not why i'm detached i'm listening to what they have to say i'm more capable of seeing what holds there are in their plans by not moving my mouth not talking i'm listening those are some of the methodologies that i use an i advise people to use in order to effectively start down the pathway of being able to detach in various semariols i love it again i'm saying i love it because i do love it and thank you i think it is a wonderful techniqu we have talked before in your podcas an a some of my listeners may be not all am this podcast will be familiar with the fact that when we narrowly focuss our gaze on one target a number of things happend our visual world becomes constricted of course but also that we start slicing time more finely and the dopamin system tends to start doing a kind of anticipation and trying to guide and direct things in that narrow tunnel of view ras when we literally take on panoramic visions and otino silly moving our head around although one could abroadening our field of yiew or looking a horizon specially for walking but gain that kind of not kind of getting a broader field of view we slice time differently things do not feel as imposing on us this is the physiological substrate underlying what you' you are describing and i think it is am it goes a step further because in that open larger aperture of visual understanding there is a open larger window of cognitife understanding and new option starts a surface right i mean i think this is i've long been fastening by the fact that this i should be i'll tell us the real quick story i in twenty fifteen i was im i went over to spain to do some mountaineering with whim hoff if this was not as i wanto podcast at and have any social meya just went over there as i'd hard the sky whim contact in them somehow arrange a trip for myself and i went over there and we did some crazy dangerous mountaineering thi no business doing almost ripped my left leg off in a stunt that was organized by others there at i never should have done in any case one day ilook and womens crouched on the ground next to a curb in this parking lot before a height he is down the n the round the little stick and i what ar you doing he is look dthere were aunts climbing up this thing in he is their mountaineering this curb and not on thisky different right but then i realized we were about to do the same thing up this big face and i thought well lake he is able to think at these different scales and see similari is i let let us prek go i would have never stop to look there and i'll i still remember it right i was it profound no was it interesting yein the sense that things are happening at all scales all the time and we we think we know the scale to pay attention to and we think that that is the one that matters most and i thin it is fair to say that in a gun fight there is a scale that matters most but new options new perspectives actually come from that broader feeld of you wish is what you are describing and later that day it is interesting because this group going up some of them were really challenged in the in the declime and wen went back to this example of how the ants would stack on top of one anotherand he ised an analogy from that to help people through this clime there is a beautiful pool at the top et ceter at ceter anyway i think that these examples am are in fact meaningful especialy the ones that you gave because they do not just relate to military em you imagine around the dinner table i've had this gets ter there and partners there and nimes it is really nice to sit back and just ca here it all in baskin it all but oftentimes new information will surface ye said thike all i'm hearing his worries out of this personer they are not even really here they are all talking about what we are going to do nex next time next time next time and unlike you reanchor people halic maybe let us focus on what what we are doing here or sometimes yeelar hiperfolk is one wone's happening there o they neen to think about something in the future i love this i need to practise detachment in number different domains o my life i'm one thing that i i'm realizing after hearing you am describe the process theyre really need to do as i need to start taking im some time away from my work maybeven elivit of time parallel to relationship to get per better perspective on it because i think the problem solving nature an us really makes us myopic really makes us neer sided yet's a you see this a lot i mean i i get to see this a lot we do events with company's businesses and we go offsight somewhere were they are detached they are just they are they are defact o detached from they are dateday business you pull some one out ofthe business for two days an all the sun they start seen the solutions but they net they never see them te it is lot horder for them to see them when they are in the fire fight you get them out of the fire fight it is hard for them to see when te're in that acquisition at they are doing how we gan merge these two cultures thitsis ging to be impossible bom pull em out are i let us talk about two cultures and and let us talk about what possible outcomes are and all the o when you get them to take a step back the these solutions will appear and and it is true in a gun fin ollisan if it is a one on one gone fight even then be ability to take a step back and look around wor use your perfial vision you have to be able to do this is going to increase it is expinential how much eiting that is why it is a super power it is cheating it is it is cheating n i's speaking of setstone setstone took over a we he became a taskou to commander or troop commander when we got back from romoti and now he is the gying chargean now i was running the training and a couple months into his training he broke his neck i broke his vertebra in his neck his spinal cuorter's o ket he was enal the guy with the big neck brace on and he could not doany arduous training and his his seall task unit which is troopltunes was going through their land warfare training and he could not do it he could not carry arokak could not carry a machine guns we could not do it i said heyim coming out let us go out and you can observe your guyse and see how they are doing and there we are we areout the desert his his troop is going through field training exerciser full mission profassoat's ike a big fate operation there is a fate target there is fate bad guys were using these lazer these high speed lazer guns to shoot and we are work in of standing on this little burn and at a certain point in the operation his whole task unit forty guyes gets pin down in this little ravine and worst kind of standing in the ravine with these guys and no one's making any decisions and the enemy with these lazier guns our startin a maneuveranc startin it theu're killing guyes cause hese lazer guns you can duie and seth ets me on the arm is a can i cannot tell him what to do and i'll not but let him finguret out another thirty seconds pass another guy got's killed with lazer he get's me a conproll let me let me say some to him and i'll no let let him figur it out another minute goes by two more guys are now dead just lazer dead but they are dead and he gets me again he is pro let me tell him i go ir goad tel and he jus crouch is down next to one the gusin bangs him on asterd pel right and which is a again it is just a fundamental basic call and the guy shouts it out be'll right and they start punrine in another minute later they are all out of the kills on and everything o ke and then seth looks at me an he goes man this is easy way up here and i said bro look it where we are we are in the ravine with the guyse we are now we are on a knee and the guys are laying down but it is not this we were not on some elevated position and i said hey it is not that when an elevety position it just that we are detached and looking around he goes on my god and i said hey your member when you and i went through this training and he goes yaniga this is what it was for me all the time i was constantly just looking around that is why it seems a magic power right it is a superpower cause you d sets down there with this gun and hes shooting om hebro move your gys over that go that rid's in right their such a curitypont and he how did how di jocklo see that jockle must be attacked cgenus not amot atactical genius i'm just taking a step back and looking around and this and you just said it applies to everything that we do if you are having a conversation with your significant other and you start to see that they are getting frustrated about somethingnow look if you are in the conversation a hundred percent you are ging to get frustrated too you are gn to get frustrateit the're frustrated next thing you have got a you have got an emotional argument going on where is if you take an take a mental step back and they waited why they frustrated right now oh because i'm trying tos solve they are probleen really what they'r ooking to do as vent ok ak got it let him than o canc hel that sounds horrible what you think you are going to do and to sayi well that is the prob here is what yous should do cas peopleare always looking for that yeav it is this thing this ability is and it is smething that can absolutely be trained and that is what is cool about it can absolutely be trained it is not a natural gift it is it is some people we better at it than others but it is something that you can train i used to see guyes develop and i see people developin now in the business world where they will they will report back to me hat we had a meeting with the union today and the union started escolating what they wanted to do and i just to i detached and we ended up desclating in now we got a solution this is an absolute skillset that can that can be learned and that is what that is what makes it especially nice because there is some people look if you are very articulate born very some people are born more articulate than other people some people are born with anability o simple fy things more than others and you can train and you can become more articulate you can become you can learn to simplify things more and some people can be naturally good a detaching but but every one can get better out and that is a beautiful thing ite's a beautiful thing and i'm highly insensif eyes to do this i min their areas of my life they are going really well that i also want to apply it there i think that i've tended to rely on people close to me as a way to access this detachment i will be very direct in saing that you knw i am not the leader of my podcast there is a leader it is not me i'm part of the team but it is not me and i often rely on his im put u and sometimes that in put is solicited and sometimes it is not one place for instance where you see people getting really myopic is on social media i'd and and i've experience this you id love to say that'm always non reactive and i think in general i take the stande that iave filters i have i've filters i i know why i'm there right 'm interested in being a teacher and a giver and informing people and about the beauty and utility o biology that is wha i say i's not a mission statements it is a fact that is what i care about anything that does not fit through that filter i really have any business doing but occasion i likta you non'l make a joe kirsey but occasionaly something comes throughing you and i find myself an way a second and you get sucked into that tunnel and sometimes it is observing other people an tunnels and when you are not in the tunnel it is obvious to what is happening right you are watching in some cases people just dragging their lives and some cay os sinking their entire careers i mean the former chair of psychietriate columbia university in new york made in absolutely foolish truly insenseitive totally in appropriate tweat that is my opinion and i think it was the opinion of all the people that fired him from his job this person was at the tapecs of his career lost his job for saying something terrible and in retrospect was said something i do not know what i was thinking and dis guise a psychiatrist is that he lives in t in the study in the treatment of the mind it was just goes to show that everyone i think is susceptible to be impulled into these tunnels and fortunately everyone is susceptible to learning to teach themselves how to rach themselves out of it i love this idea of a teachable skill i'm certainly goin a practice it in one on one and in group situations and and ina variety of situations i i think that the tunnel is has a a gravitational pull as i can allure to that tunnel and that i always just go right back to the nor chemistry i think that there is something about solving a problem inside of a tunnel an animal on a chase but at some point that animal could get picked off by a run over by a truck because it was did not have enough situational wareness i'm deffling in a practices through opening the gaze and embroadening gaze and i think i also do for a a couple days off from things to just walk and think about work on these retreats do people work on work or they just there to do other things and that is where the ideas surface we will do a little bit of both we will do some stuff that is focastrong work but then will pull out and doce things thatare completely unrelated to work to for that very reason whether we do something physical whether we do something some kind of a mental exercise but we do things that are completely unrelated to their work and and take those breaks in order for them to free their mind what bothers you mout sophomedia this is will you say that there is some things that kind of make you mab it mean not me but could of course of course amhuman ou know little things little things treatment it is not the things that are obvious is astually not direct critique of me it is am it is when people exploit misunderstandings to try and create a greater misunderstanding that does not exist that is what gets me cause to a scientist that is the most irritating thing i doft kno what the analegy would be in the seal teams but it is some one hih jacking something that they did not mean that but then they cond of thiy they distort the argument the word gasligting gets thrown around a lot now lot of be blashlly think that any time someone states a boundary now i do not believe that is that that that is gaslying trust me tho psychiatrice who were all professionally treing tell me that is not gaslight gess thing's a very particular thing were you i'm trying to alter some one's reality in a very active almost sociapathic way am i just that is a editorializing right there what bothers me is when people a hih jack am some time some one in a in an argument is not a sophisticated with their language o somebody else o some one will high jack that lack of sophistication and trying to flip them on their back that sort of thin ng really gets under my skin because i feel that treates a unnecessary divide there a few other things but i i ways jokin my lab and 'll saring at an i've three thousand pepies but i 'lse ave three thousand flaws to match each one of those hes ye i whenever i'm in this is not just social media but it is just life whan somebody says something about me youre too me that i do not what i realized years ago is i the reason i do not is cause there is some truth in what they are saying and the best thing to do is to say either to yourself if you are by yourself or to them is to say yo yu ye yet yeun you are right i i am kind of a knocklad sometimes or ye you are right i sometimes yo jumped a conclusion tor yet y you are right i was completely wrong about that and that is just much more liberatat liberating and healthy then saying you n know what you are talking about or know i do not it just going into that defencive mode and and trying to close your mind and set o openg your mind up to listen what somebody else has to say and sa what is a good point im you are you are spot on without one next question next commade lat's go one thing i appreciated about you on socia medyas the te limited number of words in each of your respsthatit is a grating at for a sing you to be effichent and concise ictually s is a huge advantage it also forces you to be precise at least about category you are right i thing there is there is something to be said for that well there is a good example i was on social on twitter the other day since twitters getting getting kind of getting a lot of gin a lot of a traction right now as lot of mayham gone on itthe other hado not ft and somebody asked me somebody that ham going to boot camp soon what adviced you have for me and i wrote back enjoy bon't and you said i mean it is twitter i'm responding to bunch of people and then somebody else chimed in and said you do not might is well not even answer jocco that is not helping thi gy at all ant look litely at your face feause you do not wanchin your face just got a little bit mat right you got a little bit ofensive for me yiwell i think that is my nature i do not seeing other people sort attackd an thing that is my night had a split sacking of who the hells isgy and i said you nowhat he is right and then i tweat it again back thi us it is sorry man you are right what i should have said was hey read the book leadership stragety in tactics it is a good book for some one that is going to be in an environment that is going o be challenging and we are ging to be faced with leadership challenges and enjoy boot camp because if your mind said is this is socks and this is terrible you are it is going to be terrible and it is gon to sock and if you go with a mind said of hey this is a cool experience and i should enjoy it youre can have a much better time that is my full ance sure i'm striting to and it is perfectly fine that i was right to crutique me and he was right in saying that and there as a buch what ish funny as i punch allther people came to my defence i thisguy that is really greand it but my point is instead of me getting defensive and crazy and letting it tri me crazy open my mind a little bit listen what they have to say except that there is got to be some level of truth in it and there was i gave a guy a a very very turse response and i could ave expanded onto more and i did nobody geal good times i a few minutes ago thinking myself wonder where your mind is that in the few moments before you fall asleep are you able to make yourself go mine blank im pretty easily it' something i've been practising more because i tend to again room and i to drill into proms obviously yit yesteri did a sola aposode which when we do those ere usually anywhere from five to twenty hours of prab and then the recordings i will not say how long they take but but i love going into the tunnel righte the tunnel is the that is where the juice is for me and finding the structure and i have the benefit of amazing producer helse me sort through it and but a kind lie came out o thing and then when home could not eat sos i doft want dinner and then us explaining a call i had with a colly the other day and yo mig i she mike coffrin chose jus slike youn i cay i'm going to sleep and iws up and lik thingiu taxtaing thinking writing nots own i thought a man li 'm costello chewing on the stick and liy they hewin into my pot i neen't i needt sleep need to go to sleep i think i've a a bit of a harder time disengaging clearly aand i'm this is why never touched cocanor infed of me because i think that some of us have a a love of the dopa mean circuitry that i always sense if i were to have tried drugs that that they might have been the the thing that would hit my narrl circuits just right you are some do time but i'll call that way ave read books by alcoholics the ook dry and fyew other richroll talks about this that he drank i'll call for the first time in causu it was this a lixtur that filled his body that made him feel right for the first time that is not how i feel after a couple of jingsthat it all o relaxed but i cad do without it but this drilling into something is really that is my i guess may be that is mi i do not think its the superpower but i have some some strength there but i think it is also the thing that cut that can cut on the other side youn you started off this conversation early you talked about you'r getting up in the morning ndo you get up and you have these nouls about to go down the path of it is at night time when i'm trying to go to sleep and i have some random thought about some thing that that can be a hard for i have a a visual thing that is goine on it seems ike come on a rolar coaster and i'm going in a new idea comes in i'm just on this awsum ride and i get's nock an stop and i cannot i do not no how to stop that oh no i been i think it it goes with people who are very driven and and to master different crafts i have a colleague is nameis carldice serout thes byo engineeri as five children and he is a psychatras he is an incredit one these people i does a taun very likely will win the noble prize hom me's an amazing scientists amazing gi and he does this practice that he does is not a meditation which he sits for an hour late at night after his kids a gone to sleep and he forces himself forces himself to think in complete sentences with punctuation about some problem i tried doing that for about five minutes and and i fell off but it is a something that he is cultivated and himself which helps him in his career right i do not think thats this certainly not something i reckommend if i did that at one or two in the morning i knowbe bad for my sleep because falling asleep asher requires drifting into these kind of liminal states on other reasons why i'm a big proponent of things non sleep deep reast t or these yogan needro practices which are basely body skans were you are trying to learn to detach from the sensory world and thei're very effective it a it certainly for me they have been very effective at teaching me to have turn off thinking which is a interesting notion in its own right but i the idea of of detachment by stepping back and getting perspective my my father is much better at that he is a very calm guy and in the world of confrontation i always knew whene ells a kid he would blank which ye ment some was ging a hapn il was goin to get it and now but i've always does he can control his his responses his behavior others of us in the family the side from new jersey were more go to loger heads sii do not know this raise is a question i think it is a one that i and several other people i talk to hin anticipation is fodcasts were asking you mi think one reason why people are drawn to people who have ben in the seal teams and you in particular are that i think everybody not just males but females to i think everybody and wants to know theire calibration point on their level of toughness i think people wonder you kno i think when people talk about buds and all that i think a lot of peele wonder would i make it through i i've certainly wondered at i'ven't spend hours on it i went my path i'm happy for the path i went but i think people wonder do i have this thing that supposedly buds selects for and if i do not at how tough am i or not tough am i i thnk that we all can look at other peoplephysically and i'm not somebody that does a lot of this i know some people are really obsess by this all that person hat an are not pack with a vains i do not understand that that is not me but i understand some pople do that even to the point of mythology but i think most people wonder how resilient am i hwand they can look to experiences that they have survived and say i made it through were i' resillin tor not but is there a way that a we can i certainly that we can train it by doing hard things cold showers his kinding are small examples of those but d ou think it is an even an important question to ask and if it is how does one go about thinking were wear it how razilient ama should we put ourself into situations of discomfort just to test that as i will say i think a lot of people look to steal teams and tinguis in particular as have a a a calibration point uget they know how to do hard things at they were selected for the ability to carry logs and getting a cold water over and over and roll in the sand and go without sleep for a week or but that is probably not what they were doing when they were on demployments it is clearly a pressure tast for something else yet it is a strange strange thing the basic underwater demolition seal training and quite frankly going and gettin wet and cold and being miserable is is actually nothing a compared to being on deployment and a good example that i use to compare this to is a when i was on deploynment and two thousand six in remodi there was a as you were as you were driving off base to go to the city to go into the city an conduct operations as you drove out of the compound on your right was this area that was called the vehicle graveyard in the vehicle graveyard was exactly what it sounds it was probably seventy five or a hundred vehicles that were blown up destroyed burned am in verious twisted conditions that had been dragged back through the city and put into this vehicle graveyard and as you drove by that vehicle graveyard without question that every one of those twisted vehicles represented one to three for five american casualties wounded horribly wounded killed in there you are in vehicle about to roll out into that city where what you are looking at can easily be you in the next three minutes and you'r ging to do that to day you can do that tomorrow you do that the next day in the day after that in the day after that that compared to and by the way this is not jous seals that are doing that this is marinsis is the army guisar over there this is what every one is doing and they do it they do it yous i talk about markley use one of my guis firt seal killed in my rackan here was the lead turrit gunner in the lead humvy and can fee it n om if you were the point man of yet nomf youre up l an infantry patrol you appointman of get ofm your at risk buby traps ambush they rotated you out youn enough to stay up there all all the time youd do an hour up with the as pointman to get some one else up there and that guy the leed turret gunner in the in a humvy colum of four or five or six vehicles f you hit an iete that is the vehicle it is can hit it ight if you culd gointo an ambush that is the guyd that is on to to hits the guy that is standing up in a fifty caliber turret that is the guyd that is gon to die nd mark was it you not us a new gu he is he is in that lead turret fifty cow and he never asked to get rotated out and i'm hois a very to say very he was extremely carismatic funny gregarious a commedient and you we got all kinds of stories about mark but one of em ou a wewere in vaguus and we are all gambling and i come down from my hotel room an i see mark across the across the he is playin back jack and we sees me egles hay sir when or the new catlacks coming out he is just blighten up everybody im just having a fantastic time but iememer one night yo know he is geting ready to roll out and if i was not going out with thupletunes i'd let go out iu o see the guse off can my hand salute as they are leaving him i feelin o mi iiu do markit good to go and he is feeling lucky sir that was his attitude and he is a guydis gan ta dry by that vehicle graveyard drive right out on that city nd he is can do the next day in the day after that on the day after that and and i said that is what the army guys are doing that iswhat the rincorguis are doing they are doing it and as much as the mithology around basic seal training goes to me that is that that that experiencein combat and what guys do is infinitely harder and infilly more important now all that being said basc seal training as i isit is the is a very strange laboratory for human beings it is a very strange laboratory for human beings and it is aid h i it is it is kind of crazy the way it works it is very it is it is obviously extremely difficult but there is no o i would not put money you could put odds on somebody making it through hay that guy seems some be good to go but i would not put a bunch of money on it i and i would not take a hundred per cent i would not never take hon to present bat on anybody cause the is no one that is honor presentt ging to make it trough that training and there is there is just brand m youre some people see it is walt it is cause your wife there is people that make it thour sheel training cause thei're excrl friend said they could not make it there is some other guy that makes it through because they promised god that they would make it there is some other guy that make it through because the're dad said they con nav there is every one thes examples youcan come up with and and it is good enough for some random do to make it through and it does not matter what your pedigre is does not matter where you are from there is guises from iowa there is guyses from florida there is guie from wherever that make it and there is guys from my when there is gus frm florda ther's guis from wherever they do not make it geuis from farms guse from silver spoon in their mouth and you just cannot predict it and i i mean to has to have something to do with the fact that how bad you actually wanto do it that is it is it is a strange thing and i would not i would not try in you of i was in the world if i did not do that training i would not be trying to forgot if i could make oere not cause you do not know tyou do not know the very strange thing and it is and it is mythical almost right now right it is mythical that how hard it is and is not too many people make it through man its fifteen per cent ye now you have from all the folks that i've talk to there gone through been instructor's there some we both know im seem that that fifteen per cent number is unlikely to change as long as they keep the the process the same that just seems at about fifteen per cent people seem to have something in them that can perhaps grow during that training but that this it is being identified and select it for rather than somehow being built up across at least that fase the early phases of training and then at some point they build on that capacity and this gets to this really somewhat controversial issue frankly are people wire differently and listen ie started off in nural development and i'll tell you that there are some universal properties if of nural development in all surviving human that youre ging to breathe without having tothink about at your harts can be without having ta think about it but beyond that there is a lot of variation and natural levels of dopening and ceretone and i sthere is nature plays a powerful role and nurture and what is interesting though as we cannot always predict from parents what nature is going to do recently we had soone on the podcasts i n the cide for you to listen to it if if i perhaps you will if i cend it to you is a ti've talks about inheritable acquired traits you do not expect tht because you work out that your grand kids will be more muscular and have better endurance but there is actually some evidence that that may be the case and yu knol how could that be we got two kinds of sells in your body it turns out youave what call semmatic cells which are alvenln of the germ cells which are your sperm and your wife's eggs well why would not the deana of the sperm cells in the excells be modifiable by experience if all the other cells aren'n it turns out there some evidence that nameit is not the deana but that the are ina are think about that that means that whether and we known this that people that have been in a famine several generations later their implications for bloodshrut of regulation in their great grand hits the idea that experience and acquired traits can change us as actually has some validity an no and and it and this gets into really complicate things tat be well this is the draft t head tolikes crain it is neck and then gete birth to longer necture havsence will not exactly but also not entirely untrue either i love the idea that there are inherited traits and that there are that nature and nurture play arole but that hard work may actually transmit across generations the othere is in seal training you have kid's that come through that that call legacies which means that they have a dad i think it i dad brother whatever and they do have a better chance of making it but it is not a guarantee chance at all an it reat my personal pitin is i think a legacy kid would have a better chance of ma it just do to the thanksgiving dinner that you are going to have to go through for the rest of your life aif you do not yet if you are even invited which you might be on your own a but yet tit that there is may be there something through that as well but i think that is just more the the pressure that some one must feel hay there is no way i'm going to be allowed back in my home if i do not make it through this training ocan have to jisgo had and suck it up but not everyone makes it and im it is it is a bummer when that when that does occur well for people who are not thinking about going through seal training or who miss the opportunity or who are not interested in that for whatever reason do you think there is value to doing things each day that suck a little bit or from time time doing something that is you do not puts one end to a state of deliberate a discomefor hundr percent i mean hundr percent i mean even you in order to improve yourself youve got a you got a impose some discipliineself right if if you want to get stronger you have got a do things that require strength if you want a betoff for you got a do things that require you to be tougher i think that is pretty straight port does that mean doing things that are not pleasurable for instance im you nave done some long podcasts and na a few weeks ago idea a series we were doing a series o any gallopin o all that exercise and exercisecise and we did six podcasts in that we must have ever done which may doing for or five the next week not bad but i loved every second of it and i love every second of podcasting and it did not suck but it builts up a greater capastity igess i'm asking specifically about things that really feel a splinter is there any value to that im because i have to say there are some people i know some of them are former team g the art team guises he do not say formity mas it they were out they are out of the teams now but they are team gis for ever who seem to not be rattled by little things those guyse in particular they they do not seem to be rattle by little things then i know people that they they get the wrong sized coffee to cofshop and they dissolve into a puddle of feers there doest seem to be something to this hull mental razilients thing and flexibility thing u and i i try and do something that is uncomfortable to me about once a week some the e really do not it does not matter what that is but i try and do something that' sound unpleasant or do something in a way that is unpleasant guess the example getting into the cold water the first thing in the morning and making that decision from under the blanket's is a rough one for me but then it gets easier and then you wonder is it still serving the purpose that it is building me up should people seek truly bad experience is provided that they are done in a safe way i think that your going o just you would develop your legs by doing squots and you would develop yourvback by doing pullops i think you would develop your raziliency by doing repetitions of things that require you to be tougher that actualoquet good toit thend the reason i ask tis is because i thing a lot of you will think w i work out every day but i but then you prove them allopen te're but i love exercise and the well then that does not quite qualify as something that makes you tougher right or they think o the last raps of a set are really tough but if you love hitting failure on a set cause that is kind of what i seek in the gim i love that aspect of the training that is i where i know i'm getting better it no longer services razilient training it morgis service as training n yes i think that the point is clear and appreciate your answer i have to ask about something this is can a seem a a total divergence but it is not which is animals tbecause first of all they are a love of mine in terms of understanding the animal kingdom ind placing humans into the animal kingdom second whall i know you are a hunter and also i know you own dogs and the question i have is do you ever look at people or did you ever work in teams of of guyse when you are on active duty gave see that the difference is you naw you mention before this persons really get a problems all in this persons a little bit more creative yoever wonder whether not people of embody different on of animal archetypes thas i do well that that thing where people say that dogs or owners look their dogs dogs win ren your owners i think that is i've seen all kinds of icyouan goin inter dat and find a bunch of examples of dogs that look their owners and owners that look their dogs i think that is true and i think ah you do not by my dogs are wsom and do not tell me about you are dong wisnondogs my dogs ae german sheperd is name is oden and he is unalsome dog youe nowlike am and heshe is got a personalg guts o easy it got an interesting personality he does not to a cuddle right my kids we li go we does not to cuddle now even when we go to bed at night he goes to your four feet away from the foot of my bed even if iles hate jump up ou 've told him jump up in here we want o pet you he will jump up in there and he just kind ot goes in that low crouch position and then sort of waits until i say free dog and then he goes back down he goes for feet away frm the foot the bed ind sit tere cause he is that is his that is his personality is two protect and sat security and do his job and and that is what he is and you known you have got other dogs that are yoo thithey not it they are to tilly different minds that yhe have dogs have definite personalities and and look i also have ait it is not allgenetic two of my friends a got dogs that were brothers when they called do go argentinos what is ogas the others are hard to get in you ask there not and it it mag not even be legal in the united states do not tell me o these people are not that i care but i layou where they are yet but these two guys and those two guys had different personlities b one guy is very happy glucky to smoke pot likes to hang out very just the chill kind o playful guy the other guys not hes the opposite in every category and they both got these dogs and you fast forit fast ford a year the dog that was owned by the playful guy his dog was just a big puppy lakin a jus wagin the tail the other dog you had to keep it in a cage or it would murder everything insight and ind these dogs were brothers from the same litter and they were completely opposite and i think it has more alot more to do wih with nurture then it does to do with nature but that being said when you look at when you look at mouls i mean mouts have a personality that is very distinct compared to a german shepherd now look there is outlying mouths there is outlying german shepherds there is outlying what you name whatever kind of golden retriever whatever dog is known for being more playful you you get around the muth moths ar mous are mouths and they are that w if you been around muths before o oh o the belgian mou yi a few of em thatmy neighbor has one and that thing thut is not terribly friendly but it is it is a security dogs i do not expect it to be dos them yet thet the're i know the they use him for work in the teams and i've heard that you houvht to keep a close i on your relationship with them ecause if you get lacxs about it they will bite you the that true the first time i saw one a we were doing a a drill with using dogs for the first time inth one of the teamgo dog handers came out and we hit this target building and t thethet kind of prebrief do a ha get this target building and this guies can be a runner o squirger and and the we pull up in the humvies asaltin jumps out i'm kind of stayin external con o con one see hit is can happen the squarder goes running off and the dog handler whatever tracks his dog on this guy and then releaseis it gives him whatever commands howut whatever the commands are that thing is toldly primed are not unlike anything you have ever seen your life it is just crime ets trackin that guy he hits that release on that leash and that thing takes off at a thousand miles an hour it jumps i'm not kitting fifteen feet maybe ten feet in the air away and yust chomps on to this due to dute goes down it was freeking all i've seen sovidios tas a malinois i guess i did notfor forgeving has befri ton knw your friendship but mauths mat a belgiam malnois those dos running up tree jumping over little lo rivers iout tha it is craesy incredibly powerful animals ye well the idea that pep that they mimic their owners has me illitt concerning as my last dog had to put him down as my bull dog costols a bull dog mastiff i got him because i went to pick out a poppy basically and there ware aid of these bull dogs all tem running around and then there is one in the background jus eating out of all of their bowls and i'ls i on that one hig bull dog biggest one in the litter laziest creature not jis dog the laziest creature that ever existed but if you need to activ eight he would he was just very efficient with his energy anynow i do not think i have a bull dog personality and that is why goutum to gon balance me out im never retrieved never did anything a stole and destroyed every toy at every dog park in sandiago who is kont of famous there i had to bring afive dollar bills to pay people for all the balls and things he would destroy and when my apologies told the dog owners not really i am miss him did you train your dog or did some hen elseon euse i di it was he train to be a security dog or a cont of family dog or it us con of a mixture you n i mean the true working dogs unless you unless you have the time and efforto put in to him or you buy him that way a youyou do not you do not want one of those dogs that i wese just describing in your house they are they are not for a house unless there is there is that level my dogs not that level a he is alsome did you apply some of the same a principles that you usein a leadership of humans with your dog ye there are a lot of similar principles but there is also there is there some differenceas theres the're the're their pack animals right and they respond to you knon ththe pack leader is fanto my my dog obeys me as if it is the command of god and my wife he is kind of maybe i'll do what you say the they kick up on thakatastov dogs are very intuitive i love this idea that i'v told early on that they can feel your emotions i think they actually can sense how we feel not just by the intonation of our voice but i hope some day some one will figure out in anonevasesive wake as on the idea of people doing experiments on dogs in invasive way con't what they are picking up on frinces we know that sharks are paying attention to the amount of activity in the lateral line of fish at lot fish have these these stretches of ner ons they call the lateral line that alowed them to school andknow the distance to different things and be able steer round quarrel they feel proximity yit be con't if you are turning going to and they can even recognize specific lateral line om signatures to be you and markley walkingthe othe through the dark but maybe people sift around e youre you doft hae to look at that is mark you con'd of learn him in to a fish can do that sharks can sense whether not the lateral line is is hut say vibring but firing at of particular frequency to know oh that fish is a little bit slower than the rest i mean thet you knon't hunting animals just they develop these incredible senses and i think humans have some of these kind of senses ind more rudimentary wave we are just not force to use them unless of course you are become a hunter of animals are a hunter of humans and you tap into these neral circuits that are very primitive and hard wired in everybody but of course they are honed in in m in warriors when i could spiral off into animal biology in a ways that i truly would take us twenty six hours i do not want to do that i'm almost has notin to ask this question but im can at do it anyway many times on line you are asked whether or not you will run for office and i want to say that i hit is a true compliment i do not think people are asking just o cind of entertain themselves i think that this country certainly in a lot of the world is desperate for certain kinds of leaders and people to have experience in hirisk hig consequence chaotic situations and have shown prowess at leadership in multiple domains an you are certainly one of those individuals and they asked for that reason among others and i've heard you give your answer you can repeat it again here but as a more broad theme that i think of people are interested in do you think it is an important criteria or it would be great to see people and positions of leadership who had wartime experience u and you think th a some of the shifts that we have seen in terms of m patterns of leadership over the last less just make it real broad that this is not eve relate to any particular person or stretch of of histery but over the last less just tay twenty five years i'm reflectiv hat we have not seen a lot of that at least at the top tears of leadership you i think it be excellent if people meadef if the president had military experience for sure i think that then they understand the with the way the military works better i'm they understand that each es civilians that control the military cause lot of times people at a ciflians do not understand that this ens control the military a nd i think that you do get to appreciate what war axtually is and what the costs are i think that a you have i've i've seen in the same vain of people asking me to run for political office i've heard you do not seen comment saying oh that is what we need another warm a a war monger in in office and i'vl responded a few of those i think if there is any if there is any group of people that do not want war it is people thaut have seen it people that understand what the what the sacrifices are and i think that i think that being in the military people understand that better yet i think it be a great qualification i do not think it is manditory mean clearly it is not withat a munch of presidents that have not ever served anything really wete had a munch of presence that have not ever served anything but themselves 'm yet hopefully will get some more people that have some experience in the military some combat experience would be especially nice and ti'll be good in my opinion well i'm certainly not one to tell people what to do and i'm certainly nothcan tell you what to do but should you ever choose to run i would certainly im be very enthusiastic about that and and i will just say that im with that stated a i hope people do hear what you j said i share that sentiment im people who have led others besides themselves i think is is the key statement there yet i'd look i just i've ie friends at er politicians and i really appreciate what they are doing and it looks miserable to me i do not i do not what i good for them i'm happy that the're in their trying to make a difference i'm and and i guess this is me being selfish of mesant look i donn't think i could stomach that and i also think that you kno right now i'm you i'm trying to help out for insince yere we have obviously got the leaders af consulting it acial on front which can to help businessis grow i've got origin you essay were bringing manufacturing back to america we have got hundred four hundred four hundred fifty employs right now that are here in america working and growing that business a obviously supplemence to everything that i'm doing here right now is to e tryin move the needle with with america bringing manufacturing back helping the economy as much as a can riht now that is it is kind of one ofm doing right now an end my standard answer which you alluded to as if things got bad enough then i would i would do what i had to do but i do not think people appreciate my level of bad i'm talking real a it is not there yet and hope we never will get there i'd i'd rather obserf and hang ou my friends and and hang l my family then do that and hopefully america can can fined some level of balance i think that is the problem that were having it now and a lot of these things that you talked about but specifically think you talk about a social medias not very good for political balance it is it is exactly horrible four political balance and a lot of it has to do with just a way that those conversations are had a lot it has to do withe ego as well because i do not every one who admit that i'm wrong about anything and if if i can find something that i think you might be wrong about it is satisfyind to my ego to just call you out on that thing and attack you and i think that is what a lot of people are doing right now now that being said also i also usually say this as well i travel around the countryall the time i work with companies of all sizes work with people in every different industry and the're not they are not sitting round arguing with each other about what would the pot the political scenery they are talking about hey how can we growr business how can we take care of our workers how can we take care of our clients how can we take our our customer that is what people are focussed on and when you jump on social media yo you can get sucked in to the political scene very easily and that being said also we do have to pay attention because you you kno we a citizens have to make sure that that america stays on the on the correct path within the gardrails of what this country is based on we you have to pay attention im but i will be doing my part as a civilian until there is total maham and chaos in the streets then i'll probably just be a benevolent dictator that takes over o be an interesting omut hey ah you would be the man to lead under any conditions but thank you for stating your threshold i'm certainly you ere in the right to make whatever decision is that you feels right for you and i want to say that i i agree i feel we are a country that still includes a ton of generators thand the ton of projectors that oure interestin projecting the good and growing the good i do believe both those pena types are important i also want ed just say thank you for being a generator of much useful knowledge you in science we have a saying which is it is somebody is an end of one this is a rare thing to here about oneself or to hear about somebody because what it means is that somebody is in a category and which pretty much everything that they do and they say matters and serves a purpose which is a useful an important building purpose and i will look at you and tell you that you are an and of one you certainly would meet that criteria under any conditions and it is evident in the many combanyes that youre running an the leadership that you are doing and also in your online presence a man that is how i initially came to learn about you a'm now fortunate to have an to lengthy conversations with you and a fou interspersed as well and and i'm an think of myself as a reasonable to perhaps good observer of how people behave in different domains and every time you poest or every time you speak or every time you you go on a podcast or host of podcast it is clear that not only you prepared and not only you proaching it with a spirit of i'm of seriousness that deserves but sometimes also likeness that it deserves but that there is always an element of give and that you are trying to encourage people to do better for themselves as somebody who is greatly benefited from the knowledge that you have put out there from the very first tempherisin shol rogue an episodes to your own podcasts i want ot extend a personal thanks i also want to extend great thanks for coming on here today talking to geek scientist whos but who else apas be a fellow puncrocker becauses that spirit and the heart tht's behind it and i think somebody will thing it is all about your noise and chaos it is ashy about being really true to yourself that is how i thing about the puncroxperi is really about being true to yourself in realizing the the thing that you while it might be quite different is actually if that is you you have to live in that in that vain and anstick within it certainly served me well and sons i get served you well the most ad just one extend an enormous thank you i'm you as a civilian thank you for the worth you did in the military but also teaching people about the military aany lot people do not realize what it is about at any level and learning about your experience there in what you have observed bringing other people s experiences from the military more broadly is superimportant and sharing this and being able to entertain some of my umscientific reft thank you thank you thank you w appreciated i can im it is con a weard you say all these nice things to me i i defefurlly do not deserve o muma kind of a regular du that that just kind of showed up i guess at the right time and i and told some stories about some guises that were true heroes and just im itrying to share my perspective but it is not just my perspective 'm i'm talking iabout stories that i live but there is plenty of people that ave done way more than i've ever done and and sacrifice infinitely more than i have resacrifice i'm i'm thankful for being here i know that you i put all kinds of information and i the same backatter i i have greatly benefited from the information that you put out and i thank you as well and i

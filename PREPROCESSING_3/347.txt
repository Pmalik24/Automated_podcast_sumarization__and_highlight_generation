welcome to the huberman latcongens nco science science pac to e ferli i man drew hubermen and o professor of nurobiology and opthemology at stamford' school of medicine today my guest is doctor rena malike doctor rena malikue is abord certified eurologist and pelvic surgion she is an expert in both male and female eurological pelvic floor and sexual health during to day's episode doctor malikue answers the most commonly ask questions about urinary pelvic and sexual health for instance how to avoid getting utiize urinary tract infections we also discuss pelvic florinatomy and function as it relates to overcoming an overli tight or an overli relaxed pelvic floor this is a key distinction that most people are not aware of many people here about the need to called strengthen their pelvic floor but in fact manyd people need to do the exact opposite they need to learn to relax their pelvic floor in order to achieve proper eurologic and sexual function today you will learn about that you will also learn about sexual health as it relates to erectile function as it relates to things vagenal lubrecation as it relates to orgasm we separate out very carefully the difference between psychological desire and a rousal that occurs within the genitals themselves and doctrmali hilights some important misconceptions about sexual disfunction for instance that many people believe that hormones are responsible for sexual disfunction but in reality hormon disregulation is responsible for only a very small percentage of sexual disfunction and yet pelvic floor and blood flow related issues can account for a large number of cases of sexual disfunction in both males and females i assure you that to day's discussion is going to illuminate many new areas of information many new tools and protocols that i'm g esing most people have not heard of we talk about the nurl vascular that is bloodflow related and muscular aspects of blatter function prostate function schenes glands we talk about vagional health as well as penile health we talk about these things as it relates to different stages across the life span it is a far reaching in indepth and practical conversation that i'm certain everyone will glean important take aways from now before we go any further i do want to highlight that the content of to day's episode is secual in nature we talk very directly about different types of secual behavior and we talk about it from the standpoint of the clinition and biologist it is a medical slash scientific discussion that said we cannot be aware of ware this podcast is being played and who is listenin and i assert that there are certain themes within to day's discussion that would not be suitable for young children how young well that is certainly not for us to discern we realize that different parents in different households should be the arbiters of what sorts of information their children are exposed to or not my suggestion would be that if you have any concern whatsoever that the content of to day's episode would not be appropriate to be hearde by some member of your family that you please listen to the podcast first or at least check the time stamps where we have detailed what specific topics are covered and then to make your decision accordingly i shull mention that not only as doctor malikue still an active clinition she sees patiencs daily out of her clinic in southern california and we provided a link to that clinic in the shownote captions she is also authored dozens of high quality pervieed publications in the fields of eurology pevic health and sexual health and we have also provided link to that bibliography in the shownote captions and sheis also a spectacular public educator she provide zero cost content about sexual health public floor health and eurology as it relates to both men and women on her youtwo channel and there too we pro vided link to doctor maliagues you to channel in the shownote captions to this episode before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and scigns related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is roca roca makes eye glasses and sun glasses that are of the absolute highest quality i've spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges

here at the huberman lab podcast and as always thank you for your interest in science and now for my discussion with doctor rena malik doctor rena malik welcome thank you think you then matches not nareto be here i'm delight to have you here i'm a huge fan of your content i find that you are able to deliver critical information about secxual health yourology pelvick floor lebido and many other things that are of immense interest to people but that ordinarily people do not really know where to get the high quality information and coming to you for that information means they are going to get the highest quality information i truly believe that because as everyone will soon here to day we are going to have a a very frank discussion but one that is really grounded in science and medicine around sexual health and related topics these are topics that typically people learn about perhaps a little bit in school may be at home from friends usually over hearing things i supposed to direct exploratory conversation on line pornography and at least in my experience growing up there was education around sexual health reproductive health et cetera that was more oriented toward the fever of things as tea eyes fear of unwonted pragnancy all of which of hourse is extremely important for people to learn about but far less about om sort of that healthy versions of sexual health right ye absolutely this is an especiually important conversation it is also one that i think has a back drop that we should just acknowledge right off the bat that because the information is gleaned from multible sources and because there are im less you say a influences out there that relate to the morality of different practices that there can be shame there can be misunderstanding there can be secrecy and that further leads to misinformation i'm confident that to day a you can clarify things for us and we are going to stay out of those trenches and last thing i'd to say is that because a number of terms will certainly come up that i think for some people i'm they are not used to hearing and general discourse i'm just going to get them out of the way now penus vigina anus prostate what else is there i we aren we are going to talk about libido we are going to talk about intercourse or al sexs anal sects we are going to talk about all of that i just want to get that out there that a we can reduce the a shock a the shock response elof it maye talk about all of it great to start things off in anticipation this episode i solicited for questions on social media and i got thousands of questions but there was a lot of overlap in the questions to start off i'd to talk about pelvic floor g because both males and females have a pelvic floor and mynerstanding is that there is a muscular component there is a nural muscular component there is a blood flow component what is a healthy pelvic floor what does healthy pelvic floor do and then we can talk about some of the health issues that an unhealthy pelvic floor creates and some of the ways to ameliorate an unhealthy plvic floor absolutely palvic floor very simply is basically a bowl of muscles that is connected to bones that hold up all your organ basically in your palvis there is all these muscles there and there function is essentially many it it helps with erination defication sactual function it helps with posture and having a strong healthy palvic floor can mean that you are having normal urination you are having normal defication your having great sects and that you are also not having ailments backpane or issues related to those those functions and those organs and you dont epalvic flor is is important in many different aspects an we deal with it a lot as yourologists because it is intergiral to these functions that we take care of and when you have an unhealthy palvic floor it can vary from person to person and while you hear about it a lot and women men also suffer from palvic flooridous function are problems with the palvic floor bes i public lor's function happens a lot when youre doing things if you were to go to the gim and do repetitions of of any sort of exercise and you did not rest then that muscle would become contracted an short very similarly if your palvic floor is overstrained it can become contracted and short and tight all the time and you may not know it it may just be a function of stress anxiety a or over use or posture problems things of that nature that can affect your palvic floor and this can lead to issues let start with euranation you can have symptoms of urgency frequency a meaning if to go a lot to the bathem or you have to go and have a sudden desire that you cannot delay sometimes even have leagage in some cases it can make it difficult to urinate because the pavic floor is tense or perhaps to incompletely vacate the blatter correctly you go to urinate and then you go back to your dascur and five minute later yafter urinate again exactly something of otsall it can be either that you are not apting complitly or that the pavic for muscles are tense that their stimulaing the blatar it feels there is more to go 's not always that you are not evacuating it it can present in a number of different ways and then with a with sexual function it if its very tense you can have pain you can have pain with sex you can have pain with erections you can have pain with ejaculation sometimes tit can be a lot of different kind of pain cyndrums and you are i have all these different things going on n it is really just palvic flooridas function a with with gi function you can deathly have constipation and then often you can also have back pain a and all f these things can happen when your palvic floor is to tense sometimes your public floor can be to weak and that can be often because of we see this in women a lot because of child birth delivering children a with some people of neurologic disorders they can have weak palvic floors ar connective tissue disorders lers damwell syntum for example these sorts of things can cause weakness to the palvic floor which can then cause very often what i see eorinarian continents ar leakage a which can ben no create problems for people down the line thank you for that first question how does somebody know if their pelvic floor is too tight from a a over contraction or chronic contraction of the muscles their verses too weak am an one of the challenges in having this conversation is that if we were talking about contraction of the calf muscle or the bisep i think everyone intuitively knows because they have seen the shortening of the muscles when the muscles quitit flexed and the lengthening of the muscles when it is relaxed a is there a way to describe pelvic floor muscular shortening in a way that everyone can understand would this be a a we are gin to be direct to day would this be le tensing up one's am a anis an bout the opposite of of the movement that one would do before initiating a bowle movement and relaxation is sort of the pattern of plvic floor muscular am relaxation just prior to initiating abowle movement i will shey most people cannot recognize it because it is very difficult to notice it sort of a gradual and it can over time become noticeable with these symptoms but otherwise it is very difficult because it is not a muscle that we were ever train to recognizes right you hear about keegal exercises for example and people talk about how to do them but that is all you ever hear about the palvic floor and you do not really know how to kind of do things in a way that protects your palvic floor or a or kind of what how do even tell when it is too tight or not relaxing and that takes the sort of a training and usually when people come to forse aget an examination to see if your palvic flooras tight to for women at the palvic examined for men as usually erecta exam how dos how does that exam go it is essentially palpating the muscles and also looking at the function well say for a digital palpation woule that is a medical tacknowledgy for fingers are called digits a am i'm old enough to at to recognize what a digital prostrate exam is right the physician insearcs their fingers through into the anicine and and feels the prostrate to see whether not at swollen or not and and as om saing thes i'm realiz in as sonn as we think of met medicine coniqua modern medicine evolved this is basil basically been the practice or what fifty year sixty years may be a hundred years in the same way that the the old school practice for glaucoma thus of ie pressure wats for the physician wo just touch the eyeball o folks for those do yout think that medicine has evolved much a it clearly has in many ways but umin any event a prostrate exam thosas i just described what would a what would a pelvic flor exam for a male and a puvic floor exampher a female a involve at a cont of granular level yes for for women you can feel the palic flor muscles through the vigina you can feel the elio coxages the pubocoxages the levate or ait an those are all names of different muscles in this bull is is n a physition who can feel the crar fingers and youkno you could doo you could put your finger but you to have a reference of normal right you would not know what a normal palvic floor feels verses tha tight one verses a weak one and you can assass the tenseness base on ouno palpation you can also see if there is tenderness and you can assass that base on just at a general physical examination and then also you can observe i can say contract your by squeeze your palvic floor up and and i can look and see are they squeezing or are they pushing are they coordinated or not right because that is the a function of normal youse of the palvic floor ancd sometimes you will see that theire discoordinated am you can also assass fir sensation in the arian things that that that could be consequences of disfunction to there be disfunction an laterality the pelin fors pulling up into the rit or up in to the left absolutely what tipically when you see a pavic flortharipis not not of pavic flortheripis but these are the people who do the work right they they work with you on a prolong basis to help you normalize the function of your pavic florits gorn the gim with the train are right they really work with you to get your paic floor functioning correctly and the first step to that a lotoc pavic flortharipis will just a line your bones and and your your kind of the way you sit and walk to make sure that you are not straining those muscles by pulling in different in different directions and if a mail goes to the physician to get a pelvic floor exam there is obviously a difficulty in putting fingers into the rethra one would hop a too small and opening how are they doing the pelvic flor examines it external to the badiers it through the anas some of its through the anes you can feel the muscles through the anas than you can feel the paraneal ariad fill the muscles there as well sensations soa superneal area from the outside of the bai toc am the reagion between the scrotom and the anas yes ok it sounds to me if people want to get a high quality assestiment of whether nother pelvic floor is healthy or not they nean to see a puvic flor specialist yet that its not the sort of thing that they could into on their own necessarily it would be difficult i mean there are things you can buy on line probes that you can insert an the vigina that will teach what a do keegal exercises and give you some read i of some readings but they are not really meant to diagno teyusualy something people use if they they have a weak palvic floor and they want to try to do it at home on their own also there is nothing that can to give you a baseline reading is this normal or abnormal but' talk about keagles for small whose keagle he is a a gina collegists i do not remember all the specifics to be quianas but basically he came up with keagles which are a strengthening exercise for the palvic floor and what it is what we describe it to for patience as we say you are going to there is fre different ways to describe it you are going to youse the muscles that use when you yearnit but try to stop the flow but you do not do the whon you are yearnating cause that can create disfunction you han to learn what the muscles are and then you squeeze those muscles and relax in between sets to speak and you will do the other way people describe it is pulling up and in in the ligef vigina or for men san oa you say its the feeling that you are trying to lift your penus off the floor without touching it right those are kind of yeaer o describe it those are kind of of ways that you can describe those muscles and you can squeeze for five seconds and relax for five seconds and do them in repetitions and they are just any sort of exercise you do you do not want to start doing a hundred of them right you on a do them i shell thet people i tell patients yrou them lying down that you are only focusshing on those muscles you not working on your posture youre not doing anything else and as you get better with them lying down you then sit up and do them and then once you are good with them sitting nop you can do them standing and start with you do not ten of fifteen at a time likine oa marnetine repetition to yo te onc tats oye yet ten of fifteen repetitions in the morning tend to fifteen repetitions at night a maybe one more during the middle the day but do not overdo it because just anything especialy when you are starting out you can and if you are doing tons and tons ic keagles then you will get a tight short pelvic floor muscles and you will then develop pelvic flooridous functions it is really important to kind of understand those mechanics which is why a lot of people think they know how to do keagles but they really do not and i always incorrage ile if you have the time and the resources to go to a pevic floor physical therapit they can really work with you and make sure your doing them correctly what are some of the benefits of eagles for those that need them yes they are typically prescribed for your inarring continents specifically stress your inearing contnents leagage that occurs when you have increase in your intrabdominal pressure a valsalva or coughing sneezing lifting heavy things jumping on a trampaline a for those purposes we use keagles to strengthen the palvic floor and also an women palvic organ polapse when you have weakness of the pavic floor that leads to a bulge that you can visibly see or feel in the vigina for men we often prescribe them for people who have had a prossatac to me who then subsequently develop leagage after the procetact me that is against tress herinering contenence now a lot of people use keagles recreationally because improving the paic floor musculature can lead to more intense palvic floor contractions during orgasm which can be more pleasurable and some people do it for those purposes but again i caution people not to overdo it a because then you can lead to a more tens palvic floor which is not where we wanto end up yes i will under score a that cautionary note years ago i heard about keagles si cogill try it sounds all good right i only heard good things about keagles am and what quickly resulted in was painful urination and i thought this is weird everyone sayind keagles are great and the best thing i could do for my palic floor t seemed was to avoid keagles yes aum and lobit later all when were talk about prostrate ii'll explain at least what my experience was as it relates to the prostrate but i guess the tako message that i'm gathering from what your tlling us iys that strengthening the pelic floor is great if you have a weak palvic floor strengthening your peuic floor further if you have a strong pelvic floor can be detrimental it can be it can be as if you overtrain it just if you overtrain anything else and a you just have to if you really want to do keagles if you have any symptoms at all you described painful euranation or the things i've describe pain with erections pain with a g aculation pain a difficulty emptying any of those symptoms stop and go see a yeurologist that they can kind of assessior pavic floor what is the antikeygl in other words if somebody decides that they have a tight plvic floor how can they learn to relax their pelvic floor there is a lot of different sort of things that you can do fur a women you can do mesage of the area you can use vagional dilators to help relax hen muscles you can take sepositories that have medications valium or backlefen which are muscle relaxents and a that can help as well although they are not treatments ther more of abandaed but they can help with the symptoms that you are having and then a you can also i think the best thing is to work with the physical therpis cause they can teach you certain exercises that will help down train the palvic floor for example one of the ones i tell my patients is happy baby pois it actually enoustratches and elongates the palvic flar muscles doing these exercises regularly will help you lengthen the palpic flar muscles one thing that i've experienced extreme painfrom and that stopping was one of the best things that ever happened for my pelvic floor was to not do any kind of crunching movement with my legs crossed i would go these yog of classes one in my life and i they would have evrybody o these crunches and i've always done some abdominal work here and there during the week if i'm being diligent but they would have us cross our feet and that seem to lead to some palvic floor discomfort that was similar to what iad experienced when i did the keygles yeso gaint for me seesing te keygoles was one of the best assitions i ever made i only do them for a short whiles i get this is clearly not for made and i gess that is another point i'm that tell me if you agree were not that if you hear about something on line or on this podcast or anywhere else and you tried and it seems to be sending things in the wrong direction either you are doing it wronger it might not be the right thing for you exactly an i think all too often we hear this thing is great and people jump on that ban wagon and than they an up worsening thei prolmis or developing prolmise were they did not have them previously but is there anything about the anatomy of the nermuscular connextions or ore vasculature of the palvi floor that would provide support for my experience ther that doing crunches with legs crosses essentially is it possible that is creating a symetries on the pelvic floor and now i'm sure i'm angry yogateachers and umc cruncha crunchin eas stos everywhere but heh if it is the question of your plvic floor of fou extra umdelineations in your abs where my votes going there is the couple things here that we should dive into one is that people do not often breathe correctly during exercise ra and diaphermatic breathing is is really impornt which is a deep breath that expands the dia fram not kind of shalo brating that just in your mouth and throw and that is actually when you tyou now when you do any sort of exercise the your trainer will tell you exhale on the effort right and there is a reason for that because when you inhale your palvic floor relaxes when you exhale your palvic floor contracts and it actually that contraction stablizes the palvic florsa whatever intrabdominal pressure your your causing to increase from the exercise whether it is a squat or as crunch or whatever your increasing your abdominal pressure your palic floor is then contracting to help stablize that and part part of the reason people tend to hold their breath during crunches right they do not do the appropriate breathing and that can be part of it the other thing that can happen with certain things is that there are nerves and arries particularly the pedendal nerve and the pedental artery that run through the palvic floor when you get palvic flooridous function you can cause decrease blood flow to the to the palvic floor muscles which can affactsectual function and you can get nerve inflammation as well that can all theyll cause pain and thell they the kind of halidill comes together glad ht you mention blood flow i think our entire discussion to day should be framed up at least in the back of our minds in the minds of our listeners an vewers as involving at least three things any time we are talking abut erectile function or disfunction or pelvic flor functionor disfunction or vaginal lubrication or lack thereof we needto think about the hormonal influences the blood flow related influences and the nurl influences including the nurl influences that come from the brain the signals of arowzle for instance ore lack of aralsal tam and on am we will not be overly systematic in in our a parsing of all this but i i think what you just mention raises really important point that sometimes in an effort to do something that is good for the muscles strength in the muscles one will cut off blood flow in fact one of the more common questions i got and i consulted with a couple of exercise physiologists about this and they confirmed that a lot of people who squat and dead lift heavy in the gim or even who just tence their pelvic floor when they are doing things dumbell curls were other exercises and especially people who seem to do a lot of abdominal work reported to me in the questions that they experience things erectile this function that they experience things pangering vasinal intercourse that essentially they had created some sort of sounds to me a hyper contraction of the muscles in that area that were impeding all the things that they wanted as either side effects are direct effects of exercise because many people are exercising for sthetic reasons and health reasons but nowadays it seems especially on the male side but we all struck abo their old testoster on the female side a lot of males lift waights in order to increase their testosterone and for reasons that are obvious also want have healthy sexual function and here they are doing this thing that is very good for increasing testostrone if they'r doing it correctly and tostostrone is involved in libido in the male sexual response end the female sexual response of course but they are impeding their erections you can start to see how a there are probably a lot of confused and may beven distraught people out there they are trying to do all the right things and thei're setting up rode blocks and even a sending themselves backward in some cases the question is how does one know whether not something a let us a low lubrication or painduring vagunal intercourse or a loss of rectile strength or some sort of erectile disfunction whatever it may be cause it can take on different forms as will talk about how does one know if it is blood flow related hornmone related or nural related and if it is nor related how does one know of it is issue of lack of appropriate signals from the brain over suppression or lack of o rousal from the brain or whether not at some pariferal neral thing of enervation of the pina ervigin i think there is there is a lot that we can go into here but esectually first you one to find out very specifically what is going on are you getting aroused are you having arections are you masterbating there is all these questions that will help us go down therose sorrito interrup when you say aroused a forsake in this discussion i just want to make sure that we distinguish between psychological arousal the desire to do a i guess here we also have to be precise a arousal to engaging intercorsing arousal to a desire essentially eri think people learn torecognize or we talking about a rousal as the response of the ganitals correct o desire and arousal this is a very important concapt does not always go in one direction sometimes you can feel arousal meaning you have the tell tall siens of arousal your nipples get e rect you have more lubrecation if you are a female you really mal when fou mal nipples get erector in er ro believe somethink no a you maybe get the sex flush whet you get some some redness or or warmth feeling that is your body's response write to arousal and sometimes that can be an erection and sometimes that is not not having an erection does not mean you are not aroused it may mean other things but certainly that is part of it and then desire do you want to have sex do you have delic when you think about your partner or who whoever you want to engage with to their desire to actually do that right or res it just more of obligation or other things and doesn it desire it does not matter f the desire comes after arousal for some women in particular we see that they may not have the desire right away but they want to be intimate or close with their partner and they will start just being close with them and then arousal will come and then oh ye i'd this then the desire comes after and that is normal that is totally fine anso you want a kind of part that out and then for men you can ask are you getting erections at night because that will tell us the function of your organ at night verses during the day where you have also psychogenic components right you can really get in your head about erections when you have a problem in the bedroom with performance it becomes a vicious pcycle rite you you have a problem the next time your really strest you are not present you are not mindful in the moment with sex and you are thinking about on ma got a megana perform oc a migat a performo and then it does not perform again and your just it is getting worse and worse the anxiety is through the roof and that is actually causing your sexual disfunction i think it is it is important first to identify those issues and then also for a bloodflow a lovetimes we can we can assass pased on well what other comorbities do you have do you have other issues on going that may be affecting your bloodflow most common high blood pressure dibetis heart disease and if you smoke all of those things will effect blood flow to the genitals and that will point tetive negatively negatively that will point us to a more vascular issue hormonal issues are are very important for desire and and as far as sexual function in terms of erections there is only three per cent of erectile this function is related to hormones it' tact does wonder a rectal function correct as opposed to desire gressias wire it isdesire is predominantly modulated by the hormontostostrom for both men and women in fact if you a lot of people do not know this but women have more testastrone in their bodies an they actually have astragent tosaftoms very important for both men and women for variety of reasons and you ouna using that discussion with the patient will help you kind of identify weare your headed in terms of a what you need to focus on for treatment there are certain things you can use to assess blood flow you can do dopler ultrasounds of the penus as well as the cliterist to see if there is good blood flow you can assess the peqsostolic velacity which will tell you if there is a problem with are tul inflow verses the end diostolic velacity which will tell you if there is a problem with venus outflow and that can assess those things there are some tuss you can do for nerve function although their very uncommonly done because mostly w e can kind who get that through clinical report and unfortunately if your having nerve pobs sumetimes it depends on what is causing them but somethimes they can be very difficult to reverse and that is kind of a problem we know that as people age their sensation becomes less just through aging the nerves the receptors become less sensitive and you will generally have less reresponsiveness to the same sensations you did when you are younger and that can have overlays all of this it is complex but really iu kno a lot of it comes from the discussion you have with your patient or you kind of really doing a deep ave in what is going on really thinking about each of those aspects and also what is going on your relationship and what is going on in ean of your life stras tangsiety the coware thos is a thing ro as many of i've been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve som delighted that they are sponsoring the pod cast a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a g one i'm sure to get enough vitements and minerals and the probiotics that i need end it also contains adaptagence to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a g one if you would to try ag one they will to drink g one dok com slash hubermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs puss a year supply of vitem in d three k to again that is drink a g one do com slash hubermen gush lots there to adpack em and i'm glad you mention the relationship itself because im there all sorts of things that can impact the are alsil response a novelty i'mnot everyone is in a committed relationship whethe're not people are engaging in a lot of asturbation to the point of ejaculation or climax or not em fornography et cetera wewe will get into that a it is a vast space to explore before we go any further i want to make sure however that we cu people to where and how they could find a really good let us a pelvic floor a therapist and where they could find a really great eurologist to do the sorts of exams and perhaps the sorts of treatments that we have talked about because em at least as far as i understand much of what people want to learn on this pod cass is how things work and what happens one things s break down but also aw to resolve those issues let say somebody wants to check out their palvic floor figure out what is going on there maybe there having issues may be there not if they are male or female where do they go wtis their place on line that has a great list of of some of the best ones one's aria can be done over tella medicone no howhas one go about that yet in terms of your palvic floor it is good to get assessed by a physician who specializes plvic floor d now that could be a eurologist that could be a ynachologist or even a physical medicine n rehabilitation doctor that specializes in palvic floor health typically you will see a in eurology you look for people who are bored certified in female palvic medicine an reconstructive surgery if you are woman if you are man may be sexual medicine a some one who specialize in sexual medicine would be a good place to look for gina call just a ganuine look at some one who has interest in this area who aeno does manage palvic floor and then in terms of palvic floor a physical mesonreabilitation at least when i was in traying there is about twenty piumin ir doctors areoun the country who really focust on this it is not a lot of people if you can go to a palvic floor physical herapis and you have one near you that is great as well you a you do want to make sure that one may do are certified in pavic floor physical therapy and that they have taken care of your gender if you have male anatomy that you want to go to someone whos actually seen men because a lot of the pavic floor physical therapist tend to treat a lot of women and that is kind of what i tell my patients generaly speaking there is no tleast to my knowledge no great resourceine may be will will look that up in safely and fine one that is very helpful thank you and because it again going back to what i said the beginning of our conversation think there is a lot of no shame or at least lack of clarity is to how one gets help for issues that a relate to the genitals because if you have a headacre you having and i issue an or nowhere to go yem ofully you are head k does not warrnt going to inter all just what it might istuff thencto be o them all jis optomatristr i do not think we hear often enough about where to access the best quality care for these senct thank you for that in thinking about sexual disfunction i'd to have that conversation more o less in parallel if we can round male sexual disfunction an female sexual disfunction and i one to make sure that before we do that tha dom creating the correct parallel construction as they say erectile disfunction in males is clearly a form of sexual disfunction what is the parallel to erectile this function in females is it lack of vatunal lubrication and lack of relaxation of the magina to have non painful intercourse is there is it even possible toave a parallel conversation about these two things it is different in in some circumstances there theare homalogues right the penus is the homalogue of the cliterist right the cliterus is the essentualy the same sort of spungy erectile tissue that you see in the penus it gets erect with erousal and it is it actually extends very deep into the palvi it is not just a small little organance actually quite long and you can in men you can have erectile thisfunction cause you can see it but in women you may have difficulty with orgasm and it is not exactly a parallel but difficulty orgasming in women is multyfactorial and can get into that but i think the're the're ther different and i think also sexual disfunction presents differently in both genders when you talk about men thei're very the one visual they see of arousal is erections and it becomes very in grained in your psyche that if i do not have an erection i'm not aroused right but thereis a lot of reasons that you might not have an erection that we have sort o touched on vascular problems harmonal problems nor logic problems a psychogetic issues and other medications you are taking there are issues that can effect a ractile function and and that can be part of it where yeu know you might feel you have low desire because tyoure rousals not there not becomes a little bit confusing for women what they can assas is their level of lubrication if sects herts and if they get an argat them and those are kind of the ways you can look at it thank you for fleshing all that out years ago i worked on sexual diferentiation an in particular the role of hormones in sexual diferentiation and indeed as you described we learn because we were taught and i think a people still generally agree that if one looks at the embryological origins of the penus and the cliterus they are ssentually analegous structures a and that a lot of male genital development involves literlly the regression the disappearance of the female sexual genitaliunassociated or gins molaryan duck somethings that and what would become the overies become the testies et cetera et cetera those are inatomical parallels but whill you just describe for us a very beautifully is the rfunctional parallels has it relates to sexual function and disfunction i'm hoping with tat framing that we can a that we can a knock down a few these pins a in a little less time because there is a lot to tackle here first off id to daddress the hormonal issues you mention that only three per cent of rectile dis function and by extension can we say also a female a issues wet sexual rousal or hormonal an origin is that right with desire yes ochey are harmonal and in general an arousal in terms of lubrication if youre using that as a as a barometer yes you can see less vagn lubrication do to harmones and i cexecy three to six per cent mor up to six percent we see of erecthiw tos function is harmonal it is a small percentage of the entire entirely of erectile t' function as i think in looking on the landscape of social media podcast and and just in the common a mind set we have all come to believe that testostrone is prolabido it is pro desire in men and women think now people ar strng appreciate thats pro desire in women as well zurlian men and that dopamine is also associate with desire and the general public tens to have this view of estrogen is being sort of anti labido or anti male which is frankly false in fact en ove cover this on the podcast with doctor collgelatten with doctor peter attia and another fellow a utuber a deric for more plates moredates has talked a lot about the fact that if people if men excuse me take drugs an astrozol to suppress the restrogen thinking that oh it is all about having high tostosteron loestrogen oftentimes they crush their labida just abolish it awhich has led to a slowly growing but ai think positive shift in how people ore thing about estergen esterogen's greate for brain function estrogen's greate for labido in men and women and that is a revision of a i think how most people think of the male sexual response it is more in keeping without people think about the female sexual response oh esterogen and the female sexual response that that make sense but wet were trying to do here is clarify some of the a mis conceptions now the reason i mention dopamine is that my understanding is that dopomine is involved in the eralt theexcuses me the desire response we will distinguish desire the psychological arousal from genital arousal physical arousal and that prolactin is associated with the refractory period during which irection cannot occur another perhaps orgasm cannot occur in females et cetera but my understanding is that is also not at simple and we need to take a step back perhaps and just talk about the physiological underpinnings of the desire and an arousal response i'll tell you what i was taught and the can tell me where it is wrong i hope i was taught that the erection response and the ragenal lubrication response is generated by the para sympathetic nervous system the relaxed the rest and digest aspect of the nervous system hence why some people can get psychogenic sexual issues of lack of erection or lack of vagional lubrication but that there are individuals out there for whom a lot of alertness may be even and this is a controversial thing but for some people even some sense of aggression or kind of eginess or excitement adrenolin in other words can stimulate irection or vational lubrication it gets tricky i it is not the tex books is not it they taught us in high school as far as i know i was taught that the arousal response in males of females is initiate by a para sympathetic to relaxed tone and that as sexual desire and a rousal and sex or masturbation progresses that it shifts more towards the sympathetic nervous system which has nothing do with temotional sympathy and has everything to do with arousal the catacolamines dopamy norepanafran an epanafran also called ae drenalinan nora drenalin a released and that the climax response it which mayor may not include ejaculation we have to separate that out is one that is really of the stress system of the body and then in the postcoidal or postejaculatory or postclimax phase than there is a shift back to the para sympathetic nervous system that is where om the a pillotac and the a the exchange of a odors and tastes and other molecules is known to enhance parbonding through things oxytosin vaso presson and on and at what i just described is exceedingly oversymplified i realize but is that more or less how the physiology works yes a the way where tot in medical schools point and shoot thepoint is the pari sympathetic nervi te tinal yor all the maadints that one and that teder you go on to the sympathetic nerves but it makes thene and the reason that i think youre hearing ab t this aggression or or these things there leading to arousal is because there needs to be a stimulus rigt a visual stimulus a tactile stimulus some sort of stimulus at you'r getting that is then causing the release of nitric oxide from the parisympthic nervou system and that could be for some people aggression or some form of that right yes al wy people about nitri goxide because we will get into this when we talk about am drug stat increased blood flow na yalish by agra and also am non prescription drugs things a elsea triline nargine and am water mellon for that matter ri ow ans that i read on the inturn a get hom yet nitric oxide is essentially the ignition for what we say for erections dignition for erections that we if you thought the reason i talk about erections more often as when you look at the data in fact there was a paper on this where they looked at the number of articles that came up when you put in the word penus and the number of articles that came up when you put n the word cliterus and it with fifty thousand about penus and two thousand about the cliterus ocan we have this was actia major section of the comments yet on when i asked for for questions on in stegam i'm in comments on comments and ye how come am why not a et cetera is that because the eurology and am sexual heallh field was dominated by men that is going to be the presumption wor's it because it is easier to study somehow oer i men what what is going on here we i think there is been a lot of am andyou can go back to froid where he thought that that the female sexual response was less valuable and and there are some some res valuble i yes i not li thas te right i arm b o no noon no i oi r turis man an i wit these woin i to d you sad with it right wl yo at was but it was more about the male sexual response than the female sexual response and in general yes there is there were more men in medicine there was more an it is easier to study right you cannot say the clearest uite as easy as you can study the male penus response cause you can see it visually you can injected and see and erection response where yuwe do this for people who have rectile this function they will take medications that increase blood flow trimaxs you will injectit into the penus and you will see in erections you can actually try mix trymac there is it is ingured all the entarmal lon is just when we what ar you enjecting te ton there there are they are three basically brand names of intricavernosal injections that we use for rectile this function i hear injection an nicent i i think i i to think that it reflects a unnatural maler swhats i sort of a om i taken aback at mas is a poic for contractthece oh it is it is cary to hear about it is a very small needle it is very well tolerated i've dot it to pations ain the office and they look im mesey ou're done they do not even it is it is not as painful as it seems and when you are not having erections and you have tried multiple things people get to the point where they are willing to try that i and and it is very effective as the most effective non sorgical treatmend we have for rectile this function and it is usually either one medication two medications are three you can have i'll procide paverine and third one that is yea wecan om lok a son put in the comis om i surely they wom what what is it design to do as it is it om a eas o tolater a sort they they the work in different mechanism but similar to the medications that we have p t five inhibiters pt five in hibiters work in te erection cascade basically what happens let us ectu mutst tay get back to the nitric oxide thing will get there nitri goxside essentually is released by the end ofthelium in response to a visual tactile stimulat stimulating cu right and your body releases nitricoxide which then sets off the cascade for the erection and that release is f g n p which is which is causes the erection and it is degraded by phospho diasteras and medications that inhibit fosshood diesterace viagara and sialis tend to prevent the break down of that sigian piecee have longer lasting erections and similarly these medications work sort of similar to that some of them we do not know exactly how they work but they work by increase increasing segyan pier s an p that are involved in those cascades and what about else trilling i heareabout else sotriling used to sait over the counter supplement and it is in the argening pathway and o my understanding is that it work similarly to things a sealosphiagra but is perhaps not as potent else suggust a cautionary no dout there else triling can give people vicious cold sores an canker sores vicious a you heare about this on the nternatit is been verified by grotesque images that you do not want to gougle for and not every one tolerates it well these actually work by increasing nitric oxide they are not in the they are not later down the pathway theire actually increasing the availability of nitric oxide ell argening is the more direct pathway but it is very low bileavalability elsitralyin converts tell argening but it is last much longer in the bloudstrin which is why people tend to use elsa trilling now in in sexual medicin these supplements while therehas been some studies on them and they are effactive there is no regulation on the supplement industry we can recommend them but we just cannot say that for sure that the supplement is exactly whats said on the bottle we see lots of studies where theyll say i read one about melatonan and there is a variation of melatonen from what is on the bottle to four hun per cent times more and that is kind of the struggle that we as medical doctors have at i know we get a lot of slack for it that we do not talk about supplements but it is really the challenge there is finding the quality supplement a great site is a which i've no a relationship to i except that i mention them all the time is examined not calm ow mich at it has references to human studyes r send where there is a lot of effic to sy shown and wel get into some side offect issues does cannot address bri am quality by brandissues but m thanks for mentioning that what percentage of males who take sealis am ttaca to dalphil or viagra wer rectile this function get a relief from that because you mention only three percent of erectile issues an males or formamally in origin but what per centage ar likely to be bloodflow related in origin a large per centage our blood fl related that does not mean that the medication will be effective for every one if you look at the large percentage are are vascular in nature at that is the number one cause in in as men age we know that about fifty per cent of fifty two percent of men over the age of forty will have erectile tis function and that continues to increase as you age afifty percent of fifty year old sixty percent of sixty year old and on and forth it is very very common and the success rate in the studies os about sixty to seventy per cent when you give some one a medication they will have sustaind erections that are sufficient per penetrative intercourse which is the way we kind of discuss erectile tis function in studies and in uno with pations is is about sixty to seventy per cent not every one will have success but not all f that is because the medication does not work a sometimes people are not taking them correctly is ye iling to tri to frent doses and then they are still this issue of your your brain is tolactive and if your having anxietyor having otheir issues are stress in your life thact can havan af fact on your ability to create in erection there is lots of factors that go into it a but generally speaking they are factive and they do work quite well and they are tolerated pretty well as tise ti seveny percent is not a small number tha that is a significant number that is the majority aat by i significant margin is there abasius for the use of a sals a to dalphil viagra a elssitruline im in females tho yet there there is not a lot of dayt on this but certainly ou know if you have surmise that there is a blood flow issue and ther having difficulties with orgas them in certainly comething can tryalfully bull and certainly people do try i try these medications offulyable to see if they improve sacual function for women but there is not a whole bunch of robust randomats control trial studies on women with with these medications lubit later we will talk about prostrate health specifically but i'm just going to im make a note here that im nowadays there is i'm increasing use of lo dosage im sealis slash to dalifill i'm rather than i what i found on line was that the erectile disfunction treatment dosage of seals to dalfills somewhere in the u fifteen to twenty miligram range what we are talking about here is i'm daily use of im two point five to five miligrams of seals to dlfille for prostrate health and i learned in researching for this episode that im todalfill ealis was actually developed as a drug for the treatment of prostrate health to am essentially increased bloodflow the prostrate to increase prostrate health not for the treatment of rectile this function i i found that to be somewhat interesting im and a lot of people are now starting to use that i also learned that am if you dive into the a the guts of the innernet im one can find that now there is a growing use of combined lodosage sealis an apil morphine which is a prodopamanurgect agent i will get back to dopeing a liment later but im is there any basis for lo dosage say two point five to five miligram daily use of sealis to dalifille in females yet tho wel let us talk about it for males and themales i think lo dose daily sealis is excellent for eractile function in men evens that true even a sorry interrupted that tru even for men that are not experiencing erectile this function it is not indicated for that purpose but there is a thought that its increasing blood flow to the aria thou people i i've personally used it for men who have paw the pain to help with increatsing blood flow you can also use it potentially as a preventative to some people have you do not could have thought that'l gets incresing blood floods preventing fibrosis of that erectile tissue that can happen with age or otheir vasculair problems though it may be beneficial for that as well although again that is awf label and not something that we generally am promote a as far as for women there is again it can help with blood fuss if your having issues of you have a females having sexual disfunction and she is got kinds of vask their problems that she is got a dibedies highblood pressure she smoke sent yes its certainly reasonable to try and see how they do usually want to give at least a four week trial to see if there is any benefit with those medications g thank you for that why is it that i get many questions about erectile this function from males who were in their twenties and thirties because everything you said up until now was mainly focased on men forty years and older is it from lack of physical activity over usive niccotine by the way vaping as far as we know vaping in smoking bad for erectile function and perhaps sexual health and males and females generally because nicotine is aves o constrictor nicting does have certain benefits and i cover this in an episode on niccotine am norcognive benefits in a the elderly in particular but it is of as a constrictor it runs against all of the a sexual rousal stuff that were talking about m but okat let us assume that a male in their twenties or thirtesis sleeping enough sixteeght hours a night is exercising is not doing anything to punish their pelvic floor in the gim the're not doing a legs cross keagles while doing cruncties or something while inhaling i i that was a quiz by the way of fer earlier topics covered let us assume their yu know eating pretty well majory the foods are coming from non process or manly process foods the dunal meditation each day their engaging in hopefully healthy relationships they are not masterbeting crazy to porn and i let us assume that they are not on any assessori wire all these twenty thirty yearls on the innernet asking mainly you this is they a runder you but also to my direct messages about their rectile ofshues i will say i have seen a lot of young men in my clinic and i will say that they very often have pavic flartis function that even though they are doing all the right things there they do hav me were in istressful society to you can try all the things to be to dencrease your stress but lot of us are sitting long periods of time especially during covit i mean people sat for month right years just sitting at their home competer and exercising one hour is not gon off at the day full of sitting and all of those things can affect puvic flor functions my theoryes that that is probably the more common cause to walk more yeive atuis etanding desk yewalk more standing desk wo case and then my guests is that there is some psychogenic feed back loop absolutely just ner speak for things are not working as well as they would than thei're stressing about it in the stress is making things worse absolutely and u now you mention that people are not master bating or youre using porn but a lot of people learn about sex ther porn whether it is good or bad we cannot it is not a great think but that is accessible now when we were growing up you had to find af ece are you had to find a quiet room that no one was in a walk in i'm enough to rememberen the ton the stret i will not mention em a by last name but yet kiddon the street ou kno had am porno magazines yor magazine and then there was ashy a library of these goodness ession say whether they wherem in the til thiy groping where kids would stash them in am in spisvy locations in parking lots and then you not boys would biker scape word over wuld walk over and then they would take terms take difference use me looking at them but that that actually is to raise a perhaps a more important point am which is that looking at pornography is different in masterbating to pornography which is also diffrenthan masterbating to pornography to the point of ejaculation right because am i also get a lot of questions from people about their porn ediction issues and there is a growing theory out there that overuse that meaning not just looking at but a masterbating to porngraphy to the point of ejaculation is creating a deficit of seeking out an am decultivating healthy real world sexual interactions yes i wentit i went at start this before i get into that is is to say that if your mastering to porin and you have normal healthy relationships and your going to work and your have a great we no a partner and you aevereathing great in your life it' cate shame is the real problem and i maye the watching pornography together yes i think inviting it is important though that it least in a literature they describe they do not describe pornediction they call it por problematic pornography youth and it is only describe ing about four per cent of people in these studies it is it is a small subset of people i think it is becoming more common because pornography is excessible and it it act tobes ta dopeming pathways just thik any other sort of eddiction rite you you watch pornography you get a dopa men response your brain then ays though i want o i want that again and you keep seeking more novel more a grassive different types of pornography to get that same m responds but it does not happen t everybody butd although i would say it is sorry at ginteru but that the dopeing response as it as a hard word biological mechanism for adaptive behaviors including unless just a fine healthy secual behavior because i feel there' such a range on that dependngon one's background religious beliefs it tetter any time we talk about sects on this podcastelic to say that involves at least poor things obviously consensual age appropriate contect appropriate species appropriate yes absolutely absolte thati'm thatreally glad you brought that upste i've pherade you sget at befor but it is very important and i think there is a spectrum a large spectrum of people who watch ponography exjactly to ponography and have a normal life and that is fine i think that if we shame those people were creating problems right we say oh you udo that that is horrible and then they are in their head right and their causing problems in their life because they because of shame and there is i think there is a little bit of am cultural shame that comes of this discussion and it is a problem in the long term if we if we say that oh this is goin create promisan not everyone has theire's many people who watch ponography and have no problems who have normal healthy relationship's great sex with their partner and it is fine or theywere not regaring orther between relationships ye and the relying on masturbation specifically i are there any data that distinguish between m just pure imagination phantasy verses visual phantasy as it relates to developing or inhibiting sexual health and here we tling about the desire aspect let us assume physical arousals handled i do not ont intended i think that a the the the think about young people are want to get back to that the l in's your question but the thing about young people who are watching piography that is what they think sact i supposed to be they do not get an education about hat sex is right no one has the conversation with their kids hagis this is what happens when you have sexes how long it should take this is what for play is and this is not normal this is the production this is a produced product that meant to arouse yo right and and to give you idealy an ejaculation are an argasm right o no one has that discussions that then go to relationships lake wi and my partner not react that woman did on the porno right or why did i not react that woman did on the pornout ra why did not he react ye when they whould in porn because can ni think females or watching pornis well dectly no i think i shall i think that a you raise of really critical point rhichs at this shame can extend both ways and i think to that and that is a problem and and because it is excessible i think we need to have conversations that think it needs to be open we have to talk abut sex and tht's what kind of why do what i do we have to have these conversations people know wat normalis thank you for that i do think that a people need to know what normal is in what the range on normal is keeping the constraints that we talked about place earlier because i do think those are universal healthy constraint ie cinsensual age appropriate contects appropriate species appropriate or i to take a quickbreak and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracter inside tracrs a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood endiane

imagined the pure imagination based arousal verses am visual arousal and for some people the sounds of of people having sec is extremely arousing ifyou ever lived in a major city new york wich ust wit summers in the you hear lot yr more more often than you do in there is where people are living further bar you hear people having sex ya it is by it is part of the art of the auditory landscape yet youare very close together a but yet there is not exactly at least to my knowledge i do not know of the data that looks at fantasy verses visual vorses auditory but i will say that you can get habituated to certain things and there is that data that maybe you can get habituated to watching a certain type of thing to get aroused and then normal things do not get you aroused right you may watch phronography and then you may have difficulty getting aroused or turned on when you see your partner a you may get used to mastrating a certain way right if you use certain barbratory stimulation or certain pressur sensation every single time you masterbay you can get habituated to that and you may not be able to rapplicate that during penetrative intercourse a and i think that is really important and i think the take home as to try and vary what you are doing masterbation is fine healthy way of self exploration again with the cavit as long as you are not masterbating to access and avoiding your obligations are your family your partners your friends right the are just masterating for the the benefits of maybe sleep improve ment moodboostaying reduction in anxiety those tho those things are great and i think a with that beings that you just find it be thoughtful about verying itat one of the issues with masturbation thave talked about when i was a guest on other podcasts amainling the context of mal masturbation and perhaps with pornography perhaps not is that it is pretty clear base on the dt a surrounding a diction that any time there big increases in dopomin without a lot of effort required to generate that dopomin turning on pornography on the innernet verses asking one out on a dat going out on a day again but iing about going through the conversations and the mading ritual that is the human mading ritual that of course in the contects of healthy interactions ivolves getting mutual consent and these kinds of things right that you could imagine how with without placing any moral judgment on it without shaming anybody you could imagine that if somebody exclusively masturbated and did not develop the skills of courtship and building healthy sexual relationships that pornography end or masturbation could start to create quoting qu problems right whereby somebody only felt comfortable in those domains i think that is what i'm hearing more and more about whend it seems to be young men reach out absolutely and i think you are it is eftly the ease of access right but i think that is pervasive in the young society now you do not have to actually go and find a mate you can just go on an at and look for somebody right there is there is ot anyome of finding in it man i was wined in the ero when a no smartphon trinthing and a no a my point as i think that we'e become very am connected to technology in our world which also means that we are having less conversations the younger generation is having less conversations and more on line conversations than i think that the skale that yis to be developed as well and i think part of that is contributing to all this is woln one thing that i can attest to is that i grew up in a community of mostly male friends i've fremale friends always have am where a lot of what we learned about sex came from older my case guys my sister probably learned alabout sex from her female friends a and there was always that one guy who would just say stuff that years later i realize was incredibly misleading inaeven just detrimental and i just wont to remind people that when you are on readit or anywhere on the inner net and there is people saying things with certainty am they might be that guy ye right up an and am and if you look at the if i look at the long ark of those people that guy's life it it did not speak to a tremendous success in the domain for which they were asserting such confidence let me op it ot that way ok am i'd to slightly pivit to a different aspect tof this conversation because it is just really critical which is the female sexual response this is something that am does not get enough discussion absoluntly and there is a lot of stereotypes write the stereotype that we hereabout is oh they need more for play which can be true some cases is not true a the stereotype is that women are more a intimacy in relationship based in their sexual response that cannot be true i have female friends and have known women who also are just really interest in having sex for sex sake at times or maybe all the time a i think i'd to think that we are past the stage of human development where the stereotypes around this are a are fixed right and i an and we hear more about this than we see more about this now but what is the real deal around the female rousal response and then we ill talk about female orgaism response and there i'm just going to you are mork now that any time we say something a rousal or orgasm the remultible forms of that om then we will talk about the multiple forms of female organism yeso if you talk about the responsesychle you can go back to the research of masters and johnson and what they did this was way back ene and they actually watched sex workers have sex and this was i gess hi'll cayback fon malsic heat with men that they watched and to they took note of the the site the kind of the steps of the female arousal or sexual response and the first phase is excitement writ and during that phase your heartrate goes at yeur breathing little heavier there is the sex flash you can see redness and areas yet you kowing the volva in the breast imen nipples and then you go to sort and that can last a variety of different times you'l also start seeing some lubrication vaginatly right and then the plateau response is when that is kind of at its pique an a kin astays steady and then you reach organasm and orgaasm essentially is a response to the body where you will have again increased sympathetic response and you will have palvic flor mustle contractions which are rhythmic about point eight seconds or you are having a rhythmic public floor contraction along with the sensation of organasm and then you will have your recovery period which you talk tabout brieflhe earlier which can have sort of a refractory time period at which point you can no longer orgaasm again if you to or for men to obtain another erection again for a short period of time and that can be kind of an absolute refactory period where it is deafly not happening and than a relative refactory period where you need something more novel and exciting to then again resume that cyclic a coolish effect thewoas effect before on this podcast i'll just cuw people to it a a time stampe link in the shown o caption we do not go the down the path but one thing that is really important understand is that the coolege effect is present in both males and females meaning if a male ejaculates and am is of the feeling that they cannot have another erection for some period of time the presentation of a novele i guess we should sak partner because we coun be tong amout homosexual relationship pered not just heatersexual but a a novel sexual partner female or male depending on their a their proclivities am can override the refactory period m and they can have another erection and ejaculation am similarly a female will have a postor gasmic refactory period if they are am giveng an adequate stimulus r a something arousing enough they can am experience arouso orgasum again and we know based on really good farmacology that this is a a dopoming driven a thing the prolactin is essentialy establishing the refractory period in the dopamine is essentially overriding the refractory period fascinating ner chemistory there a and speaks to the incredible extent to which the brain is controlling the genitals yet let me e we always stay insexual medicon that the brain is the most powerful argan for sacts not not your genitales but the brain because it is powerful an i'm not ch of forna touch on thes later but ol bring it up now there are some sentually acting medications now available for ther aftera proof for pree men of poslo women with low libita t maybe hanthrow thos out was the one that i'm aware of a is a in that is often used in the sa niche cultures a is milanacite simulating hormon in men on which gives people at hand makes them erect a milanacite simuling hormon at emasage comes from the medial petutarif i'm not mistaken am one of those weird regions no everence at but anter but e ah but and people are now injacting this is a peptide in can cause ripism i have not had that experience iv never tried this am i mustah but itold that it it people are getting cavalier with it they can on havishes a prepism being enduring and perhaps even final erection is that true thou in prie is a i reis is them a yo ts actully from pritis the greek god whois often photographed with a really big erection whil i'm grang yu ot about that ego in a that a uts at roman roman a reek but y ma either we a it is an erection that last longer than four hours and it is actually a surgical or it is not a cergical but it is an actually an emergency if you have an erectio that last longer than four hours in the absence of in o sexual erousal thend it is important to get to an emergency rom because at that point you constrc developing decrease blood flow and ultimately nchanges to the actual tissues scarring fibrosis a its trealy important to actually go to the emerge whom do not wait cause your embarrassed a really get there and get treated however if i'm not mistaken earlier you mention that it is exceedingly rare that people who take sialis slash to dalafill wer viagra for erections are getting true pripizme correct and it is mostly from a those injectuables we talked about earlier those intrcavernosal injections people can get priism from those a little bit more commonly and that something we always counselon and also certain medications trasidone a or if you have sicle selanemia those are the most common reasons that we see people coming and pritasi don really o camman refraine from my an desire o figure out that one i do not take us down a rabbit whole here si when ont to get back to the ames ach there is actually in afty iprove medication called bremalanatide is the bran name vilisi is the a the s brinmaoton is a generic name vilisi is the brand name which is afty approved for women with with lo des i hypo active sectual desired disorder premen apozzle women premen apuzzle because tat's what they studied but it is basically the same peptite wright it is a milano court in receptor agonist and it works dopaino on the the brain pathways to increase desire it is taken as an injectable again just you e said about an hour o forty five minutes before want when you want to want you take it forty five minutes before and it works quite effectively in increasing desire how long does it last about twenty four hours some people may be up to forty eight a as it i know men using a mletuside stimulating form on peptides el really wont to caution people a about obtaining gray market peptides sorry for this a a insertion here but a they are a lot of peptides available without a prescription on the internete they are almost all contaminated with something alled l p slopy polly sacaride which is not something you want to be injecting a lot overtime that is i say how we induce in a munrespont in animals in the laboratory a and it is amazing to me how many a websides are selling this stuff in it a arise to you easily you despite on the internet says not for humaner animal use in people are injecting it and a the olpsissue is something i think it is a puttetially get a shut down that whole market at some point but if you are interestin using a peptide you should be obtaining it by a prescription from a quality physician exactly in because we have bremilanatide we can prescribe that for men as well also sometimes will do it offlable for men who are having delate jaculation cause it will help them achieve orgasm a little bit better a and this is available for premenapasa women the other a medication that is available for low labido is called slabancrin also known is addie is the brand name and that also works on sertinoge it is got kind of a mixed response seretonan and doplemenergic areas of the brain and essentially works as a daily medication taken before bedtime hundr melegrams a day that actually helps with decreasing hypoactive sexual desire disorder works in about sixforty five to sixt e present i patience and you ne to take it for some time now both these that branny medicatiens they are a little bit costly and some tempts i charms does not cover them but they are available i think very few people know about them and i think they really great and useful tools in the tolbox and these are for desire therefore yes ther they re after ar prov for what we call hypo active sexual desire disorder which is essentually lo libido that causes distress and bother i do not want to take us off course about a vagunal a lubrication arousal and fe more orgasm but as long as we are talking about a rousal and am reduced ta rousal that requires treatment i have to ask this now any time we talk about a rousal and libido there is no b m i which by the way the bodymastindex is probably not the best a tool either a but there is no chart it is not a thermometer that says your ninety eight point six plustermine as too degrees your good if it is too high much higher than that you have a fever if much lower in that your hypothermic my understanding my i donoft thing ni eve understannd but a my understanding is that one determines whether not their libido is normal high or low largely based on some intuitive understanding of what their partner or partners desire whethr not they can meet those desires and if they sort of a a crue enough of a sample size they date enough people where they have sexual interactions they can they figure out over time whether not they have a low medium or high sex trive an people tend to compare to how they felt in earlier years or at different times of the year or under different psychological conditions and strass conditions that kind of thing but we really do not have a bench mark for this right may we cannot say that am for instance that if i people are not desiring sex are thinking about sex with blank frequency that they have low libido right its sort of what is working ore not working for you in the contact of your life i that is a yet ta very god to think about there is no right or wrong ba icly what your thaink tereis no right or wrong among of libido thereis many people who identifie asexual and theyare happy with that there are people who i to have sec once a month and they are happy with that it really is a matter of distress are you bothered by it when we look at studies for female sexual disfunction you can using valiated questioner s that afas afi you can actually see that about forty percent of people qualify for having secual disfunction but really bother is only seein about twelve per cent and you can be bothered because your bothered you can be bothered cause your partner is bothered but it is really up to you right if you feel thereis something that you want improve on than that is when you go see our doctor but there is no right or wrong answer bit this is very subjective and a lot of times will see couples who have miss match lebidos not dos tot mean one persons right in one person is wrong no it just the mattr if well how do you if you want it come to a point where you agree how do we get there and what is what is your encle i leader will talk a a bit more about chemistry which i find infinitely fascinating because in my life experience i've just been struck by the fact that occasionally you have a physical interaction with somewone sometimes is not even physical interaction and they are just unbelievably arousing to you or somewhere between or sometimes it it just sort of are not there ors just not there are that much or nobody likes to talk about this or it is there until you sleep together and then it is not there and this is all not just put on males this is put on females i ia i hope she iesn't kill me for saying this i know somebody who is a family member who once said sometimes you afeter realizing never want of sleep with somebody again by sleeping with them and here we are not talking bout dramatic experience rigt right si again that thiscusherman libito as you o apptly point it doubt engaging what is healthy levels of lebe do not has a lought to do with what one self desires as well as the hopes and expectations of the people that we are sextually nvalledworth we will get back to that it later in the contect of cemistry cause i find it' fascinating and it is something that is not talked about enough but thank you for that let us get back to female sectual rousal respondetan ndasl physiologically what happens to the body is that prepares for penetration now that could be penus that could be a sextoy that could be a digit finger a to be more specific it what it does is the servics mooths up and out of the way that the inner one third two thords of the vigina lengthens and a longates to allow for penetration and it can actually double nearly double in size of that of the baseline fasinal length and it is preparing for that if you and that is part of it in some people who have a painful intercourse it is because they have not had adequate time for arousal and there the penists penetrating before they have had those adaptations to occur and also the labbea open up to allow for that penetrations of these things t actually happen physio logically to allow for preparation while some people may be aroused and get to that point quicker some people do need a longer period of time of what as you described for play and not everyone is the same but thing its important to have that discussion with your partner and lubrication is one of the ways that people assess arousal but that is not the be all and all some people just make a lot of lubrication and some people do not and sertainly that changes with age and harmons if a certainly we know that after men a pause with a drop in estrogen and testastrone you will see a decrease in lubrication and sometimes if people are on medications that can alter their harmonal access they may also see changes in lubrication after during brast feeding ucan see changes in lubrcation and again this is not a they are not aroused necessarily this is a physiologic problem that they'r having can we istinguish between arousal based lubrication the ay sexual arousal based lubrication a gain folks for give me for being hyper specificate language but there are other forms of arousal besides sexual rousal that a we know from it is not a pleasant topic from am reports of falling sexual assault that oftentimes a the victim is demonized for having been a lubricated and they will say well then people will presume that somehow they wanted that interaction and that is not true in those cases it is clear that those that the lubrication occurred independent of labido type arousal exacti oca let us set that aside again unpleasant topic but one that is important to to atempt to flag or there forms of non labido type arousal lubrication that allow for non painful or even pleasureful penetration that are important to distinguish from the arousal base lubrication in other words i have to imagine am that women will half sex and it can be pleasureful ere t lease not painful and that might relate in some way to baseline levels of lubrication and here we have been talking bout lubrication a mainling the contects of arousal o postmen apozle reductions in lubrication but are there also postmen apozl reductions in base line lubrication are some people's vigian is just more lubricated at i must they at rest as the scientist in me om when am theire sleep for instance i mean men are having erections in their sleep are women getting vaginal lubrications in their sleep periodically my guesses yes while they are deafly getting cliteral and an engoragement right they are etting clearlin guargemen there as been somestudies on that that they are also geting nocturnal to messens right just men do as far as lubrication that the data at least from what i understan is there is a protective maccanis them whereby women when when there is any sense that there may be penetration that their body will immediately start creating lubrecation and that is prodective to avoid you dont troma and injury there is also baseline fagional discharge that is completely normal women will make physiologic discharg in fact in our examinations when we examine one will say normal physiologic discharge because we see it there is always discharge and it is a it can be up to five milliaars and it is not a small amount it can happen e me quite a lot the nace menstrual pcycle dependent in terms of thof iscosity an yes it changes over thi pcycle and it can be different in color and different in thickness and that is completely normal and i think that is a real problem in the famineine hyding industry a you do not need to smell a certain way or or reduce that discharge this is completely normal healthy and you talked about cemistry and i know there is not a connedate on this thisic farimal ans right their sense that are coming from you which are actually attractive to a partner potentially and and in whatever physiologic ouknow i do not know thiesknowledge ta dat ontis but there is that part of it sel a there is a lot of marketing towards women that your dirty you should be smelling peaches or whatever that there is a lot of market a i may be this as generational thing but i learned early on ma think by behavial no scince courses that vaginal lubrications were a part of the arousal response for both a these were always framed in the contects of hateral sexual relationships but both partners lendis in both partners a mecause tis cound be a amosexual female relationship tooit we wanta make the conversation is broughd as possible a and that the a odor what is just be frank here a the odor and the taste a played a role in both arousal but also the perabonding response that would establish future arousal and any one that is ever been in a a in a relationship that a what is ey had healthy secual a relations i to think is experience a remembering somebody smell er think about someboy smell and that itself co be very rousing yes partners even i'm smelling of different articles of each other's clothing nat thing arousing this is the stuff of of real physiology we are not were not making the stuff all right but there is there is a lot of marketing towards women that they should use dushing or other things to clean themselves and it is it is damaging right it is actually one it can affect the vasna michrobiums o their pages changing and that can effect they are risk for utiis or bacturel vaganosis and a and and there the're buyind these spending their money on tese things becausethey are being told that they are not clean and they come to the doctors thing oh im i think i have astity but it is normal physiologic discharge a and i think it is important to say that this is normal and and it is normal to have an odour that is disdain to you and that there is of course if yure a fishy odor that may be a sign of a very strong new novel odor that was not there before that may be a sign of a sectually transmitted in faction but if it is your general odor that you have always had that is normal whone about other infections east rnfections or becturial infections of the agot number of quections about michael plasmo om infections which and we do not hear that often about but yes youyou can see if your discharge has changed an become more cottage cheese or there is a meno it others symptems itching a or discomfort then those are signs to go get a valuated a michael plasmais another infection that we see in the vigina but we also actually sometimes see in the earing and while it is not something we routenly tassed for when we have people who have symptoms of you are in artract infection and they are not improving sometimes twhe will check for michael plasma that could be causing symetims in the eurethreadself a that a couple episodes about the gut michrobium i colly just in sonunbur et stamford is lovetors directly above frmis expern agout microbiom done a couple opisodes about this and am he reminded me and i to remind people that a every mucosal lining of your body has a robost microbiums that means intrenasal and true vational intry ourethrol in a males and females am here is an anal microbiom there is a microbium on your skin on your eyes am and you mention ducing an other a in other ways of i say quot icl cleaning it because that language falls in line with the idea that it is a good thing you are telling me it is it is it is a bad thing in many cases am because wiping out the microbiom what er some of the things that a females can do in order to a promote the health of their vagenal microbiom it is it is really our bodies are amazing the vigina is a self cleaning of in you do not have to do anything you just lot the vigina is a self cleaning a muckitor no cin to repeat that too often into ma different contects wen' remember it forever you well you and the all you neen to do is wash the hair bearing aries because those are the ones that creat thweat and and and should be cleaned but others an that let soapy water run down owning to do anything your body will take care of it itself when else five years old i pull my parents in the bathroom and i said they still talk about this i said i want to know everything about sax i wont know everything and they wele all my got what are we dealing with and i'll never forget my dagis look tat me he is argentine he said just remember cause of the one thing in life you cannot give back that is all i that was it that hat that was it o gash wy you my discussion ofh my sons are my son my elder son has been much more graphic than that i tell it is a masin well went ou into the worlan e anyway a yo figured it out let us spend a few minutes or more talking about female orgasm one of the more cryptic topics on the internette not because it is not disgust but because i think that the new ants of it is not disgussed often enough or in full depth let us take the time we need am to parse this i think that the simplest way to parse it is going to be from the anatomical standpoint cliteral orgaism verses called cea spot or penetration based organism but of course penetration based orgaism is also a bit of a misnomer because a there can be a cliteral stimulation by pelvic pressurer or by digit wretti bout fingers as digits because we are both am in the medical slash science profession but whech ime at fingers here or something else right fibrator toy whatever am to for a depends on flexible youare i do not know but the point being am that i think the simplest way to go about this is going to be to talk about the distinction between cliteral organism and cea spot organism however those are achieved am and to also talk about this idea of gratedverses absolute o casso atis has actual parallels to narrow science where we talk about communication between eir ons being grated meaning it is kind of eu one level than a higher level than lower level ere all ar non right am how shall i say this am it is clear in my life experience in observation that there are multible kinds of female organism those that are grated and in some cases cumulative they sort of build towards a larger and larger organism and then there are what some people have described as cliff type organisms where there is a refractory period i think that is a fair way to frame this and clearly there are different responses to the organism response some people get sleepy some people get energized some people it heightens their desire for more some people they need a a a period of time in which am they become hyper sensitive to touch am a lots of diffren things going on there am psychologically physiologically am yet tell us all of it to in terms of orgaasm mig i think it in fpoint to distinguish that there is orgasm and the n there is different areas that you stimulate to achieve orgasm some people will stimulate the cliterus is probably the most reliable form of stimulation that will achieve orgasm and when you look at the data and again female sexual is functiony oes not super robust but what we find is that about eighty five per scent of women require cliteral stimulation or to climax very few actually climaxs through just vasonal penetration alone and this is a real problem we are seeing on the media that you you have sacks and you penetrate and meale women are having orgasms that is not the reality for a lot of women and in terms of stimulation wee talked aghout throughout this podcas the cliterus is the homalogue of the penus or the pieceas the homalogueof the clierus however you want to say it i do not you forgetting it both direction yeicoers threw that one up yeso a cliteral stimulatin is just pena stimulation for women that is very reliable and there is a huge orgasm gap for men it is pretty consistent that when they have a first time sexual encounter ninety five percent of men are having an orgasm we look at first time sexual encounters for women with in heterosexual relationships it is about forty five to fifty per cent are having an orgasm and when you look at holmosexual relationships of women it is again ninety per cent there is clearly some lacking in nine you per cent of om female homosexual interactions that ar first time interactions ninety per cent or having orgasm correct ris only because they understand the antemy of other by way of understang thenatemy of o there is a huge agasiology on psychology oh yes that is but th o there is a huge gap there and i think to to bring at home is that cliteral stimulation is the most reliable way and as you mentioned when you'r stimulating vasually you are often the clierus is a wishbone and it goes around the vigina and you are often stimulating those the cura is what we call the leg es i guess for lack of a better term of the cliterus and youre stimuling that you'r also stimuling the clip the cliteral shaft which goes deep into the palvis the g spot is a is an area as narogenous zown where it is kind of the antere wall the vigina but two to three senimeters tin that is the location of these parior retral glands called the schene's glance and they are anologous or homologus to the male prostate just some men have prostate play and enjoy pleasure from prostate stimulation some women enjoy g spot stimulation now tht's not universal right not all men enjoy prostate play and not all women are going to be aroused by g spot stimulation and i think there is a huge a huge variety of ways you can stimulate with stimulate any one it can be man or women some people will have orgasm through just nippl stimulation alone some will just here something or tsee something and be able to achieve an orgasm and it is it is varied from person to person and i think that the big take come from this for people listening is you have to talk to your partner and this is the hardesthing we never learned how to talk about sex what do you what do you not and and do not take at personally right i think a lot of times people feel you half to orgaasm to have pleasure which may not be the case for everybody a and if it is how do you prioritize that for your relationship on if i got off track there but that is kind of a i think the the take combs for this and also the vaginal penetration it is actually usually from cervical stimulation not necessarily vaginal because the large density of inervation the vigina is the first outer third of the vigina there the deeper two thirds of the igina has as much less intervation and yet there is such a thing as ervical organ and the servith being further up t the vaginal canal a is servical orgasm specifically the the stimulation anac a the fosi of an orgasm that starts in the back of the vigina is a yes thots from stimulation of the servix through whatever means trigt an that can be pleasurable and w lead to orgasm and again orgaasm is is defined differently red but the one thing we know is that there are palvic flor contractions which are measurables tat you can kind of tell that your partner is having an orgasm if you have a female partner because you can actually feel those contraction thright wheather it is on her didgit or our organ or sextway supernurty question here am years ago when i worked on hormon basexual differentiation of which by the way we'e done it aepisode the pocast on previously am a you kno learn that the levator any muscle am is the muscle the controls erection and males and presume the a cliteral tomassinsand in an ingorgement in females is there an equivalent muscle responsible for the orgasm response or is the contraction of the pelvic floor on part of a more general theme of af muscular contraction and a bunch of different of nerve roots contracting the reason i aske this is that eventually in this conversation were gtnto migrate up toward the brain but because his is a science and health podcast when we talk about orgaasm of course many people recognize that as their experience of it and ther recognition of it in other people am and descriptions et cetera but a are we talking about a response that originates at a fosie am conplicin a in the brain we talk abut a seizure bat ou no starting at a focus of fosin then spreading out am or we talking about a bunch of different nerve roots and brain centers firing in syncrany and that is why some people experience it as behind their forehead and in their geneals te aer as a whole body response and e ere we are not telling about the flood of of nerrow chemicals into the body i'm tolig about during those moments of worgasm am what is happening naurolly i mean it does have certain p well's to seizure ri os does let me go back to your first part of the question which was a about orgaasm and sare erection and two messons being lit the levator anice actually what happens during the reason you get in erection and presume wy clitol stimulation the same ways blood flows into the erectile tissue and the tunica which is the outer layers of the of the sh of the erect tile tissue which are too basily cylindrical shape structures in the penus and in the cliteris they will fill with blood and to that tunica will compress veins on the outside to prevent lod for from leaving sos not a muscular event is an actual blood flow event the howcome when we wanted to study erection behavior in rodance we would om give them injections of tostostron females or mals and observe changes in secual behavior accordingly erection and cliteral tomescence all thofs harger harder imeasure in rodinc tereis a way of indirectly measuring that and then we would measure the size and weight of the levitor any muscles as a redoubt of how indriternized that whole system was etthem well ou know we have what is the role of laator any in in the sexual rthelevator a i i thiny le varring when you an noy i silly those muscles are part of the palvic floor right and those contract when you when you climax right weather it is orgaism from male ar fumale there contracting and their exercising wright there get that is how they would increase ther their strength are their density om if you are measuring that through the actual climax of which you cannot see in roans right your kind of using as a cergit in that way a that is what happens those muscles contract as a response and climax is a brain initiated of tan organaism as a brain initiated event that is why to answer your second part you ovassy feel focal response but you also can feel a variety of responses cus all come ng from the brain it is not a kind of ththe wa described it as a ripple a fact a it is more a it it is the way your body response in that particular stimuli and it is actually the ultimate form of mindfulness you cannot think of anything else when your organasm ing right it is you have this moment of clarity and and every and and everything you are very present in that moment and people will feel different stimulations depending on how theire how they kind of how ther sensor of their nerves are their sensations are not things that a his perhaps a good time to a mentioned dopening we talks about a few times a earlier when talking about the arousal arc that starts with paris sympathetic sort of calm and then am move typically starts as calm and then moves to am the orgasm response we know that the organasm response is associated with release of dopening a and then prolacton which sets up the relative or absolute refactory prede the a the interesting thing and i got some questions about this is that am there is literature as i understand about the elevation in dopening cause by say anta depressons well butron bropriron which increases dopening an norup in efferon am people who recreationally use drugs cocane were other stimulants am people who take am ateral vivants or other drugs that increase a levels of dopening because i did hole episode about those drugs and they are different forms of anphetaming unlesswe talk about riddle and which a slowa different aand i got a lot of questions about people who experience feeling a lot of a desire sef arousal but not being able to achieve the a physical rousal erection or vaginal lubrication it is almost as if they are sitting further along that arousal art hence the importance i think of a people learning g to have acalm a states of mind when going into sexual interactions now i realize that in saying that it might be confusing bcause a lot of people think le that thits anything but calm right sexual rousals anything but calm but maintaining enough calm that they can a ride that ark a for whatever duration is appropriate for that interaction in them rikeers again when we shurraily get back to this a some people will have sex for long pruids of time some for shorter periods of time and here people do not really know what other people are doing except by way of pornographian and self report and discussion am is it the case that drugs that increase dopening can inhibit the sexual response do they tend to promote the sexual response because i also mentioned earlyer theire is a growing trend of people taking by way of prescription of course from a physicion am combined aple morphine which is a dopaminergic drug a with to dallafill which is a a pety five inhibitor its can increase blood flow and i'm hearing about men and women but mainly men doing this rampen up their dopening a ramping up their blood flow to their genitals in order to have presume we more arousal in sex does it make sense an a yes o as a mechanism yes in terms of april marfin a the that has been study and its bulsely been approved outside of the united states we do not use it very often here in the unitestates that has not been afty approved a but it is a very complex response i mention that a flabancer and which is essentually acting that occasion it actually has not only a inhibitory and not only stimula tory but als wen hibatory of facts on dopa means o the way it sort of works to enhance interest or libido its sort of complex and kind of confusing when it was actually approved it was it was being studied for an anti depresent and what they found was that women were actually having lee no better a interest in sacts ar more interest in sactsons of that kind of how it was disco verd similarly viagara was actually studied for high blood pressure and when they went to am it was horrible blood passura medication but then the people the men who took it actualy did not return the samples but the study they realized that cle what is going on here and it was because they were having better erection is it true that a at some eurology meeting that the first am description of biagara's treatment for a mertalis function involved the speaker actually coming out from behind the podium and revealing his errection is that a true story yes i do not think it was bagar i think it was not intric cavernosal injaction now i think he came ou a it is the truth rathere is actually a publish arcle i'll send it to you you can share it if he liked in metralest tat a i'll read the article there is a published article about people who were attending at the meeting and yes he came out and at the time it was mostly man in eurology but there were spauses i guess in the audience which is not typical now but a there were women in the audience and he came out with the philoneraction to show that it he now in fact well i suppose at the eurology meeting am or weg whin meeting where a one comes out in reveals her a inhanse of aginal librication than weill have a wel have a gender in sexs balance at the meetings on eurology am be interesting to attend one of thus some day am differences in arousal as a function of stage of the menstrual cycle really interested in this i did along eposode on fertility and we are going to have a few other i v f experts a fertility experts on the pad cast am but clearly am there are differences in hormons across he minstrual cycle we know that for shore ye am clearly there can be psychological variation according to those foremonsts were prubly other things across the minstrual cycle and it is always an imperfect experiment because we are not laboratory rats and people are having different interractions across the minstrual cycle is there any known am correlation between a desire and stage the menstrual cycle there is some obvious a assumptions that one might making a prior t ovulation et cetera around the time of obdation a but what about the other direction to a is there category of women that are very interested in sects at certain stages of the menstral cycle and then not at all interestin sects an other stages the mentrual cycle we know that all that i dated tha i've heard and maybe a gan cloges could speak more on this they study those variations a little better but there is data to suggest that lebido does increase prior to ovulation and during ovulation andting it the couple days prior because that is the optimal time for fertility yes there is deted to suggest that in terms of completely a lack of interests i do not believe theire sata but i'm not a natser is there evidence tot females who perhaps have not experienced clle g spot orgasmer cervical organasm can learn to do that and i always find it interesting that whenever there is tha discussion about different forms of female organasm a people are careful to point out that many women do not have penetration based organaism and then they separate out cliteral stimulation as more a more common rout to organasm but of course there can be cliteral stimulation with penetration absoletely right and a depending on the physical arrangement a there can be cliteral stimulation purely by way of penetration through pelvic contact am fingers et cetera yes or ho how do we how shoal we think about this how shall we talk about it there was an interesting study that i just rad recently where they gave women words for these things right tho a the there is the rocking stimulation that can also stimulates the meating that the you are penetrating but theres a rocking motion that can also penetrate the clitter is there is a stimulation of just the outer part of the vigina which again as they me chion the gspoght is there it is more highly intervateds o that can be more stimulating there is also wags to a lying yourself that when you'r pentrating you'r putting pressure on the cliteres and then there is stimulation with actual stimulation of the clir intentional stimulation either by yourself or by the partner and there are lutible different ways to do that right a and there i think that it is important to really a kind of exit cay to explore and not always be a home run and i think that is when you get into relationship where youare maybe second therd fourth time having intercourse with some one that you can try and explore tese different things or if the partner themselves knows what they to actually tell the other partner it there is a huge part of communication that i think it is plays a huge rollen in this because we know ourselves better tha any one else tha you can tell your partner what you and i think tat that we have never been taught how to do that yet a such important conversations for many reasons as you point out a defily not something they teach people in school except yoon they might say something about communication is important and that almost always circles back to the the keyfor things we talk about earlier which is you kow consent and age appropriate a contacts appropriate these kinds of things an a and obviously substanceis alcohol and other drugs can strongly confound to those issues and that is well just leave that as as a kind of an obvious one a as als were talking about communication on secual interactions a perhaps it would be useful to people to cultivate a a language or a nomenclature there too to facilitate that a some of the language that i've heard that is a quite useful as things a youknow people have different arousal templets right some people certant ideas ore stimulating to them and other ideas are eversive to them and then there is this category an between were sometimes people sort of either do not know cause they have not tried it or have not thought about it or theire sort of curious but kind of unsure or it might work in the right contact but maybe not all the time is there any kind of structure that is been put out there as a way to improve communication around sexual inter actions ye i mean there is no script but i think in general you want to have the conversation outside of the bedroom not right before sex a right after sex because that leads to ayou know a sense of in security for the other person mi gi do something wrong ind something go wrong here you want a kind of move those to a neutral location kitchen table in the car whatever somewhere where sexes not cand happen am at least for that particular moment and a m e yo listening a some challenging conversations on this pod gust challenge it a previously challeging because you try to get things clear an it as clear as possible an this one's challenging because ther're many coviots everything right ee on wor ye wol sex in car you ight getem or they did when i was growing up a and sometimes they still do o cet please continue yes that is one and then too when you are discussing it i mean this is kind of goes for any difficult conversation is you make i statements rigt you that i it when this i do not it with this it is not something you did right tat you did not do this you did not do that makes the kind of an animosity sort of situation and then i think also part of it is being open about those things than it made it is not chan to happen in one conversation i think that is the hard part tece you think your going to have a conversations gan to go great and things are ging to be better it is gon be mulcible conversations and some of them are not ging to go well right a that is another place where you can actuallyu get the help of a sax therapists and there is a webside for that it is a s c t a cect dot or where you can look for a sax therapis near you and you can even do those things virtually a and that can be really helpful when you are having difficulty having a conversation ye i think again such important conversations and then when people a differ in terms of their level of experience it gets am but te ntually problematic but all it can be potentially educational and then of course there the twists in turns that occur with when one is asking about somebody else's arousal templet oftentimes you will learn things about people's sexual past and that can be either neutral stimulating or aversive right that can open up all sorts of other issues relates to the psychological interplace there is no way we can pars all of those now i just think it is worth highlighting that it is understandable why those conversations are challenging and it also is understanding why ponography is not g invall those conversations rit rigt imoly conversations there are between a your brain your hands in your eyes in a rear sum a not can hiliday in particular order other i want a switch gear slightly u an talk about yut is i got a lot of questions about yournaretract infections let us make it belade to both females and males because yes males get your inaretract infections females get them more females asked about your nretract infections how common are they should they always be treated with antobiotics is crambiary really a good treatment if wior their other things that are better is it belat to th yacidity or alcalinity how does one prevent getting outies can get them from swimming should you yeurnate after sex tellus about youtiis and how not to get them and how to get rid of happy tfell outiize are very common in women a obly up to fifty per cent if women get at least one outia in their lifetime and up to a third of them get recurrent outiies and what that means as they have two or more in six months or three or more in a year now this i common and we will see a lot of vit and it is not as a until your having recurrent you tet the atures have one year or you have one every few years it is not a huge issue in men however outize are much lest common and that is because the earethreat ens longer there is last a entry from the outside world into the blatter which causes infections and a the when men gould a utiides concerning ise a man getting the ut eut other's multiple reasons that it could happen but it should be investigated that you can make sure there is no anatomic abnormality ar functional abnormality with tha blatter that is causing the utes in terms of prevention a there are kind of major things are haded in the guylines that we all we all talk about one is hy dration making sure your drinking about truto three leaders of fluid ideally water a day a dilution is the solution to the pollution wrigt drinking more fluids is going to get that bacteria and youin a p it out can help keep not let is sit around the blatter very often another thing in women who have altered states of estrogen whether its postmenapozzle surgical a menapause or may be have a roduced esterogen for postpartom or ather reasons or that about turn the sicon half of the monstrel sicle were not necessarily for those specific people but for those specific times but cause its pretty short livded a iguess you could use it but a is is vaginal estrogen vaginal estrogen meaning estron ta supplied in the vagina either through a cream a suppository or a ring is is highly effective in reducing the occurrence of recurrent ut es and this is because when you have low estrogen the piation the vigina goes up and the piation of gana goes up because there is less conversion of glakagen to lacdo bacili and then those lacdobasilla are proventetive for utes essentially you want a reduced the pe back to its normal acitic p h and vagnal estrn is very effective at doing that in fact and our clinics will actually check of vaginal p g to see if there is an indication that their page is too high that may be they do need vageal astron partictler on the perry menapos cas hard to tell just by looking if they are really a heading into lower estrogens state sometimes and that is very verieffective and very very safe when you look at estrogen the the women's health initiative way back when sort of made a big stink about how estrgens laid to cancer however a vaginal estrgen has never ever been a reported breast cancor uderan cancer or any other blood clot any other adverse event associe with vaginal estergen you can get some breast tenderness some discharge those things can occur a but the absorbed amount vasinally is little that your estrogen level barely goes up it does not even reach premen apuzzle level just goes up very slightly in the bloodstream not enough to crate any sort of abnormality vaginal estern is extremely safe and it is pretty affordable you can actually use coopons if your insurance does not cover it through a goodarax or marcuban's farmasy and get it very very affordably and it is very effective it does take about three months to work you ned have to be consistent you plied about twice a week at night sometimes three times a week a and it is its very effective the ring you put in once n at last for three months but gently speaking that is the most effective option for low estrogen states other kind ofs simple things are trying to make sure your completely emptying your bltder over a lifetime people can develop some mild pelvic flordis functionry not enough to create pain or discomfort but maybe theyre not emptying completely right because maybe they used to hold their earn for long periods of time when they were cid or may be there always hovering over the twelics that on a sit on it at work and over time that can crate a little bit of mild this function which can make it more difficult to completely empty the blader and when yeurn is sitting in the latter for long periods of time it is basically food for bacteria to grow and back tere grows and then you get current you ti making sure you have complete empty byc sitting relaxing on the toilet sometimes leading forward and they maybe going a second time standing up sitting back down going again and even for men sometimes trying to sit and see if you completely empty cause sometimes standing you are not able to empty completely well the lot of menargan the ust thr lese you it was fun to research for the suppesode because m therare entire discussions on redit about wi what percentage of mal sit while youre nating of minor shenning base on having visited many mal bathrooms in my lifetime in just beng in the world a tha that i assumed that men stood up in order to to urnate but thereare a decent percentage men to down yor there are an in fact s veryle country and probaly the reason its become more interesting lately my mediatry a certain country was recently surveyed thing was germany abut essentially tis recently picked up by the media that germans sit more often to p and that people always as better for me to sit to pour standap and there is a whole big discussion on the media but the reason being is when your sitting your public floor is most relaxed and if your having any issues emptying your blody you are going a p better also if you have an enlarge prosay which i 'm sure ing a talk about pro prosta enlargement that can sometimes allow you to develp a little but more in trabdominal pressure cause your sitting and you can lean forward to overcome sort of a blockage and and there are some s some indications were sitting is better but if you'r being fine in your standing that is fine to i don ly you have to i thing is just something that you knowing other countries they do more and here we do not and tot dont thing it is right or wrong it just depends on your individual circumstance kin a spermicides or condums or both on increase the frequency of you taes for a females spermicides absolutely spermicide if your condum has firmicin or your using spirmicides that is a known risk factor for you tiyes other things i want o touch on you did ask about cranberry cranbery's actually in the american your logical association guide lines for prevention of r current you tiies and women now how does cranberry work right do i to string chose it is actually a specific active ingreedent in the cran berry which is called pro anthos sianadens or p cs and iu kowht they have actually looked at the amount of p cs you need in what formulations wo youd thirty six melegrams of p cs in a soluble form lot of the supplements on the market will say that theyre thirty six melegrams of p cs but theire the whole berry the using the the skin of the berry and the stem of the berry and that is not gat a help you you need to make sure that the supplement using is a soluble form of the cran bare in it isactually very very effective at reducing the risk of you tiye should you mean am capsals a joke ap a yet it is a capsul an that you take once a day and there is some although not as much data that if you are having them around secs which some women do always have post coidale you tizes a that you can take two on the day of sex and two on the day after and that may be helpful but there is not a lot of data there but certainly anoption that you can try that is pretty low risk a that is kind of the the guide lines now there is a tun of other things that you can do to help prevent that are kind ofs available and have some data behind them d manos is one of them we take a about two grams of day of d manos and you drink it in that actully helps reduce you t iris it is e sudying the smalle randomis controlled trial to be effective and a and those are kind of the bigger ones there is other things that people use probiotics but there is a lot of heterogenaty as in probiotics and what to take and are they really effective vaginally a in the flora there those are kind of the big things and there is a lacturall lot of microbium study and you t ize going on act at you see a la a we are the looking at the microbium of people who are more at risk for ou t ies or even over ac to later other conditions that in ther try to figure out is there something here that we can target or that we can figure out is is causing probes because sometimes we just cannot figure out wites happening a in terms of wiping from front to back and swimming and keing after sacks there is no good data and any of those things a wiping from front to back i think it does create a little bit of shame it is not a big deal if you wipe back to frun as long as you are not as long as you have cleaned yourself to speaks i think a it is last of an issue wolerturnu is o you referring to any contamination from an ar any bactoria round the a yeand a lot of women who have orcurrent outies tend to come and feel very dirty thike there is something wrong with them go i wash all the time i'm really clean a really this and it is not something they are doing it is probably a micro bium of fact or a hormonal of fact or yore there is something going on that we need to investigate further it could also being anatomical or functional problem were you are ot emptying the latter correctly th as lots of different factors it could ben it is very infrequent i would thay i've never seen a patient whose dirty and not the reason o can outies a perhaps even the opposite is true ther cleaning too much based on what you told us araly ye and the're eliminaing the got micro escuse me just rolls off the tongue hom again no pone intended am perhaps it is ther they are abolishing the loca microbyum on the skin too much cleaning liminates the microbum on the skin nt that we do not want a wash we am when soninburg was a guest on this podcast he said ashe kids can develop a very healthy microbyum an general microbyum oftentimes by sorry parents not washing their hands before eating if they have been playing with soil outside or dir a little bit of that as actually healthy pets actually offer microbyum support this is weird i know it sounds ni readybut we ave to imagine how we have all does a species was not with antibactorial sand alcohol swabs everywhere and a novysy we do not want infections ut overcleaning can destrupt the microbyum which presumably can lead to outis perhaps some one who is cleaning excessively is more at risk than somebody is cleaning a little lass absolutely and actually the cleaning can irritate the dermisrihts at you can actually gate contact or etise typed symptoms from over cleaning and that is one of the you no things for that i i deafly have a utide defly have one will know you do not but there is a host of other things that it could be one of them could be that another very common one that we already touch on is pavic flooridas function very often palvic flordisfuntion just tlike you had pain with arnation women can also develop pain with arnation that does not go away and it can start where they hato you t i that trigger the palvic floor and then the palic flordis did not relax that the pain distrigger the palic for te tents up and did not relax because again were not taught how to relax our palvic floor and a and then they have develope pavic flordis functio wise utyi note going awarewise that keep coming back and that is another common thing that we see in people who have quartant quot recurent utiies but do not really have them to be clear i experience the pain in urination as a consequence of trying those dam key wiles fihe everyone coing but stopping that was in formative in two directions one it relieve the pain very quickly thelse good the other was a i realize that it is possible to have a palvic floor that is neither a hyper contracted or over relaxed in some cases just not doing anything for it is tt is the best circumstanc right and ther only reason i mention that is because am obviously this discussion is not about my palvic floor this discussion is about fact that some people perhaps need to clean lass some people maybe more but probably not base on what you said some people might nee to strengthen their puic floor some people might need to am relax their public floor an some people's puic floor is probably a o k i any discussion about u anything medical or you especially hormon stuff this hapens alon the discussions around that get into it seems with with male every male now seems to wonder if their testastrone is too low not the ones that are blasting tustostrone cause they know successively hig u and as you point out earlier at least introm disexual function that is unlikely to be the case may i less o desire but on buttin terms of a genital base arousal function yand i mean you have talked about tosacteral lot on the pod casts i'm sure your audience knows very well the multitude of benefits for testastro i think there is value in assessing harmons panels and asassing your level of free tesastron testastrone and assessing if your having sinters are not always sexual right it can be depression it can be weightgain that you are not gaining a muscle mass a you can have cognitive changes those things can still be a sign of lo tostaterna and very valuable and important to assess that reminds me of another thing that we get back to a outiaso wha tok abot kinneystones but am i've heard of women using a small amount of testastron cream directly on the cliterus as a way to amplify the maybe it is the a desire andarousal effect or perhaps just one or the other i've athe way that we discusse testaceronuws in there are consenseof statements and there is a action abundance of data on tostatrone use particulary postmen apozzle women for low libida or low sexual desire and it is all been very positive inciceres been increased a sexual desire base on value questionars increased number of sexually satisfying events wi'th testastron use now the range of testacernan women is about a tenth of the the amount of tosaterna man needs right testastro an cream is systemically absorbed wherever you apply it and the way we generally recommend women to tred us if they are having low libeda when we have ruled out other issues that may be psychologic byin af relationship other issues that can a feclabeto medications here is a lot of things obviously that go into that but if we set and we have checked their tesacernat appears to be low for physiologic levels for women whiching an as one tenth of the male level then we can actually prescribe awfullabl testastrone and the guide lines or the consense of statements are not a true guidelanes but they recommend using transdurmal testastro and getting andrew gell tubes from the farmesey and putting a tenth of one tube on the back of the calve or the upper outer buddoc hairiless area a for absorption that can improve desire over all and then the other place we use testastrodeas in women who have of what we call vestibulodinia to the vestibule is the area outside the vigina which is very harmonally active there is lots of anergen receptors there and it can actually when you have hormonal issues meaning lower testastrode and aster in that area it can cause pain and actually applying a combined or compounet estergen testastron cream to that area over time can reduce that pain and discomfort as to sasson receptors or anders an receptors all over the body very much in the generals very much in the brain and their very useful to a very useful place to treat women for those issues thank you gidneyston't hop do never have one i ot ye do not eiter people get them a how do youave weld getting them in how doyu get rid of kidneystones a very often or they a they can befer a vritin toprometabolic disorders right it can be one dehydration is of very common cause of it a dehydration combined with may be a slight metabolic adnormality where your creating more cacium or oxilate in your earine can result in a in kidneystones and how can you prevent them i an i each person is individual if you get akidney stone typically we do with call the twenty for hour earn analysis plus some blood work to assess what is the metabolic adnormality we can target that either with diet or with medication and the cun of general recommendations for people who have kidney stones one is increases your fluid an take to two tor three lears again the same number i told you before you want a decrease your oxilate intake nefhugugle ox lag and find millionthings that you eat that have oxilate in them but the big ones are spinage and rubar a wre seeing a lot of nuts too that are eatin people eating lot more nuts to get more protine u no cutting back it is impossible to get rid of all of that in your diabut having a spinner salad every day while swich it a different green wright do not eats finage everyday a also you want it increase your cittrate and tik thats an inhibiter of kidneystone formation increasing fruits and a and things that to increase citrate vegetables as well actually ane easily accessible thing is crystal light it has a high a citrate compositions tha you can drink crystal light with that to three leaders and that can be helpful a you want a decrease your protine intake high levels of a a purins ore purgenic meats red meats and things can also put you at higher risk these are kun of the general sort of proventative measures we talk about for kidneystones a if you have a kidneystone a lot of tippeople can have kidneystones and their kidneys they are not creating any proms thei'r tiny we can observe them over time if they start coming if they str going very large or they are starting to move into the uriters of the tubes that train the kidney often times they are their companied with pain quite a bit of pain a and it can be very uncomfortable in those cases a we can if they are not having any infection symptoms thing there is no signs of a urinary tract in factiond o there is no fevers no chills we can treat it conservatively with pain medication and also under our medications flal maxers you use for a enlarge proced as well that act you relaxes the ou readerall smooth muscle to allow the stone to passale but better a if you are having an infaction you got go treated right away you can get very sick very quickly in fact a i've seen young healthy patients they are pealtier than me walk in th in the yar with a kidneystone and within twenty four hours there in the icy because they are really sick because of a kidneystone but of smumbered your an idea ae a tea colored yourancs op the meaning blood in the uran yet all of those are important warning sinse that you ideally do not get to yet blood in the earn i mean does not always mean infection at could jus be irritathion from the stone but certainly feverous chills or you have a sign of it infection and the stone looks its blocking if you get imaging an ou see was called hydron or throsis or pressure behind the kidney and youre you have these signs of infection we do not want a wait because you can get sick pretty quicklay u and then once a to treat the kidty sonsers three major options one is shockwaves another is you reader oscopy where we go in with a cameran we have small leavs or we ba break it up into small pieces and dears o the camera inserted through the u reath correct your sleep under anestese us you do not have to ather get i saw the winds and then a percutan as naferaless otomy which is done if you have a large kidney stone or a very hard kidney stone that is up in the kidney you can go in through the back with a small a small incision and with a specialized camera that goes in and uss ultrason ac less o trip te to break up that stone and kind of suck it out that way s ofre extremely helpful bits of information not even bits thes sir a this is enormous amount of useful information i to piv it again for sake of bread we cannot go into extreme depths on everything wat appreciate your willingness t to follow this carasel with me oral contraception previously on this pat cast i hosteda a female physician gessd who offered both sides of female oral contraception discuss some of the benefits discuss some of the risks i made the decision to post clipse about both on the intrinette an wow wow wow was i surprised but also frankly a bit shocked and then finally intrigued why how polerize the discussion is around female oral contraception am end female contraception in general newvering a nor plant am the pill broud category of things there but for sake af discussion the pill et cetera it seemed that approximately fifty percent of responses which seem to come mainly from women were of the this stuff is terrible it ruined my life it ruins lives it destroys you it has immense am risk and then the other half seemed to say know there is reduce risk of certain forms of cervical cancer aum this has allowed me a the obsecual choices in life style that i prefer without risk of pregnancy i mean it was astonishing to the point where i thought wol if only i could postpostclip simultaneously am obviously i do not know what the answer is a but i do know that this is among the more polarizing topics available for discussion uam what is the story meaning what or the data about oral contraception why much controversy and whants the real deal here yes it is a very polerizing topic and there is abundant data abundidated that we eveintoto study and again this is a not high quality evidence but we looked at redit threads and we looked at sexual disfunctions to tht the low labito de orgas difficulties and we red hundreds of threads and we did a qualitive anals infeti in female to fee what ore people talking about and problems with oral contraceptives and ant he depressancs leading to low labito and and being very as you described very this ruined my life was very comment and that the theory is that taking oral contraceptives increase ives the amount of sec harm one binding glomulan which binds testastrone and astrogen and that actually makes testastera unless available which is as we have talked about a very important harmone for desire and in some subset of people thei'r seeing thery significant consequences of taking oral contraceptives now i think that there is we do not know which women are going to have this problem and we do not know how it is probably a very small subset of people but we do know that this does happen and that when you measure as te sbegy levels there up and that even after they stopped or all contraceptives you will see elevated as e sbegy levels from base line ral for at least four months afterwards you will still see elevate esaebegy level we do not know but not infinite we do not know and and yenendecanc agans weird because it it we assume everything is a short term of fect but there is some plastosy in the system because it is a narrow indicrentaem yet i thin gather some narrow plastosity there that occurs as well and we do see this and i think that the other side of this ye apsly oral contsemts are amazing right there their helpful for sexual freedoms for for preventing pregnancy for yeu know for a lot of things and particularly other conditions too picioess and and other problems or all contraceptives are amazing and they have changed ginacology in managiment of these women for and in a very positive way and i think yes i do think that there is orol contraceptive related sexual disfunction usually lodos estrogen a sort of contraceptives are the culprit abut i think that it is it is again the data femal sectuasmec leisure is just not as rebust as mal sexual disfunction literature i saw a lot of comments about howt orl contraception head let to depressive symptems u or just con adonian u apethy not jus low lowerd labito i can imagine how that would be the case through the elevate secs homor n biding globulan which is you preventing to saucer an estergen from ing free i literally i and exerting their effects on notjust the body but the brain but is there any evidence that orl contraception can destrupt no transmitters i'm not aware of any i do not think not to my knowledge a well it sounds to me orl contraception for women sus where we normally her about it it sounds there is a veried response and it is highly individual i certainly had partners that love the pill or at least in seem to mind it i've had some that hated it and no way try that never will or just went with other forms of contraception or whatever reason were not using contraception it seems to me that there is a lot of variation out there how does one explore that without risk of permanent damage it sounds truly permanent damageis unlikely u in won are the other options a yo know is the ring a copper iud oh no any sort of long acting horminal contraceptive weve seen wi we that is what we consulpations on as if their having issues with oal contraceptives even if they come with palvit pain and their honoral contraceptors i'll tel them you now what just stop because maybe the engn the fact of on the andrg an receptors a esterdan rceptors is effepting the librication eoither things were not sure but you an't you stop in go get a long acting contraceptive method wi can iud li canit and uds ar iud safe and here wi should probably ay ook a copper aud is one form yuorn'ta mention a few of the other form no i do not oudescribe i uds but generally speaking their very saife of course there is risk with any sort of it is a the preceder youre incerting and i ud their s obviously some small risks associated with it but it is safe and effective form of contraception if people are wondering why the copper iud is an effective form of a contraception a copper r is a the third rail for sperm as i understand it much that am i was able to find some evidence for this in the medical text books that a in the old days as i say a prostitutes who wanted to avoid a pregnancy would put copper pennies in their virgina really i know i do not recommend that anyhow and a please and am i do not think it is a fool proof form of of a contraception a but there is evidence at that a an it happens which is amazing that means that people somehow figured out the copper sperm relationship which is not a good one for the spirm and a deduced from that a behavior ye that ee oes trengini suggest if youwill do tha iding is just an interesting medical factoit a i can tell you one move on from the caic we will a before discussing prostate an anal sex not stated next to one another for any particular reason i want to talk about escessorise a lot of people over the last twenty thirty years have been prescribed selective saratone and reuptaken hibitors and other antidopressence am that have disrupted their sexual function or their sexual desire n seems in particular a do you see a lot of the sinyor clinet you hearabout it a what can people do about it a youn oftentimes these sexual a rousal or disfunction issues associated with essessorise another medications make those medications prohibitive and people in a theratone an is kind of the anti to orgas them and in fact we will use escessariyes awfully both for people who are having premature ejaculation it delays ejaculation and then there is also other csexual disfunctions we see with it and it does happen absolates dose dependent ain some casees when some one comes in with escessari related disfunct tion if they are doing well you can either try to reduce the dnose or switch them to a a nother ante to present for example whell butran that does not have such severe effacts on sexual function a and you can also use sealis and viagara you have tut while we have talked about forrec tothes function as an addition if we cannot change their medication management because andis gets a little bit complicated because we know erec tellis functionn depression or very in ter related now what is causing what and what where do we maybe somebody went to see their dalktor for depression was also having issue ith directions and now what you if you fix the erections doyou help with the depression what i means to tay everywhere shouting o i think i think that thereis a lot of discussant has to be had their as a lot easier to talkto yourprimary care doctor about depression than it is about your erections and i think it is important t really dig into that a little bit but yes there it is definitely a known thing we use it to our advantage when needed and a and it can be helpful to to switch medications or reduce thedoses you mentioned earlior the trasidone can cause a sustained erection a and is trasidone in the category of a touching the ceretone and transmission system i do not remember the mechanism but interetingly trasidone is also used for off label as a third or fourth line for premature ejaculation as well am i i do not remember the the mechanism off hint let us talk about prostrate an prostrate health earlier i cewed up that a there is a growing amtrend toward i everting more progressive a malphysicians a or physicians wretreatmeils axcuse me a thanks a prescribing low dose to point five to five milegram sealis which is to dalafil which may assist with irections wut it the rasional for this l o dose daily lodoseis not centered around irections persay it is really about u prostrate health improving what floaw tof the prostrate reducing prostratus u an even reducing the probability of prostate cancer u what other sorts of things are you encourging men to think about men thinking about their prostrate yet before i forget i want i mention that lodos todalafil is actually a treatment for e rectile this function fact it works quite well particularly men who are having a lot of pychogenic issues one because it dol have to remember to take a pill before sex it is always on board and your taking five delegrams every day and it has a thirty six hour half life over eat of your kind of increasing those it can actually work quite well and is a great option for a rectile this functions i do ot make that caviat a in terms of prostrate health it has been shown to be a factive for b p shor enlarge prostrate this is a very common condition in fact if you look at autopsy studies eighty percent of men at eighty have an enlarge prosrate that git is very very common now does every one get symptoms and what is the long term concerns of it nd what can you do about it typically as the prostate enlarges it is wright around the urethreats a walnut shaped glance it is underneath the bladder around the erethra and it can narrow the ourethrare the ptube and over time you can imagine if youre i always give this example if your sucking from a straw wriht you'r drinking from a straw if you have a wide diameter straw it is really easy to drink if your straw gets really narrowlike sat you take a coffee straw hen you drink out of that it is very difficult to drink very similarly it can become very difficult to earnate if you have an enlarged prostrate now what causes enlarge prostrate there is a whole whost of factors low them rgenetics if your father grandfather had a large prostrate your probably more likely to have an enlarge prostrate u do we know exactly how to prevent that not exactly but we know how to mediate the symptom s a little bit the other symptoms you will see before you have difficulty yearniting is sometimes you will see over activity you will see a your blatters responding to having to push hard against that narrow youre rethraged push here and out it is having more urgent se the sudden desire to go the bathroom that you cannot delay youre may be going more frequently and very often you are going more often at night and those re kind of the first signs people will see and then over tind it may become more and more difficult to empty the bltter you might see some hesitancee you are waiting for your stream to start or it stops and starts a and those iun orgars that cannot empty that cuts not ga to drips or a very weak stream and those are kind of the things that can happen over a lifetime now what what are some things that you can do to help a sealis helps relax those those the fibros smooth muscle the prostects that allows yearn to pass more easily there is also other medications that you can treat very often flow maxs a or other alfa blockers are healpful in that area a in terms of things that you can do in general for blater health prostate health there certain things tare irritants to that area and what i tell people and not every one's affected the same way i do not want people that be oh i got a stop all these delicious things that eat and drink but certainly it can be useful to just pay attention if you say you drink coffee every day and you find your self aring the bathrom ma lot if you limit youre kaine and take you might see that you are not going to bathonplayis often because kafine is a blatter irritant that can be coffee tea chocolate things of that nature that have cafine in them energy drink some as you will forget they have kaine in them a and limiting that may improve your symptoms a alcohol also is a blater irritant and these have actul been settig n animal modelsan you will see that the blatter contracts more often when they are given these sorts of substances a and it is dose dependent and some people can actually habituate or get used to a certain dose of kafine s if you are drinking coffee every day you may have less symptom than some one who drinks at every once in a while am other things can be a sometimes carbonated beverages spicy foods or a citic foods those sorts of things can also irritate the blalings o sometimes limiting those things may be helpful in those situations thank you much that is very informative em years ago there was discussion about em bicycle seat causing damage to the prostrate maybe en sexual this function em tha still a thing i thought they put gruves into the the seats but ave also in reading on the intrnete i cadn't do a deep dive on readit but em seems i women are reporting some blatterin continents from excessive bicycle seat use maybe ven e exercise bike does not have to be rowe by yes this is at great points cycling if you think about at rat your sitting on your paranium which is that space for men between the scrodum and the anas for woting the vigina and the anes and right there runs your pudendal ardery in your pudendal nerve which are again responsible for bloodflow and nerve function to the area the most common things we seein people who are am who are really high volume cyclares now the studies have looked at a maybe they dost three hund r fifty calometer race sor they theire ouknow biking three times the week for sixty ments but there is no consistency but their seeing pretty high rates of genital numbness up to fifty per cent and also in men erectile this function in women you will also see numnets but because sensation is ta big part of arousal you will also see kind of decreased lubrication may be decreased arousal as well in women and how can you prevent that the reason is because when you'r sitting particularly fyour leading forward competitive bikers yo were aero writing you are putting pressure on the the beak of the bicycle seat and that is where most of that is not your weights not distributed evenly the goal is to take a bike seat that allows you to sit comfortably on your issue to verocities and postures a huge part of your public sfo i no we did not talk about that earlier but sitting with good posture and not a kind of sloucting or leaning forward acan actually really do wonders for your pelvic flar folcassing on postures helpful but also when biking plassures helfal they have actually looked at thi date on they found that people who arrow ride meaning lean forward a are people who use narrow bike feats are more likely to have issues and you want to get kind of a noseless seet and a wideer seat tha the cut outs actually when they looked at kind of mechanics of the cut outs they will see higher pressure around the opening 's ctually not good to have a a bike with a cut out a bikesyt with a cut out becaus they have seen at least with some of the cut outs that the pressure actuon becomes higher on the arelits right around it very important point a i do not cycle i do not the exercise by somethonra the salt bike for whit has the big seat the ae for a few minutes but am i os wont at one of one thing because i shink that idoan at amake people not cycle i think it is really valuable cycling is a great erobic exercise has lots of benefit for cardvask their health but a there was actually another study that looked at people who were parts of sports clubs they were swimmers runners and and and cyclis and they looked at rates of disfunction and they found that actually the rate of erectile this function was not different between runners swimmers and cycler maybe because those other siys were just looking at cyclers that may be it is just the general rate of erectile this function in that population at that point in time i do not the nubness is daffl an issue the erectile this function maybe maybe not yous selve a couple of more questions for you and bodily youve been incredibly generous with you a time and in po an't here i've really appreciated r sure listeners to is well analsecs you recently did a post describing the multiple reasons why women do or do not have anal secs yes it very interesting post very interesting study the at hovert yet and you a explained it very clearly i'm guessing there are relatively few but perhaps some other studies as well about thise let us talk about nl secs and i maybe if you could just offer some of the the keybllet points that you learn from the literaturn from your clinical practice u how frequent is it i with protection without protection how safe is it what are the different reasons people do it m that might seem a kind of a silly question but it turns out when it comes to this topic its ther enasting datayeum educat us sell anal sects let us talk about it well when you when you talk about anal sects the reason people it' become more and more common lets say it is more and more hiterosexual couples are during that we know that a male homosexual couples are having anal sects and i think the one thing is that it is safe in terms of pregnancy rit you are not goin tho get pregnant from anal secs which is one of the reasons people do engage in anal sects you think thus the reason people are doing it more frequently no i think that one of the reasons that people one of the reasonbut a in general a the issue with anal secs is that people forget to use protection a condemn for example because secureathons men in fections are actually more likeely with anal sects than they are with vagunal penetrative intercourse because the anal tissue is very thin and friable when you penetrate the anas particularly if you have any trama a you can have you knoa you can have bloodloss and that bloodloss can then easily more easily transmit setualy to the men in fection it is really important to use a condemn and use adequate lubrication the anis does not make any of its indogenous lubrication you have to use lubricant the other interesting thing about anal sex is that the anis p ge is different from the vaginal peage you want to use specific lubricans that our iso osmoulder to anal peachs you cannave to look ap anal lubricants and we could talk about lubricans but generally there is water based sylicone based oil base lubricans water based are the most easily accessible a sylicone based ar a litle more slippery and last little longer and oil based also last longer but are not good for ease with condemps definally using lubricans and always cen of making sure to a b in the context of course of being concential but also never force always take your time and an those things a really important to avoid trama because trama can happen and usually it is not severe trama writ s not gointo create longlasting problems but it is inconvenient uncomfortable probably where not seeing as much of it because hey're not coming to the emergeom of their having issues unless it is really serious a i think it is really important one to prevent from a sexuich as menifections to to be thoughtful and cautious and sometimes it requires some preparation if we gent of penetrate in anas it is good of outon unocna start with it a large girth item you gen a start with something smaller and can work your way up a and then i think ultimately why people have anal sex as i mentione earlier the prostate is highly enervated and can be a source of pleasure some people enjoy that particular men may enjoy anal penetration women as well make enjoy anal penetration because of the enervation around their the palvic floor a and that is certainly reasonable to do as far as wy people engage in anal sex sometimes it is because as i mention their trina avoid vagial penetration either to avoid pregnancy or maybe a you menstuation or other reasons a sometimes it is because people want to do something spec sal with their partner they feel this is my special thing with this partner that i do with them and it may be something kind of a gift or something that sometimes it is almost they feel they a they have to and this particular stude i look at ther's actualy not a lot of studies on wy people engage in anel sex and this particular study that iad talked about on my channel ar manstergam with a talking about why they they specifically regod drug users and a lot of people had used drugs prior to using to engaging in al sex and i think that that is not ideal you always want to be kind of in the right state of mined for consent and a and safety purposes and i those were comding common reasons what about infection not relate to sectually transmitted infection my presumption is there is a higher rest with anal sex than there is with other other forbet youn vasual intercourse worl sex et cetera a what is theire evidence for that a not necessarily it is more about secues has been an infections more than anything else i's rare you can sometimes aing the rare things that people have kind of comment on anal in continents temporarily or things ike that very rare a mostly it is it is just sectually ch has been infections because you cannot have more it is more easy to create bleading threanl sex if you are not careful and ore people doing animals before inal sec to preven vectorial infection or secjust et's at con of some people are some people are not i think it is people are making sure they are evacuated fully a there is some media articles about what you should eat before to kind of keep your gut healthy and avoid kind of loose stools and things that a but generally speaking there is there is lots of things you can look up to make it safe and healthy and i'm sure some people listening to this and their maybe they have turned it off all righty a and i think we can expect a veried response to sascussion but it is happening afther thaapparently with a increasin n frequency yeand i do not know if that is because of the increasing avalability of pinography where it is visualized more or if a iu dnreally know i but we do know that there is more going on in had our sexual couples and pire as a final category of question a i was really interested in some of the posts you have done about herbs and supplements in the context of sexual desire in sexual function am on this pardcast i always say always always a we emphasize behavor ol tools first dos and do not becaus se of the foundation of mental health physical health and performance in u a in all contects a there is of course a roll for prescription drugs sometimes oftentimes people cannot do the things and avoid that certain things they want to because of depressive states anxious states ceteraan prescription drugs can serve a roll but i do believe the goal is always a behaviors first then of course things adequate sleep nutrician healthy social interaction all of that stuff i exercise but we do often talk about supplements am because they represent a i think in important category of inover the counter compounds that can play a roll an a i've talked before about tongaali this indonesian herb i think it can be malation as well but this indonetion a erbistypically the one that a ie aware a works best for a mild liido inhancement m sometimes a especially the case of people taking escessorise a it can enhance libito to overide some of the a challenges with essessor i induce roduction in libito and generally even if people are n on ourascessorise i hear from people who take tongaali and get a libido increases also things macka rude which we do not really know how these things work exactly probably some freeing up of testasteron tongadali maybe some quarters all suppression as well a mayb some estrogen receptormodulation with mockarout may be some dopomanurget tone changes am schilagy nom this ivatic erbam which there is at least one study a that i think its done well that am shows increases in ephasapholical stimulating hormon with a schilagy use what your thought somethings tongaale mocha rute shilagy am how heu talht your patients about this stuff yes i think that a you i see tleast my patient population is still in the behavioural management place right a the biggest cause of sexual this function whether it is low tasastra an rectile dis function sexual dis function is often comorbidities right managing high blood pressure managing dibes with diet which you talk about a lot but the best study diedas the mediterranean diet at least in in the sexual disfunction literature exercise doing both party of ascular erobic exercise but also doing resistance training particularly large muscle groups a and and then a really working on reducing blood pressure and and preventing dibedies and those things i think are really keeand i know we taught you talk about them all on this pod cast but i will tell you that when people are getting ready for for example we do a surgery for erecto tis function cal pinal prosthesis this is end of the line nothing's working they cannot get n erection at all and it can be o and and they may have dibedes as a cause of it when we say you do you have to get your huma globan a one see below a certain level to do surgery i cannot tell you how quickly these men change their behaviors forsake of erection for sake of erections i think that really if i can say one thing before you do a supplement that i do not have a problem with i think that it is reasonable to try tha a i would try one at a time to see what is working and you are not ting a bunch of things and not knowing what exactly's working and realizing that they are not k an a work immediately if you take something that works immediately it is probably got a pity five inhibitar mixed in there and it is geen a kind of biled over time and your necy changes over time but i would say that the number one thing that i recommend for people is improving their diet exercising getting good sleep as you knowant bus tastastron and even you kow you mention this all the time but getting early morning lihe but it is it is beneficial for testastern as well because your rely helping released hastason with the circadian biology i think that those things that i cannot stras enough how valuable they are and if you'r smokping quit smoking it will kill your erection vabin and vapin no and then lastly if you are developing true organic impotence meing that there is a a biologic problem that is causing your sexual disfunction then it is really important to get your cardio ascular health assassed because about fifteen percent of men who develop e rectile this function seven years later will have a cardy of ascular ovat it is the canaryan the coal mine meaning that it is the sign that you may be developing cardy of ascular probs are endotelial disfunction that is first presenting in the penus or in their sexual organs and we know this probably is the same for women we just do not have the data yet i know a good number of women that take tongua aly in part i think on the recommendation although i wont beclare i never recommended it it is an offer of something that people could try if they are doing everything else correctly in ritacess em with consulting your physicion of course em and they to some of them have a reported improvements in libito in desires the most soem yet and the shilogy is less known about the em distinguishing quality verses low quality sources of shilagy is harder dosing is hard it comes as this tar typicantypically em maybe more science on shielas you wl come out the next few years we could em get get behind it a bet an or right now'm short upon the ya maybe if you are an adventure you might try it but i'm not a it is not one that i normally throw tof the top of the list i think that els the trale is is pretty good ostua conduct for strust production which also has implications for sexual function and ton cadaly has reasonable data a i think there youknow there is reasonable data n these things i think the weve that you talk abou ll the time examine dot com is a great place to look at thot a and i as tike as ti think it is reasonable their smaller studies there not a there is by is in manys tatyes but there thereing not the there is effort dot in this areand tere's never gan to be a really high qualityes tience no one can really find that i think ims i think our expectations in to beel tempered when it comes to that sta we rena doctor mollick i won i thank you ever much a for this discussion to day you providees much useful information am and really have transcended the divide between the mysterious thing that every one wants to know about sex and sexual health genitals an genital health a prostrate youreethrough a outeize all these topics that am many people are just afraid to to raise an and to

we break down the latest effects of bid nomics the white house gives the aronian government access who six billion dollars while touting their deal making prowiss and sectral horasmanaligations emerged against tenballard the inspiration behind sound of freedom i' been scure the is the manscero sho the benshpirosho is sponsered by express be pian protector almon privcy to day at express vepians a com fleshmen a poles are really bad for jobidon on the economy in fact the poles are really bad for trobidon pretty much a cross the board a c bs newspole that came out over the weekan shows that the qualities that most americans are looking for are just not presdent in jobidon according to the latest c bs news ugov pole it chows that sixty seven per cent of americans wone o president who is tough sixty six per cent want a presient whose caring sixty two per cent on a president whose no nonsens only sixty one percent wile calm and fifty eight per cent one energetic a among people asked about jobidons leadership style sixty three per cent say that he is calm but only fifty percent say that he is curing and only thirty five per cent say that he is no nonsents meanwhile donald trumps leadership style is seen as provocative by seventy one per cent by tough it would seem as tough by sixty seven per cent energetic by sixty five per cent no nonsense by fifty five per cent and entertaining by fifty five per cent even more importantly despite the fact that americans are really dissatisfied with this match up the strumpers's bidon perspective match up with sixty four per cent of american saying that that rematch would make the them feel that the political system is totally broken on the economy the numbers are awful four jobidon as well they should be according to this pole it shows that only twenty per cents of americans say they are better off to day than they were before the pandemic forty five percent say they are worse off to day and thirty five per cent say they are t about the same level which jus to say only twenty per cent are pleased as punch as far as the choice for president if finances are worse now than before the pandemic seventy one per cent say they would vote for trump f you said tht your finances are worse than they were before the pandemic which is forty five percent americans seven and ten of those voters say they are going to vote for present in trump onein the administrations efforts according to c bs news has been deteut what t seases bidons a complishment a lot of oders do know about some kefforts and an apparently matters for example independent whohave heard about the bide administration investing an infor structure are backinghim but those in a penans re pesent a small minority of people and here is the reality the vast majority of people flar thinking about the economy either think that they are no better off or significantly worse off than before the pandemic and that has to do with jobidons policy the facts aed matter is that jo idons easy money policy which has been combined with a extraordinarily restrictive regulatory environment massive subsidies to his union buddies green boondogals and all the rest it is making people feel pretty insecure their wages are not stacking up the same way they were before the pandemic prices have risen dramatically and it does not look as though an end is in sight even people in the business sect or hore supposedly doing amazing thanks to the stock market boom even those people are holding their money on the sidelines not shure exactly where to put it and he can hear the inability two handl the economy in the voice of treasury secretary ganic yellin who suppose to be he beg expert on this sort of stuff sir gjan yellins an interview on sn b s yesterday in which she basically explain that che has no clue what to do next because they do not they have no clitsu next the probal ot kainsy an stimulus is that when the stimulus does not work you have no more bullets to fire the thing about innovation is that innovation is done by individual ontropanors who have ideas and then look for the funding in order to go and build those ideas but stimulus does not make the ideas magically happen thi's the equivlent of suggesting that' some kid who get straight sees if you just give him an extra jucebox anlhe is gang get ais that is not the way any of that works the reality is that the only way to truly stimulate in economy is with innovation and growth it is not simply by hellocoppering money everywhere but that is the entire premise of all left wing economic policies that if you simply hover up money from the private sector and then you blow it out or you'r nve do that you hover it up from the future and you blow it out in the present somehow that is going to lead to long term economic growth and innovation the proof just are not in the pudding sir janne yellin was asked on san b ses at squack box about the gas price is gas price it continue to be extrordinarily hight significantly higher than when jobidon took office and janniellis has look we do not we do not know there is nothng we can do about it the tout is tar standing a prodoction cots thro the ando the ar are you looking at taking any action on thas fir welt the pricident wants to make surts it gas priceis reln fortabol foramericans a americans care a greateal about the price of gas a there is still down adollar twey of ther hiles summer although they hav goin a presimply a we are mylintering the situation very closely the pricent has taken actiino for the lesteer certainly the release is of oil from the strictitic petrolan reser a piv been a important in holdin don well priceisan will continuon amonger t that closely lashio wonter howit actually now the two things that jobidan is done tat of tremendously effected gas prices rely three infellation affects the gas price two masive regulations placed on oil and gas companies and the notion that jbidon spins out at every turn that he is going to kill off gas he is going to just destroy oil production in this country and thany's at why do not you invest in the oil re fineryes to day whell because you have said thatyou are wanto destroy the industry over the course of next five ote ten years thas factor nmber two regulation and incentivization an factor nmber three jobin has decided to make enemies of many of the bgest oil producers on planin earth including the sally royal government and before he come int office you basically said that ew's gin to cut off the salties at the nees and they return the favor by saying we will cut you off at the nees which presumably is why the gas prices in twenty twenty one january twenty twenty one when this tool took over work two dollars and forty two cents and to day therre three dollars an seventy cents or thereabouts and the rally never sunk below that in any serious way meanwhile janne yellin is claiming that we really should not worry about this u a bl u strike we colnetly have a massive strike the biggest strike against the t strike carmakers in modern american history it is against all three to strike carmakers and she is pretending that this gon o have no economic impact the slow down at these plants because they' have to be worried about at latan ive it thak just as it startin to connadan t li hanto throptan are rest cara that well yo i i think it is premlyture to beeng making forecast about what it leans fifty economy i it would to an very muc chon how long the strike laests and exactly whos uffected by it but im important point ti think is thit the tosits nee to noww they'r tisigreements and a to work for win win s it a contract thit is good good for the work is and fifty intiscres well i'll gepe it the entire reason this strikes happening all the other strikes that have happened on jobidon's watch is because every one in union world thinks that jo biding is on their sides ther are now all taking advantage of the easy money policies and the inflation of the bide administration in order to strike against thei're employers hoping that the by diminstration is going to come in and ram down some sort of beneficial deals them that wooll in the end bankrupt these car companies again remember the car companies when bankrupt the first time becaues of rich union contracts including to find benefits pension plans that is exactly what the u a ble u is seeking right now all of this can be laid at the footstep of this white house all of this stuff wll get'sto more on this in a second first there is a company looking out for you right now that company is pure talk first of all there nt hate your gossic lout of the other phone company's but pure talk also has just to added dated to every plan and the includng mobilhotspot with no price increase t whatsoever if you have considered pure talk before but you aven't made the switch tick look again for just twenty bucks mont to get un limited talk tax tat now fifty per cent more five shou da to plus they are new moblhotspot this why i love it pure talk they are veteran own the only har the best customer service seem located right here in the great united states o america most families are saving almost one thousand dollars to your while enjoying the most topendable five chou not work in the country remember heu oth haw you spendor cash stop supporting woke wireless companies that do nots actually support you when you go to puretalktock comslash of per you will seven additional fifty percents off your very first month because they actually do value you that is pure talk dot com slash chipiro pure talk is wireless four americans by americans ibenusing puretalk for all my business calls for monts an monts and months now they are gright the shure on of the tower nout works wot he big eyes which means that your coverage's excellent and again you are giving money to a company tht does not hat your guts but a pure talktock comslash of purel save an additional fifty per cent off you are very first month of coveras this pure talk dot com slash chi piro i' gat these strikes these you a blu strikes again are just part of a broader whole picture here which that the unions have paid off jobidin in the norcratic party for literally decates on end and finally they got their man in the white house he most progun in president since barakobama and probably port mort morpro union even than borakobama who suit you leadist corbitn has beenin the pocket of the union since day one in wilmingtons delaware well now all of these unions are seeing the're moment to shine according to politica the yu a leus walk out friday at three four general motors in stilancis plans still antis by the way is cristler they got sold to a european conglomric could becom themost politically and economically tostruptive strike since president o bin took office but's hardly the only significant labor management clastering his administration made part of that is because utually appointed a union man hoad of your labor department and you'r national laborelations board iin absolute frank and steinean monster in terms of it is pathetic af fact on the american government theanalarby it isa disgrace to american governmen we by by all rules and regulations of the analarby i've o say that every time tbecause literally one time i ade a joke and they sent us a threat letter here is what they do for a living theres just threaten business is there are not in violation of the law workers according to politica armed with the power of its tight labor market and at times angered by how employers treated them during the pendomic have organized with new energy from hollyood to you p stostarbas is only one problem the money are not there to go around oum pretend it is but it are not if all of the left wingers over an holliwat are not signing the rich union contracts why that is s cause if they do they will go bankrupt tyou are seeing this by the wayt in the stock prices ave lot f the major entertainment conglomerates ranging from that flicts to dizny the taken into rectally on the chain an meanwhile got their writer striking whenit comes to the auto manufacturers thereall get intheir lunchein by tesla which is a non union shob it is amazing how we can keep relearning the samnd lussons over and over and over again now all the all the dolts who suggest thed its unions that made american life wonderful during the nineteen fifties nineteen sixties whos the union job the union job where you sat tere for ten hours at ah toing griveting or whatever and neglect the fact that a lot of those jobs now is usiting in an air condition office doing another kind of job an that your grandfather ho had to sit out there in the fact ory doing the riveting would kill for your job right now put that aside the fact is that the real reason a merica boom during the nineteen fifties is because every other place on earth was on fire during the nineteen forties it is not because the unions did such stellar work they effectiavely bankrupt did the car industry which was the single greatest industry in the united states in the nineteen thirty's forty fifties and sixties by the beining an ninethy seventyes ever as moving over to the cheap toyodas there is a reason for that crap union contracts the first atobale outs are happening by the eighties but says political bidin has work tard to brand himself as he most probab labor president in american histry hand relied on unions political muscle to hlp im when the presidency hen here is even the threat of a major strik he is in the spolec more than other president a ben again they know they have got him over the barrel in the show down between the you ae taban auto makers bian has publically steped carefully as the administration engages primarily behind the scenes but thet has not always been the case bidon was able to intervene directlly in talks beyen railroads and rail workers tbecause federal log is the goverment a big say in that industries relations because its economic importance i's top labor topartment official was involved in a deal this year be ween west coastports and dock workers when it came to rail negotiations bidin sad a rail strike without its out woud av benin economic catastophe o very bad time in the year the contract did not incallu paid sickle for more than a hundred thousand workers wo had threaten to strike the administration weeks before had brokeer to yel to avertan er earlier strike but four of the twelve labor unions involved representing more than half the union work forse rejected the proposals sending both congress and the ad ministration into a frenzy to get involves before a holiday shipping rush the same thing happen for grat to the ups in teamsters as well as west part costit as the west costport negotiations because this administration is basically own by the unions lock stock and barrel unions know that and they are pressing while the iron is hot meanwhile you can hear burney sanders out there mi micking ou a usedmans including at can you not you a bl once for its workers get rad f this a thirty two hour workweek a thirty to our workwig now your mouth is not deceiving you that is a forday workwig that is eight hours a day four days a week a thirty to our workweg is what they are seeking th u a w of course burney is big in favor of it the this push a from the ou ae ofou for four day work week is that in the gotiatin canc ordn you see that is the future of labor in the u as forday work week wha tay what i think and thanks for rasing that question drink we all looking an an explosion in this country a otoficial intellitions and w wacs and that means that the agra workor its going to be much more for dokters wha yo work o o octivity i goingincrease significantly the question iss ination that we have got the erscucls is who is got a better it from that increase from doctivity is ol a no incomin wealth incrat o work opon tativity got to go to the people o oo workis going to net of it wight now in mind you i happentably that is e nation we should begin a serious discussion and you ar ouits toomen about substantially lowring the work we i ga first of all we should point out here the worner prot worker prodoctivitying united states has largely been result ofm investing in better machineries im because workers suddenly got massively better at their jobs is becaue thei're jobs themselves are more productive thanks to th use of for example capital equipments this is brought down prices which has benefited workers or would have its ther are not bin massive inflation one way to reverse all the product al the productivity gains one way to do that its to artificially in creasuasions and lower the hours that is one way to do that and by the way it is always short turm gain for s long turm pain when it comes to these union negotiations the ou a duly rite nows negotiating for all of the stuff because they see that all the car companies did real well becase of the boosting in flation pricis of cars right car price is wen up dramantically over the course of the last couple of years bese a suppli chain woes well now those supply chainboes are going away and now the easy money policies of the united states are gan i have to be curbs what happens when the car sals drop off what happens when jobidons push to force car companies to spend extraordinary amounts of cas shifting from gass power vehicles which represent ninety seven percent of all the troisails to eves electric vehicles whosecan absorbe thos cost it is on me the workers if they get their contract from jobin but jobin mon't car cause again it is all crup bargain the unions spend billions of dours every election cycles back democrats his why i always scalf when they sak that democrats when to get money ou a polsics my as democrats when to get money out of politics who you think is paying for jobidon's bills it is the unions when tey's a big business runs re public an politics first of all that are not true but second of all unions run democratic politics in direct ribery fashion they hire effectively democrafts to then negotiate with them at the table it is an amazing scam that is been going on for decades on end another part of the scam is that the only employers in the united states who right now our benefiting our wayd for way forway for t the government we are getting rid of job creation in the private sector through rich union contracts but we are definitely boosting more em ployment in the government sector which of course is what jobidon would if you would likes work for the government nows an excellent time'l gets that momentarily first everybody knows i love my heelics mattress have you checked out their most high and collection the helics eleat he looks his harnest years of exstensive mattressecs perties to bring their customers

helick sleep that tom slesh men heus coat heliks partner twenty five that is the best offor yet is i can last long with helics better sleep i starts right now l there is one sector of the employment market that is gowing by leaps and bounds and tht is government employment are not you lade the you pay the taxes the goverment can hire lots people according tothe walzry journal while many companies hve been cutting staff and freezing new hires this year the government is layng out the welcome mat public sector jobs at the federal state and local level have risen by three hundred twenty seven thousand positions far in s twenty twenty three according tothe bureau of labor statistics that is a proaching one fifth of all new american jobs created in the first eght months of the year in contrast public sector jobs accounted for five per cent of em ployment growth turey during the equivalent period last year if you lok at public sector jobas to per centsage of pay rell gans this is the biggest number that we have seen in any given year since two thousand savin two thousand sixem thi mean thit does' even go back that far the chart the walter jounal is showing what we are watching here is the government basically subsidizing a bunch people to come work for the government some of this is worth while becauseyou ecthin need people working for you us customs and bor protection as will see the administration isn' allowing them to do their job but they are hiring there but there is also a tun of people largest working in con of make work programs for the govrnment private sector em ploymen is now three point tupertwo nine per cents over it is preepounds on ma level but public sector is struggling to shore up staffing and they are just rattioning up theyare rationing up the amount of money that they are pang people jobidon's fut ir economy here is one in which you have a government job working a thirty two hour work week with a public sector union pension paid for by the american tax par a growing public sector at the expense of a shrinking private sector is the future of this comi theny wonder wy many americans seem a dissatisfied wit this arrangement thens as basically the arrangement that lengthened the great depression by eight years during fthe ar senior it is the same arrangement that led to economic turmwell in the nineteen sixties ineteen seventies under elb j and then under richard nexon that that would be the reason bad iconomic policy is is parton parcel of what jobidon ise doing right here combine that with jobiton's crape emigration policy and you have a real you have a real tempest on your hands at the same time thet jobidon is making unaffordable for people to live in this country particularly the lower end of the in come scale he continues to ship in millions of illegal emmigrants then release them into the interior over the week and fox is griff jankins posted vidio of the called faro mex train it is an amazing vidio these are all people ore aheaded up to the american border they are coming from zacatecas mexico and they are cheering onrout to the united states earlier of the summer the bi deministration accoring to mediite ended the noal trum eur emigration policy remin a mexico which required asylum secres to wait in mexico and tom the the administration has successfully in sentivized literally thousands people to hop on trainchist had right for that border here is the vidio why not jobiton is going to proscess them and release them ins the interior of the united states thas wats going to happen here well know that these are not all people who are attempting to escape from tyriney ridden countries these area lot of people who are looking for jobs and ther can com and wellfare benefits n therere to come into the united states n that is what they are going to take advantage of and meanwhile by the way immimages of immigrants an cages are emerging from tuson arizona thanks to billmalugan i dont i do not see ao see crying anywhere near these cages anywhere you seethese giant cages filled with people all these people will be processed ind let into the interior of the united states that is jobidntimigration policy if you are a low wage american st understand that jobidins importing and entire labor pool to take your job awav from you in the private sector simultaneously paying abunch of middle class people in northern virginia to work for the federal government blowing out the spending as to increase inflation and pang off his union cronies and then you wonder by americans are not superfond of his economic policyes i cantomangion why and just one secon ll get to jobitons absolute discombobulated in immoral foreign policy first the valotoror a scetuls ofh hw much we have to do everyday at the sok ar practice and the science fairs in the prepping for the holidays and all o that the goodness is you can take one giant thing off your plate by putting great meat on your plate

americans according to the uca daily mail the five yus prisoners released by ron's day s part f a controversal prisoner swap have arrived in doha cotar to begin their journey back to america or one says he is eager to visit an apples tor to find ou witht latest phones are after eight years behind bars the prisoners were flown first from tahran to doha on a cotar airways jet to day they are greeted on the tim i cat dohah by the us ambassar to cotsour timy davis the price ftheir freedom six billion dollars in frozen funs fou us seized from arn in twenty eghteen now we claim that i'll be use for humanitarian purposes only which is a complete lie thethe president of eran said as much recently he was recently on with them with lesterholt and he is as specifically about whether they re in you restrictions on these he funs thak not or can use it for whatever we dam well please meanwhile the administration continues to deny that there is anything to the sitale john kurby with the national security spokes person he says do not worry we are not ignoring aran's terrised activities were just ignoring rans terrised activities how is new etanastron security batter to day because of this tale and not wors off as ive herd many re publicans say first of all a what is really better off are five families toiti that is a really important a remember a number two as i said earlier we well we just executed more sanctions on antities and arn to day specifically for the offence of wrongfully detaining americans and just in the last couple of weeks we up tour military presents in the gol fregion we a added some additional sanctions all on aron just a few days ago a ma we are holding aron to account and we are mindful of our national security interest in the region and we are doing everything we can not just on the economic space but even in the military space to protect our troops to protect our interest to protect our allies on partners in that part of the world no one should take away from to day's events any idea that we are somehow turning a blind eye to what aran is doing in the region around the world not at all quite the contry o well i mean quite the contrary you be seconds stract democratic president to ship palats of cash over to the aranians effectively speaking by the way we also releaed o bunch of eranian prisoners in the united states oratial criminals including one aranian who sentence to sixty three months in prison in twenty twenty one frotaining equipment that could be used in missils le tronic warfare nuclear weapons in other military year another ronian and permanent residence of the united states whos charged in twenty nineteen with e legedly stealing engineering plans from his employer to send to eron as well as another one who ut was arrested in february and sentence to thirty months in prison for purchasing siphisticated topter you us elec tronic equipmen in stofswuare through confront companies in the u a meanwhile john carby continues to maintain do not worry the resume is never goin to get their hands on this money which is weird because on t they totally are that' what happens when you release money to criminals what can the united state n do if it is seen that they are using this money not for o not for madisen for badresonlock at back down can stop a transaction it is important to remember cate that the yae believeser su does it get the money that they can request or withdraw for humanitarian goods agricultural products medical supplies food and then we will run a process through which those goods are contracted for the aronius do not even get the let the contracts we will make sure that the contracts are let with venders that we know we can trust and then that material will be delivered to the aronian people the aronian regime does not get hands on this money there is nothing that american os better than forein a going directly to the sources that were seeking to atted to i ben incredibly sarcastic right now the amount of money that we waste every year on fraud and grapticaes directly to dictators all over the world is insane it is hundreds of millions of dollars there is a reason the yocerariphit andd upt the richest guy the palicignian authority hn give that money to all of his all his subjects and the same thing's happening over our by theway money is fungible let us assume for a second that he is right let us u sum the six billion dollars goes for humanitarianade that' six billiong dollars are on nown does't have to spend on that stoff and then now spend on giving misciles to hasbelot it it is just an absurdity but the administration on form policy is an absurdity in terms of other absurdities adthis administration by the way jobian continues to mock re public ns on the impeachment stoff now our re publicans can be able to achieve the impeachment of of jobidon now i do not now of the gon to beable to even achieve in the house i do not knw they hae a majority in the house i would assume that at the end of the day mocarthy is somehow tin a wrangle a bar majority to impeach bidon and mo that that will hav an impact on bine is he can actually be remove from office by democratic senate of course not of course not but that is not the point the point is the me a lot of damaging material about joe's corruption from now u to a lection day and jobidon is absolute blithe about the whole timement the thing which is which is pretty shocking moment to go at the pracidat reacting with defiet when ask about the new house in peachmanquiry as he arrived back at the white house wos alug tas usog by the wy now an now that i watch jobidan walking around i cannot get donals frum's description of jobi not my head it is an excellent description he says he always os les walking on a bet of toothbics yo he definitely definitely does by the way hunter has somehow come up with the money to soe the iras which is exciting stuff remember he does no enough money to pay his o baby mamma but he does have enough money t the iras alleging his privacy wrights were violated when agents are concern to congress in the media about the handling of the investigation into his taxes in business dealings while that ac she whistle blowers coming forward to a ledge bad behavior that is a thing that is happening you kow whose actual taxrturns were leats to the media donal trumps you recall turns out thre alsn't anything particularly on toward in them but it is totally crazy to me how the iras routinely weeks tax records of various people on the right to propublica or wherever but hunter is mad apparently bat dom hunter is is angry that whistle blowers pointed out that yoas ettng a sweet hartdeal from the irs pretty amazing stuff in a second we will get to republicans be clowning themselves speaking of people be clowning themselves the medical establishment has been beclowding itself on the issue of abortion for literally decates many doctors we own callas because it seems sereale to think that over sixty four million babies have been killed preborn will not stand silen nor should we we cannot stand by and let babyes die t the hand to abortion this is why preborn exists to stand up for those who counts efend themselves the only defence four these precious babies is their hartbeat which begins just three weeks and can be heard on ultra sound by five weeks when mom making that ultimate choice here is her babies hartbeat and sees the precious life in her the majority the times she will choose life by sponsering an ultra sound for mom you are being the voice of the preborn please join preborn in the clause of life fors twenty a bucks yo can be the difference between the life and deat of a chiled the ulterasounds theyre basically magic

republicans are hell bent on running directly into a wall at full speed which is presumably many of the republicans plan on this government shut down again if you are asking for a moderate cut and you might get part of that moderate cut in a government shut down negotiation all right but if your plan is les just run directly in to a government shut down get blame for everybody by that for that and then lose the house on the basis that which is very likely what could happen i'm wondering about your strategic choices again i'm i'm into point out again i am morphiscally can serve to them pretty

not matter were just con run directly into all and the only loser here presumeblwe will be the re publican party because democrats are notkon to be punished for re publicans not even beng able to come

the show tim ballard was the man who is the inspiration for the fantastic film sound of freedom will now according to vice dod com timballard's exit from operation underground railroad earlier this yar followed in investigation in to claims of sexualmius conduct including seven women according to sources with direct knowledge of the organization again were not see if all these charges are confirmed i always creat ta cavabic is just dont know until the facts rall out ther sources familiar with the situation said these self styled danti slavery actvus who appears to be preparing for a senate run invited women to ask act as his wife on under cover oversee's missions a sensively aimed at rescuing victims of sex trafficing who then allegedly coerce those women to sharing a better or showering together claiming that it was necessary to fool trafficers ballard whose played by jim covisal in the hitfhome sound freedom it said to have sens at least one woman of photo himself in his underware for stune with faketattus and to askd another how far she as willing to go to save children those sources request an ananimity because they fear retalliation the total mumber of woman involved is believed to be higher than seven one sorse close to the organization as deteld knowledge o ballad making secual advancis to a volunteer using methods similar to those he allegedly used with imployes those methods are also consisten wit his conduct tward another former employ who spoke to vice news as spoke porson four operation underground railroad told vice tim ballard resigned from the organization on june twenty second twenty twenty thee three he has permanently separated from o u r we youars not con to make any further their public comment the time to preserve the integrity of its investigation o this obviously is a horrifying report and tom we will see the details as they as they come out according to an anonymous letter that 's been sorculating in the uto pillan thropic community they say quote it was ultimately revealed through disturbingly spesific and parallel accounts that tim has ben deceitfully and exstensively grooming and manipulating multible women for the pass few years with the ultimate intent of coercing them o participat in sexual acts with him under a premise of going where itakes and doing whatever it takes to save a child women believed to be at the center of the in vestigation not respondent or quest for comment at this pointso we have anonymous alligation to this point tht ere made to vice we are going to we are going to have to weigt to see what comes out about this and i am going to reserve further comments until more conformation is presented at this time for wht it is worth the the church of jesus christ of laterday sanes the worman church they have removed all articles promoting ballard and thenon profit that he founded when all this came out this came out the same day the church relese si statemen setting be trail and con demning ballad for morally on acceptable behavior which makes ae tound a little more real than merely an anonymous report that is om truly bad stuff glen back hose one ballard's partners indicate on cial me to the ballard had ben quot effectively excommunicated from the church ther ambiguous but onquestionably daming statemenis thout being given adequante notice or the ability to respons to again i'm n a weigt to see more come out before i comment more extensively on this particular subject but obviousle aits in the news and worthy of coverd meanwhile in entertainment new s that is a essentially being ignored by by prety much everybody eccept for the right hassan minha she is a a pretty famous comedian a he apparently has basically just been making up stories about himself about how horrifying american racism is at's altkik points out a profound e new york er of minhas says in minhash's approach to comedy he leans hevily on his own experience as an asien american a muslim american telling heroing stories of on forcemen in trapmen n personal threats for many of his fancye'd come nto advetire of the power of representation ind entertainment after many weeks of trying i hade been unable to confirm some of the stories he had told on stage and then when the author confronted him and minhash admitted that the stories hat he tlls on stage ar offen exaggerated or made up well i mean some of these stories are just purely intended o paintamerica in the worst possible light and theyre completely made up is not resulting in tremendous blowback frorm inhas one of his anecdotes apparently claims a white woman from high school stood him up for a prahm because her family did not want her to take pictures of a brown boy minhash then disclosed identifiable details about the woman during his telling of the story prompting his fans to harasser the woman apparently addressed the threats withmanhae who then told her to scrubb er social media presents to deter mor threats it is one thing to exaggerate u no family stories for comedic effect it' something a lot o people do is another thing to make up out of whole quath stories abaut the evils of american racism this this ye effectively bores on emotional fraud and the fact that there are somany people out there in hollwood who are making excuses for him people equld be golberg out there suggesting that is a this is totally fine again woodwoud by golberg say that about any one else i've i've a difficult time believing that she would wooby golberg's defense of him is that this is what we do quote that is what we do we tell stories whom we embellish them golberg said that she recalled the time when reporter clled to faccheck one of her standups in which she said she had agreed from and wyyou she told the reporter she did not have agreed from theuniversity and ever said she did before realizing whe was refering to one of her stand up characters but that is not exactly what is happening here ray minhash tells stories that are ostensibly about himselsh and those tories are false and there inherently tied to the idea that america's deeply evil in race's place men make those sorts of claims presumably you should have some sort of backing for them from the fact that that he had to make up thestories in the first places pretygoodevidence that america is not remotely as racis and horrifying as minhash suggests for laughs and profit and leftism is a very very lucrative point of view for comedians that is ow you get that is ow ou get a comedy central special that is how you and up being extremely rich and extremely famous he says every story in my style is built around a seat of truth my comedy arnold pomler is seventy per sent emotional truth this happened and then thirty per cent hi purpably exaggeration and fiction he says the punch lines worth the fictionalized premis but dom how is there a punch line to my daughter was exposed to a substance that couldhave been anthracks which is one o the things that he actually sad at one point now that is not something that you are supposed to fabricate especially as a person who has receive powder in the mail at least twice as far as i 'm aware yefga is still investigating case this am that is on a story that you make up or embellish thet's trustit that is either reality or it is not nthis also e part of the problem with our new commedic our new comedic world which plays can a clown knows ohn clown knows off i'm a comedian ram telling deep and meaningfull sthruths about the world to you howevour comedian you teld jokes avery comedian you tell ponny stories but that is ol a comedy is any more our co our cmedians are supposedto be newscastors and our newscastrs are stupposed to be commedians one o the great ironies of john stuart attack and cross figrhe back in the early two thousands which at that point was polbigala and tucker carlson is that this is led to the temptation for comedians to basically become newscastors and newscastors to play john stuart every one has become theyve converged on john stuart basically ason minhage is now john stuart telling meaningful stores about as tht are completely made up to expose the evils of the united states o america and how rasist it is and then when he is caught on that ralspost t pretend that it is no big deal at all tay speaking of things tht are unbelievably stupid the a the senitmajority leader has now declared hat there will be no informal drest code ford the senate chamber why becaus john federman likes to wear the close of the homeless apparently we have to be nice to tumongo over here and that requires that we a that that theren be no dresscode in the senate any more according to the your times in the tradition at bound halls of the senate customs ti hard rules can be next to im possible to change on monday or the potentral govrnment shut down days away an newly begun in peachmen inquiry and lawmakers preparing for a visit from the president if youcrane a major change had the capital abuzs for the first time in centuries whill makers are no longer expected to suit up to conduct ta business on the senate floor from now on members are allowd to take a more business casual approached to the workwere noffice staff by theway and not guests only if you ar senters you get this this special dispensation the modification is in many ways to bowed reality in recent years them in plenty of senters whoas departed from the suit entie uniform that for decades was considered the only acceptable attire in most clearly reflectsly influence of john feterman the six foot ate tatude brain damage first turmat democrat from pennsylvania he edon a suten tipher's first months in congress but that now he just wear and around jim sharts and carhartswetcherts and ouer changing the entire rule of the senates in order to make nice with a dude who does not want to actually just wear suit pretty ridiculous bata that is whre we are in in american public life because i pretty much everything is mockery at this point time for some things i and some things that i hate things that i to day a lot of states urenoucstarn cuttizes with the american libraty associatio which is utterly approbrate considering that the a la is now a left toing interestscroup many of our public institutions sentr micle according to the washington post has now targeted the ale when itwas is turned to question witnesses he call the bavidio of deber called willstones director of the american library asociations office for intellectual freedom in izum call called well stone hade been recorted arguring book advocates should reframent the book challenges thi debate should not senturn whether tentles are sexually and appropriate for minor said calledmostone it should be about diverse materials that are about every one's write see themselves in their families reflected on bookshelves we then said the goal is to sexualized children t ovide miners with sexually explicit material than hide this content from parents the ale a is now facing a partison fire fight unlike anythingin ats almost hundred fifty year history says the washington post i one who brought that up who may that firefight happen i love that we now it is a full time sport now the we will do something unbelievably terrible and provocative and if you notice you are the one starting a firefight the once untr un controversial organization which says it is the world's largest and oldest library association whch provides funning training in tools to most of the hundres hundred and twenty three thousand libraries has become entangled in the education culture wars the raging debates over what and how to teach about race sex engender culminating in tuesdys senetorial name check lee politicians and parents on the right increasingly painthe ssociation known as the ale e as a defender of pornographic literature for children tying their alligations into a broader conservative movement that asserts school libraries are filled with sexually explicit inappropriate texts a two thousand twenty two tweat in which the organization's president calls herself a marksist lesbian added to the concern well ye think yo thing i love that its that the problem is not that the ale ise president calls to silf a marks ist lesbian te problem is that ever anyone notice that shou tueeted that out publicly over the stumer state libraries and montanamos orian texas announcs they were severing ties with the ale e which is good they should meanwhile librarians and those on the political left are defending the ale e as a keeper vider of money and skills for librarians in particular they are setting in ale aropart tracking one thousand ton ar sixty nine attempts to remove library books in twenty twenty two the highest number of challenges to books since the ale a began compiling stafts on the issue what are the issues they are all related to l g b t who plus minus divided by sign books directed akids well good good for parents for finally waking up and taking notice the fact thathis i somehow considered in instance of writwing radicalism is truly an astonishing and silly thing okate time for a quick thing that i hate for all of those people who believe that there is no correlation whatsoever between politics ideology religion and sexual practice or sexual identity i'm sh cannom point out that that is completely false that is a lie it is untrue it was always untrue the notion that sexual activity or sexual identity are inherently written into the danna unchangeable unchanging non affected by environment not affected by by any other mode of human behaviors is written in the same way that mellon an level is written in doour skin that is a lie bran new study out from rad wilcocks and the fire and rion burge it shows sexual orientation bi religion an now hereis what you oud imagi you imagine their would not be major gaps in terms of sexual identity by religion and you might imagine some gaps are not massive gaps because after all i mean yououl imagine that if it is biologically in grain sexual identity in sexual behavior biologic purely biologicall ingran it would fall the rain upon all equally but that is not what you see now the counts argument here is that people are leaving perticular formes of religion if they are elg b t ku for example and they are moving into other categories that is possible i do not think t's totally plausible considering the size of these gaps for example of you are muslin eighty five per cent of muslins identify as straight eight per cent identify as conquote something else do not no it something else amouncs to but a negli gibll per centage write that eighty five pluss eight is ninety three seven percent identifies either gain lesbian or by sexual among protestants eighty four per cent identify is strait catholics eighty three per cent identify is straiht hindu eighty two per cent identify is straiht el d s seventy eight per cent identify as straight an thenyou start getting s the more atheistic rups jewish is a is generally people who identify as jewish very often therenot religious ninety particular way only sixty five percent identify is straiht fifteen per cent identif as by sexual six per cent identifies gaine lesbeen twenty one percent plus fourteen who identify as conquotes something else if you are an eigtheist fully forty five per cent of etheists say they are not straight forty five per cent tell me there is no linkuage between environment ideology and sexual behavior and identity at i it is all biologically in grain sure sure it is it is if that that lie which is which lies at the route of the entire elg b t ku movements to equate itself with the ratial civil rites movement has been a lie since inception and remains a lie to day it is purely a matter of genetics and never matter of environment and tha behavior itself is exactly the same as a biological component melon an in skin absolute silinisok one more thing that i hate apparently the rolling stone cofounder yon wenner has been removed from the rock and roll hall of fame board why whell he wrote a book and this book is about a bunch of great rockanrol artists the probem is the pick seven white dudes to profile which is bad apparently ou're not allowed to do that because he was asked about it and om he was asked to quote acknowledge thet per formence of color and women per formers are just not in your likegise and wenner said in far as the women just none of them ere as articulate on this intellectual level and that none of the female or black musicians meat his criteria as philosophers of rock rather than just creative geniuses this provokes a mage reaction he said at one point just for public relation sake maybe i shoul have gone and found one black in one woman artist to include here that did not measure up to that same historical standard just to avert this kind of criticism mister runner's comments according to the near times troughanimmediate reaction with his quotes mocks on social media and past criticisms on earth of rollingstones covered to female artists under winner and a the rock an roll hollifame has now effectively kicked him off that is that is what they do now l is in other words it turns out that the seven men that he pickes he things fer the best the and ut being seven white men he is not ayig that womenarenot capable of being great artists he is not saying that black people are not capable of being philosophers of rock he saying that the seven philosophers of rock who are the best are not blacken are not women i'm not sure why that is super duper crazy maybe that is the way he sees it others can obviously disagree but that is that l if you are asked to name to day who are the greatest classical composers of all time an you are betoven boch brahms modzart all white men does this make you some sort of anti feminist radical or anti black radical wou're not even saying that if given the same opportunities there would not hav been a black batoven you are just saying that betoven was the best hal iron iron on understand the critique but that is the way that it works he is right by the way if youad just placed one black woman in the compendium everybodybd left him alone which is truly anincredible thing already coming up

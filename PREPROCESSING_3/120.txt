the bi dedministration uses medicar to cram down pricing own drug companiswell claiming telpations but the law of unintended consequences is undefeated the national arkchives reveals there are fifty

seen in sold the advertisers now ma neither at express we can right out express be piandacoms flashmen uton old saw in politics there is no such thing as a free lunch well apparently theire lot of people out that who believe there is such a thing as free medicine and the way that they are basely macnicases is that big farma in the united states makes a lot of money now there re lot of problems with big farma for sure there are drugs there really not grat for people that are marketed as though they are amazing for people a the most obvious example being oyconton but it is also true that every single drug you take was developed by big farma everysongal medicine you take was developd by big farma big farmais responsible for oxycon ter all responsible for adval he big farma is responsible for the emarna vexing that you did not want to take big farma is also responsible for all of the keep mot therope medications the ar mother is taking big farma is responsible for all of those thing in the medical advanceis in the united states have led to a tremendous exexpansion of life expectancy in the united states the the fives er cantser survivalrate in the united states is much higher than anywhere else on earth the reason being we had better medicines than anywhere else on earth it also happens to be the we develop a huge number of medical patens right here in te united states will the reason for that is because the united states when it comes to drug pricing is maybe the last country on earth that actively allows patients and doctors to by drugs at the price tbig farmup is selling the drugs at as supposed to using the government to cram down particular prising now this meen of bugaboo for a lot of politicions because they look at canada or they look at germany or they look at europe or any place else on earth and they say what thei'r buying those american drugs for far less than we are pang for those american drugs this is what led yesterday the bidin aministration to through the in flation reduction act that in nothing to d with inflation rduction at all it turns out the premuch the entire thing was about giving away money for green boon doggles and also apparently screwing up the drug markets yesterday the us goverment name ten drugs tat will be subject to the first ever price negotiations by medicar taking aiment rom the most widely used and costlye's medicons in the country according to te walzter jurnal at stake is arguably the govrnments strongest effortto dates to tackle high drug costs if drug makers captprswat course to scuttle the negotiating powers that medicare was granted last year on the list of targanded medicines announced by the by dedministrations whose d our treatments for cancer diabedies an hartyzes that can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year or more including t the blood a thinner eloquess and diabedes treatment jardians medicar spent five a fifty point fi billion dollars on those drugs last year acording to jp morgan chase the ten drugs include many drugs fighting dibedes i's anarthrightis drug from amtin called and brigleton the list there their sriasis drug from johnson and johnson stacy dus zena a health polity professor at vanderbill university chool o medicanc that is a major step toward reducing drug spending and of course jobidon is very excited boul all this he says we pay way more for prescription drugs than any other economy on the world in in the world and here he was yesterday explaining that if it' sold in chicago your paying more money than if you are buying it in toronto or paris o copinmar harn maricer chicago oo pconr i cay well that is true but the reason that that is true is because basically the united states has loud a bunch of other countries to free ride off the prices than americans are paying what exactly would the downs from effects of thispe according the walster journal the positive down stream facts would be lower prices those would take affact in twenty twenty six medicair would save anestimate a twenty fie billion dollars a year by twenty thirty one the savings wouen mostly go to medicare because it pays the bulk of the cost of the drugs the reductions would not directly affect the price patients pay at the farmasy counter but the price cutswould have an indirect impect ion people spending medicar plans to use the savings to put a two thousand dollar anuel cap and how much member's have to pay out of pocket for drugs starting in twenty twenty fives tut towns agan unalloyed good right everything is grate it is ousm there is only one problem which is the medical innovation in the united states isabout to crater and when the government can cramm down pricing an any particular area and remove the profit margin from the from the actual pricing mechanism that means people are not going to invests the kinds o money that are necessary in orderto create the drugs in the first place in the same way that rent control decreases people building and constructing because wiwc you bild a new apartment knowing there is no profit in it the investment in the byo text fere is's going to utterly dry up if the government veamedicair continues to cramm down policies this one by the way the policy itself is absolutely wild an mean the way that they are cramming this thing down is that they go to the companyis that the medicair goes to the companies thet produce the drugs and then they tell them that they are now going to be subjected two this serve arbitrary choice where they where they pick your drug out of line up an they sape from now on we are going to cram down a price on ou the sams can only select drugs had beeno the arket for a certain period of time for instance a small molecule drug a product an pillform aspan must ave ben on te marketd for nine year's a more to be negotiation eligible a by logic drug if acseenorgin therby must have ben marketed for thirteen years or more for elige ability theyare a couple of examptions the drug makers can use they consi that thei're small biatect than they manufacture one drug or by logic drugs hat have a high likelihood of geting by a similar competition withan a couple of years on list there is no res to cram down the price there is gone to be somebody wic velvpsage neric but the this the start of the negotiation process basically theyare notified by medicair that they are now subject to a price cram down and they have to decide then whether to enter into talks if they choose not to they would then face an excize tacks skaling up to ninety five per cent ninety five per cents they they would still beable to sell ther drug to medica bout medica ould then clawback the othe powero the fatder government ninety five per cent ninety five per cent of any income from that drug or theywoud have to leave medicare or medicate all together which by the way does not help patients on medicar or medicade a whole hell of lot a suming drug companies than enter into the talks the final legotiatorate on the first sentof drugs sapplies to the farmsy counter starting january first tweint twentsec what is the downs from effect of all this will here is the thing that people are not seeing to develop a drug yes youre loing at the drug you see it come across the count ar you woo look at the sticker shock on that thing that is and does not cost near that much to produce the drug the amount of money that is put in ar in d on drugs is insane i mean totally crazy i know this becase i personally in vest in byotet companies the amount of money that is sunk in to byo tec to develop a working drug is totally crazy and i promise youv you are moe the prophit margin from these companies there'e just be less investment in thes pere drugs that would been produced

stand why the government cancur simply name prices for drugs and then magrically the price comes down ye've to see the downs from effects the price's on those drugs will indeed come down it is the drugs that will never be developed that are the unintended consequences in twenty nineteen alone the farmar suitical industry spent eighty three billyan dollars sonce twenty nineteen eigh three billion on ar ind resirction evelopment according to one twenty twenty study which covered six hundred thirty two newtheir apputed drugs and byologic agents opprove by the f t the estimated median capitalized re search and development cost per product was nine hundred eighty five million dollars counting expenditures on faile drials which should count because the vastmajority of drugs tet are originally develope never make ato market some ortin eighty five and ninety per cent of all drugs that enter fases one testi ng never make it through f ta approval process but they cost a wat o money s that means that for every drug hat actually hits the marken and it is not that men drugs every year it hun ma i doesin couple does not drugs hiting the market everier it is costing almost to billion by some estimates som reton one poin thre and two point four billion dollars a year two develop each one of the what to one poing thrange to poin for billion dollars to develop each one of those drugs that is ho much money these companies have to spend up fronts to even toevelop a working drug how to the make that money back what makes a profitable why would they spend one poine to reach to poin for billion dollars i'm cretig a drug or risk hundredsto millions of dollars on drugs that aren' t ever going to make it out of face three well the reason is because on the other end there hase to be some sorts ov way to earn back that money now americans do bear the brunts the cost because other countries are free riting we also capture the industry upside it used to be in the nineteen seventies that a huge per sentant or drugsirecture developed in europe to day a huge per sentantor drugs aredeveloped in the united states according to one twenty ten study the united states account ed for forty two per cents of prescription drug spending and forty per cents of total getipy among inervator countries an was responsible for forty three point seven per cent of what are caled n m es new molecular entities according to the bealaz the beare of laber statistics the farma suitical an medison manufacturing indistries responsible forabout three hundred thirty two thousand jobs in the united states nots itta big business and to big business because there is actural freedom of pricing in the united states to what exactly would happen if medicary gets away with cramming down this pricing structure according to national eviews jeffsimeari drug development wouldrop off nd tha's not ae goring hamins going to s b o the congressional budget office has predicted the scheme provided for under the inflation reduction acts would lead to a manufacture revenue loss of fifteen per cent such ae cut and sebeoes predicted forty five new drugs per year which you just round seven few ar drugs per year that means a hundred and twenty one drugs lost over in eighteen year time horizon as one report estimated which drugs to be most likely to disappear the drugs most likely disappirit actioan be the ones that are for rare conditions right the ones that have less of a profit marcin to begin with those drugs wore just go away seeng forget about drugs being develops for the rare condition the our mother just got diagnos but those just not going to be in the market any more because who the hel's going to develop then if tere's no money on the other end there is another solution of this by the way that' solution be to a ressively make other countries pay their far share when it comes to american medication we cold use every leavert our disposal in ords do that and this is where a trade war would actually be somewhat useful saying to candida or saying to the national health service yuguys are going to pay a merican companies what we here in the united states pay and we are going to use the leavers at our disposal in ordr to make that happen that would be well worth while he is right now basically america is subsidizing the rest of the world when it comes to drug creation but the solution to that is not for american government to then cram down a pricing mecanism on the big farm a companies and the drug companies and medicine companies whet when you do that you just get rid of all the inivation imagine first second if the united states in any other industry decide that rugescin a rachet down cost suppose it government cost on any other air of american life i take the taxector or or take the finantial sector rige skin a rachet up taxation and were ging to do in order to lower supposedly the cost o th american tax payrages can attack that preticular sector what deu think happens people flee the innovation goes away this is simple supplying deman kind of stuff when you get rid of the profit margin in particular product line there is less innovation there is less investment in that area it is very simple but yourbide does not care about that he cares about the top line look that he is bringing down cost the lostonovation is of no consequente to him whatsoever thecause whn it comes to bide nomics second order thinking is completely irrelevant it is all first order thinking i do not the price that drug therefore i will use government to cramm down o new price on that drug sure means that a bunch of drugs aren' con participate medicar you'e stungen have toget them over the counter sure it means that you are going to lose the invation by these companies or have them base themselve somewhere else but at least you will feel good about having supposedly brought down the cost by the way democrat's care about the cost of meticar sit is since when af democrats care about the costometicar they on en restructure medicanr medicate social security which represent sixty six per cent of the american manditory budgeen every year any time anybody mentions maybe should restructure those programs in order to lower the cost thougig none an nop the cantuchit aparent the only way to touch et is to confiscape money and innovation from the private sector genius ideas weet to another genious idea that is going under the rate ar and is being crammed down by the bidin a ministration the the national labor relations

promococh grl forty per cents off your first preferred or ocates of the other big move the bid administration has made over the course of last week i's going completely un noticed and it is going to utterly rack a huge number of industries what exactly is this big move well the national labor relations board and i'm an to say it up front because they have actually come aft frm ius mane jokes about them i'm not ketting they litterally sent us ha letter because i won t's made a joke about my employes and unions we aby by all laws and regulations here at dailywar also the national labor relations bords a joke and garbage institution that should't be a part of american government it is effectively speaking a tool of organized labor against the american tax pair and the worker and businesses that is what it is the analarby is a blot on american life we by by all ofilbe laws an regulations here daily ware o case with all that is at im to keep sayng it over and over because the fa schustic and alarby literal if you make a joke the literally will launch an investigation into you requiring you to obtain a layer to explain what a joke is is a thing that that then just haven to meatils hiven to ben dominate over the federalis to tame do bunch o people these dolts over the an alarby or union base socialist they they they have decided they have now issue a decision in the case called semax construction material spacific they nounce tha new frame work for determining one employers are require to bargain with unions without a representation election ' normally you would have tohave representation election right you have your entire base of your employs vote on whether i form a union or not now i'm not even in favor of that i think the national labor relations act is ridiculous on its face if employse wish to unionize then by all means go ahead and unionize but that means the you have to get all the employs to be part of the union not by voting in majority but by getting im to actually join the union if i do not wish to join union i wish to independently negotiate my salary with the employer that should e my prerogatve and free country i shouln't be forced to join a union tjust to gis a majority of my employes well of my fellow employs which to join a union whatif i'm better at my job than they are what if i'm willing to work for less beaks any to money what that their bunch of reasons why you might not want a toen union which as presumably wy un thon membership in the united states is dropped to oaf small fraction of what it once was tunion membership in th private section in the united states is now what seven prercent something that there is a reason for that i'secause unions were not doing their jobs there 's bankrupting the companies that they were siphening money away from in any case many of these unions no lorton h they woud have representation election they'v the end of the the national labor relations act posit is that if a majority of memberers of your employ e base vote to form a union you then by law must negotiate with the union again as thiy say that is ridiculous you should be able to say i'n wishio negotiate wth te union tnd i'm sorr if i lose them those employs woth their other employs out there but that is owt the national labor relations acts ays we by by al laws and regulations here the dailyware o case here is what they areknowing now at least these toafe to hold an election these to have to actually havean election now the national labor relations board i saying the opposite they say the new frame workal effet will both effectuate employs right to bargain tho representatives of their own choosing and improve the fairness and integrity of bor conducted elections under the new frame work when a union reqrest recognition on the basis than majority of employes in an appropriate bargaining iunion have designated the union as the representatine and employer must either recognize in bargain with the union or promptly file a petition seeking election e let us be clear they are now saying there is no election if tere's no election is determine whether a union was formed at the local lamazon plant ire's just some union organizer went through and sed had every sign a petition saying i wish to join a union now on the promise of that is can bing an awful ot pressure bare unions for years are brought enormous mounts pressure to bar an individual employes you knont all your budies 'll think if you do not sign this here petition you are screw bob over there bob knows whre you live lhich is why they are they are use to be in this country wewhen we go o vote there is the secret ballat with with unions thetre now moving against that that not basively sayng no more secret ballet you are gong to be able to go around s to your other employese and yougingto have them sign a petition and now the company has to choice is one they can either except the union as fully formed and negotiate with it or they can petition seeking an election however if an employer who seeks an election commits any unfair labor practice that would require setting aside the election the petition will be dismissed and rather than re running the election the board will order the employed to recognize in bargain with the union what is this mean this means let us say that you find out for example that somebody h's actionmean pressuring employes inside our company to sign i petition and then n electo and you fire them for interference with you'r labor force the analar by could come in the back door in nhec to ch you rn' allowed to fire that person and now you are automatically forced to bargain with the union automatically forced to bargain with the union it is a major change this is why the american prospect is extremely excited they say the semix decision was proceeded by another one day or alier in which the board also long party lines set out rules for representation elections which required them to be held promptly after the board hav been asked to conduct them cursailing employes to abilit ability to delay them often indefinitely a lot of the employers would basicaly say let told an election but let us wait amonths we can actually pull people and give them som material as to the cost of of implementing a unionior now the worts hin nup got a hold the election right away let us just be clear no election us serting the first place caan get people to zign a petition two if they do request an election the lection ust o be held now and three you are not allowed tou take any action the anl our b deems you are responsible or bad and if they will just automatically declare te union as te american prospect a far lefs magazine says takein to gether this one to punch effectively makes union organizing possible again hafter decades in which un punished employer i lagality was the most decisive factoron reducing the nation's rate of private sector union isation from roughly thirty five per cent to a bar six per sent all this is ruded by the way in a perverse and stupid version of you canomic history and which it was unionisation in the american work fore the led to american prosperity that is unbased in american economic history it just is not i'l get to that in just one second first leyberedy signals that fall is fast approaching apple picking fall leeves

all of this is rouded in the version oft economic history in which it was american unions that built america that is not true has not truethererare certainly circumstances in which unions are necessary and good co miners unions would be at excellent example while it say you ave a company town and the company town is effectively in oligarcy and you have to have the ability to unionize in order to change conditions ofthe company town however tunionisation in america's car industry absoluy destroyed the american car industry in the nineteen fifties because america was the only place capable of actually making cars were the only industrialize nation on earthtat had not been wiped out by world wore to get big prophit margins and the unions organized and they sign themselves extraordinarily rich contracts nd those extraordinarily rich contracts end up basitly bankrupting all those car companies by the seventies this is very often what happens when unions are giving outsize ability to organized this particular trn the public sector by thewayouon talk about the bloated public sector and united states private sector unions in some cases are at least understandable public sector unions are blocked public sector unions are the most corrupt bargain in american politics essentially what happens is that you have a bunch of union organizers and they negotiate with legislators for some sort of bigt give away deal including very often the ability for the states to actually take out of peoples pa check union duws in hand over the union the union then uses that money to get a bunch of democrats elected and the the negotiates with those people to sign more give aways for themselves super duper corrupt and its oneof the reasons the cost of government has been skyh rocketing year on year for literally my entire life time beyond if you think that the combination of this sort of top down economic controls centralization of american can of of control of theamerican ecconomy by the vy administration is ngan to have long from affects are wrong it is can have wild the facts when it comes to the drug industry istat hae wild the facts when it comes to business over all with regard to these new unionisation rules in he by ministryt of hebenminestrition and care they are understand economics and do not care about it n the there there small children it comes t economics i do not high prices therefore i will use the power of government to yell about high prices to bring them down il kep thei'r second order of facts of this sort of stuff they are unintended consequences always these the kind of idiotic thinkers truly ho believe that it in in what they call the broken windows fauls yo w th gard economics that if you throw in rock throug window just helped the economy becaue now somebody has to gob new pain of glass neglecting the fact that when you break the window that chopowner was going to use that money to invest maybe in another employe mayebe that chopowner was going to by new equipment and know they ife to waste their money on another pain of glass and that this this bizare notion in economics that the only thin you have to focis hone is tha thing right in front of he is supposed to all of the outsides deffacts beyond that thing it is the death of actual efficiency it is the death of actual invasion the madminstration oesn't characteris looking for give wast the political allies anyway meanwhile jobidon has to lock down those political allies because the entire american public knows that jobidon is unpleasant there is a growing impression that he his corrupt that growing impression shuld ben launched at the beaning of is political careericause you ben corrupt for literally half a generae half a century at this point in american politics ibut tha th the biggest thing that sticking to right now is that the man obviously is no longer with it tyesterday creen jhohn piare tried to defend jobion's virility sand whell he did go to you craine you mean he took a plain and then wanderin around their wow shocking stuff there creen but i'm talking about what american see when they turn on the t v and they see jobidon's been in politics since before literally since before you were born and that he is es momet's aged what moment's talk about ask we all do let us talk about this and you all talk about thi fack when we were e wear wor a marking the one yer adiversary arit the of of the war and you cran onprovocor by inna when did the presdent he wet to keith and he was there with the with the alarmed glaring in the back and people were impressed that he was able to be there and look strong and represent a represent the ameri the american peopl anke in a warzon country i know that ta shea she has to do this for loving but i got to say that is that is not pretty weak sauce even morning joes yet ereall conto concern about his age eighty nine per cent of republican saye bion is too old sixty nine percent of democrats say he is too old and seventy four per cent of independence say the same this ti something that the white house the bidon canpaign cannot avoid it is a reality it might be un comfortable for some people to talk about but when you have private dinner parties when you go out and at the ice creane place in the summer people do even democrats who jo bin and and pland to support of they do have concerns about his age yes they do en is jus o e jus efact to they have o dea war thining the fact also ths supthac those democrats i thinker are hirhly a migtly a jussay o cas too old arvo for doral gor yet at's problem even his own party knows the man is too old and by the way he is mean yesterday jobidn forgot the name of his secretary of homeland security a a hundrd americas here he was do in that aryour oe security i ja jo the gagde the j ye he he is lost but im is noncius that he is lost tere's also growing perception that he is a nasty person which of course is true i' been talking about this for a while the the fasad of jo bidon captain of empathy was always alie jobidon is a pathological narcissis which is the reason why any time some dy els to suffering he immediately strerchd talking about his own idiotic experiences oh you just lost a child in a fire in hy i'm a tell yo about that time the ma kitchen gotset on fire for twenty minutes oh you lost a child blown up an oufgantisan i'm to tell you about the time that my son came home in a coffin drape of the flag which is not even true that is to jobidon is whell no other's a new book about the last couple of years the bid administration by franklin four who is a bidon ally rite someny wh's friendly torbdon and i'm the bok is calld the last politicion in sico bion's white house in the struggle for america's future and dom for talks pretty openly about the fact that jobidon does not care about people by jobidon is is not a person who is truly empathetic that his his famous empathy goes away the minute that essentially the minute that a crosses his political streams as long as is lun quote for a man vaunted for his empathy he could be detached even icy when confronted wit the prospect of human suffering that is what forer says about bidon that is begoming increasing with clear to people and it should be clear to people it is on of the reasons why his approvalrating s tumbled in the af from af vafgannistan it is not just that by the way we now have in formation that the national arki'ves has some five thousand four hundred jo bidin emails using fake names to dish government information to hunters and others as vice president of the united states according to the nor post the national arkives an records administration has admitted it is in possession of nearly five thousan four hundred emails lectronic records and documents puttsentially showing presen en by using a sudin him during his vice president byt's presidency narri can firm the exsistence of the

j r b ware those are the st byt by the way very very ouds a non brilliant sudentems right there robin ware would be joseph robin net bidon and ware is delo ware gatigis jenius levell stuff right there from jobn what what amazing sudentem the south eastern legal foundation on monday filed suit against narra for the release of the records the say all too often public officials abuse their power by using it for personal political benefit when they do many seet to hide it the onlhe way to preserve governmental an tigrady is for narrit is release bidons nearly fifty four hundred emals two s el f and thut's the public there accusing narra of having dragged its feet since the fwayer request since june twenty twenty two earlier this mont the house overs omay chairman james comer demanded the narra hands over any unredacted records in which jobidon used to sudent him again i'm confuses to under what gi's narra is denying access to the demals it is the national arkives i mean that they should really be giving access to te demals alve very suspicious none of this is going to benefit jobidon i' came meanwhile it is time for these stupid rachal controversy of the day we actually have a couple the stupidest racial controversy of the day is non racial at all according to fox newsti com ividios circulating on acs this week depicted a young elementary school studenting coleraro springs

ierea e isjuto is forwit slavery aas reason es donsswaeri eysasn tig this kidjust sitting there being all the inshired ministrationis is filled with more o im the a the family has tat turned over some of the emals aon this miss blank as discusse and providing of the rasion out for doetermining the gads in flags considered an unacceptable symbol first case when et eose required the complaint to be reviewed tide to con federate flag an other white spremicy groups includig patriot groups and also tied to hate groups apparently the idea is that if some bad people use the gadsdon flag this means that the gadston flag is itself bad which is kind of weard bease i know a lawto bad people who use the be alemflag i do not see anybody on the left sayng its bad and the momro back respectfully everything can be con sidered racis and tide t whitespremacy it is ad becaue when everything becomes race is nothing is that is a probem for people of color me when we actually need to cri racis hm an oppression and it is actually happening known will take t seriously i thing making everything racis is racis ellewell all tipebeen random things i see from the school and type in racis into the gougle searchbar let us yo wht i can come up with eir racist math racist definitly racist as a person of color i agree totally raciss u good stuff riht there e again it is amazing but by lys is petty that even the governor of colorado whose a democrad jard policyis ot no this is not a thing a jard police was this is this is ridiculous he as shurd remarks is that i thng its pretlen couls exsprss themselves in different ways as long as are not crittng a desruptive invironment certainly the gads an flags a great iconic american flag other cits have elgyou be tee flags other have flags of major political parties it is it is itit is re thitculiaves are by the way even comparing the gads an flags the elgu be te flag is absurd the gadston flag ise just a flag that simbolized the united states by theway wer oan be talking with jade in a little ben later on in the showduring member block apparently there they are doubling down but not on the gadson flag the'realowing him the gadston flag but he has a gunright's patching that has to goway apparently patches that are associated withthe actual amendments to te united states constitution those probably need to go away ii have serious questions us whether the school is banning others similarly political statements ah man genius sis at all levels prout probably we should delegate pretty much all educational power to these people without any vedo power over them that is probably the best i think i think that that that will work out absolutely fabulously oki well get to in just one second updates on hurricane idelia first let

presenen trum has said the qui prad lad heis now saying that he is opens the idea of avagromasuamy for vice president which is one of the most expected things i have ever heard in my entire life since the vake is basely running frvice president at this point here he was with glen back yesterday have you thought of vice president rama swame well i di get great anybody that tat i'm the te ta presat i to a generation i don' you have to te find generat on fi and the at i couple of time tane tat it in a hundred yearsio i have te a gi lik ta gou mi tak get up atet wit but he a make gi i he ta young

youre notthrit to him he is very baust friend i means a little wit there was a viroclip of of a vacant yesterday which i do love these old clebs the vakue was on hardball with christ mathews backing two thousand in three at the time he was in college bi la sose people judge on the show this is really funny i must en me see everybody's got the the the early two thousand three haircot his harcolic salotlic mine at the same time in my life and i an vavace is asking al sharpton about why he should vote for the person with the least experience in the race i soom vevacat this time was democrat i'm thevac and i will not ask you a last week on the show we had senator carry and this week and in the week before we had senaredwards and my question for you is of all the democratic candidatesout there why should i vote for that one with the least political experience wel you shouldt because i have the most political exi got inva in the political a movement when i was twelve years ol and ive been involve the social policy for the last thirty yearce doll confused people that have a jaw what political experiencce a whoever be and o vav of some mocal burocracy has a jaw in camr that does not mean that they have political experience in a done me ay have these first to a run the united states a governments i think that we confused title holders whul political experience as we av have seen with the present occupant in the way o george bush was a governor and clearly has show ly does not have political experience it is only funny because the question i the vace was asking there is about lack of political experience my chavoe for you obviously vakes nown person on state with no political experience and he is running for for preson of the unitesates by the way just at the quicknote the same exact year i also asked il sharpton a question i think i was lutsy in two thousand three i would ave been nineteen years old and the question that i asked al sharpton in two thousand three was why he had helped in site not one but two riots slightly different questions there depending on yourop political perspective ow came meanwhile hollywood continues to sink into the mire the latest indicator

ollar fine hooglans thait i expectet i would finish if not all that six months big chunk of it is a huge win what it does his it was setting a precedent what they wanted was to real to turn for parents especially when theirestanding up against transgenda with what is being pushed through the schools by the scool councillors and for all of these different things hooglan was feature anonymously in the daily wares enormous hit doc ment fory what is a woman and took legal action after canadian childrens hospitale and twenty ateen told him his daughter whoas thirteen was going to be injected with testostrone without his consent in british columbia the infant's act permits miners to consent to their own trans treatments of doctors think it is their best interest n parents consent

continues to speak out he was thrown in jail after he talks about the case and his daughter he is found a contempt of quart om he served about two months behind bars mots that time he is in solitary confinement absolute insanity by the way thers the sort of stuff fit if thelofts had its way would come to america in california i'm sure they would pursue something this they the ood news that he wanted a peal court and he is now out for the moment ire a time for a thing that i hate ladies i got to ask you why is it left to the gentleman to be annoyed by men dressing his women in pretending to be women should not you be insulted i use as example one and one a dillan mulvany who continues to be given all sorts applauded for being a gaydude who acts a gay doude but wearing female get up his behaviors absolute indistinguishable from his behavior when he was just a gadoud but now he claims that he is a woman and he won a stremy award on sunday according to seannan during his acceptant speech i do not use false pronouns is not a woman za he during his acceptant speech mulvanhe said he did not expect to win he asked for people watshing to support trans people publicly and proudly anda and expressed gratitude and love in her heart for his supporters best night ever ever he captured his post here is here is what dillin molvaneiy had o say whele wearing a m a red ballgown a di'mond necklace and bleech blond died long hair i gid i o kno i really shok because i thought the only award i would ever maybe win with maybe a tony award but now i'm a musical theter gow with the three ma peeter t to madi to the ma thream i five hundred and thirty two days ago i made a coming out thatio that turned into my dasof girlhod feries and i my life has been changed for the better im but on the flitside there is also ben an extreme amount of transfobia and hate and i know that my community is feeling and i now know that even our allies are feeling and i look around this room and i just see many a me sing allies tha h ons and i think illi ship right now needs to look differently and you need to support transpeople publicly and and and you too can be a man dressing as a woman and when awardson and when plouded for it again what by by pulling the the polling data suggests that women are far warmer to the sort of suffin men mainly bcause women are nicer than men and women look at this sort of son lak ye it is bullcrap baut i'm nin a pretendet's not because i'm trying to be nice person or it is gitch thathat isbullcrab now no no no n no but ladies defend your own sex because

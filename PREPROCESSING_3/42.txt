cloudin gay is out the presidents of harvard now the former president is the shortest tenor president of harvard in the universities history and goes back several hundred years let us all rememberd just why lest we forget here is the president of harvard university now the former president unable to say that calls for genicide against jews on campus violate the colleges policies on free speech and doctor gay at harvard does calling for the genicie o jews violate harvard's rules of bullying and harassment yes or no it can be depending on the contect what is the context hargeded as an individual hargeted as at an individual it is targeded at jewish students jewish individuals do you understand your testimony is te humanizing them do you understand that th humanizaion is part of anto sematism i will ask you one more time oes calling for the genicide of jews violate harvard's rules of bullying and harassment yes or no anticemitic rhetoric and is not anti matiratorat anticemitic retoric when it crosses into conduct at amounts to bullying arassment intimidation that is actionabl conduct and we do take action the anseris yes that calling for the genicide of jews violates harvard cote of conduct correct again it depends on the contact it does not depend on the contexts the answer is yes and this is why you should resign these are unacceptable answers across the board gay made those statements after issuing a week statement complaining about death and destruction un leashed on otober seventh an israel without any reference to homass harvard students testified about their feelings of unease on campus on eas underscored by actual attempted violence against some pro israel students allegedly including by members of the harvard law ro view after that insane exchanged with stephanic after all harvard is not exactly a hotbed of free speech being one of the most restrictive campsars in america on a wide variety of hopon topics cloding gay came under even more fire the washington freebeacon did pullets are level work and uncovering her academic charlatanism by mid december the freebeacon had uncovered dozens of alligations of her platurism then on monday night the freebeacon revealed even more examples of platurism what harvard ouphamistically turned quot to plicative language without proper attribution tand to plicat of language without proper attribution is called platrism there is word for it but still harvard tried to keep her on they had to she of course was the poster child for their cor philosophy diversity equity and inclusion or d e i which suggests that all inequality of grupoutcome is due to some sort of discrimination in the system that can only be corrected for by forms of actual discrimination in practice to allow that cloudingay should never have gott en the position she was in that her academic record was scanty that she had involves herself in no original ground breaking work havy emphsis onward original here would have been to admit that she actually got the job because she was a black female and to the leftis palors tho b had to maintain tha sheectually deserved the job the head of the end of lacy p said that those who wanted gate to go were engaging and quot nothing more than theatrics advancing a white supremasist a genda dozens of black harvard faculty members wrote an open letter proclaming uot any suggestion that her selection as president was the result of a process that elevated an un qualified person based on considerations of race engender are specious and politically motivated but of course that is why she had the job her race and her gender she was not qualified she had the right interosectional qualities to maintain her job she was not to black mal with heterodocx's leanings rolan fire the economist who had to bunked notions of disproportionat anti black police shootings and then got alsted from harvard over a bunch of specious aligations of sexual rasment she was not the jewish mal larry sumers from her president who is austed after pointing out that the lack of women in stemfields might have something to do with both skills distribution and desired to enter the stem world by woman clouding gay was a far left black woman and her imunity was absolute until it was not and a probably came not absolutees people sar pulling their money now the question is whether americans will be satisfied to leave d e i in place with ga gone which of course would be wrong in order to leave d i in place the left requires a narrative a narrative that ga was actually a martyr because either she was a grifter who abused at d e i or she was a martyr or d i is itself a grift the left cannot call her a grifter because that might open the door on all the other grifters or members of the d e contingent prictably those race sgrifters are therefore calling her a martyr today mark lemont hill who makes an entire living suggesting that virtually all in equality in american life is the result of inequity he immediately tweated the next president of hovard university must be a black woman why why cloudingated such a spectacular job that weans omen who looks just her what what wide why or for example necol hannajones whos mane entire living off of being in absolutely unqualified hack historian terrible at her job has not written anything for the near times in a couple of years i believe keeps getting offered prefesorial positions to spite her complete bachery of american history she tweted out well they got what they wanted from their well executed plan the the they of course presumably being the white superstructure of power in america or for example cornal lest who was such a lack luster academic when he was at harvard university tha who is alsted for never having written anything he literally had released a rap album and no papers and they got rid of him was there on this happen and then he ended up at princeton because this is the way that it works if you have the right in ter sectional qualifications in american acandemic life yhou fail upwards cornel lest tweeted out howsad but princtable that the same figures and forces enabling the effinit cleansing an genocidal attacks on palstinians and gaza acman bloom summers and others push out the first black woman precident of harvard ah you see it is all the jewish conspiracy to get rid of cloudyan gay this racism against both palistinians and black people is undenible and dispicables o clouding gagos and that is racis m agains palistinians i've experience similar attacks from the same forces in academia with too many of my collegues remaining silent when big money dictates university policy and raw u powar dictates forn policy the moral bankruptcy of american education an democracy looms large but we shall remain strong in our fight for truth justice loves is cornell west wh's been spending his days standing up for commass who love neither truth nor justice nor love or asha hadale a deeply terrible colonist who tweated out cris rufo and bad fath rightwing actors win again oh you mean because crisrufo reported that she was a platris i'm sorry thae journalis man happened to you that is a sad one the journalisming happen to you meanwhile iber ma kenedy tweated out repeatedly on h matter he suggested quote when a racist mob attack a black person it finds a seemingly legitimate reason for the attack that allows fort to a croupopular support in credibility which allows for the growing mob to deny ther attacking the person in this way because the person is black now i mean what is weard about this is that lismagill who is the president of pen is no longer the president of pen inchis white lady and chos alsted without any alligations of platurism because she made the comments that you may in font f the leas stophannic over university of pennsyllania also this not the first president of a major university to be alsted over researchfrom is conduct martes your levin of stanford had resigne over racsearch mis conduct as s back in july when all that long ago but itr max kendy says that effectively speaking any time a black person is called to account for their own sins which is what happened clouding gay that is in aspect of racism and all the rest of it is basically just for show itr max kendy who is indeed the d yi grifter par excellant a person who cannot defined this from racism whithout reference to the word racism he literally defines the temraism as racism is a series of racist policies in pursuit of a racist ideology which is most circular definition you could possibly imagine it max kendy has cleared tens of millions of dolars for being a terrible scholar who lies about america and american history itr mex kenedy responded to a tweed from some one sanquat we are returning to a color bline performance sbase society were he judge people by their character affort and achievements and it mex kendy says this is the propaganda of history to use dutely bee to blasterm that they want people to believe at we should return to the color blind performance base society of massing carceration of jim crow of concentration camps of linchings of slavery of settler colonialism yes becaus though those those where the choicis the choices were keep clouding gay or youare in favor of masing carceration jim crow c centration cams winchings slavery and settler colonialism according to ibermax cendy again the reason they are all standing up for clouding gate is because once the grift is exposed at can no longer be used and they require the require the grift to be used they of course are the beneficiaries of the grift is why all the griftors are out of ludwork on this one it iswhy al sharpton is out theire making his usual grifty statemens al sharpton who ise spens is entire adolt lying about america and by the way overtly lyine about situations including toon a bralley inhelping to insite ryots in new york thacy who has a show on ames and beces specifically because she is a quoinclat black leader theug what flock e leads is up to anybody to to discover he says quote president gaze resignation is about more than a person or a single incident this is an attack on every black woman in this country who ise put a clack a crack in the glassylin question for theblack woman in the country are all of you plagerists why exactly would her being alset for being a bad president who shield anty semetism on her campas and also a plagerist why would that have any impact on you thi this is superconfusing to me i got i got a tell you am yu went when wen mark tesiar leving wos alsted from stanfert university that is a white dud is a canadian american atynthing waw a sealing has now been set up for canadian american white dudes is jo weird take but the unspoken assumption here obviously is that the reason that shoose put in places because shos a black woman therefore the reason that she was removed from her position is because she was a black woman the reality is shoose removed from her position despite the fact that sheas a black woman harvard was fighting as hard as it could to maintain her this presumably is why eric deggins at n par also to toquote the intimidation is the point well the next president at harveard stand for diversity will that person be female will that person be black if not theyave forced several steps back and everyone across the school gets the message what what steps back have been forst theyou cannot bget plagriss io defantantisemitism the entire idea here is that objective standards do not exist objective standards are in and of themselves racist that is the case that is being made by the d yi grifters and by the way the d agrifters ejust a ross methods of american media they are everywhere this is true certainly in the legacy media when a bring you the eight piece have line on this sag just a second as a truly is an astonishing example off just how

headline from the associateo press quote harvard's president's resignation hilihts new conservative weapon against colleges plasurism yew that is that is the new that is the new weapon is plagurism not you might take yourself wait is not play turisemtus an objective standard vi lift entire paragraphs as clouding gay apparently dead from somebody is work and unattributed put it in my own work when that getmieg kicked out any school in america the answers yes but the rule here when it comes to d iy an equity is that objective standards are themselves racist if the outcome of the objective standard is racially unequal any objective standard if the outcome is racially unequal the standard itselp is racist and bad and quont what weapon ized by conservatives is the case that isbeen made against the essay ts against the a c ts agains t any merit base tiring programm is why firmer of action exists my favorite part by the way about this associated press article ism the the the amazing attempt to tofind the word scalped this vealy fonny crissrufo who is a friend o the shor obviously con servive activis and helped or ca strait this effort and helped un cover the plagerism he celebrated her departure as a win on act he wrote scalped quote as if gay was a trophy of violins invoking a gruesome practice taken up by white colonists who sought to eradicate native americans scalped is a terb that has been in frequent use on the intrinete for literally the entiraty of the intrinete nobody is invoking the idea that chris rufot is standing over clouding gay with a hatchet also by the way scalping not unique to white americans against native americans also the opposite was drue thet that these evidently what in the world but the idea is the very use of the word scalped the internete use of that term is somehow a racist attack on cloudying gat to clouding gate has now responded t this in her resignation letter the entire letter is abot what a victim she is ah what a victim she has quote dear members of the harvard community it is with a heavy heart but a deep love for harvard that i write to share that i w'll be stepping down as president is not a decision i came to easily inded is been difficult beyond wards beause i've looked forward to working with many of you to advance the commitment to aconemic excellence that has propelled this great university a cross centuries but after consultation with members of the corporation it is become clear is in the best interests of harv ard from metresign our community can navigate this moment of extrordinary challenge or the focus on the institution rather than any individual i deep sense of connection to harvard and its people has made it all the more painful to witniss the tentions and divisions that ave riven our community in recent months weakening the bonds of trust and reciprocity that should be our sources of strength and support in times of crisis iamidst all of hus it has been distresing to have doubt cast on my commitments confronting hate and tw up holding scholarly rigor two bedrock values that are fundamental to who i m ah nope i i to seriously wer the bedrock values oure confronting hate an up holding schylaly rigger i'm pretty sure the opposite and she says quo it is been frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fuelled by racial animos yesk that istrit she is the victim everyone has been mean to clouding gag it is been terrible by the way she is notisher leaving university she' stoll to be making apparently nine hundred thousand dollars year at harvard university is a professor she concludes when i became president i considered myself particularly blessed by the opportunity to serve people from around the world we saw in my presidency of vision of harvard that affirm their sense of belonging s yeryu to all of you please know those doors remaine open harvarll be stronger and better because they do ah she what if it what an honorable victim sad terrible meanwhile harvard corporation also issue to statement quasy defending clouding gaguop with great sadness we rite in light of president claudin gates message announcing her intention os step down from the presidency and resume her faculty position at harvard first and foremost we thank president gag for her deep and unwavering commentment to harvard and the pursuit of academic excellents through plagurism throughout her long and distinguished leadership as dean of social science and then as dean of faculty of orts and sciences or shes skilfully led the f i ask through the covanineteen pandemic and pursued ambitious new academic initiatives in area such as quantum scienc and inequolity she demonstrated the insight decisiveness and empathy that all that are her halmar waw we do with sorrow they said we accept ho resignation we do with sorrow while president gat has acknowledge missteps and has taken responsibility for them is also true she has shown remarkable resilients and the fase of deeply personal and sustaines attacxs while some of this has played out in te public domain much of it as taken the form of repugnants and in some cases races victrial directed o her through disgraceful emales and phone calls we condemn such attacx in the strongest possible tom this is always the last ropository of victimhood is i got really badymales and realy bedruncales aunt i somebody wa twenty four seven security literally my entire life because at their people who do not me very much grow up grow up lake i'm i'm sorry that people were mean to you on the emals that sad the people rthose people our bad and the sion is sand youraces temales also you'r a terrible president who refuses to defend your students long as they violate intersectional tenets and your platerist they say the search for a new president of the univers eo will begin in due qarse apparently the interum president will be a person named garber who is the the provost of the school i'm that person also shares the d e i mission i'm sur ill be similarly terrible honestly ous cana happy thet clouding gay was remaining there specifically because it is a mask for the retension of d yi to get rid of a few heads of d y yet revelis ma gillapen a does not solve the d i proby ere th clouding gay ten solve the d yi problem in order sall the d i problem you actually af to take on the ideology of d i but that ideology is incredibly deeply imbedded a cross our society from everything important to frivolous from administration white house policy alllway down to entertainmen this d i notion that the best way for america to run is on the basis of group identity to establish intersectional outcomes that are equivalent regardless of individual personal action it is wormdour way throughout the society and then he is to be extrpated everywhere it use to be cut out a cancer ecause it is a cancer d i ideology is a cancer that destroys institutions destroys trust and destroys the country it is destroyed

also of course in the bin white house an this was the promise that jobidan made on coming to the wite house which his a different promise then what he may during the campaign dorin campaign he said that he was going to be a moderate who governed frall americans and pon entering immediately he started calking by hequity would be at the center of everything they do but yen equity an a quolity not remotely the same thing a quality is the idea that every one ought to be treated equally that is not the same thing is everyone ought to havin equal outcome which is what equity is all about here is coreen john pierr who herself is d i product she is terrible at her job but choose a pointed for her diversity quoceon here she is the press secretary suggesting that equity is again at the center of everything jobiton does the present has always always put equity at the senter of every polity is put for it every legislation that hes fut put forit cause we understand that many communityis have been left behind have been left of behind were not tryind to do the trickle down economics again she is not wrong every biden policy is geare toward this idea of equal outcome and they will run rough shot over institutions rough shot over the law in order to get there this why creen chon paren the sae interview she is toing ohout jobidon unilaterally took action on soon lons illegally because again the idea was that equity had to be establishe no ther e do not no yo we no on a oter s and i wante and it because they have heard from you that i sentially this as something president has tried to do and do you think that over time they start to feel trying is not a dot no but i what i was going to say what i was got a finish and say is that the present even though his plan wat stop he was able to take action and we are able to ot wer able to i get rid about ta hundred and tar thirty million dollars of dat a more than that for millions of millions of folks across the country that matters that mes he still took action he still took ction even though his hands were a tide again this is all what equid is equity suggests of course that you do not actually have to work through democratic means of politics because those are all obstructionist all those institutions obstruct equity it' you hav to run right over them in pursuit of the quality of outcome you do it andthis has particular ramifications foward the american boarder one of the big political connundrums that we are experiencing right down the country is that the border is wide open wide open and it is totally not understandble on a political level why precisely the border should be wide open it is a huge minstakt by jobidon again if you look at his palling numbers jobidon's palling numbers on emigration are absolutely awful people by leaps and bounds trust trump more than bidon with regard to emigration it is approval rating on emigration over all it is down to thorty eight per cent in the last harvard caps heris poll thos are terrible numbers forty six per cent by the way that they proved of it in november tan's going to go down even further if he does not stop what is going on on the border and yet the bi deministration which has an outright now ther's the parts to mating they have a political out the bi deministration could to day sign a bill a yeal with republicans and congress and sign a bill that would get them the eucranade that they want and that eucrane does in fact need get the aid to israel that israel requires in order to pursue its war with commass and possibly a war with cusbelo in its north give arm's pretection to ti won and also solidify the border and jobide would be able on a political level to go back to his left to dailison you gots want ed the ucraned i culdn't get that without solidifing the border and then heu could go to moderates in america and tak guies you wanted me to do somethin about border i did something about thewoardr but jo bidon will not do it it is unbelievable jobidon continues to maintain and open border position than gas the american people by saying tht the border is in fact being taken care of now why is that why are they doing s me here is carrenge on peare doing this yesterday suggesting that jobidon took the border craces seriously from they one which of course is a lie now weare havin we believe a very preductive conversation incongress with senators unhow do we move for it in a by partisan agreement to deal with the bord to security that is important now what we hope is that when congress stits fact woll be able to act and get these things moving forward we can deal with this issue we have been in touch with the some of those mares that you talked about governors a in and northern and northern part of the country on dealing with the issue that theire dealing with on the ground and we have provided o tresources to them an were gen it continue to have those conversations but again congress needs to act the presdent took this very seriously unday one the president did not take the serious thy untay one this present has done everything he can to keep that border open now why why is that the case the answer is because there is a deep idea logical belief on the left that somehow people are ode entry to the united states andthere is some people who believe that it just ta cynical ploy that it is aboup bringing people in will then vo democrat maybe that is true quite possible theyou belie they dono bring a bunch people in whore under educated wo do not have qualifications for higlevel jobs will and up being on welfare once there in fact given legal status by a democratic administration and then who will gratefully vote democrat for the rest of time the ge the california model an they believ that they can broadly apply that across the country maybe that is the reason it synical reason but maybe that is the reason or maybe there is a synical economic reason which is that the democratic party having facilitated policy that stagnates the economy requires a cheap supply of labor from south of the border in order to keep that economy humming could be that is well or maybe the is something even more deeply idealogical here which is the equity argumen which is effectively that america is an unjust terrible force in the world and that the only way to pay for its sins is to keep that border wide open whatever it is the the equity orrientation of this administration is leaving some pretty herrific policy according to the walstry journal the by dministration has now asked the supreme quort tolow the bore patral to cut texases razor wire texas has put upon to razor wire on the border e drying stop people from simply crossing in areas where there is no border crossing and jobidon once the border patral to cut the border wire what is the reason for that what would the possible ration out for that be according the walstry journal the by deministration ask the supreme quort on tuesday to reinstate federal authority over the international boundary between mexicoane texas after state officials one a lower qort order blocking the othbor patrol from removing concertino wire texas officers had installed to determigrants from crossing a twenty nine mile stretch of the real ground the move represents to get another volley in th increasing conflict between texas and the federal govermen over border in forcemen state troopers an national girdsmen deployed by the state lead miles of razor wire as part ofthe states operation lone star border security effort the operation is spent or alicated more than eleven billion dollars since twenty twenty one they have sought to challege the federal government soll authority over international borders and now the by deministration is literally suing texas to stop them from putting obstructions on the borders to stop illegal imogration that is insane that is totally wild bu just on a practical level i would not jobien looke the other way are not that that is just clear host that we will not in forth t hemmigration laws an if you do we will go to court to stop you trom in forcing the emigration laws meanwhile correen john piaris out there claiming that its shameful that migrans are being busto sanctuary city 's long as they are being im ported into small towns and texas and arizona no mexico it is totally vine the man you send them to chicago or new york that is an all hellbreaks loose according coreeng john pierre morally speaking the the bust the busting of migrante the putting them ont flight it is shameful that that is a curring and instead of if the governor really truly onte tha deal with thisition hishould talk to i the senator is in his state unbelievable a ca just just to make clear we lod people say the jobidon asn't really changed the border policy that is not truce the migration policy institute has a good run down on exactly what jobidon has changed in terms of policy's instaking office they's just in the first couple years of his administration according to them from january twentieth twenty twenty one to january nineteen twenty twenty three the first couple years of his administration the bin administration took four hundred and three emigration related actions according to migration plicy institute that is supposed to four hunred and seventy the entire presidency of donal trum jobidn himself changed d ches policy that is departmen of homeland securitye's policy to tirget only recent border crossers and migrans who present national security threats within the country ice conducted just seventy two thousand one hundred removals in fiscal year twenty twenty two compared with two hundred thirty three thousand average anual removals under trum and by the way three hundred and forty for thousand annual removals under obama biden is leagues more open on the border than barokabama ever was by far according migration policy institute just twenty eight thousand two hundred non citizens in fiscoal year twenty twenty two we are remove from the interior after initially being arrested by ice the remainder were border rivals initially process by border protection by border patrol in comparison ian average of eighty one thousand annual interior removals occrurred during the trump administration and a hundred and fifty five thousand per year under barakobama ice also detained in average of nearly twenty two thousand six hundrd peopl daily in fisal year twenty twenty two that is down from a high of fifty thousand in fiscal year twenty nineteen less than half the're accorded nearly three hundredand seven thousand total bookins of which two hundred fifty thouson came from the border the bid adinistration has dromatically increase the use of ice alternatives to detention programs which track non citizens through smart phone aps or ankle monitors well the're emigration case proceed that is what you'r hearing about the binaministration givin people phones that is supposedly why but why would the people show up for their second courtdat they just disappearing to the interior way for the next dackaround under bidon the program has been used for migrans perolled in at the border according to migration policy institute ice reporded about three hundred twenty thousand people in rolle in all ternative to deportation in fiscal year twenty twenty two that is up from a hundred and thirty six thousand in fisal year twenty twenty one an just twenty three thousand in fiscol year twenty fourteen that is an insane number mean just a break that down one mor time for you that means that in the year twenty twenty two ice had three hundred twenty thousand people enrolled in those alternatives to deportation that is up a factor of fifteen times over that number from twenty fourteen they are non detain dockat ballooned to four point seven million cases in fisculear twenty twenty two and of course the bie administration also designated new countries for temporary protected status that includes afganisan cameron eth yopia mian mar you crane ven isuayland they reas designated another six countries hady symalea south dan sodanseria and yemmen which means that bid made ian additional seven hundred and twelve thousand emigrans already in the united states eligible for teep yus you wonder why people think the borders openance o the borer is open it is cause jobidon basically says if you get here and ou clam refugo status we give you quortate release you to the interior and we never see you again and het's perfectly fine with that long s you do not get chet over to chicago or over to new york where is that coming from again it is coming from a global equity position that is the ideology that undergirds all of this all tis anagain what is amazing about all this is there attached to this particular equity position and theyre even willing to destroy thei're support for you cranate over it the sente of crisvan holland who is at the senator democrat from marylan he says that it is been really harmful to tie you crane ade to bor security why is that ben harmful why not just pass the thing why not just passit to day tit is hat said an on going with respect to borde security a something creset by this r for for a long time as fallas migration efor i issues ah but wean this two issues si providing you cran is the health they need a gainst tho an and the bor security issues ah i fear an is going to mein that we do not get you crany in to the equipment they need wen they need we ean to deal it bot the issues ah but ting then together in this way ah i think its tan harmful a we are workin or try to result no you are not if you did you would just give bora security everyone knows that they need it by the way again russiais attacking cramer now you crane it needs the money i believe that the united states should help provide thes support for you crane necessary to repel a a second wave russian invasion where exactly is the conflict other than you are connected to this ideology th you cannot o of it no matter what you do you's refused o of that equity ideology over at the bidan white house and tha's a disaster area for the country again it is rooted in an intersection ol veopolitic that was built under the abama administration the basically america could be broken down between white oppressors the white oppressive class that had built all the institutions of the country and the marginalized people whoould unite to overthrow that particular institution by peep electing people borokobama the democratic party has been enthrall to that dumb idea for quite a while not recognizing a campy replicated by anyone who is not name barokobama was it replicable by hillerclan really is not replicable by jobidon it is one of the reasons why jobdon has a ser rios probem going into twent twenty four the obomic colition is not going to show up for jobiden the way they showed up for broch obama in one second when t get to equity in entertainment content because they continue at disney to just destroy i p in the name of equity first let us talk about your favorite childton

the motivating factor mind much of the entertainment world couple months ago south park did not episode in which they talkes about the complete destruction of the starwords universe at the hands of cafling kennedy who is just been awful i'm a huge starwors family the original seres and even the prequel series which has grown on me over time especially in comparison to the garbage that has been turned out by disny at dis note's done a couple of things that are right i the tuff the dafaloni is doing over there that is good stuff starwors clon wars and starwors rebles is stuff my kids typically othet they made a couple of decent roge one is good but kathlen kennedy overall has just destroyed the series destroyd the series south park was making fun of cathling kennedy for effectively having turned star words into a woke universe of nonsense they had cartmen having a dream in which he replaces cathleen kennedy and a here is the tak tey get ap pat tan pata no pottl of it all it kennedy we we tis tis citing i tis a pet to do wit the new princaricluty et ta g ma ga ga i yes miss kennedy i some of the exececjus expressing tha maybol that may be we should go different rout then we did with indian cont al ge gan ga t ta gena a gaa ga well that that in fact is kcathling kennedy's strategy apparentlys starwords again one o the great ipees in all of human history i mean it is a tremendous piest of ipe it is le tens of billions a dollars worth of ipee and they have now decided turn over the universe to personamed sharmine obeyed she knoi who exathley is this person well she is mostly famous for having made a couple of non fiction documentaries that one oscars about feminism and antipeminism in pakastan which that is fine but what is what is that aft to do with starwords what will makes you think you can transition from making a terrific documentary abouts a honor killington pakastan too now you are in charge of the star wars universe an where is that how how does that happen well she then was a director one of thedirectors on miss marvell they twenty twenty two series from dis noty plus that literally no one watched and that no one wanted to watch and thet no one cared about because it look not good anda they have decided to put her in charge of the nect starword's moving ituall focusin on ray you remember ray or maybe you do not she is the star of the last strwords trilogy in which they killed off all the characters you love in favor of characters that no one gave any whoots about whatsoever no one has said the name po dameron in years cause no one cares no one cares about fin and barely any one cares about ray they got rid of all your old favorites and they killed off hon uselessly and stupidly and then they killed off luke uselessly and stupidly and then they killed off lay up absolutely uselessly and stupidly and then they added beloved characters rose an awful character who annoyed everyone much that they literally wrote her out of the third movin the rise of skywalker the failure of cathling kennedy's trilogy has been dramatic tat there is been a whole new revisionist history set up where last jedi is good moving whone everyone knows t lastjudiyes absolute tras from ye from ran johnson everyone knows that just absolute scrap peep of garbage is the is the last trilo gender cathlin kenny sh instead of shifting focus angain wyngs tan the ext move to day paloni they paloniactually likes the series they have falonia actually likes the character stav phaloniactually understands what he is doing in the starwords univers and wat the universeis all about instead catholin kennedy has hired this person who also happens to be not just a documentary fillmaker about about the oppression of women in pakastan also she was the first artist tho cot chair the world economic form in twenty seventeen well i'm in those seem gre qualifications for a piece of hi octane a ventsur fan to see sipi entertainment well they asked her about the newmovy that starring ray apparently fifteen years after the end of rise of skywalker and hereis what she had to say the first woman and the first firston of color just direct a star wors fill itset to be release twenty twenty six you can say that the forse is strong with this ot here is t starmano bachono you do not i n very thrit about the project because i think on what we are about to create it is something very special and we are in twenty twenty four now and i think i it is about time that we had a woman i come forward i to shape the story in agonic see far far away ow you had a woman who shaped all the tories in the gal eo far far away ornam is cathling kenny an she socks she is awful she is garbater job and in any fair universeal would been fired but she is unfirable because she is woman also the minute some one talks about his storic ipe and the first thing they say is well we are in twenty twenty four now the next thing out of the mouth is going to be the stupidest crap you ever heard your entire life or whether it is rachel saglar talkg as' it is twenty twenty four now we do not need a woman waiting o be save by a man it is a feminis die by the way daily war yes we heare it talywhere we will take full credit for disney having to completely reshoot snow white because we point id out that not only the rachels eggler saing thistup an then we actually committed to making a rival snow white film ' an attempt to head us off a tiny company b dis nees ligkes dis not y had a reshoot the entirer film wellthere enough to rech it the entire star wors universe probably because i get uny blow i pee this bep again equity is the only thing the matters equity equity equity we need a woman directing how bout you just make a good star worstlem have not done itf a dakade the lasty sin star worsem was rogue one when is what do you guises do for a living and the answer is they please themselves they please themselves on the stock holder dime that is what they do because they they tey stakeholder capitalism the world economic form preaches it after all it is everyone the world can be changed by entertainment and this is why you hire directors weave no history of directing anything good in in the sphere and then decide the way that you 'are going to do this is by is by puttng them in charge of the single most lucrative ipe in probably all of human history slow clat for capholin kennedy she is done at once again put a chicken in her makerga that is the that is that is the way the sall works and meanwhile an actually important world at news the conflict in the middle east continues the the israilies killed a commoss deputy leader name that all a rury he was killed an alleged is railly strike in baroot anybody who thinksthat here is no co ordination bes ween ecause balon commoss obviously you are wrong comoss an ces blot wore cannon glove with one another if you look at a map of this region what you will see is a commosses located in the gossiss trip which is the south western part of israelsing the south western corner and then isballat is located in israel's north about two hundred thousand missills ppointed at israel bout fifty thousand them er smart weapons capable of actual targaning technology much more sophisticated much more dangeras then a camas to israel kisballah has been basically protting israel at the northern border that killed monch people toe northern borb many of the kisballat terras haveben killed at the northern bor israel has evacuated for literally monts this point some thirty to forty thousand is on people a wave from that northern border in expectation of a possible isballa attack kisballah was apparently housing some of the commas leadership according the times v israel cmmases deputy leader abroad an sella allaruri wanted for yours by israel and seenas the groups primary orchistrator of westbank terrism was killed tuesday evening in israely strike in the beroot suburb of dakiya according to officials with commas and the lebany's terras group kisballa isrally officials declined to comment unname toous officials told then your times in washington posted israel was responsible nowts day targeted strike zero civilians were killed in this particular targeted strike basein lebanon are was one of the founders of commases military wing deputy had of the terro groups political burau and con sided the the fact a leader of commases military wing in the west bank which by the way not only threatened israel but also threatens the vaunted and much lied about palsinin authority which is in fact also a terrors group just not quite as crazy terrars group as comas kisballah for itspart is now vowing revenge for the cmmaschief being killed in barry which hegan is werd commas is a different and distinct terras group from kisballana kisballa is remarking that once revenge on israel fraving killed a commas terras the possibility of comas going hot with israel obviously dramatically higher then it was and meanwhile the west is saint israel do not hou got o avoid escallation particularly in lebanon oket well here is a god way of doing that what if the westra said to the lebany's government which is in fact distinct from but heavily influenced by kisballa move cisballa off the border end of story move them off the board theen then violation of youn resolution by way for those re who pretend to care about the united nations there is a youan resolution that prevens kisballah for militorizing the northern border of israel the militrize the border sthere in violation o international waw if that is a thing h you careabout or preten to carreabout and yet the international communis w israel really should use restraint with this terras group that is threatening to evisrake not only thousands repite tens of thousand of israelies an de on french president an manuel mc cron is called on israel to avoid escalation particularly in lebanon following that strike mckrone said fin you speaking by the way not to benjaman its now to the prime minister but to war chabinent member benny gons is for the primnistern waiting he said it is essential to avoid any escalatory attitude particulally in lebanon oh an asclatory acten mad maybesome should say that to kisballa at some point that might be worth while meanwhile morans bornysanders continue to call for an end to eight packages to israel even as israel is engaged in excistential fight against comas terras who murdered twelve hundred people antok another two hundred and forty captive there is still dozans of hostages being helld in gaza commas co on this wore literally on moment's notice all they have to do is surrender and probably they be allowed o goin t exil surrender going to exile and give up the hossages war's over literally morrow thy well do that instead their highjacking humanitarian eih soburneysanders supposed supposed pro israel friend on left who iseriously is non is let me be clear no more you us funding for nitting yow whose illegal in moral brutal and grostly disproportion at war against the palistinian people again he is using the word to proportionate incorrectly here proportion has nothing to do with the number of people killed on your side forso the number people kiled on the other side the proportion is weather youre killing the minimal number of people necessary to achieve your military objective and the answer for israel is yes because commas has imbedded thirty to forty thousand terrorists in the middle of civilian populations continue fire rockets on israel even now months later also i love that he says that it is nittingyah who is war it is a unity government ware cabinet if nittinya were alsted tomorrow the war cabinet might be more wright wing nittingnow who is actually n incromentalist the big critikue an israel wright now against nintinyahu is actually from the right people saing than ittin now who isn't doing e nough go on youne glonthe whos the defencemenister in israel wanted nittingnw who to swiel up north and hicis blaw first an nittin now who turned him down nittingnow who is actually the moderate force in the war cabitet by many of the reports buburney wants ut wants no aid to israel of course that that that that was perfectly predictable in the name of global equity naturally yo the usual from burneysanders and company meanwhile it is amazing how times change over an israel's worth noting that the supreme court of israel which is in fact a terrannical body they literally appoint ther own successors the suprim court over in israel there are no limits as to what they declared ther own discretion to be they struck down a law that was passed by the canness at the israily parliament is passed by a fairly narrow margin in the last canna succession before the war and it basically sad that the supreme court of israel could not simply on quone qua reasonable this grounds strike down rulings from the executive or from legislative branch thet could not simply just si we do not what you did were striking down the supreme court than overruled that waw on the grounds that it violated basic law stayly lili wthere is no legal presson in for anything what the supreme court is doing but it just goes to shade that isben aside shown israel no one cares ot this point because as alwaysiness is something we shuld remember here in the united states as always the social cohesion of a of a nation it is significantly more important then the actual govern mental workings of the nation it tis functional government but high levels of social cohesion af community that can continue to work at jus functional government and at is functional community that is almost impossible to work and that is what the united states is facing increasingly right now which is at why it is importan to mention hat te united states has just crossed thirty to srillian dollars innational debt which is im in insane amount of money that has now been spent accoring to fox business the national thet it thirty four trillian of course i'm fordack ids go the natioal that wasabout nine hundreds haven billion we ave blown out the spending that is all been a band dat an attempt to manufacture social cohesion through th powerol government it hasbeen a failure on every score is not made america better off it is not increase social cohesion it is exasperbated divisions rather than papering them over and by the way that does not include unfunded liabilities you include the unfunded liabilities of social ssocial security medicar medicate inal the restour togueabout probably a hundred trillion dollars of national debt here in the united states all of which is a bill that will eventually come do already coming up we will get into more on the twenty twenty four election and bob an end as zenter from new jersey tet with another corruption charge if

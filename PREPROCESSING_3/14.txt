yesterday the republicans voted incredibly narrowly to inmpeach secretary of homeland security alehandro mercus very narrow because a few republicans defected through republicans defected and republicans as will discussing just a little while have a shrinking house majority but they were able on a two fourteen to two thirteen party line vote impeach the homeland security secretary what exactly does that mean in first answer is in practcal terms means nothing heis not going to be acually convicted in the senate there is no shot that he is going to be convicted in the senate it was in optical impeachment in the same way that was noptical impeachment both times donal trump was impeached by the house of representatives but that does not mean that t was worthless it was worth while for a couple of reasons one it is imperative that the republicans in the house continue to highliht joe bidons administrations refusal to enforce americas southern boarder sigtona pure policy matter the administration has kept the southern boarder wide open the have completely restructured american emigration loss was to facilitate the mass migration of people up through americas southern border youare talking about anywhere from six to ten million people who have entered the country illegally since jobidon tocal office people who are claiming asylum waving their arms getting picked up by border patrol and then being released on parol into the country never to show up again that is a deliberate policy decision made by this administration effectuated by the secretary of homeland security to be totally fairdalajandr marcus he works for jobide here is the other side of the impeachment cas thi's really two questions one is is the bor policy herrific and should be highlated yesaterrific yesit should be highlated then there is the second question whether that merits impeachment on the merits of impeachment this depends on what you think impeachment is for for nearly all of american history people thought that what impeachment was actually for was high crimes an misdemeanors which is why it was barely ever used it was used in cases of bribery a couple of times it was being threatened against richard nixon before he resine but the reality is that the impeachment cat was never taken out of the bag unless you actually had high crimes and mis demeanors to allege and then democrats two times alleged no crime bidonal trump and thn impeached him twice and i said in both of those cases that impeachmen was not merited because even if i wildly disagreed with donaltrum's actions between the election i november of twenty twenty and january six wot twenty twenty one there was no actual crime that took place bad behavior is not impeachable crime is impeachable an when it came to his conversations with vladamer's alensky the suggestion was that he had a conversation vlodmers lensky backan to thousing in nineteen in which he essentialy threatened the suspention american aige ou crane in the lead up to the war in ucrane specifically because hou wanted the aucranian government to go and investigate hunter bidon and berezma and the suggestion was that this was him a set essentially militorizing american military aid in order to pursue a political goal on his own behalf and that was the impeachable offence but there is no actual crime that was alleged in the impeachment documents it was all again bad behavior inso i said both times even if you do not donal frums behavior this not impeachable democrats is agreed the impeachon twice why impeach alehjandro maorcus without actual high crimes or misdemeanors the reason is because if these are the new rules they applied to every one evenly and we should all recognize that if we want to go back to status quo anti if eone put the cap back in the bag then we cannot have a situation which democrats get to impeach republican officials for not high crimes and misdemeanors and then republicans will only impeach for high crimes and misdemeanors the impeachment serves purposes one is an obviously political and i think well merited purpose which is go after this administration on their crat border policy and two is to reestablish a mutually assure destruction with regard to impeachment s that if both parties wish to restore what impeachment was for before which is just high crimes and misdemeanors let us go back to that otherwise is just gonto be every one can basically assume that if in opposing party takes control of congress a party that is not the same party running the precidency that somebody in the white house is goig to get impeached that just the way this is going to work accordig to the wallstry journal with the two hundred forteen a tounder thirteen vote morchus became the first sitting cabinet official and history to be impeached the juop he has been pursuing the impeachmen for more than a year alleging that marchus has wilfully refused to en force the nations and migration laws pointing to the record number of illegal crossings at the southern border maorchus is called those allegations false and of course is not going anywhere in the senate of the united states now again this does not mean that alehan dra marichason doing a horrifying job he is doing a truly horrifing jop but it is also true that there are no crimes that are actually alleged in the impeachment documents and looking the impeachment documents right now again the political case for impeaching mayorcus or hall impeaching jobidon is very strong if by that you just mean this person is doing a really bad job and betraying their public oath of office and should not be in that jop for example the impeachment documents say that alehandro maorchus has demonstrated he will remain othrat to national and border security the safety of the u us people and the constitution if a louge remain in office and as acted in manner grossly in compatible with his duties in the rule of love and i totally agree with all of that again is that a high crimer mis demeaner now me i think jobidon does tot pretty much every day and that doe the mean he his comitted a high crime or misdemeanor but again this about two things one is reestablishing a level of deterrents with regard to what used to be a ucallearoption in american politics impeachments a even when billclinton was impeache by the house of representatives billclyn had committed a crime billclint committed obstruction of justice that was alleged in the impeachment chargeing documents that is what was there it was democrats who broke this glass and now it is democratic an to have to put him back together that is all get' to more on this in just one second first for all my christian listeners lends the forty

in or life than reconnecting with the divine hallo will help you do it but a hallo dot com slash apperill gat that exclusive at three month free trial of more than six thousand prayers and meditations to day tell what are the consequenceos froltis while obviously it keeps front and centere all of the border failures of this administration and those border failures are myriad and superproblematic democrats our claiming of course that this is all ridiculas an there is 't there nothing to it and ins the same people who are claiming that it was perfectly fine to impeach donnal trump over not high crimes an mis meaners now saying that its really bad to impeach mayarcus over not high crimes admis demeaners of fr example represent of dan boldman who actually led the impeachment affort against trump he says that going after mayorcus us just about taking a scalp well i mean that is true what do you think going after trump was as wellp the president atd secretary my orcas and months negotiating kee by partisan deel to atress the situation at the border which goes further than any democrat has ever gone before and all of a sudtle after claiming that the administration needs to attress the border the republicans and dovl trup deside noot we do not really want to solve the problems we want the problems that we can prod against the prolems and that is notcredibly senical a nots what this is all about it is taking a scalp secretary by orcas for the mock a bace and trying to lay the blame at his feet for situation at the border that meeds to be addressed but can only be a tress by legislation not by executive action and of course that is a li right what what the impeachment is about is saying the merichus has every legal tool at his disposal to shut the border democrats are of course claiming that you need some sor by partis in peace of enabling legislation in ornr close the border which is not true andthen you hear by the way some republicans buying in to this retoric by suggesting that there neecs to be additional funding at theborder there actually does not again i was down at the port a talk to the head of the borpatral union ion can watch that documentary that we made about at the first aposote of divided states oviding can check that out over a daily wire we discuss all this in dapt this is not a resource problem this ise resource allication problem and that is in fact about aljandromaorchus which is wi for political purposes it is necessary to remind every one that this is solely on the bidian administration that this really is about the bidin administration and let us be real about this democrats have taken the open boarder's posit on hakeen jeffreys who is the minority leader of the democratic partyg thouse he says that greg abbot the governor of texas is the real problem because greg abbot is taking e legal emigrants and telling them that they n get on a bust to new york or chicago he suggest that he is responsible for human trafficing for telling people that they can go to major american sanctuary cities but jobiden is not responsible for human trafficing for literally facilitating the entry of maybe ten million people intothe country do you not see that the move by governor abbot of tacis a to bos migrants to democraticallyaning city such is new york or chicago or denger that while you might think it is cruel it has been a factive an demonstrating how this inflict inflexof migrans has samp social service resources and demonstrated that this is a real crisis i do you d you agree with that ogovernor abbot isan abaratmen an a human trafficer they want to keep the border open when you suggest that abbot is the embarrassment in the human trafficer it is pretty obvious what you want at all of this obviously pleays in to brouder concerns about jobidon's presidency the reason thet democrats are very upset about the impeachment of mayorkus is because obviously' suggests the american people that jobidon is truly a bad president becaus jobidon is truly a bad president and all of the factors that are militating against his reelection are now coming into play according t brigt bat da com presiden jobidonat maintained a plausible deniability while his family business raked in millions from several forn antities including c e f s china energy company which compromise the president according to former bidon family business partner toning bobolinsky he was talking to the house im peachment inquiry there is impeachment inquiry into jobidon himself his testimony is significant because of course you will remember that he actually did meet jobidon in the lobby f the beverly hilton hotel and made twenty seventeen to discuss business with c e f s and he is also the whistle blower who mention bybolinski is that the infamous email about a stake of ten per cent held for by ah for the big guid the big gui was jobidon there wis a carvout for jobidon according to bomolinsky he said the only reason any of thse international business transactions took place with tens of millions of dollars slung directly to the bidon family was because jobidon was a nhigh office the bidon family busness was jobidon period other players have made this point very clear as well hunder bidon himself is abdimently stated it in a variety of communications as did another bidon family business associate dovan archer in his testimony last year nthe perception of jobidon as some clean politician who is never been involved in cruption is obviously not true see abd together his political in compatents his accusations of cruption thatare still swirling around him those sort of taken a bacsit to the biggest issue surrounding him right now which is his obvious sinility when he is obviously losing it onamental level eighty six persent of americans by the lates ploying toy to think he is too old to be presidents of the united states and meanwhile democrats have no alternatives they are just ge thereis no way out but through for them and their defensis are ge ting more and more straind creenjon pierre yesterday white house press secretary in competent terrible itter jo she suggested

american consterns about his mental state and he went out there and started spewing cream of wheat and then jabbering nonsensically about how the presidents of etrypt was the president of mexico and such she set whose idea was that ti said of th time it was clearly jobidon's idea cas no political consultant in their right mind would put apple sauce for brains out there in the middle of the

one of the cases the democratsman making as we will ee in a moment is at the special council who totally sank jobiton's boat here e's the problem th special council had on his plate a real issue which was the jo bidin clearly m candal class fy documents knowingly obviously he was on tape agit is amazing how many of oure politicians do the crime on tape it is it is first rule of criming as i've had a thousand times do not do crime n tape folks they watch the wire do not yo crime on tape but apparently all of our politicians break that rule jobidon was on tape with his ghost writer saying just a minit all the classifbi materials or os i jus found the classifbi material which means he knew they were classified in that they were at his house which they violation of the huin any case the way that the special council got out of that it was was by saying ye i mean it is true that he set all that but also we all know that his brain is no longer functional that he is in the clutchots hav encroaching sinility and then democrates how dare he say that and people merr ilo ha well if you say that he is not see nile men maybe you should release the transcript creensohn peras asked are they can release the transcripsinat i cersi ton letter the itrageeral ain for the release tho the transcripts a reportin related to ers investigation givin yer intisti a the special counte cariteration of the presidents to met er oh were an accurat are eagerallys material to be made or wen tes wor they rely won look and i just wont to be really clear as not just tus that was also a by partisan voices in the legal illegal experts who have said it was raw flatly wraw right it was it was gratuitous t was in appropriate how that was characterize in in in o the special councils report for any other specific on the the transcript or anything related to that the letter i would certainly preferyou to my colleagues say you wank a tha ofll give it nythin you are word is flout and wrong two it is cannot tayy wank an materially ma wicn a mar w know what i n saythin there discussing it theyre looking at it there is a process thats involve and the wayouse council an oris they has taken these questions from all of you and theyare looking into it i just no have anything further to say about that yes and then theyr they are not can release those transcripts cus can demonstrate whateverybody already knows and by the way we do not need the transcripts we can see him this my favorite part of this whole controversy for the jobidon has a mental problem at this point we have eyes folks he is the president every time he talks it feels he is about to keel over physically ye our a i gin me surprise by anythingin the transcript i'll be surprised of he shocking ly articulate that is what wll surprise me meanwhile the democrats again that keep tring pushed through nancy plosy who is eighty three years old legitimately eighty three because the entire leadership class of our country has been dead for twenty years nancy polosy they are trotting hur out to say the jobidon is sharp which is an amazing amifter trot out the lady whose two years older than jobidin to explain wby old age and sharpness are i're not a facting jobidon amazing stuff here do you think that is the avenue the president bin should go down on this cort of poking fun at at in his ages is age the is is age yet i ta this fello worked with the president for long time pecially cas lia speaker when he was president and ow since that and he knows a me he hi's always on the ball he knows thes issues he knows the let teslationtly how bright fomo that e campaigned on it he remembers that a any one who wuld a think that there a some advantage because of his age a a thinks that at the peril because he is very shock thin n tensure's a clacking ys this is our country now uow gensaki the former press secretary for joban she says that may be wishactually investigate robert her the special council yes we we should we should not talk about the twenty of amendment for our fading president instead we should talk about whether the special council is a bad bad man for noting the thing that every one can see becauses again we all have ibles is reporting and who e talked to when outside of what would be normal even for a speciil council do you think that should be invest the ganetor looked into because in n the judicial system the judiciarious conofator not not a positive vieu necessarily by the american public at the flit well in the rull that i have all i can do his pointed out which is you had and investigation that ran for fifteen months which could have been concluded in just a few months there was never any question the president had not engageon colonel wrong toing he was the self reporting partyesere he had turned the documents over upon discovery cooperated in every respect and yet somehow in this report of the special council felt compelled to engage in this irrelevant unfounded and often projurative commentary and i think it is clear that of that commentoryis in consistent with department normsan a invstic investigate the special council that is te taking you gesurdan grate chucksumer also an old man he is out there defending joban i am amused by the fact that legitimately every person in these conversations is is an elderly person chuckshumer is seventy three years old rs stuction or he is the spring chicken of the group talking about how with it jobinis i talk to president bion regularly or sometimes several times in a week un usually several times in a week his mental acuity is great sfine it is as good as it is been over the years i've been speaking to him for thirty years since we oked on the brady bill in the salt weapons man when i was at young congressmen and dem he he is he is fine all this right wing propagander that he is mental acuity is declined is wrong oh it ids it is tell wrong is it thit is more on this injest one second first if there is one thing keeping me aliverig now it is black rifle coffee last night we are back in from bad stage as really really late and then my three yoar old daughter came on in at five thirty this

central to take over his old slot on the daily show he is now doing that i suppose every monday he open with a bit about how not with it jobidon is and again this is a formant that all was suited john sturbast non ever said he was on talensed i said he is bad for the country now never said he was on taensed here is john steward opening up his guns on jobine's mental acuity these you candidates they are both similarly challenge and it is not crazy to think thot the oldest people ind the history of the country to ever run for president might have some of these challenges now demicrats we will say that any criticism likenes especially if bid is unfair because you just do not know bidin they kno bidin if your telling has got the sance is sharperfol energy at out tot of it really control and leading you should fill that that would be good to show to people instead of te ticto where he goes one thing we know for certain is this we have too candidates who are cronologically outside the norm of anyone who is run a for the presidency in this country and the history of this country theyare the oldest people ever to run for president breaking by only four years the record that wthe sthanks of this election do not make donal trumps opponent bless subject to scrutiny it actually makes him more subject to scrutiny if the barbarians are at the gate you want conin standing on the ramparts not suffice to say jobiton has a bpunge of promising his realikes affort including the fack by the way that in flation continues to truck along the consumer price index came out yesterday and what if

cline i in the mo a wort pointing out a yes things are bad for jobite now does that mean that jobidon is going to when lose in in twenty twenty four we have some early indicators and they are not amazing for republicans last night there was an election in the house seat to succeed george santos you are membered tor santos he is the weirdo who is fitting about his name and his sectuality and pretty much everything else george sand remember this lained conartist huckster mayby lible for criminal trarts anyway h got tossed out of his seat by the congress and that left to see bacant that seat was a democrat district it had been rated to toss up by cook political report is a pretty hotly fought race between a democrate name tom suasy tom suasy had had that seat for a couple of terms before santos took it in twenty twenty two and he was running against republican a massy pillop who is really s for of fascinating character etheopian jew who was pro trump but did not run her campaign on the basis of trump because isshe had it would been bad that that is not exactly a a trump rich neighborhood jobidon won that district in any case thas he pillop lost last night she lost because again there is a lot o money those tossed in tom suasi as a very strong ground game iis very snowy outside and and all the rest but special elections in this elections likle have not been going well for epublicans over all that does not mean that that they are not always bell leather does not mean that is neserlian go amazing for democrats an twenty twenty four with that said these special lections if they are going for republicans would probably be an indicator that twenty twenty four could theoratically be a republican wave year in the face of democratic failures the problem is democrat's right now our only losing the house by a couple of votes with the loss of this seat the republican house majority is down to three or four tootal votes an some of those seats our curtly being occupied by people larn showing up for congress that means that in the upcoming twenty twenty four elections there is a very not insignificant likelihood the democrats and of taking the house and frall the talk about republicans taking the senate those then are races are very close one of things republicans should keep in mind is that theyre running against a dead person eighty six per centif theamerican public thinks thet jobidon is dead they hate him on every issue and republicans are aning dead even in pretty much every poll down rums aring dead even with jobidon one of the ways that you can militate against that the can fight against that is to use every voting tool at your disposal one of the big problems in new york is thet republicans did not vote early they did not use mail and ballats who did the democrats the democrats use the mal and ballast now whol coult in the republican party who would have suggested the mail and balts are stupin ushon use them who wouldhave proposed such a foolish proposition they you should never that it is its somehow morally bad devote early if your republican thus losing two centeteats in georgia and may be his own presidential election downs rum beter flip on that right fasts because use every method at your disposal to win it is legal why would you not encourage republicans to vote early according to the wolstry journal sazi will succeed george osantos he cutzins when already narrowed cupe majority in the chamber the partybreak town is currently two nineteen to two twelve sazi be back criticism from pill up over the by dministrations stewardship of the southern bor as well as the handling of eric adams of the migran crisis in new york city sazi said the race was center an emigration and the economy much the issues all across our country we ou on this race because we addressed te issues an found away to bind or division suazi is a more of a moderates democrat in sum respects in fact as soon as his election was anounce a bunch of procomasprotester showt up andstar yelling at im that is of this looke with that sid this was a pretty solid victory by suazi was not partict close election handed up when about four fifty four tof forty six in thes election if again if democrats had lost this seat it would ben red blinking light right in their face but they did not the republican mouth is still rough emigration is not can be enough s o can be the only issue for republicans in the twenty twenty four election this now makes the second major congressional election in which republicans have tried to make emigration center piece and it did not quite work don trum tried to do it in twenty eighteen and it really did not redounce for the republican benefit de mocrat had pretty high turn out because they wanted to show up and take back the district and once again that malin voting problem is a problem forepublicans dissippointing geope turn out on the day ob could cripple trump and this

price on twitter he points out that there is also a special election yesterday in bucks county pensylvania to determine control of the state house of representidates ire's a biding plus ten district s solidly bidin district the race was called four the democrats over the republicans with only forty three percent ofthe vote counted why well because the democrat won the mail an vote eighty six to fourteen eighty six to fourteen why because republicans keeps saing stupid things do not vote by mail dum dum dum do not do that the other thing tha you should not do is probably you should not run every congressional or sentate race on the basis ob does donald trump love the candidate personally the candidate in that race again massy pillop was on anti trum candidate just gos in a person who made trump the centrpiece for campaign and dom trump is a very bad habit which is crap on candidates some of whom he indorses by the way who then go on to lose by suggesting that if they tied themselves more closely to him they woul have once he put out a statements and quote i have not almost ninety nine per cent indorsemen successorate in primaries and a very god number in the general elections as well but just watch this very foolish woman massy pillop running in araces where she did not indoris me and tried to quot on quot stratle the fence when she couldhave easily won if she understood anything about modern tay politics in america mage which is most of the republican party stayed home and it always will unless it is treated with the respect that it deserves i stayed out of the race i want to be loved give us a real candidate in the district for november sazy i know well can be easily beaten a im mean no me no it turns out that running races in congress specifically about trump is not a recipe for electoral victory is jus not they area lot o purple districts or people do not particularly love trump there is some districts red districts where you can love trump as much as you want then'l be good for you yu'ring that heavy red district those districts tenda love donal trump this district when for jobidon in the twenty twenty election running on the basis of i love trump in a bidon plus eight or bidin plus ten district would not exactly be smart politicts if republicans continued to follow that road in elections that is not going to end particularly well for them it just is not s again the factors against jobidon's reelect are very solid but can republicans snatch defeat from the jaws victory you bhat you are asts they cand tee really good at it there is ben the last few years doing it jobide was a week candidate in twenty twenty too and somehow he won again republicans better yet smart about all of us o can meanwhile the congress continues to debate this massive foreign policy aid bill it is now move to the house in ninety five billion dollar aigd package but sixty billion dollars in military aids u crane andthis wen we shold be clear that the sixty billion dollars in military as u crane a large part of that is to re stock the american military build up that is already gauntu cranesto we sent weapons to u crane that was military aid and now we have to restock all that for own purpose is and that is considered military aid to u crane and t we we have to it is estuly not a bad thing for americas military base to be builts up that is estuly quite a good thing now the question as i've said is i's all sixty billion dollars of that necessary in order o prevent russia from taking the country laid all of the tout yesterday that what is amazing about oure form policyed bateses no one is willing to clearly state what their en gull is on virtually any of this and because republicans are not being clear but what theire ungles are that llows democrats not to be clear about their ungles if republicans to silizen we would to provide the amount of money to ou crane necessary to provent russia from overrunning its current positions tht's the amount money we are willing to send and meanwhile wants to aggressively have the president and sa department ne gotiate in end to this conflict that looks what everybody knows the end of the conflict is can look likeuhage is a solidification of the crren border situation plus american security garantees in european security guarantees to u crane that is effectively the outline of theo if republicans said that wod be very hard for jo bidon to come back with something differen cause everybody knows that is the logical solution it but instead republicans seem to be implying some republicans seem to be implying for example that it would be totally fine not just if pooten word to continue the war but if puttingwere to overrun keyve and that allows jobidon to then go out there and suggest that this foreign aid bill it is all about preventing keeve from being overrun which it is done clear to me that that is what it is about there is much other garbage in the bill is well another wars the're many good principaled grounds to oppose the forein aid package an say that it is too large you could even suggest i thing a little bit less credul credibly that it is a mis prioritization because we need to spend that money on th borders have said before the promin tebord is not a money problem plus let' s be real about this the amount of money that we have currently granted in to to foreignaight evenin places crane amounts to approximately a fraction a small tiny little fraction of what the american budget typically is if you'r talking about the amount that has ben provided to you crane over the course of this war which would be mounten maybe a hundred billing dolicestook one point four per cents of the american anual budget ou're not talking about the kinds of money the bankrupt te economy the sef the bankrupts the economy by the ways all the entitlement programs that no one is willing to touch and that is why al wes find at ironic there some people who are real spending howx ic ran pulse spendinghawk there certain people for definitely not spending hawks and now they are bucking at the spending i lay ay feel that is now what this is really about in any case jobidon is using republican lack of clarity on what they wants in order to push the idea that re publicans want putent to win which again i've talk to many of the senators weare voting against the foreignade bill they do not want puttin to win they just think the foreinad bill is too large but this is why behoves you to be cleater about your positions on these particular issues well get to that in just one second folks i have good news in ive badnews the badnews is most of the products in your bathrum they are wok yeun look at them look at the commercials for the produxve bought latamar wok the good news is germeys once help you wash the wolk away with fifteen per cent off all of your essentials along with germy skin caproducts the ficial clens er in moistrizer are made with natural ingredients alivera bam bucharcoal and hileronic acid and germy's wleaves out toxic cemicals parabin sulphies and fliteevill how can you wash off toxic vallues if you are using toxic chemicals you now that that one that i'm talking about it is felld p h t h a l t s that is why tound jobidon taking righe there haw dnover to germyes razoris tot tom to get germy's skin care for fifteen per cents off to day along with all of your other essentials or can meanwhile jobidon is now attempting to play republican hasitens to pass this giant foreign aid package which againd has bunch abad elements maybe to much aid for you crane depending on what exactly is the angual here certainly to much aid for quotin what the palstinians in gosi which again unspecified how that money even gets into the gotstrip who takes it the american taxpar sponts are petty much all of comases weapon re tunnel building and all the rest over the course ofthe past twenty years seems to be the american taxpare should stop subsidizing actural terrest groups thos areall good reasons opposed the forignade bill when in fact i think it shold be passed by the hous in pieces i think that if you are mi johnson the best pathford is put up a clean israel aid bill separately put by clean you crane a bill of the size that you think is necessary to prevent glanmer putent from overunning keeve put that up separately for but clean tiwan aid bill and force democras devote on each one of those things and force jobiding to veto each one of those things thow did be th s mar politics here because the truth is that there is a majority proposition four foreign aid on ech of these things just as e political matter is an eighty twenty matter that most americans believe that the amount of support that america has provided to israel is either right or needs to be increased when i comes to the amount of foreign aid that has been provided to you crane they are still is a broad majority that believes that enough for an age sould be provided to you cranes that russi oesn't take it over if that is the proposition and then the quession is how much aid that actually is anway it is pends ut of course i knawl these polles on hiv you asked the question wewe say should you crane get more aid many americans will say no if you say if bladmerpooten will take over you crane if they do not get more aid should ou cran' get more aid most americans will hen to yes when it comes to ti want that is a broad majority proposition most americans believe that ti wan shod be armed enough to repell a chinese invasion or chinese blockead and youn pass all those endapendently bowed we pat ford fort my johnson force the democrats to the floor on this one a but because no one's been clear bout their position that allows tobidin to get out there and slore his words about all that isto yesterday jobidin does a press conference it was literally if ivebin a press conference took no questions he is dodtering he is not solid here het was yesterday the way work is we supply yoran with no o from our stockpile now we stand our money replenisin o stockpile i noicary has acces stockil in a mad right here in america by america workers a i do not an know it what he means by let in he does not tak english any more but again he isn't tire stick is he believes that if he yells it republicans about pouton that is con to have the same impact as republicans yelling at him byt emigration i really do not think thast the case here he was yesterday suggesting the republicans have turned propouten ni snd house maber houso publicans te got i si arguna stand a for treedem igana sid wit carin cerny e stand wit you cranso sani pouten we stn wit america or chum obe an democrat in sni can togene te sana asiniin the world stant o hous o cublicn do sant in pas i sto immediately stand ergicious et what stante democcracy sand up o callly to help an a wekin american security ay le lea these sorts of truisms where e says teniforfor im saa itin ido not that sort of stuff when ye talk forin policy form policies about hard headed american interests that does not mean that we shuldn't back country's that at oure more pro american over countries that are more anti american we should generally speaking it does notmean we should not back liberty when we have the ability to do that is tru also but let us be real about this the reason that we are backing you crane in the fight against pouten its for very strong geo political reasons you want a throw china off the ball with regard to invading ti wan youn a weeken the russian militaries that provided less of an ally to the chinese you want to make sure that russii cannot spread it is tentacles into africa in the iddle east you want to make sure that russia does not have it is eyes on polans or on lithuani or lotvia or a stonia and these are all good geo political reasons very few of them have to do what this kin of br ad nogresy and' that sort of stuff because again there is our arguments that as we sustain loscall prove too much thei're many democracies that are under thret in the world toesn't mean that necessariltye united states has a role and all of that tere lots of place were bad stuff its happening does mean the united states has a role and all of that either this happens to be a place where the united states can sign a reasonable check and ont taxety billion is the size that reasonable check but in any case republican lack of clarity opens the door to biding being able to do the sort of propagandizing and you can see that i chuck sumer was out theire yesterday promoting the idea that isis one on most consequential bills in american history which i i have some questions long night along week end and a long few months but a new days here and our efforts have been more then worth it to day we witnessed one of the most historic and consequential bills have effort has the senate it certainly been years perhaps decatdes since the senate has the bill that is greatly in pats not just our national security not just the security of our allies but the security of western democracy a gas si again tha tha the sort of game that he is playing here writsei that this bill or nothing that this ort o binary stupidity has always been particularly done now what is goin t happen in the house o mike johnson has said that he has no intention of bringing the bills curently stands up fra for a vote on the floor and as i say i think that he is just carve id up and provide piece meal bills for each one of these priorities first palli ten te that anyway dn't i'm nabus packages thas imonabus packages ten o be crapsandwiches s i be much happier with single issue bills that people tht devote up or down on you doft want ad for israel fine vote on it you dn't want ade for you crane fine vote on it might just do it that way but there is another way that the house could the oretically go round mike johnson is something worth considering as just a possibility and that is a discharged petition get ready the is i think democrats actuonable pobly try to pracy this a discharge pit petition would require about two hundred eighteen members of the house majority to force consideration of a piece of legislation on the floor assentially you get a pece paper everybody sinds it yet two hundred democrats and tak twenty republicans inthe house to sign the fe's paper and then it moves forward through this arduous process and he majority effectivally loses control of the floor unlikely it moves forward that way because again i do not think democrats actoun want this thing passd i thnk democrts would prefer to use it as something to run on tdemocrats are accusing republicans of that with regard to an emigration bill there is i thnk a grain of of some truth to that i think it' tell sor true for democrats iv think democrats right now would prefer to see re publicans kill thes thing in the house s they can then run on the idea that americans are week unnational security which is why it behoves republicans to be clear about what they want and what they do not want and right now you have a fractured narrative from republicans over the foreignade are they doing it because it' actuay do not mind putting running over you crane are they doing it because they do not want is rael bil to feninsof against comoss or are they shing were spending to much money and theyre spending haks a tomas massey or a ran paul or are they saying that they want a grant for anay that you do not want al the crapin bill theye been totally un clear about which of these pass their choosing that is a lowing democrats to spin this thing aor can meanwhile speaking of republicans not handling politics compatently we mentioned yesterday that donald trump would to see lara trump become cochair of the arancey and as i mentioned yesterday i do not really know lar trump it alglti've never met her i doft believe in of anything gens lar trump i'm not a big fan of dinastic politics i just think it is wrong an bad i do not it when its clenton i dn't one is bush and i do not it whon its trump either i particularly do not it when entire republican apparatusis are mobilized in favor of one man at the expense of conservative victory across the country the aransee is not just supposed to be about the presidential race that is why the president has done super packs sy the president has own campagn funrasing apparatus the arnse is supposed to be about congressional races it is congress matters and senate races because the senate matters bel lara trump she is out there yif if's therepublican party is basically just pledge pet pledge fealty an allegiance to donald trump that is not a party any more it is not and it is certainly ot a vehicle for victory because donal trmp is not popular enough to do that democrat's by whd tried the same thing with brokabama and it failed parties do not succeed when they are not coalitional parties must be colitional they must include people whar lukuarmon trump or even cold on trump but we will vote with trump eighty five to ninety per cent of the time taking all of your campaign resources and directing them toward a presidential and forgetting about the legislative body we are all legislation commences that is a mistake but tha's what tlar r trump was saying shoose literally out ther yesterday as the possible co chair of the aransee suggesting that every time raised by the arans she should go into the pesidential race which is wild that is not how the hurancee is supposed to workin by the way it is does work that way republican to get their assiskicked up and down the ballat here is what i can tell you the aran see needs to be the leanest most letal pollitical fighting machine we have ever seen an american history that is the goal over the next nine an a half month if i am elected to this position i can assure you the're will not be any wore seventy thousand dollars or whatever exorbitan a not o money it was spent on flowers every single penny well go to the number one and the only job of the aran seete that is electing donald jay trump as president of the united states and saving this country gay i'm that is not what the aransy is for the arnse is not just for getting trump elat thed president it is about other candidates as well and the problem with this mentality is that what it means having seen how donald trump responded to the loss of massy pillop in the new york three race if it turns into the only people that donald trump indorses are the people the aransea backs and the only people who pledge total fealty to donald trump are the people that the aransey backs that is not irrecipe for success again bhat i would to see just politically twenty twenty five january twenty twenty five i want see down trump its president with a solid house majority and a republican and republican majority in sented as well that is my top priority i just politically speaking i want to see republican unified electoral command of the legislative branches of government as well as the executir branch or government anything that is an obstacle to that up to an including declarations of fealty directly to downl trump is stupid if the areinsee is gon a run itself this way this is not the way to win as proof of this proposition i have twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty one twenty twenty two and now twenty twenty three i'm not your homming morelections we have to run in order to understand that donel trump is not in fact and should not be the center of every congressional race every centate race that is not a good strategy for victory in an incredibly tiverse country with a lot of congressionals distracts and senenseeds that that do not share all the same priorities i'll get ab your mits if i do not comment on a clip that has been making the rounds to day it is a clip a a tucker carleson i'm not sure when this is from a russell brand start ef putting this out as i russell i've had russell on the show mulbletons have many conversations ith russll an anycase a tucker i once again went after me rather personalway here here here he was we have a right to be mad at least an limits agains speak for americans middle aged americans a which is what i am i've got fordraftae children if you are playing recklessly fast and loose with their lives that i have a right to despise you and i do if you are nicky hales twenting for presiner benship peero or half the people i see on tellivision casually mentioning the possibility of newclear war or sending americans to fight in the middle least or in any way involving us in a war that has nothing to do with prosperity and peace at home nothing nother ws to do with us americans then i have a right to call you out and be really a fennicas it is my family they live here it is not a joke to me its knows nothing abstract about it and that is the difference between what is happening in the mddleast from what is happening in eu crane by which i had very strong feelings but i din't hnk there was a realistic possibility that my kids could be emashedin it now there is and the only people who claim uts devisive to pull people's attention back to their own families their own communities or the people profiting from your attention being five thousand miles away that is just true and and its true because they do not even debate you they name call your pro terr your whatever o shut up let us be clear about this one tucker is just lying about my positions here i've never called for bouts on the ground n you cranulisten to the shol that is the case i've never falld called for american boots on the ground in israel by the way do i thing it is good for america that he are bunch of pro comas people running around tearing down posters of kidnap people including americans now i do not thn that is very good for america and i actually do see a fairly significant problem in the west if you do have hundreds of thousands o pe ople marching in support of a terrorist group that seems a fairly prol america position to me but tucker has been spending months mis characterizing my positions lying about my positions as from lessing with a show i've offered many times to sit down with tucker he has said he is willing his team has said that he is busy for months because of form travel that offer remains open already folks the rest of the show continues right now will be joined by anthony reuben he is the founder of muck

well yesterday was a very important day in the twenty twenty for rays jobidon is still really ailing a corting to the washington post jobidon is currently holding private meetings the white house to reassure his supporters because his poll numbers look bad says the washington post while present in bidon has been holding private lunch is at the white house of topdoners another supporters as part of an efforts reassure them about his reelection campaign including concerns about his age and his energy according to three people familiar with those meetings he is held a half dozen meetings in groups ranging from forto eight people since he launch his campaign in april but a bunch happened right before the holidays that a lot of people ore very much worried about jobidon's reelect efforts a lot of hes meetings are being organized by jeffrey catsenburg movi mogel again holly wood and the democratic party one and the same the meetings of course are coming because a lot of people are worried that jobidon is going to lose that includes barakobama that includes michell obama and whose pretty much every one and things are going poorly when even jimmy kimmel is mocking you there was a hands off piles whoth regardedborakobama in the comidy world for literally years you could not make jokes about borakobama because he was the holy one bless be he but when it comes to actually jobidon even democrats are looking at jobidon in realizing this is a a man with encroaching seninelity problems a person notting control of is own administration when jimmy kimmel's making fun of you in a reelector that is a problem if you are democrat wher was jimmi kimell doing just that last night are not just that fully imisen for jo bid is not desperate mean of support fror me ol voters and grappotice as tout pull it out all the bells of whistles to try to win the back i marers wors ferson on clecton coyim history t iwr e o hoslsli yo a ma ese ou s hen i t ci me an iv noi you with the holig just i this cannect between bidon and his own people is extraordinary right now and democrats kno this which is why again even in the fake at it is all about trump and will christ matthews back from exile you's to been hard by them it them y say we back on hem as hem my say the niht can year rell that a beu rumpum when hen he come to thever they sho sexplaining why dow do not trump campy prise an ye iyes tates go thin cin tave gu democrat this baebris mathe gow wont i think it is throug impoint that then the the conservatives out there when you defend tonall trump you are defending what happened on january six you'r dus tending why he sat there in that little office next to his ol office he sat there an doing nothing according to tas to o utis an the rest at are all talking now hand there more got a talk in courd here is the guy who did nothing it is all january sixt it is all trump the entire democratic campaign relies on trump and we have the sort of weird situation in which if the democrats swapped out jobidon for any one else thy would be in much better shape meanwhile if the republicans by pulling dit a swaped out donal trump for any one else they too would be in much better pulling shape that is the weird irony of the situation in which we find ourselves both parties are fully convinced that there is no way thy can loose to that ky democrats there is no way we can loose to donald trump let us run the old guy after all he is an on contraverse sholl he is not can rip open all of the inter sectional gaps in our party and meanwhile republicanselect there is nobodye can loose to that geyes we may as well have the guy who makes us feel really good in donald trump on the right side of the isle the big question is is there any one who is ready to replace donald trump on the ticket now by pulling data the ampsire is clearly now mif you look at the national pulling data in the national primaries r at nowich again those are not tis positive and one point re julioni with the big club house leader in two thousand eight fairly close to the ational primaries but we are now less than one week away from the iwa paucases and in the national pulling average donald trump has a fifty point lead on the rest of the field in iwa the pulling suggests the trump also has a massive lead every single pole has trump up by at least thirty points in iwa that is a very very large gap new hampshire a little but different new hampshre youre starting to see trump loose somomentum in new hampshire he still has a lead but that lead he is not much more than the commine force of a nickey hayley and chris christy nickey hayley is running ai somewhat close second as a somewhat close because most polles have her somewhere between ten and twenty points behind trump in new hampshire but all those pulls also have chris christy in the race and chris christy is drawing a consistent twelve per cent in the new hampshire pulling she could certainly see a situation in which donald trump win's iwa saint nickey hayley comes in second in iwa she gets a boose going into new hampshire she wins new hampshire and now basely the race comes down to south carolina in order for that to happen though chris christyyou would have to drop out ofthe race will last night chris christy did drop out of the race he is suspended his campaign he announced you suspending his campaign which again credit to cris christy how is under the sumption he would not because there is no bigger egomaniac in american politics then chris christy who continues to run for president spite the fact he is not been popular for full decade but here is chris christy last night dropping out of the race suspending his campaign we were not campaigns to win my goll has never been to be just o toaife e gets the had and the devision and the selflissness of whete our party has become on the gonald trump sos o been the win the nomination and te feet you pon and restore our party in our country through a new place o hope an op them is tim in this country i've always then that there came a poin con in this trace were i could not se a pat to a complishing that ol t i would get out in its queer to me to night i cour esy go pat for me towing anomanati which is why i'm suspending my campaign to night for prisiny an night of thite i'll gate that is the right moot because that allows the field o consoliatin now hampter now what would have allowed it is consolidate more new hampster obviously his if christy a done what everybody expected in just in dors nickey haley but cristy's still to much o an egomaniac for that he got caught on a hot ik at the same vent ripping the only other people could stoppe donal trumps he says thet his top priority is stopping donald trump does chris cristy and then he get's caught on a hop mike ripping the only other two people in the race with any credible shot of stopping donal trump yeits is a yat im min gon to shepen sixty million or for to entyda it sifty lion o far fifty nine million bi te santis an we scec twelve e whos cunching abot ther way and who is cun an return on their in vestment at's shetin gat smokes and youa bot nowit ses o tothis i gat that of course led donald trump to go on line and talk about how much he actually likes christ cristy quot i hear cris christy is dropping out of the ract today i might even get to leg him again anyway her's just caught in a hot might making a very trithlesstatement she is ging get smut youn abut now it she is not up to that s of course trump immediately jumping on the person to whom most of christ christys support is presumably going to go but the field is in fact consolidating in that led tor debate last night between te santis and nickey hailey we get's more on that just one second first if you are looking to save money this year but you actually do not want a sacrifice you not quality of life pure talk has your back instead of paying your currint self on providers sixty seventy eighty bucks a line pure talk has a limited plans starting it just twenty buck a month oe'll get that same phenominal coverag you are used to on america's most dependable five u not work for just twenty bucks a month that is how the average family saves almost one thousand dollars a year switch on over to a wireless company the chairs your values a company that is vetter an own that sures veterans that is not afraid to invest an shows this one what he waiting for switch to pure talk in is little as ten minutes and start saving it to day the're youust customer servicstem is waiting to serve you i' been using purtock myself for years at this point the coverage is excellent in again they are company that actually likes me in my values go to pure talk dot com slash appurel right now you will save an additional fifty per cents off your very first month of coverage that is pure talk dot com slash afpuro get connected right now again pure talk dot com slash a puro start off the year saving on wireless with a company you can be proud of because the actua it go chk com out right now at pure talk dot com slash apuro now goin the dynamic o the race are very weird because nickey hayley actually needs to santus to stay in the race that is what' strange about thes dynamic is this wild theory that somehow if the field consolidates stown to nickey haley forsodonald trump that makes nickey haly m ore competitive that is actually not right because that is a suming that te santisis support flows to nickey haley rather than to trump that is incorrect the large majority of rondissantis support will flow to donald trump because they think that trump is harder knows than nickey haley they see nicky hayley as fairly squishy now probe with the big debate last night between to santis and haley is of course they are nocking each other there theire bumper carring each other te santis does need haley to drop out but haley does not need to santis drabashens the santis to stay in and meanwhile it is servo lobsterpot over there a crabpot that there' s sort of pulling each other down ins the pot and that is what happened in theto bate last night to santis did actualley levy some attacks against donal trump haley really did not most of her tactor agains te santis which gain his strategically weird because if haley's entire upheal is that she is more politic more polished and all of the rest then i'm not sure whi knocking to sans can get her anywhere and again if the santis were to drop out say after iwa that actually hurts nickey haley pretty badley she needs him there to sok up ten twelve fifteen perscent ofthe boat in vari estates going forward here is rondissantis going after donald trump over the constitution again let just be clear about this if the primer's were eltedto advote fronisantis i'd ove for him he is the bst floorta govrnor he is the best governor in america he is the most consistently conservative person in the race he is an incredibly competent executive he knows how o actually run the leavers of power and make sure things happen not just bloviet i'd vote for him in a primary he is way behind and is nickey haley they are both way behind they were busy mashing each other on seeanend donald trumples over on foxtons of bredbar sipping a diet coat and enjoying his life and mi hear is rondissantis going after trump over the constitution if interesting the oath does not say that you are gin a defend the shores of the united states a or orgateing and no ta conplict the oath simply says that you will supportan defend the constitution of the united states as present nited states you will preserve per tactin defend the constitution of the united states you cannot just terminate the constitution i mean i know he does ou kno word f omet from time to time on sosomedia but obviously i will uphold the consiu that of course is exactly true and then to santis turned to haley and he points it ot to big wrap on haley which is the chis chu squishy on a lot of issues and the loter publicans who feel the nickey haley is to squishy on a lot of issues that she sort blows with the wind on a variety of issues for example he says i did not see you out the're fighting the school lockdowns now to be somewhat fair to nickey haley nickey haley was not in a position of political power in twenty twenty she would already left the trump administration she was yuan ambassador under trumps sould have had a lot to say about that anyway with that said he is right that the person who led the battle to reopen schools was him you no a governor haley mention i think correctly the devastating men'll healt consequencis for the school closurs a lot of things that happen derin covit i never recall seeing her out there ighting the fight i was on the front lines on that h again cappins to be regd about this he also pointsed out that nickehaley still has not ruled out running his donald trums v p if you are elly running for president than why yo running for v p is the case that disantis was making to the anchors she will not answer the question about whether she would except the v p not ah if she would gives all these the ameli mouths respos what is wrong wit just say no i would not under any circumstances say that andi think the fact that she has not done that it is part of the reason criss hav been staying in and i think that is part of the reason i think she is have this choice wor you di isshe would agree toa re cliss fresher i do and i dont i do because i think why would you not just say i would not i've set i would not why not just say that she will not give a yesor no answer o that because if she says yes she loosees support from the people but tho trot ah if she says no than that is for closes is petenally her ability and o be hudice ll get's a more on that in just one second first you now i've been talking about my helics mattress for years i've had that helics mattress and almost a decade at this point basc leads the only thing tat keeps me alive cause i need my sleep and helics makes me sleep it is that simple helicks is the gift that keeps on giving every night when i climb into bed i'm

free pillows for her listeners right now start the you are offright checked him out at helick sleeps ot tom slash ben with elicks better sleep starts right now a meanwhile tickey haley was going after dissantis but now really on a good basis she kept saying over and over the people shul visit to santis lies dot com is very annoying she said it may be a dozen times in the first hour of the debate to the point where it just became a meam many of her tacks were either sort of bad spirited or just false number one bad spirited if she acuses to santis of spending owfa lot of money on the campaign and not doing very well mean that is true also it is sort of relevant what what what is that af to do with anything at if he as been a lot o money on the campaign and he had been doing amazing in the bolls would she not be attacking him it is a strange line of attack er do not go an lie ton the american people to make them think we cannot do this you turn about and ray a dat lannit you are in the one that is talked about look at what se din defornim but think abot the f that he is tolk o were's this money gan ta come from he the best way to tell about a candidate is to see how they bron i their campaign he has blown through a hundred and fifty million dollars i know how caun do that through his canpan has nothing to show for it he is spent more money on private plans than he has on commercial trying to get islands to vote for hin if heo cant mane to canpain how he can a man to contrin get that that that isnat incredibly stupid argument mscan put that out that to dumb argument down trumpet randmus lack lest or ridiculous campanions tweny sixteen an than he on we truth truly he spent almost to money he did almost know on the ground work and then he on that is really not correct also disantis has been an awful lot of time on the ground in iwa more than nickee haily has for example hailey then bastersantistover israel gand this is this y just a wrong attack an that the notion that rondisantisat anyway week on israel is an absurdity to santo seis by far the most pro israel governor in america by far it is not clothes but here is haily going after him on this but it is really rich that ronas can act he seddena cares for israel when he brought the person to island that is the most anti israel republican in the state the person that wet and voted against israels right to existin commess the person that voted with the squad against anti senmatism on college cannot than your go and you brought that person goiner to i wa to go an can canpain wi go o thats or frango i asan ts ou a raherin cingesmen ton massi from conainthat is a cheep cheep garbis but here is the thing when when that whon ther wen o g te o o hunde e e f ye e beel for floridto we hav one of the largest is railly mar american populationce in the country and we have been a a havin for worth of ocx jues in particular since i've been governor and what bitin was not helping americans get out of the wars own these are people that were stranded i did not executive order we scrambled plans and we rescued over seven hundred americans from israel and brought him back safely to the state of florida you got a step up an you got a lead when things this are happening yen that that is a wind for dis antis now does any one really win coming out of this particular thay the answers no trumplis an tom stage trumplas busily over on fox news he answering questions from bet bear and what is it what is been clear here is that trump is actually piviting to the general election at this point trump is no longer fighting in the primarythat does not mean that he can stop himself from getting snippy with the other candidates a he just tells lies about to santis he does he he tells lies about his opponents one a regular basis that that is something the donnls from does and to be frank that is part of the charm that a lot of trump supports feel about trump because there is cynicl about politics trum supporters for a lot of good reasons that they believe that long as the person they are backing is willing you throw everything up to an including rubber hammers kitchen stings chain saws alligators at napone does matter if it is justified or unjustified they want the person who is simply unpredictable willing to do anything and that is the sean trump the rest of the field is welt that at ack is untrue and truth is a standard but a lot of trumps words truth is not the standard winning is the standard and if winning takes bing mean and saying things thare not true well i guess that dim happy the trump is doing that sort of stuff that is the actual logic that applies as part of this campaign for example don o trump yesterday suggested that rondissants is shut down the sat oflorida this of course is notrue o gay the su just to joe everyone knows that rondosansis after the very early weeks of the pandamac worked extremely hard to open up the state of florida meanwhile he and brying camp and many other govrnors were being chided by donal trump was then president of the united states for reopening too soon trumpet is rewriting history here it is not true and it is morally bad to li o cade is morally badso lie but is that canot hurd him politically in anyway has not far i own't a small bittit and timeis miny would you ever allow a shut down in the future shut down in terms of covid or shut down in terms of buged cause their talking about a but your shut down right now but your tuckit about a cove shut a cract noi wouldn and i never did i let the governors make their decisions and some of em from sot carolina you no henry ric master and frankly a not the coda a few of hem tennes se they did not shut down at all flarter ti shut down run to sank tis shut down or as he is known run the sanctimonious he he shut a state down very violently actually and shut the highways down the rods ta but we had d i'm a federalists to the sense because thi's the federalless way no i did not actually have a shut down despite the fact that some people wanted to and some people did not want to but we had some great governors an the governors at did the best shup were republican governors and they were the ones that did not shut down e by the way ho 's ripping many of those republican governors at the time it sort of side swipes at the sansis obviously poorly modivated he still thinks the t e sansis could do him some damage in iwa but is he deeply worried about either to sansis or haly at this point i mean by the polling numbers the answer is is no gets more on this in just one second first he struggling with back taxes you have unfiled returns this year the iras is now escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agens in these challenging times your best defence use tax network ou ussay with over fourteen years of experience tax network you essay and save their clines wover a billion dollars in back taxes they specialize in negotiating with the iras they are not produceyur debts significantly tax network you ussa does not just negotiate they protect your assets from ira seizures they manageyour yearly returns for on going compliance importantly they are license to help you with all state taxissues regardless of where you live in the united states seese control of your financial future nout do not let those tax issues overpower you that can wun your life instad fix it contack tax network you us say for immediate relief an expert guidance call one eight hundred two four five six thousand or visit t and ou ssay dot comslash appero turn to tax network you ussay find your path to financ hl piece of min gat the iras off your back fix that tack probem right now thats t and you say dok com slash apperel or one eight hundred two for or five six thousand o kat he is on with with brabarr last night and again donal trump has shifted to the general leckon he is aredy talking general lections ock he was confascinating to washem work because again this campaign is very likely at this point statistically speaking to come down to donals trump verses jobidon donal trump was asked by brabar about political violence donal trumped suggested that if for example he ends up being jailed after being prosecuted that that will lead to political vat tu to bedlam is the word that he use raberrt asks him about that and trump cleans it up can you say to night that political violence is never except im well of course that is right and of course i'm the one that had very little of it take a look at wars again i did not start i was an involved in wars we beat the hell out of icis we wone a hundred per cent we brought our troops back home look at look at the violence that we have had look at the violence we have recently rether wone you said bedlam what do you mean y thi yo bedlam i think you look at jo bidnence bedlam you have a man who cannot lead you have a man who cannot find his way off i stage after he makes a speech at last for about two minuts now i think bedlam is jo bydn i think that he is using thit this is jist a political ploy trump is a dictator he wants to be a dictator ga again trump doing clean up for the general and honestly not been answer meanwhile trump was also asked about being a dictator and done he had not answer for that one do hes as tht this asilly i did to show shown handed dy did you have here fom is ver nice men and he said essentially you not gon to be a dictator are you tobby i think you was trying to give me a nister question that maybe you gas but he meant tot very well i said i'm going to be a dictator for one day we are going to do what two things the boarder we gat a make it tight you cannot get in unless you come man legally and the otheris energy were ing to drill baby drill after that of nocging to be a dictgat what he is saying there he using the dictator language and he slipping te diccana language and to imin odo some executive orders which by the way is not being a dictator and of cours the medya ran with that jobidin rammida do most people think the tonnal trump is going to be a lary ina musolini eskdictator in the united states very hard to see how that line pleas for jobidon jom donaltrum was also asked about these stories the is late breaking stories than put out by the left woing prass about how a lot of forndignitary state at trump hotels and they were considering this aform of of indirect bribery here was trumpanswering that question documents that say that nearly eight million dollars an payments to your business is from foreign governments china included sorty rabia while you were in office they say artical one of the constitution as you cannot except money from foreign governments while president would you pledge to d t vast from your busines in the second terms of the presents a dont tht's whi er that is withut a reporter i own hotels all over th bu i do not get free money somebody rents a hotel room at such at such a much money i gave back in fact i did't have to do e enter george washington was a very rich man people do not know that in his essentially white house which was in built but they had an office he had a business ask any had a country desk brut next to each other you are allowed to do that i did not do it i put everything in trust and if i have a hotel and somebody comes in from chin that is a small amount of money in a sounds a lot of money that is a small but i was doing services for that people were staying in these massive hotels he is beautifulotels cause ihave the best hotels i have the best clubs i have the best clubs at the i have great stuff and they stay there and they pay i do not get aht million dollars for doing nothing hunter i do not get i do not get five hundred thousand thollars i do not get five hundred thousand thouse for doing a painting it is not a bad idea i guess can get away with it and this is where bidnings can be vulnerable he is going be vulnerable if all these attacks on trump i do not think that they are going to hunt meanwhile in terms of the actual policy trump as i say he is pivited toward the general on abortion he understands that the abortion issue has not been a winner for republicans on the feneral level the abortion issue imen lis not i'm ast pro life as he gots the reality is that by polling data the american people broad rid and again it is a state bi state issue now thanks yo the overturning of roverss way which correct and good in certain states state of floriguing a harpy buill in certain states new york and yet abortion until you are eighty three years oll that is just the way that it is going to work in the united states under roverseis waighed to my great consternation i whish ot ware not the case i think that every life deserves protection trump is he asked about this he understands innately that if he says anything that it is tro pro life it is can be used against him in a presidential election and because you popularwit the republican basing understands can get away with saying things they are not fully pro life a primary is usually where you'r able to push the candidate to the right trump because he is far out in front has the ability cannot be pushed to the right on issues where he does not want to be pushed to the right against my consternation as a prolifer but that is the politics o the situation here is trumplaying this politics i for you to reassure me that you can protact all life every person sriht to life without compromise hat's the great question i appreciated to you would not be asking that question even talkin about the issue because for fifty four years they were trying to get rovy way terminated and i did it and am proud to have done it they wante to get at tack rat yu would not be haf that there would be not question nobody else was getting at that any but and we did it and we did something that was a miricle when i walked on to the stage to day a gentlemen in the back probably works for fox nice guy sid si to thank you at sat for what he said you saved two million lives in the lest three years you save two million lives and i suid thank you very much i knew exactly what he meant two million lives and nobody's done morein that regard the me know i happend to be a for the exceptions alike ronald dreggon with the life of the mother agrape incest i have i just have to be there ai feel i think probably seventy eight per cent of pal about seventy eight per cent whose ronal reggon he was for it i was for it a many turn in he swivled an he hit te sancis for being two proo life again this is trum positionin himself for the general trying toke the abortion issue off the table not my cup of tea it is not stupid politics that is true also again ye the the good thing that trump has going for him in having consolidated much of he republican base at this point is the fact that politically speaking he can already moderate early onhy can moderate and jobidon is abandoning the moderats in his own party gobidn has swiveled all the ways was left and he is opening up this giant space in the center of american politics for trump to simply walk in to which is kind of amazing that is par ticularly true on the emigration issue again trumps record on emigration is much better than gobidon bekas jobidn has the worst record on a legalemigration in american history the mean trump's record is perfect it is certainly is not the first couple years of his administration for example donal trump did not actually have remain in mexico policy for example the first couple years of his administration he had not given ice y ability to do serious levels of deportation he is not pledging there will be maskyportations again do i think that to actualy going to happen under donald trump i have serious doubts but that is the pledge's making ah what is your question for the pormpes yit som that you can take care of the porter in twenty four hours after taking office how we you cather the several millions that have already entered our country inlegally and return then to their country of oriton rit question it is not sustainable for our country we have millions and millions of people here it is not sustainable did you see in new york city with it getting the regular students out and ther putting migrants in their place weare going to have the largest deep portation effr in the history of our country wire bringing everybody back tho wet they can' trum we have ne ga do i thing 's ashuly going to do that probably not but it is definitely a good talking point against jobine by the way how many legal emigrants are actually in the united states right now according to yale and ami teaters o study from yell an a mi tea back in twenty eighteen itis well before ane thats is now twenty twenty four then they said there ware twenty two milliony legal emigrans in the united states if there is wenty to million in twenty eighteen over the subsequent sixty years you would imagine that you are talking another five stix seven million elegalemigrans you are talki mout clos of thirty million elegal imigrants in the country at this point an all that is a weakness of jobines thei're lott of drags on gobidon one of the drags on gobidan is again tht when it comes to many of the personal qualities that jobidnis attacking in donal trump he holds many of th the same personal quolities from the over use of executive orers to his accusations the donal trum is corrupt but the reality is the lot o people in the united states perceive jobidenis crot becaue the bidin family has used jobiden's name to traffic for literally thirty years induryng money yesterday that will broke into the open now again i think what is going on in congress right now i think congress is a clown shoe i think our legislative branch has become an absolute clown show that gess almost nothing done what the do get done is generally bad there bunch of reasons for that ts an excellent book out called wy congress and that that book sort of explains the transition of congress from a place where deals got done behind close dors to place where no deals got done at all and instead what you end up with is a lot of costering that postering broke out yesterday on the hill i know their a lot of re publicans here very excited about people yelling an hunter by nan other lot of democrats ware very excited about hunter by an showing up on capitalal can' just point out that weof a country that has serious crises to face and this is all a waste of time and garbage not the focus in on hunter bidon and his relationship with joe but all these can of fire works whre people then send off fund rasing yemals let us just acnowledge that our legislative branch is filled with people who do not want to legislate have no interest in getting anything done and are there to eventuall get a podcast or some sort of cable new sho that is what is happening on capital hill right now their serious things that should be happening say negotiation over the budget for this year but no esaying attention then said ther paing attention to the stupidity of hunterbiden showing up on capital hill as the house jope he was voting for contempt at charges to yesterday to house committees ac cording to th your times voted along party lines to hold hunter biden in contempt of congress because he refuse to testify behind closed doors there is a twenty three to fourteen vote by the judiciary commtteen is twenty five to twenty one vote by the overside committee hunder bidon showed up there to make the point that he wanted to testify in open committee not behind closed doors and i her's what ok when hunter decided to show up unannounced i mea nowas it was one most shocking things since he was snorting cok off o hookers asked we the hunter biten aphering at the capital slalking through the door o his therter wit the thecret servicetin there another members of his otorage bat he is officially at the capital thes cerrings et under way we are looking at live in itis ri now a thi gos through at aphers the the medical the metal thetectoor ner bi the metal thetectors and ane prison wobly expect him ho in tur at these one of these committee roms be has the gad this that before the overslike committe altho action happening in that tudiciary committee where just go to follow these cameras that hunter bided and he where heis going to head what is going to happen a agan he was not expected toe sho ot before these carrings from the fact of he was not called by the pople ho hes en two stories here one is is this good for jobiden one is is this good for jobiden the answers no any time or time at hu der it is bad for joe that is just the reality and then there is question number to what is any of this mean and what really means that congress is a complete side show at this point again serious things are happening in the country in just one second iwn't get to how much of a sidecho congress is they are a waste of space they are a waste of time that is not n excuse for executive orders by the way that is to say that congres to be clawing back its own authority from the executive bransh and you non be doing things from time to time but they are not focast on the things the matter and stead the are focass on the camera time whet's more on that in second first the daily wire is on the lookout for a dynamic individual to join our team as a talent and bran development executive as the driving force behind

slash careers to day o can meanwhile an hunterbiden shows up on the hill the goal of him showing up on the hill is yo try to demon straiht that republicans will not allow him to testify openly they will not to testify behind closed doors originally the comitteehad said he could pick to testify behime close doors or openly and then thy said we want him to do both who ont testify behind closed doors in order to testify openly now realistically you really want people testify behind closed doors because otherwise youwent up with th grand standing we got the worst to both worlds no testimony and gran standing yesterday we got from both sides of the isle nancy mays who when she is not wearing a scarlet a for some odd reason to congress s a grand standing on other topics she is one of people who voted cap mc carththye out that we culd have my johnson i my johnson but he is about to pass a budget bill that' significantly worst than anything thet mc carthy was can pass last year nancy maces spend her time ripping a hunter biden yesterday and this the kind of stuff that get sent out and find raising he mells an achieves absolutely nothing a a first all my first question is tho bribed hunter bit in to be here to day that is my first question asecond question you are the apito me o white trivlets coming into the overside committes pitting in our face ignoring a congrassonal sepinout to be depose what are you afraid of you have no bals to come up here an mister chairman port of inkuery mister chairman i think that that hunter bie is to be arassted right here right now go straight to jail our nation is founded on the rule come on come ron reas com at o plies equalle to everyone wo matter what is your laint of order mister charman and first of all re publicans should stop accusing people of being beneficiaryis white privileges just ha general rule because the real privilege that hunter by nhans is not that he is white the said he is jo biden sun i'lyouent up doing when you say the wie privilege stuff is opening the door to dolts ao see gain the manogran staninshistanc and here is ao s now granstanding on the way privilege oine here wego quickly that that moments about a privilege ands and all of this that were seeing here ithey it was very beautiful speech a by the gentl lady im who as she mention was a help lead on the majority the nomajority side o civil rights ance of libertys some commitee but i think it exemplary of the points not she also oversaw the elimination of the civil rights sub committee on this committee which really kind of gives the whole game away we show up we give speeches we give flowery words but at the end of the day participate in the structural erosion of the rights and representation of people thatthat our marginalized women people of color people that just need to see their due process and ofhe liberties protected in this country o congress oh congress how is it possible the congress gets worse with each in every passing here then hunder by in storm down ofthe room as em t g mrcr calegreene was yelling out im this all reat far public by the way that is all just wonderful and i'm glad that we can do all this on cameraand everybody can get the minute of facetime it is just it is great thank you mister chairman i sa cas me hunter i'm apparlyar frait of my woread o ti we di we we met i ti mister chairman sthat yonder re musit ah thit is too ba d i think it is clear and obvious for everyone watching this here and to day that hunter bied and is terrified of stro conservative republicand women because he cannot even o my words as i was about to speak to him what a coward it is all cfabe i's all cfabe all congress is of this point ois a waste of space in cfabe it is unbelievable and again i'm not ridting on mart r caler in particularly or nance he makes particularly it is the democrats to it to everyone it is every one what do you gets do for living i'm s wondering but it' some point would you do something useful i know that you let us say things in to camera and that is wonderful i mean i do it for living by you are nots most to wid for liv in you are nelected official on the public time at a certain point maybe you could actually go pastom legislation or hold some one actually accountable maybe you could do that meanwhile on the left side of the isley got people ak yourd moscoet's doing the same thing i jorn moscuits combated the hunter biden tobacel by holding up a photo of donald trump and jeffrey epstine this is where we are guise this is our congress are not you proud we gentlelea from georgia a i know it is such an advocate for women's rights is she mention and it is concerned about grooming and apparently we we do not how many standards here any more again mind remind my colleagues because i do not want them to forget about hypocrisy oka i doon t jeabout is a clown show it is a picture is hunging ot of jackapsyon jon trapsti and when he was asked he said you non jeffrey likes im young how did the president know that how did he know that jeffrey apste likes im young perhan there is a sumption to to lean i lacking in the background was there she thinks about the joys if commoser is you t every one in everunning congreston cloun ever ah ie said the were clown many times that its basely turned into a circus here but now remotely the circus the congress actually is now again all this demonstrates that we have an irresponsible politiclass a deeply responsible political cl class and a broken congressional system and again it is largely broken because the pollerisation the parties makes its to no conversation actualy takes place between the parties the end of politics heis to eventually get out of politics an thing g'll make money elsewhere many members of congress are geting rhich after they leave congress something needs to be done about the political system of the legislature because it is full scale full stop at his asterarea that is take away nuober one take way nember to his hunter bidens really baftrjobiden her comes to the twenty twenty four race hunter is a nightmare for jobine mecas the more were togamout hunter we have not mention for quite a while here is owns from's presidential campaign hunter went out to the press afterward and the press asked him why was it that your father was being called in th midle of your business meetings and here is his really bad answer its ifidi wit a a coo ii car a io o ie that t i call you t co a it tca i a i also the call went the other way was from a hunder bitin to his dad at i do not do during business meatings generally call my father an about you you middle a big mol tie million dollar business meaning you just pillet you not letme it my dad on the phone for no reason just to say high in's yelther weather is a thing you do regularly meanwhile the democrats our forece to ifind hunter in order to defend joe james clyburn who of course s a big bidin backer in twenty twenty he is now saying that hunter showing up to congress shows just what a great father joe is this is really the angle that oing to take it is not going t be osumgize one would you ave advise hunter bie to appearit to days hering how beg of a distracts on hliability is the to the presents reelection ber wha tiis of thi stract o wiothings about the or tit i think of all this is going to temistrat wat the he good father to bi an bs we all mivin a bol it i hav to an ot te sert about thee an at wou to be a good fater to there an a not o ti tin th office a hol benin the way of be a good father gay if that is the final democratic pitch on hunter bidin that is not in a play that is not in a play one of the things by the way that has made our presidential elections important is the fact thet congress is a bleap shoe if congrs were not a leap show most apolse you begetting done in congress and the president would be there wit the vetopen and that is how the process was originally supposed to work that is ot the waythe that is not the anythng works any more because congress is basically devolved in to in absolute goat rodio it it is it is ridiculous whell meanwhile the re publicans in another i think semi useless act they are trying to impeach he secretary of homlansicarity now that is fine you get rid of him men now a hunter maorcus is a disgrace to his job there is no question about that and he has completely under scored the failure of by dministration to actually abide by the law getting one of myorcus is not actulg n a solve the problem if to get rid of jobidon in order to solve the problem you knon't may be helpful here is a useful congress a useful congress that passas una border legislation that might be the think now cant blen the house for thus republican's the house have in fact passed aghe ar too which is quite a good bill it is republicans in the senate who h've been a little more wish you washy on that particular issue suffice it to say one of the thngs that happen because the hunter by n hearing is that the meorcastufe got blown off the front pages if one of the purposes of hearings is to papublic focus on an issue you actually do want the public folcis more on meorcus in te border than you do on nanty maze an empt g and ao c and jared mosco it is grand standing about hunter bidon frank lafthing it may be one of the reasons why hnter bydan showed up yesterday is because politically speaking if four a democrat you would actually rather have people talking about hunter bidon than talking about the disaster area at the border an according to representive mark green the g chust chief mayorcus has imported five million ilegal imigrants into the united states by the way thing that is an undresmate i think it is actually higher than that at this point bus it seems by the stats that we saw yesterday just in the last year alone in in twenty twenty three three million elegalimigrants entered the country at a minimum it is probably higher than even that representative mark green of tennessy he points out this is an intentional crisis being driven by the by dministration he is correct about this all of these excuses at long predated secretary meorcasist inur and yet we have never experience to crisis this as even the new york times admits and i quote push factors do not explain the entire surge and may be not even most of it there've been no recent wards in lan america in the regents poverty rate has been flat in he new york times i'll also note that ta two of the sixteen cityes in the world with the highest murderates ar right here in the united states now this crisis has been intentional secretary meorcas was made a ware of testimony given by president bidons attorny general meric garlin were the ag admitted the current policies are being exploited by the cartells yets secretary maorcus turns around and implements additional policies to expand the caction release measures in powering the cartells an killing americans and he is totally righde about all this meawhile democrat ilike you can carr to mayorcus that is our over all policy ou n a fire him for implementing our of raw policy and he is about half right everyone whos involved in thes soveral policy should be fire here is democratic representative benny thompson trying to make the case the canca ridma orc is just for putting in place jobidans preferred policy the truth is securing the border is that really the republicans tok concern if it was they provide the people with boots on the ground at the border what they need to get the dob done republicans would really explortd a challenging policy issue for ther on precee folitical gan republicans disagree with the bine administrations bor an emograce and policies the are angry that this administration will not take babies from their monds ar put ceits and cages the last administration you can not impute to cain its secretar tecause you do not the presidents policies a mean you you can technically do that now the reality is what she do is actually impeach the president or get rid of the president impeaching the president at this point democratic enent incand happen but the american people do have the ability to get rid o the president in the next general electiont and the should absolutely do that again the emocraticpolicy here is an open ware policy there is no question about that democracts ander cristmerphy of conecticut he he actually said that they do not want to scale back joobdane ability to simply paroll illegal imigrants into the general population i think we are interested is democrats in providing the administration w tools that will help better manage the border we are not interested in taking away from the administration tools at these to day to help better manage the border and when we talk about this topic of porrol it is very important to understand that it is use to day is a way that the administration is able to better manage the flow in a planful way of individuals to the bord you better manage the floamings let everybody in that is the actual bine administration policy but again all this got obscured yesterday becaus of he hunter bantion and agains that is what that is all that happened in reality and meanwhile the controversy continues to swirel around the bide administrations failure to fire thedefen secretary for going completely awall for a week at least defanic representer from new york she says that it is vhat time for loyd ostinso resign of coursshe is correct i monered to survice the house fror publican corenc' chair and most importantly i represent my district every single day and look at the scandal right now with the secretary of the fence i represent thousands of troops from fort drop the ten mounant divisien wore defoited in theleat straight now it is unacseptable that you have e secretary of the fence who is not tarancsparent with the white house i'm looking ford to being active on that issue to delivera countability and transparency and i call for his passicnation yhou want him fire obsolutely it has an impact on first of all adversaries are watching if you look at the natialscurity challenges around the world to day whether the middly ston fire whether you think afout china continuing to be on the rise continuing to watch for american rweakness andthis assert american weakness again this is now becoming by parison issue getting redf loid austin the tophouse arm services democrat represented adamsminth of washington he says biden should think about firing loid austin we know what happen i do not that there is much of it inquirior much digisedone we does not need secretaryaustin ans to the question why didn he think that it was a propriate for him not to tell the president that all of this was going on ol i think weed need need to hear an answer from that i thing the president easen valuy is relationship wit the secretary tefense based on what happened in based on that anser does that mean that you think that he should tititily consider firing him think at out that conversation i do not know tit is at the moment i cannot think of a plasible esplanation e that of course again is a democrat that jobidns his administration is chaos the more focus on that and the less focus on the cas on the other side of the all the better for the republicans meanwhile the bide administration continues to sow chaos in the midle east with its un certainty and unwillingness to actually just sa the thing and the thing his commoss must be destroyed the hothis must be stopped aron is the actural s ponsering power here doest mean ough to go to war directly wither on but certainly the united states in its alles have the capacityto cut the arms off the octopuiss that is the aranian terra nutwork but sadly thou uss an its allies are still trying to figure out exactlye ho to stop the hoothies again this notion that the west has no ability to stop a rag tag the group of pirates in the red sea is totally insane totally crazy and yet that is precisely what the bidn ad ministration continues to push is unclear to them exactly how to stop the hoothies they say i mean i'm confused cannot you just kill a bunch of them ow they they do have these basis that exists right on the cost that they are using in ore to launch ther in flatables and the'r drones at ships could not they actually just kill a bunch of the hothies what explain to me the problem and yet according to the near times the united states an ittalls are waying how to stop attacks on omercial ships in the red sea after american an bridch official said wenesday their navies had intrecepted one of the largest baragas yet of drones and missiles fired from the area controlled by the hoothis and rhanian back roup in yemmon the attacks which the hothes they will go on until is rill ends its campagn against commoss in the gotestrip are threatening meriti'me traffic in on the world's most crucial shipping lanes an tin blinkin said whate i can tell you is as we made clear many other countries maye cleare ther'll be consequences for the hoothy's actions o cawell at some point you might wone actually materialize those consequences otherwise at towns you are a weakling and te shipping cos our piling up according to the wallstre journal western importers are apporting a steep rise in ocean shipping race and weeks along delay is as carriers divert ships from the redsee to avoid whothe rebel attacks some company's shipping goods own the crucial tradelane are starting to chafe at the rising priceis next trafees ocean carriers are imposing for the hiher cos of rooding containerships on longer voyages all the way round the horn of africa average worled by costo ship forty footlong contanes of nearly doubled since late november that is the fault of the binde ad ministration which again continues to send mixed signals in what is the most morally clear conflict in modern history i'm sorry when y when a genicitl terrorscrup crosses the boarder of another country murders twelve hundred of he citizens takes another two andr forty hostages there still a hundred hostages there and then the power it provoked goes in and wrecks them while attempting to maintain civilian life by the way at a rate that the enemy certainly would not not only would they not they are literally hiding in civilionareas this a particularly clear case of the west should be unified in support of israel gettng rid of commass and if there ancilry terro groups that aure threatening israel or threatening shipping which by the way forget about wethng bout israel threatening shipping asha as nimpact on your daily life n my daily life if you cannot stand up aga what exat wa wapoint would you stand up precisely but the wild left continues to run this administration or at least have heavy impact on this ad ministration a what is amazing about all this is the commaschus keep saing that the quapart out lout yesterday for example commassis leader is malhonea is the political leader of commss operating out of cuntar i i guess ye he mt maybe in turkey at this point thet keep moving him around because he is afraid that es can get killed by these rails yesterday he literally said that when you give money two gaza it is going to fun commas and meanwhile the americans elike maybe we should get more money to gaza genius levelstuff here fommanamada thenn he says the second as shue is the call to dona money waammn waga acollecte caima dear brothers and cisters let us

foreign aid two the god strip took h m me stolen by commass an used and meanwhile less maybe ruciens on the mor for ana thankfully the west is filled with more on left wingers the the best tape ofthe moron left wingers yesterday standing forcommass comes from san franciscos to san francisco city council voted for a sease fire amazing news i'm sure that israel's government voted for san francisco to stop being a homeless ridin fses ritten othole mike tat that man did it ha en he impactd on the governmente of a of san francisco no obviously hear a bunch of people who would be murdered immediately by hamoss if comoss came into contact with them cheering as they calld for a seese fire in san francisco by the way the same city council hearing saw a person who had five relatives murdered on october seven testifi and people ware making oinking noises in the background assy testifie sto these people are just ta by the ay the stilwering masks the year is twenty twenty four i noticed on the calender herigo everything will one ofthese people w yeu dad in gasa every one of them it is an amazing thing whyre all their haircuts bad asked producer savey and the answer is because the're crazy people that is why and the by deministration continues tocator to the crazy people by the waysotos harvard breaking news from cassi dillan over at daily wire harvard is hosting a summer programm at a palistonan university dominated by homoss according to cassi harvard university will hosity summer program ore students will be briefed on settler colonialism t a paliston an university that called for glory to the martyrs after the octobersevenh terrist massacre the embaled iviligue institutions palistine social medisin course will send harvard students to bears eat university in the westbank accoring t the program's website it explains the three week an tents of summer course is designd to introduce students to the social structial political and historical aspects that determined palistin in health beyond the biological basis of disease the corriculan contintwill includ hering from health practitioners academics in activis about various topics including settler colonialism and its manifestations in palicide a spokeswoman four harvard defended the programm saying that bears aight is a public institution govered by an autonomis bort of trustees with no political religiou sor secterian of filiation well on the sun population literally voted for a commossofhiliated block in the student government basicaly this places run by hamoss and harvard is still afiliated becaue these radical universities aron facts still affiliated with the with the far left ideology and the by deministration wants to win their votes ands they continued to cater to them meanwhile over at the hague at the international court of justice which is just a a waste of space and waste of times the united nations on steroids the icy jay south africa is trying to prosecute israel for genicide wall israels attack by a genicidal group literally targeting jews for murder and well a hundred hossages are being held in terror or abtherty dead in gaza south africa a country famous for it is a racial tolerans is now suggesting that israel oughsto be persecuted or prosecuted for genicide by the way four days ago four days ago the leader of the studente's rebel group the rapid support forces prsonane mahomed humdun hemedity the gallo met president still ram fhosa in pretoria who exactly is a hemediti hemedity isa person who recently let aigh and incredible massacre in sudan min that that by the ways accordig to roiters the barials at alcabat sementary continued from more than seven weeks from late april on till mid junian sudan turning a rectenular plot into a sprawling mass grave for least one thausand residens of a sudene city in wesstarfor the carnage was the result to more than fifty days of attacks on the cities majority ethnic african tribe by sudan's rapid support forces south africa says israel's engaged in a genicided while they defend themselves meawhile literally hosting genicidal murderers in south africa as that is hw international all workson and the bie administration is still incredibly trying to cater to the badgise this presumably is why secretary of state anthony blinkin was meeting with mahmoudabass in actual halo coston ir and the ead o the palistinian authority halarias and it is it is amazing that the bine administrations continuing to try to prop up machmudamas abas as a solution in in the gasastrip he is non im the solution in the west bank machwinbas does not run the westbank the west bank is in a state of turmoil because the palcinian authority is deeply un popular commas is waymore popular in the westbank thenabas abas does not have the authority to even keep a lin on things in the west bank which is why you are seeng is really operations in the westbank on a continuous basis against members and a filiots of commass but the united states being completely delusional under jobitan has decideod the machlabas is somehow the magic solution the magic bullets with regard to the gassi strip and the united states is saying that the only path forward for the gasistrip is of israel creates a palistinian state under whose auspecie slt lem jus get this logic israel withdraws from a piece of territory in two thousand five they hand it over to the palstinians the palsinians promptly wreck every piece of juition for structure they promptly elect cammas in actual genicileterroscrip is their leaders that terrest group spends the nexed twenty years building up ba massive stock pile of weapon ry rockets building enormous terratunnels they launch the single deadliest attack on jus since world war too and the administration's responses that israel should create a palstonian stateso the last time they try this was two thousand five and andit really really poorly the solution is not machmudabas and the sall dilutional garbage it is all delusional garbage because this administration does not actually have a clear picture of how the middle east works by way at this pont it is one shout out to john fedderman john fedderman is having a reverse bulwarth is my friend john pod hors is said is an amazing thank here is john fedderman yesterday speaking and hofs assed about the icy jay in south

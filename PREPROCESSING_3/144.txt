for taking brik for eght outs nex he is gen a hold his breath for twenty one seconds tand global warming or something all these people are politicians thatwe bring only the best took a speaking of only the best the hunterbidan pleaddeal has apparently fallen apart and's pretty fascinating to see what happened here becase of basically reveals what a sweethart deal this was in the first place now we were told that there is nothing wrong with the sweethart yie we ere told that hunter bidon being given a diversion for gun charges not even probation and then being given probation on tax charges tax evasion felony taxcharges all that was perfectly normal it was totally normal no problem at al and any one protested at it was just because we had a problemt jo bidon and hunter bidon as people not because we were looking at this an sang this dude seems really really corrupt and a lot of us were fearing that this plead deol basically immunized his hunter bidon from further charges now there were some gabs that had emerged already pretty publicly between hunter bidon and his lawyers and the doja on the other hand the deogjahad sort of implied that maybe further charges might still bein the offing but hunter by e's lawyers seem very clear on the idea there would be no further charges in the offing and that his precisely wheare the jodge in this particular case put presser she said what is this plea deal exactly you ges even a geree and the answer was they do not according t the nor times judge maryland noraca kicked off wednesday's hearing on hunter by ns proposed pleadeal with justice bartmen by telling lawyers they did not need to keep popping up and down every time she asked them question this was not a reflected a reflection of informality it was a signal the shoose about to subject them to three pluss hours of relentless interrogation over elements of an agreement she described variously as not standard not what i normally see possibly un constitutional without legal precedent and potentially not worth the pipert the princin to the judgers lay i've never seen anything this judge noraca stumned the partispens with her scouring scepticism which led her to refused to green light to deal until she received more information from a parties an exhausted mister bidon trudged out of the federal district worton womin ton delibar lookng a bit stunned as his lawyers puzzled over what to do next you areall saying ious rubber stampd the agreements of the judge i'm not i a position to acceptor rejected i need tod a fur judge noraca quickly zerroed in on a central component of the deal a paragraph offering hunter bidon broaud immunity from prosecution in perpetuity for a range of matters scrutinized by the do ja during its five yourinvestigation the jodge appointed by present in trumpin twhenty seventeen question by prosecures had written in a way thet gave her no legal authority to reject it then in just ten minutes of incicive questioning she exposed serious differences between the two sides on what exactly the paragraph meant cris clark bidon'sley lawyer sed an indemnifid his clint not merely for taxing gun offence s on coverd during their inthe inquiry but for other possible offence s stemming from his lucrative consulting deals with companies in u crane china and romania proscurers however had a far narrower definition they saw hunter bidons immunity as limited to the offence is un covered during their probe of the tax return stating back to twenty fourteen and his illegal purchase of a fire arm in twenty eighteen hn who 's a heavy druggeser they said when the judge asked leo whife to lead prosecutor in the case of the investigation was still on going he answered yes when she asked him hypothetically if the deal would procluded an investigation into possible violation of laws regulating foreign lobbying by bydon connected with his consulting in legal work he then replied no hunter bide then told the judge he could not agree to any deal that did not offer him broughd immunity and clark ppped popped up angrily to declared the del was now null and voyd apparently the ffencein prosecution for separated into two tax an they emerged into a circle to hak shout a new compromised an official recess was declared clark agreed to the narrower terms on declared his previous statements cortin quat in artful but judge noraca was now on convinced she think thathere ase some secret teal thats being cut she turned her attention to the fine prints of the deal that had been struck on the gun offens requiring bidons participat ed two year diversion program prohibiting him from using druggs or owning a firer shubjrectud strenuously to how a violation of its terms would be handle typically the deo jcred independenly verify such a breech and bring charges but bidin steam successfully lobby to give that power to judge nor raka herself arguing should be a more neutral arbaer but jug naricas suggested an arrangement could be on constitutional because that wouldgive her prosecutorial powers the deal is a mass it is unprecedented i mean even according to the ner times thats an on pressedent tod yeel what the hell actually went down here well see bes as catherin herc was reporting from inside the cort rom heares what she had to say meber you at the turnes team i told the court that there was nontya and ti one of t mad a turnes for hunter bidin a cris park sat as farshe was concerned a cot the plintya was nall and boit i it was an extremely a conplaxlygal the scotchan over the last coupl of hours but i wen spoilit town to thes it does it here that the two parties have been talking pasty tother for months in this respect then you at the turnes office sats there is an on going investigation and there could be criminal charges in the future a this gap between the prosecution and the defence is a real or is it fay there' some pretty good indicators that actually the the people who are fibbing here are the members of the do jay that once this deal was exposed two public light and once the judge put pressur on them tactualy sav what it was tha they were excusing hunter bidin from they freeked out and they realized that this would be seen by everyone as a sweethart dello explainin just one second first where curnently days away from the called durban accords the

went on in that quartroom well peter is that there was in fact a corrup bargain between the deo ja and hunder bines legal team an when got exposed to public light the deo ja freeked out and then after the deo ja freet dout then tn hunter bidens seems toic waight are you renegging on the deal will shar who up is a former federal prosecutor he has a good run down on what he believes happen inside the court room and annymac carthy the former federal prosecutor rite for national review among others he agrees with us here is what charf says quote they s un conversations with people who are in the court room to day and my experiences from a federal prosecutor i think i know the full story of what happened but the hunter by in plea agreement blow up this morning bere with meats a little complicated typically tif the government is offering to defendent that i will either drop charges or to clined to bring new charges in return for defence guilty pla that plea is structured under federal rule of criminal poseger a levin sea one ay in ageement t to proscuet hunter for faraviolations or other crimes in returme for his pleading guilty to the taximis demeaners for example would usually be see one a pleas this open transparent subject to judicial approval et cetera in hunter's case however hunter's pla was structured under federal rule of criminal procedure a levin see one be which is usually just a plea in return for a joint sensing recommendation only and contain no information on its face about other potential charges and contain no clear agreement by deoja to forego prosecution of other charges instead d oj and hunters lawyers effectivally hid that part of the agreement and what was publicly described is a pretrial diversion ageement relating to a gun charge guns hunter for being a drugg user in possession of a firearms when other words the plea deal on the tax charges normally that ud in clude all the different charges from which hunter was t immunized but that is not what its sed in the document instead they hid the immunity stuff in the gun charges the pretrial diversion agreement as written was actually much broughder than the gun charge if hunter were to complete probation the pretrial diversion agreement prevented geoja from ever bringing charges against hunter for any crimes relating to the offenseconduct the offense conduct discussed in the plea agreement which was purposefully written to includees for in influence peddling operations in china and elsewheres when other words the pretil diversion agreement about the gun charge sad that if he completes this he will then be imunized from any charge this mentioned in the other tharges in the tax charges which includes faraviolations s there trying to hide the ball here said it was not publicly available they put the facts in the plee agreement but they put their non prosecution agreementin the pretile diversion agreement effectively hiding the full scope of what deojo was offering and hunter was obtaining through these proceedings hunter's upside from the deal was vast immunity from further prosecution if he finished a couple years of probation the public wouln' be any the wiser because none of thits was clearly stated on the face of the plea agreement as would normally be the case jure's oraka mell to rat chunderstood the wawyers were trying to painterential quarter and hide the ball instead she backed theoj and hunters lawyers into a corner that pulling all the details out into the open and then indicating she was not gon to approve a deal as brought as what she had discovered doja then attempting to sav fasin save its case stated on the record the investigation in to hunter was on going and hunter remain susceptible to prosecution under fara hunter's lawyers exploded they clearly believe ferroh as covered under the deal because is written the pretrial diversion agreement language was broughd enough to cover it they bill up the deal hunter pled not guilty and that is the curent state o play this is pretty amazing hunters lawyers in doj are can go off the will try to chut a new deal likely narrower to sasfy judge nor ak up but says this proscure i doubt if fara or any charges related to hunters for an influence peddling will be included which could leave open the possibility of further investigations into hunter bidon it tallens if this is sweethar plea and is got completely blown up by the judge s the real question is why the sweethart play who presided over the sweetheartpla who made the sweethartpla why was david wifes never given special council powers in order to you kow pursuve this prosecution theway that he wanted to where is maricarlan in all this why was not there a special prosecutor who as appointed on the hunter bidn matters why instad was this delegated to a somebody whos directly answerable to the corrent to turn general whois directly answerable father of th of the perp in this particular case it is pretty amazing the white house yesterday was trying to down play all of this creen sohn pair worlds were s pressorcratory shiret o statemen about this yesterday now i know many people have been following the news and delaware to day an going to have a lot of questions and he is when elsetey at the top before i turn it over to mi conli the admiral hunter binn is a private citizen and this was a personal matter him as we have said the president the first lady they leve their son and they support him as he continues to rebuilt his life this case was handled independently ins all if by that justice department under the leadership at the prosecutor appointed by the forma president president for anything further as and we have been very consistent from here ad referry to department of justice and to hunters representatives who is is legal teem obviously who can atdress any of your questions w i on point out here hunter is not a private citizen he lives in the white house with his father he was given a big security ascort to the court house where he plied not gelty hunter bidons question o questionable connections with his father on business ard thy entire matter here and as far as the love his parents have for him the presiden in the first lady what is that ise to do with the price of tee in china where is that doth anything the question here is whether hunter bidon was engaged in deep an abidin corruption with his father anyan i'm's can point out buat they think you are a more on they truly do the white house thinks you are stupid the pres think you are idiots they thing that the that hunter bidon was literally spending his entire adult life going and picking up bags of cash and somehow joe was magically getting richer and joe was in on phone calls by witness testimony and joe was being used a by hunter to threaten people but joe knew nothing about this and never benefit from it in anyway that is what they want your believe because they think you are apparently incredibly

dome we talked yesterday about this breaking report that oneof the people who bought some of hunters garbage art for hundreds of thousands of dollars than receives a seats on a presidential commission this happen to be a a very wealthy democratic s owner un clear whether she receive the seat before or after s about the paying the paintings but the the the real question is washed about the paintings the first place in the only possible answers to get closer to the bidons ranimunis an influence peddling operation obviously well correenschomp pere was asked about all this and shoos well it o ens the others a big deal i'd have to look into it would you though ollienot calling ma oeer here here wir i whe som erer he i would not have to look into that i not i've not been tracking te this visisit yor t mentioning to me noclep noclu it is all it is anly mystery rapped in enigma rappet in af puzzle u what a puzzle box this is sike knive's out or something who who knows why somen y would buy garbage finger painting from hnter bidon for hundreds of thousants of dollars and then receive a presidential comission who i id i no for gin t be able to sole this one ever it is scan remain a dark mystery for the rest of time meanwhile creen shom pare was asked specifically about the fact that jo bidon is very fond of cracking down on gunowners where law biding well what is the deal of hunter er r i here i'm ging to be i think i know where this question is going and i'm just going to continue to say as it release to thi the case that werething in delaware i'm tust going to not speak to that it is an independent matter wen asked about as uppord a department of justice even with the question that you are asking me it is up to it is up t if a it is one of tha legal cruinel matters and it is up to that process that legal process i'm just not going to speak to it here that is a lie that is a lie your bin recnely talks about prosecuting people to the full extense of the law for tacs ovation he is constly tongue bout people whor not paying the fairshare meanwhile his son is having all his taxbills paid by jo biden's friends if by the way the white house is pretty overtly shifted it is messaging on the hunter bidin jo biden matters as philip wegmen points out over real cler politics the language dones an ibly differen yet white houseofficials said fortiferent times on wednesday nothing has changed concerning presentt bins long standing to nile who is ever involves in the form business dealings of i son hunter bidon told fox news on campaign trail and september twenty twenty i've never spoken to my son about his oversee's business dealings and then he repeated that later the next month said i do not discuss business with my son but the verbiad shifted in june when en sam's a spokesman for the white house councils office told the washington examiner as we have send many times before the president was not in business with his son as bi rial clear politics at the daily white huse reafing on wednesday whide the language had shifted and if both statements for simultaneously true corren john pier then replied nothing has changed on this you cauld ask me a million different ways on us question nothing has change but of course those are two very different statements the president has never spoke in with his son about oversee's business dealing is not the same thing as the president is not in business with his son as i pointed out the other de in business is a very vague term it does not mean anything i am not technically in business with my wife we do not jointly hold a business together we only have a join bank account charle lar finances what are you talking about it it is pretty incredible that the white house thingsthey'e goig to get away with this but again with a complient media they thingin get away with petyn much anything that is wites left to the washington examiner and tim carney ts report on joe and hunter bidon's cosiness with the delaware bank years ind years and years ago according to tim carney as hunter goes to trial on all sorts of federal charges and as the white house squares the presiden has not had anything to do with hunters crup businesses and's worth turning back the clock an recalling how tightly interwoven hunters and joe's undertakings to ben let us startan nineteen inety six when jobidan easily one reelection to the senate during that campaign he sold his homes when executive at the delaware base credicard company m b ana for asking price an the bank reimburst the byer for three aren thirty thousand dollars of moving expenses as a bit shady but bidon pointed out the ouse of praise for what it sold for however here is what the joe mbian hunter connection gets harter to deny senter bidon was the champion at the time of a bankrupts to reform that financial institutions m bana loved m bian e was senter bidon's largest source of campaign funs in that reelection acording to biron york accorning to f e c records mbian e became ut by far jobidons biggest single source of contributions company officials given sixty two thousand dollars in the nineteen nety six cychel senter bidand m

completely free of all criticism from the likes of woil be golberg despite the fact that he is no longer functional and the fact that he is pretty obviously corrupt and has been corrupt for years with thi sun hunter and i's one here will be golberig explain why hunter texted his own daughter in twenty nineteen sanu pad das bills that is all wont please explaind but know it what whenever republican targed democrats cas republicans are mean howenever democrat's target republican it is because those republicans must be in lead with ladrapouten or some such nonsense i's people traffics on nothing but rumor and innuendo for four long years in a a dem to under mind donaltrom's precedency jo bidon the same rumoran innuendo this actual evidence from hunter bidion and his business partners talking thut josinvolvemen and she is lat what is the bigdeal no problem what isoever pretty incredible stuffo can meanwhile yesterday miss mconall had a retty significant health scare is at a press comference and just sort of froze up for a long time lot people we are suspicious that he might actuall be having a stroke a argroperaturnan or sterner n and he nod hies to somein is e here who stern waver on his theef and then they gied him way if he a hotiyewean obviously something has happening naturally were not kon to get the full truth about what his happening becaus you never get the full truth on these matters sent it mi nordy leater c conall stop speaking abruptly during the opening remarks of his weekly press conference on wednesday who is briefly escorted away mc conall a later said the eighty one year old fel lightheaded for a momen that does not look lightheaded by the way and not he came bacsparts to span e the question in ancwer section of the press conference the incident startled fellow lawmakers and brought in to the open lingering concerns regarding his injury and how long he plans fr main as the republicans senate leador mc conall again is culnelly eighty one years old nancy pollocy is culoently eighty two years old jobidin his culnently eighty years old onal crumpis curently seventy seven years old now at some point it might be hoove the american people to elects leaders who are below retirement age now that might be actually something that is worth while doing hawabout just below life expectancy average life expectancy in the united states lasn't i thing the mc conall has been one of the most effective congressional practitioners for literally his entire career but there is something going on and he is unwell and this would make the thord senator who is clearally unwell inside the united states sent hime dian finetine is no longer functional she is eighty nine years old and she itnot only she not functional everyone know she is not functional and she is still sitting in voting in the united states senate john fetderman had a massive stroke during the last campain and he cannot string sentences together and the entire press is pretending that this is an is somehow ut a story about bravery rather han a story about people taking advantage of a person who does not have functional brain power what is amazing bout the fedderman story is that he has a democratic governor in his state who will simply appoint his replacement if he steps down the same thing is true of dian finesign and yet wthe stadis quo is soin grain that people we will not even tell people to step down even if there is governor of the same party now what is weird about the state of kentucky is that in the state of kentucky the governor is andi bisheer mc conal were to step down for whatever reason he would be replaced presumably by democrat i which would actually have a massiv impact on on the state of the of the current constituency in the senate the same is not true wither its sagancsy for political reasons why republicans would kep mc connal in place even mc conal were on healthy he can realy sat with fine senor fetderman but it is it is you nw again in indicator of just ow just how bad our leadership situation is that everybody in leadership position in both parties now he is really really aged now that was mazing h media coverd to this see an ends at sonce goup to he immea immediately said he needs to go get checked out quickly nan in jobin's frozen up a thousand times i never heard anything remotely this from sante gubta when you looked at the length of time i that the senator ting to sort of i'll be unable to speak freezing as as monne described at it was concerning the action looke at that take very closely and i'm hoping that he will get checke out as doctors will look at this as well i a petit mall or many seizure or a many stroke those types of things can cause brief symptoms that as well the bottom line as i she get checked out and shoe get checked out quickly because for some of those things timing really does make a difference gam that may very well be trup but have never heard sonshe good to say anything that about jobidon who frequently loses trains of thought in the middle of his of his speeches ho seems to wander off into walls meanwhile emison be seeson icol lalls shu wont n further sould there be impeachmen proceedings of bisin bidn fros that are you getting another would not be he freesis rutinely a judd jobin is is constantly forgetting where he is an in your one's defending him i wish hin well i i wish no ill hel health find any him an being in that aran our outside of it and if the turn ce bi an thever be in peachment for statings under way for senteinteraptes that is exactly right it ar collect tiv thas questions and prayers ar for mit is ma canall's help it does raise the question that republicans to rays about jobide and which is one of age and i think importrly at least where i sat i think reave to checked down questions of age in our body politic and focus ince that on personal fatnass to some one capable observing are they a son mine and the right help to continue to serve the nation ol is that is thatwy is that you think it shouln be about age well yet that that makes sure that nancy blosy and an jobi never yet asked simple questions ever again on gan meanwhile whe new economic reports out to day the g d p came in for last quarter the ecconny apparently grew at two point four per cents according to walstr journal the g d ps growth that you wen for per sent the second quarter which picked up slightly from to per sent growth in the first three months of the year means the consumer spending grugh the string the spring at a slower pace for both goods and services business investment also strength and from april through june with company spending solidly on buildings and equipment the economy remains resilien spending remains very high again what we are seeing is the aftermath of jobin blowing much money ins become there till tons of money in the american economy conmes however our diling back the recesion expectations after many had projected that downs fron would start in the middle of the year in response to federalserve policy the fed ded act to rais spensmark intrestraiht toat twenty two year high on wednesday and chief and charge roompalld did not rule out another increase here was drone pawl yesterday announcing yet another rate heiht since early last year the ephilumpcy has significantly tighten the stance of monetary policy to day we took another step by raising our policy interestrate a quarter senate point and we are continuaing to reduce our security's holdings at a brisk pace we'e covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt looking ahead we will continued to take a dated dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming thet may be a propriate well all of the sof pures to be sort of up in the air and if feels the economies to find gravity right now a little bit tbecause we had inflation rates they were up in the ten percent range for brief moment there and now the nflation rates are still i three points something per cent on the annualized basis it ispposto be at two per cent the federal reserve keeps raising th interest rates the economy keeps chugging along and im that speaks too both the fact that the economy's pretty healthy before covin and it also speaks the fact hat we blown much money into the system that still in people's pockets tht if ventually things are going to hit the skids now they may not hit the skits fast and everynew sort of expectingthe be a cliff procession there be come point where boom the market just dumps but that may not in fact happen what may in facts happen is a sort of econoomic stagnation sets in as the spending peters out i i think tey'd be fairly likely now the federalreserve does have tools to jack up spending again right if the interest rates are the highs thy been in twenty years thas means they can lower the interest rates and they can jack up consumer spending if they activey if they actively believe that the the interest rates have put in flation under control but do i think that we are out of the woods here with regard to the economy i have some serious sdouts that we are out of the woods as an economy it feels there is some weard kind of countervailing forces that are having a facts of for example the real estate marketyowould expects when the mortgage rates gop as much as they have the real estate market would dump the prices would go down the problem is because the rtes are high nobody's actually selling their home there is nothing on the market ris there is nothing on the market and tere's nobody looking to bye and thet prices just remain exactly wbut they were before meaning that because there is little inventory the price there still really high even though the mortgas rates are really high it just means the entire market has gottin a lot smaller it the no the amount of turn over in the housing market has shrunk dramatically where is that money this nop beings pent on real stay going presumably nto other consumer products but it does feel at some point here people r can a run out of money and when they run out of money when the bills have to be paid then they argan to have stare puttig their there house is on the market even if that means there can take a loss on them agon i feelike theire other shoots to drop on the economathing a lot of other investors feel the same way ther're a lot of investers apparently who our saying they can read the feds poker face according to the walstry journal theyre suggesting that thot the federal reserve well have no reasons whoe increase rates again but they have no reason to say that now they feel as though the the federalres are has basely done all its going to do on interest rates and people are kind of optimistic right now if you will get the dowjones industrial average over the course of the last couple of days it has been very positive since the beginning of

the hill about ou fos now tyou may ask why my covering this far into the show would not that be the number on news nub gis bullcrap i'm i'm's gen ta put out they are right now there are no aliens on planet earth other then perhaps burneysanders there are no aliens o ca that they are may be in the universe they have not found us yot sull say in it now put down the marker sive friends motwas who suggested this is all evidence that yes the aliens are real and they are here ll according it to the near times even by the extrordinary standards of contemporary political theater wednesdays house overside sub comitte hearing on you afoes stood out there in a somber chamber of the raberan house office building a former national an tulgiens official told elected representatives theou es government i sheltering alien space craft after a succession of lomakers rebukes wit the characterize as decates of o necessary secrecy and government programs hat studied unexplain phenomena representative tim birchat re publican of tennessy lamented a cover up he said stretched far beyond parts an politics he said the devilas been in our way an then he listed governt entities including the insult community and the pensagon he said a prevented congress from obtaining government reports about youofa leme just asked you a quick questioneer donall tromblas presidents of the united states was he not you recall we all recall and do you also recall that when donaltrom was presidents of the united states he settle lot of stuff do you think that if donald from actively knew that there were aliens and you efos in the possession of the united states government he would not ave just feeted that within five seconds do you think the government is this amazing at secrecy they are this good at secrecy for seventy years or is it that maybe there hiding much to other stuff their own military in competents or the fact that there are ar spacecraft or aircraft out there from other countries that they do not know about the're not very good at handling i have to acknowledge that it is a great way for congrss people to grand stand and whose of both parties yesterday she had representative card mosco its yesterday i's a domi crediflora saying it is long pasttime for us to know everything thate is to know about unmann space vehicles in such for tacates many americans have been fascinated by objects nmysterious an unexplained and it is long past time that they got some ansers the american public has a right to learn about tecnologies of unknown origins nonhuman intelligence an unexplainable phenomena those are not the words of a uipho twitter account tho that isnat direct quote from majority leader chucshumor that the american public has a right to learn about tecnologies of unknown origins nonhuman intelligence an unexplainable phenomena a ca anderstand that you all want to play the lead in the nexts tom cruise siphimovy but yet your you you look you have nothing i'm sorry you have nothing really and the evidence that is been provided far amounts to people witnessing things with human eyes that they cannots explain which is half of things that happen on the daily basis for ver many people and i'm and also people claiming that they have seen documents that they say say things that they have an acually seen to take the former example macates republican congress person he says that he saw an or but beyond human capability iwas it the one that that that donald trump was wit the souties with you nremember tat whwhat are we veen doing i'l cap and when he showed us the photo that you take an i asked why the vidio was not engaged why we did not have a flear system that worked here is what he said they were out on a testmission that day over the gulf of mexico and when you are on a testmission disppose to have clearer space thot's post be anything that shows up and they saw a sequence of for craft in a clear diamond formation for which there is aa rat are sequence that i and i alone have observed in the united states congress one of the pilots goes to checke out that ti'm in formation and sees a large floating what can only describe as an orb again i said not of any human capability that i'm that i'm aware of and when he proached he said that his rad ar went down he said that his fleer system melt function and that e yet to manually take this image o from one of the lenses werd have tha keeps happening how all of these systems tat would provide for the surveillance are they they always go down jus big foot s omly people hof seen big foot and yet a and yet nobody seems to have gotten a really credible good view of big foot that they can then show thak we only we are on a planet where every one has a selpon every single person with camera capabilities and you are telling me that that no one has yet taken credible images of any of this magically as just tes just hout works again my skepticism it is larghly because i feel many government actors this a way for them to avoid their day drop it really is is tat is it is a great way of of not having to actually legislate or investigate things t actually have consequences for the american people i but again it he makes everybody feel kind of spicy inside i suppose on one of the witnesses the re tired major a david grush and that he told representive nancy maze of south carolina that actually he has evidence than non human bodies we are discovered at a crash sight non human bodies discovery to crashsight he finally found those burned barbey dolls that the we thou eased the other t anywat herygo if you believe we have craft craft i sated earlier do we have the bodies of the pilots he pilotet this craft as i've stated publicly aready in my new snation view a biologics came with some of these recoveries m where they i ges human ar not human biologics not human an that was the assustment of people of which recknowledge on the programmi talk to that are carrently still onthe program g again lake maybe grushes telling the truth about what he says he has seen but also if he has seen a document in which another person tustifiged bout something that he thought he had seen from a third sourcelike iit i jst i'm scan go know o kamshcan go know youther believeit r you do not i do not believe it i do not see the evidence for it and i think all this giant waste of time apparently pressed by birchard about whether people have been murdered as part of a government effort to hide you ofos grush said he could not talk about it in a public session there is more evidence that hillery clinton is murdering everyone around her than that government agents are going around killing people to cover up youofos agai tit i representiv eric burless and republican missoury said the concept and alien species is technologically advance enough to travel bullings of light years and gets here and somehoun competence enough not to survive earth and crastuon is something i find a little far fetched yes on that i man go yes on that can meanwhile and a in a hearing that actually made somewhat of a of a difference yesterday that should have actully been of much more concern alahandr may ourcus was called in front of congress again and he would not answer simple questions bout whether there wis a limit to illegal entries into the united states for example individuals who do not it is there a limit yes or no argustmen i'm individuals who make it claim for relief under our laws and whowill you you you already release more than two point one million illegal imigrants into this country o since you took office that is e population the size os the state of debrasca once again i would ask you what is the limit there is there one argustmen last year we expelled we remove the pronximaly one point for million people who did not have tha legal basis to remane in the unite states the largest number in recent history the answer is there is not one right there is not there is no limit and as bill malugan who covers the stuff an said the situation of the borderas gottin worstering mayorcis time an office by every single metric backsback your's highest migranteth's in history back back yours of hiest recorded at legal crossington history one point five million plosnown godaways highest number of on accompaniy miners and record to history f the a rampan human smuggling backs bak your's highest terror washlist en counters in history record fentinal odies in smuggling cartells enrich and incontrol on parts of the border and yet a'll hunter mericas siting there saying that everything works just fine in facts he said that he is he is he is doing great he says iur proachd to manshing the border it is working beautifully here is maoricus i reproach to managing the borders securely ancommely even within our fundimently broken imigracien system is working o well i mean if you believe that one i have a bridge and brooklan that is forsale already time for a quick thing that i and then some things that i hate things that i to day there is an amazing opinion piece by a person named blythe robber sin over at the washington post and it is called i was immerst in hook up culture and toll covid force me into intimacy and this person blythe robbers in talks about how she is som a person who gets around shall we say wo i woud never would hve consented to havin a boyfrend of covenhad force me more precisely i woud have had a boy friend for about three mons then baled which is what i was about to do in march twenty twenty i was twenty nine had been datig inew york city fror my entire tut life which had meant in the best case in aria going to a man's house once a week having sac maybe ordering foodand then going home it was not just that i was particularly attractes men an capable of motiona emotional intimacy though dog itwas also that i and all the young people i knew where morston hook up culture a fhrase i hate but that is also sadly accurate be for cove nineteen we dated a lot of people at once and took our time before picking just one and settling down it is what by logical anthropologis tellen fishure describes has slow love though in my case id never reache the love part after years of dating this way i was becoming a guy and capable of emotional intimacy in my late twenties i decided i should least trie to call some one i some one my boy friends by pictiguy and right away i found the experience mortifying who was this person who eemd hot and fun onthe surface but also made baffling decisions whoh took longs get ready to go anywhere who was in conveniently an entire human being wou're s ating long distance he was in mawalky but march twenty twenty i dsided i did not being tied to a person outside of me especially when thereare many other options ie flue to see him then covit happen they staye together and apparently this i this person enjoyed actual relationships and then endeat moving on of course because of course this person writes it dating long distance we would basely live together any time we wr in the same state but living together for three days is very different from living together with no end point in the middle of historic period who is definding features you can legally hang out only with your housemates before my boy friend i'd spent the ight at a man's homemost exclusively in the case fen un for seen it made major weather evend i'd worry what my tossing in turning a noise at this gy what if i fart in my sleep with my boy friend i learned the joics of cuddling with out o clock taking in the back of my mind i leand how nice it is to spend a morning thinking you are falling for someone even if those feelings are just the reflected glow of the factore eating breakfast objectively the best meal of the day during covit i learn that even if i was not constantly thrilling even if my boy friend and i were genuinely different all the ways that originally mortified me at the end of the day i just spending time with him and i'm then this person says i was in two more long distance things after that the first during the delta veriant way of the second with the guy message on hinge they eat or nine of ama crawn those relationship t are now over although i still are a mask on the subway and wash my hand now instead of touching every grows thing in the city and then immediately eating a sandwich covit feels over too but i'm grateful for how quickly i built intimacy with those men without the pandemic restrictions i do not think i would know that after my swet hare cooks ust food i love doing all his dishes i decsided thi sactually is feminis i told each of those three men that i love them dein't you now be even better marriage i know this is crazy talk you constructed an entire sexual revolution round the idea that people wo be happier if they hopped in out of the sack with randos and then it turns out that women in particular are not particularly happy with that and when they are forced into isolation with they do by covit that shur quite it but because they have been train that marriage is bad and that long term commitments longer than a few months is bad they break up again and you have telling three doods you love them as post settling down with one dod but it is incredible how the sexual revolution it is a failure on every single level and yet the people who promulgated the sexual revolution are totally in capable of seeing it they are bunch of strousy an readings that have come up about the barby moby for example and i'm maxtlakindf into them many of the strousyan readings thasely make the argument tat the barby movi is an argument against feminism because the feminist world presented by barby is really quite garbage the women are actually happy ar for brief moment in kendum than they are in barby land why because barby land reflects the glow of second way feminism ansecond my f emin has'm has ben terrible for women it is made women miserable tinstead of having a balance life it is told them to put off the most im portant parts of their life namely marriage and child bearing ins favor of the least im portant parts of their life namely making partner to major lawfrm and now that women are kind of waking up to it it is cin tas take a while for many women to wake up to it becaue they have been inculcate in the idea that this is virtue now the new virtue is rejecting the patriky not actively seeking continance with the natural law rejecting the p rejecting all of that the're the the search for oftenticity but with theyre finding women is that what w men authentically want is not what they were told by the feminis movement women authentically want and da sooner or later it' gettins on on a large number of women that that happens to be the case and life is goin to change in fact i think that is arty starting to sedin look ae time for a quick thing that i hate speaking of things that i hate now because hollywood has no ideas a hollywood has decided that the success of the barby movy means it is time for a lena dunham movy directing polly pocket we have now don a muwer tings all over the placefor we hde the blackberry movy we hav the tetros movy we had the that the hot cheetofs movy wwe have had a bunch movies about eighty's product beny babies denamoe now we are getting the polly pocket movy that is going to be directed by lena dunham who is a trash person menlena dunham's her her book in which she talks about effectively sexually abusing her small sister im it is not great bob aside from being a promulgator of precisely the worst kinds of vum of morality that the sexual revolution has to offer in series girls now they are going to have bit tthey are now taking what you can say at at it is most sort of t e annadine is that these are adult directors lena dunham is not into rector of children's film she became famous for the extraordinarily sexually graphic h beosial girls and the're taking her and they are saying why do not you do the polly pocket movy i i suppose they say that dom they are almost ready to go on this apparently matellexacts say hat there is already a great script i'm i doubt that because they would certainly did not have a great script for barby they are also going to on put in's development thomas and friends american girl and barney i assume that american girl will actually be turned into a feminist icon who scorn to merica and believes that america was founded in sixty nineteen thomas and friends will be about a gay train or something and barney will be about a purple dina sor railing against global climate change which is putting his friends and and family in danger because people drive cars i can only imagine this is were they are going with all this the hot wheels move by tt the're doing a hot wheel's movy that is a going to be produced by j j abrams as well eshore mature this is real con set it seems parodic im this is from variety but i shal maksure that this is not actually apparenty o gak stupid the barney movy will be produced by daniel colluja im apparently the a the matell executives say it is going to be more being john malkelvitch or adaptation i'm not getting that is what it' says in variety the hot wheels movy will be grounded and griddy i i can i just cannot i cannot believe this is is real i cantit is got to be fake right im there is no way there is no way ah e leg the thomas and friends the're they are saying the abvet that this cannot be real i okit whatever it cannot it cannot be real there is thing thomas and frind will be directed by mark forester of rul lorsy and monsters ball they cannot be real it is it everybody's buying it and it is not april fools i'm superconcerned that a either everyone is really gullable or it is real and i cannot tell the difference and i'llbe asked the i literally cannot tell the difference okip i'm shknalat i go because i've no clue i've no club already goies the rest the showe continues right now you are not onor missit i'll be speaking with the attorney for derick chovin who is the man

when it comes to israel's current war against comas there is a clear gap between the sides on a moral level one side commas and its allies seeks to murder civilians that is why they slaughtered one thousand four hundred innocent jews in israel and have planted their military sites directly in civilian areas while attempting to stop their own civilians from scapingthose areas comms openly acknowledges they say that they used civilians as human shields the other side israel seeks two save civilians that is precisely why commas locates its military assets in civilian neighborhoods if israel were truly a human rightes monster that did not care about civilians commas would have no incentiv to shield its weapons with innocent gazens on the one side commas has a healthministry that ruteenely lies in two thousand fourteen for example commases interior ministry website issouled instructions to omin actvis including the following statements these are direct quotes quote any one killed or marter is to be calle a civilian from gozl or palistine tbefore we talk about his status in gehod or his military rank do not forget to always add innocent civilin or innocent citizen in your description of those killed in israliattacks on gaza they also say quote avoid publishing pictures of rockets fired into israel from gosa city centers this would provide a pretext for attacking residential areas in the gasa trip on quote because commas rons a tyrannical terror state media members are routinely told what to report which is why that same year in twenty fourteen the washington post admitted that when it comes to body counts the commss healthmanister was quot the only game in town they threaten reporters that same minister acknowledge tha he maximized the counts of civilian casualties the new yor times and twenty fourteen recognized the commas in fleetes such statistics as well the other side israel is a democracy with high levels of transparency a free press herr rbostemocracy with highly aggressive opposition parties the crm prime minister of israel has been dragged by that media and opposition through scandal after scandal that does not mean that israel does not get things wrong it does mean that israeled does not make lying its central principle in military matters one side commas and it is esteemed colleagueson palistinian is lomicchehod thas a very long histry of firing rockets that end up hitting their own people in to thousand twenty two for example israel escimated that some one fifth ave all one thousand palistinian is lomicshe hodrockets fell within gazap during the current war over seven thousand rocketshave been fired at israel at least four hundred of them fellshort and had gaza here are just som vido examples from the recent passt there wereseventeenth is lomicty had disthre hospital in gaza when a rocket am toard isral mis fired and landed in gaza this is not the first time al thousands of rockets ar firetord isra rocket's fail is failed rocket lotes ath mat israca and the that or catles innocent individual n tat gaza now here is a map of all the failed launches during this war alone neun see this map blankets the entire gozastrip from south to north one side israel has a precision military that seeks to hit as many military targets in asifficient a way as possible that military reteenely passes up shots on military targets if too many civilians will be harm with all this said nacturally when a hospital allegedly blew up in the gosistrip yesterday afternoon and comass immediately claims that the explosion was in is raily air strike and tat five hundred people hade been killed the media used their heads they decided to wait for all the information to emerge because comass are liars nad just gettingthey went with commasses report because this is what they do as it turned out commosslas as usual line lying from beginning to end a failed palistinian is lomacgehod rocket hit the hospital actually to be more accurate it hit the parking lot next to the hospital doing know apparent structural damage to the bilding we still do not know how many billahly died we do not know the real number of catualties that took israel weeks to determine how many people had died in the assault on its southern wor commass throughout the nmber five hundred within fifteen minutes of the rocket falling there is only one reason the media jumped to listen to commas the media have an insanely strong stake in creating moral equivalents between israel and its terrace opponents they operate under a soft headed mine set that seeks moral parity between parties to a conflict but as it turns out they only seek that moral parity when one of the parties is jews if we are talking abouts a russia ou crane the american media treat every russian claim with a grain ofsault and believe petty much everything put out by the cranin government if we are talking about a fullon terroris group that just slaughtered babies however are meda ar suddenly shockingly creculus they sudenly believe what the terrace have to say how interesting how revealing whll were actully watching in real time as a genititl juw hating terro group laundered alie about a jewish massacre of inocente at a baptist hospital is what we call a blood libel that turm dates back to the year eleven forty four when jewhaters charged the jews of norwhich england with ritually murdering a young boy named william for religious purposes frequently such blood libels claim that jews used christian blood to bak pass overmaza similar blood libels reuse for centuries all the way through the time of the noties they are still repeated very frequently in arabic language media in the belise the glolds obvious to turn the juws in a monsters and thus to justify their murder blood libels historically have led to pagroms to expulsions to genicide targeted against jews blood libels end in actual blood now the same is true right here commas retailed a blood libel this a blood libel and the media credualously picked it up therre sudden credulity has consequences very deep consequences people are going to die because the media bit commasis hook here but again that is really nothing new legasy media hatred for the state of israel is decades old really dating back to the post sixty seven era an has cost thousands of lives on all sides if the west had taken seriously comasses own words or for tham out of the words of the palsinan authority and atlomicgy hie tisrael never would ave ben force into dangerous concessions to teroris groups ththave ended with thousands of deaths but the media continue to pretend tat moral equivalents is the story them matelist ito comforting easy story they lie or at the very least they pretend that israel's enemies have serious credibility those lies cost blood to day show sponserd by express o vepian to lake or web history being seen and sold to advertisers now meaneither get express ve pian right out express vepiansa com flesh men heso here is the actual story of what happened yesterday late in the afternoon in the early evening israel time a story emerge that a palistinian hospital in the gosistrip a baptist hospital had been hit by in is really air strike that was the story that was originally promulgated and the hadlines for the media just perided whatever comostile them five hundred dead it was in is rally air strike at target an to hospital whose designs kills many villing's hospil and obviously that story was also desine to drop at the same time the pressen bidon was riving in israel huro the original headlines from all of these outlets seeannen quot hundreds killed an is rally strike on gosa hospital palistinian official say now first of al you should note how these hedlants arit the're ll written the same way the way they are written is the claim and then at the very end of the claim palistnian official say now if you led t off with palistini official say hundreds killedan is rally strike on gosa hospital everybody would know to take it with a bit of a grain of sall because commas lies they literally lie for living it is what

every single newspaper in the world bought into camases story what actually happen what actually happen is that is lomic ghodpausinis lomacihod which has thousands of rockets in gosestrip they were firing rockets on israel because you kow that is ioas a night ending an wy un tos time to try to killsom jews and ostrial own or something and they started firing rockets into israel and shock of shok it turns out that one of their rockets fell short how do we know that wall as we will see because all they evidence says visual evidence audio evidence geo locating evidence all of it says sthe meda did not jusget er wrong they brought a terrorist lie broad castet to the world and then there slowly having to back track that lies to latoh because onces the lies ot ther this will now be the story

to day okat the idea waited until the conactl gathered the evidence and then they revealed that i actually know it was not in is raily eirstrike on a on a hospital in fact israel goes out of its way not to hat hospitals how we know this well because as i've said multeltimes on the showanothers all shiffa hospital in the gosstrip is located directly above commass headquarters this s been well known for decades at this point fror literally deckage tell you asked why has an israel tos takeen down the hospital because the hospital that is the reason israel tontake down the hospital for literally everyone knows and is not a giant secret is reported on wickapedia that all shif a hospital is located on top of cmmas headquarters but israel does not blow it up why because israel understands that the the human damage and the public relations damage that would be done by doing such a thing would be catestrophic yesterday the idea spokesperson revealed that actually is lonagehod fired the rockets tat fell short here he was announcing that yesterday i want e give youn annoncement of the event that the cu in the hospital in goi i can conferm that the anolosis of the idea for parational systems indicates thet the barago rokets was fired by turists in gozi possinging closeprosimity to the halian mate hospitalin goza that the time it was htes intelligence from fuw sorces that we have in our hands indicates that the slamig geodes responsible for the fald rocket lanch which hit the hospitalin gozel i repeat this is the responsibility ol bi slami ghap that killed innocence in the hospital in gozilto e say but i do not know who to believe should i believe the official military of democratic ally of the united states or should i believe the terror scrupll good news israel actually then provided evidence that it was palisining islomacy hodrocket first of all there is surveillance footage from one of the most cavime that is one of the villages that is located round the gos'strip it was one of the place that was assalted during the commassat tack on southern israel this i surveillance footge from netiv hassara and it shows the barasha rocket fire from gossip you will see in this footage that one of those rockets doestn't make it all the way out and where is it go where is it go iu sit there you see the gossaboard er rate to the gosit wall look et the look at the rokets go up and here they go all the rockets are are going up into the sky aimes at israel and a a meremo went later you will see in obvious projectile from the exact same the rection falling directly in to the hospital area it is of there the rockets going up and boom something came down what the timing is almost whi white why look at that it looks exactly is though a rocket failed thexs thit is precisely what happenedt rocket failed they it do not worryoure nout to you are not for li on visual footage also all just zera showed it in real tonet this is footage from allge zera time stamped at the same time that these supposed is raily bommbing occurred here is what it loke an algezera there is the project ol look at that the camastays on the on the rocket and u o there goes the rocket and bam down right into the middle of the gosistrep thereis that again that was on algezera that that yes wonder wonderful yes just amazing amazing work there from palsing in is lomic gehot do not worry that is nont all the evidence the deaf falso has rate our footage tife rate ur footage here is a a picture is a graphic of where the rockets were aims there is the rocket launch sight as you can see if you are watching the shaye can see in the lower left hand side of your screen and thn y can see a series of lines that are the direction of the rockets as you can see the hospital is located directly along the path of one of those lines that is a thes zall taken by is raily rate our footage but do not worry there is more the ideaf falso has drown footage of the actual sight of the hid and what they show is damage done to the parking lots this before anafter ay you can see from the top where exactly this this rocket landed now you will recall that the original portis that t it hit a hospital square righ hit the hospital square killd five hundred people in actuality where dit hit t a parking lot it a parking lot right outside the hospital and com oss immediately clam five hundreds head in the entire medeor own with it without any body count without any sort of waiting with with nothing ay as you will see from the from the footage here you can see there is the parking lot there is the hospital compound and dub again you see the sight of the fiter there is no bomb crater no heavy ordinance crater at all there shrapnal on the roof the tile roof ofn the bilding next store was not even damage they gave the examples of craters caused by idea f ordinance ere i vas the is reaete air force diameter of seven meters there are no visible sines of craters or significant damage to buildinge there is no crater haw we nowthres no crae becaus heir actual pictures from te sight where thres no crater tere's perfectly obvious from all available evidence that this was a rocket that failed and in fact we have footage directly from tass which is an arabic station showing the actual sight and here is what it shows now does that the midl of a hospital to you rs that l look a parking lothic ut burned ay you can see the and this is footage not from israel is i from tass ay thes people walking round the burned outskirts of a a of a parking lot the got hid not some burn cars unless those cars were filled with hundreds of people they are not five hundred ad in that particular in that particular boming and the exterior to these buildings is largely undamage they have footege from inside the chapel you see some the windows got blown out and the interior of the chapel is intact is intac are yofre not seeing gine bloodstains on the floor tou're not seen bodies strewn everywhere now gen did some people die in this failed palistonian islomace hod rocket launch sure i' en i wout a som yes was it five hundred people where is the evidence also even if t was not five hundred evenif it was five hundred people it was a rocket from pallistonian is lomaceehod oh but wait there is more that mean you you think tat but but but wait there is more o call get tou the more in just one second because again in just in case you were thinking well that that is all circumstantial what if i had for you evidence of commoss members talking to one another about the failed islomic gehod rocket launch good news i do i'l bring to momentarily first are you a few years ore decates aut a scool an wondering what the hack did i even learning what was

talking to one another one a o it looks we it looks one of the palsin is lmace hod rockets hit near one of our hospitals oops he r wore r mos hoper ive nota wanted i'm telling you this is the first time that we see a missilike this falling and that is why we are saying it belongs the palistonian is lomaceehod athey are saying it belongs to pallisonan slomaceehod it is from us it looks it who says this wthey are saying that the shrapnell from the missile is local shrapnal and not is raily shrapnal what are you saying and then thenamedthen silence obut god bless mi could not ave foun another place to explot never mind yes oma blank they shot it from the cemitery behind the hospital y youwhat is l they shot it coming from the cemetery behind the all mamadany hospital and misfire and fell on them o here is a cemetary behind it yes amamadani is exactly in the compound yousilence owhere is it whe menter the compound and yhoe first enter the compound and do not go toward the city ans on the right side of the all mamadany hospital yes i know it oh soh oh but i thought it was in his raily air stricom and according to literally every major media newtalet on the planet they's ran with commasses liesbetz come oss nn right away andthen they desideo the lie about it by the way in that even aud youreaccording multiplicity ofe war crimes admitted in that recorting right you are not a la to fir rocket from right next toway hospital what ar they admitting to that they fired the rocket from right next to the hospitl two they'r admttin that it fell in the parking line ear the hospital three they are admitting to lying to the entire international media about all this now you could make the case for the media that they are just credulous and stupid except that they have known for deckates that the palacin ian authorities routinely lie about this stuff routinely lie it is not as though this is somehow not their m o this is exactly theire m o theyve been doing it for as long as they been this is why you wonder why it is that many newsalits are located with in commass control buildings in the got astrip the answer is because you will be shots or you will be hurts if you do not do what commass tells you to do every one in the gocistrip knows this it is nolic israelry can walk around free with the cameral commass is a tyranical terror states they tell you to report thing and you report it and if you do not reported they kick you out or they kill you every one knows this and yet the entire media ran with their lie yesterdy because the blood libel is more important it is purposeful that is not foolishness at a certain point itbecomes purposeful an now how many times you can promote the moral equivalent's blood libel lie of a quating actual terrorst murderers with thes ralies attempting to defend themselves tbefore you become complicit in the lie and part of the lie commass literally landered a blood lible into full public view and by the way blew up the iddleast andyou will talk about that a second these lies have tremendous affect internationally and you ghess went all along with it did not you in the leggasy media you did and i wonder why could it be because it hit is all of your political arogenistones or you gets ta claim moral equivalence between isrel and its enemies could it be that well get to more on this in just one second because again the fall out from this is dramatic andthe media theire till members the media yesterday corincessing non an no we we still do not know how could we know it is a real headscratcher all the evidence ive jus provided to you audio visual rate are none of it matters to them many of them are still parriting it some of them are softly backonufoll now we non't no now it is in convirse imean on the one hand we do have all of the it on the other hand lying terrorius genicideal duhating murderers say it was the jews i mean whose to say it is a mystery of caticl is mak proportions that sort of moral equivalence again moral equivalents in which you take in a grieved party and you will quike them to notsies woare actual notzes i mean commass is notzes ton trums wors are not notzes coms ore actual notes when you will quake those with the jews what you are actually doing is both rehapbing the notzies and to grating the jews tat is the entire purpose of this exercise and it has a facts will gets that momentarily first something more relaxing nice fun the regular basebulsies in is is its officially over now that doesn'at mean the fun has to end that is because prize picks

picture the picture is always the same which is some suffering palistonian mam and hrked and a the original headline was is railies strike is railyes strike kills hundreds and hospital palistinians say then tey up dated that to at least five hundred dead in strike on goza hospital palisinians say and then they change that to at lest five hundred dad in blast at gaza hospital palistinian say change from is railiy strike us hundreds to killed five hundred thenn't change from strike to blast and now if you go to te neur timesthe headline is basically strike in dispute sick homer simpson backing into the bushes media graphic addition s insane but do not worry you till hve your friends over namasand be seeto continue to lid you that was probably these railies here wasam mas and be sees rofsancha says well maybe tese railies are line yet you are right you are right probably it probably it is these railies probably sot that they fake the rate aurd ate of the fate to vidio the fate probably t's all that pro or commas our terroris who murder babies and burn them and lie i knows hardfree to believe them maybe evil people are evil but i have breaking news they are evil and when you cover for them you be come complicit in their evil and oure legasy me go ave been dedicated for decates the proposition that evil must never be looked in the eye they must be coddled it must be treated is though actuon a'renot evil they are not may sure they'r ling in we know they are line but whill pretendtheir not lying an maybe we can n a make we can masage their shoulders and fors israel to make concessions to to the lying genicitl murderers it is its insane here was ma sand be sees rofsanchis doing his best to try in both sides this thing this kind of death toll is not wat yo u normally associate with palistinian rockets these rockets are dangerous they are dead lun they do not tend to kill hundreds to peopll in a single strike in the an that is rally high explosie especially these bunker buster boms that are used to target these homass tonnels under gossess tity do have the potential to kill hundreds of people and we should say finally that there are instances in the past where these raily military has said things in the immediate ater afthat incident that if turned out not to be true in the long run and the one example i'll give you is that when that the alcis the irreternless serean ablac ley was killed in the occupied wess bank these really military initially sad that she was killed by palistinian gonmen and it was only months months later that they admitted that it was likely and is raillyse soldier who fired the fatal shot o gand nows a massive scandal inside isrel and turn who revealed that it was the the israily soldi refire chot even with surenab lakla these really military eventually they did all the research and they found that they fough that it was in his railly military officer cases of that was israel that admitted that a by l of this yyou really have to dout the word of these railies over overcomas overcomeas ly clearly comas are the believable party here ow that the last three weeks have been just a master class in jew hatred it is amazing to watch its all of juhating history condensed into thruly period first you have a holicos level pogroms lash genicide genicidal massacre of innocent around the gossistrip and half the world goes n well maybe they s no we you have simply ver pausint low she saw that then we see the is rael cant tofend itself it is causing svilling casualties the jews must take it the jews must take it right on the chin they must enjoy it the jews must simply stand there after all we would not want the sing dascaloide we have to make your what we just want piece seise fire now before israel can do anything to defend itself or get back ats two hundred hostages that is the best thing then we have a full on blood lible which is what this is paraded by the leggasimedia meanwhele i'm i'm just i'm wondering what is coming next as a suden of juish history i'm i'm i'm really looking forward to seeing what knew antisemetic trope from history can be dropped directly into e middle of this conflagration of garbage great stuff here media seean en hat on a senior managing editor of the military times him kimberly dosiations this this could shift political opinion against hisra yes that is the entire point why do you think comas did it why do yu think they lied and then why do you think you gis are cowting the lie again it is unforgivable for you understandl comases comas is a scorpion riding a frog of course ther oneisting the frog the media i're not the frog though because here is the thing the menia know full well what the scorpion is they are not bamboozles or shock by this they know what comas is and the report it credulously because it backs their broader narrative which is that there is a cycle of violence in the midliast not one side seeking the genicidal extermination of the other side in the other side simply wanting to be left alone i repeat for the one millionth time esrael pulled out of the gosi strip can two thousand five leaving the entire thing n to the control of the palistinians and homas dthey promptly built it into immany terror state that waunch the worst terror attack on juisince foholicoss and he media immedately turn around an go back to moral equivalence land it is astonishing here we gol jick what those images ad up to is a mass casual ty event that could change the international a opinion of what israelis doing right now it could shift international opinion against them it is already a shifted that a opinion in the ara world against israel a and is ter is rally a news channels are still covering hostage families arab news channels are covering the destruction inside gaza im i notice that to you ges her all very credulous about that againd the credet t if you are that credulous about the plams of terrors scrupta it makes me think you have him latent feelings about this conflict not latent feelings may we should say sing of people who do not have late an feelings about this conflict for shued to leavn ohan omar the terrors cawkas in the yes congress athey decided immediately to parrot homas is claims and blast them out at full volume resheted to leab terer sympathizer she treated out israel just bom the baptist hospital killing five hundred palsinians doctors children patiente just that president this what happens when you refused to facilitate a seas fire and help the escalae youre warren destruction only approach has opened my eyes and many palstinian americans and muslin americans likes me wou'll remember where you stood there she is just perroting homscrop again because of course she loves comas she is the omascockes ihanomarsame sarted deal fom my sistocamas has ohanomar ever medaterrors croup that she isn'n fond of bomming a hospitals among the gravest of war crimes is ohanomar well maybyou might once help palsinis lim she hod that the idea for portadly blowing up one of the few places the injured and wounded can seep medical trimen and shelter during wars herrific the president needs to push for an immediate sease fire to and this lauhter you noticed that all homascock is are pushing for seasfire why ca omas getting it askict as well it should ihnomart reshuted to leab again pushing out terrors prop agan a because this is what they do for an actual living it is it is amazing is are elected officials in the united states really really solid stuff right dere seriously good stuff by the way the the hamas cockas adjrunct scholar ao see she is continuing to parrot the words of her of her fellow homas cackis members she spent three minutes the other day trying to explain her calls for a sease fire after many jews were murdered is on sianen youin several other of your colleagues a reallease the statement calling on as fir aseas fire i in the region but i wonder what is israel supposed to do about hamas after they murdered brutalize aducted over a thousand of their citizens are they supposed suc a to nothing well yau i think what is important ing nout about a sease fires that it is not one side it hamat has been senting thousands of rockats since i astraielis while and what is important is frst to identify our coal incomes to what fifteens in turns of flet te fonten ut and i fin gay cogesomand i think the posicion from israels respectiv is that there was already an attack and hamas already committe at a hack after that happened do you really believe that they should not respond to that i think what is important in trms if respont is israel dos have a right to to selg defence i think wer we new to take a look at in the situation i if collect ive punishment qualified at defence is if obloch salnown an male affact that the our congress is filled with clowns an she is rited the she she is the driver of the clown car i o see the fact that the medio proper up as somebody who knows things this idiot barsender from brooklyn or supposed to pretend that she knows things either she is absolutely ignorant or she is just in ad junk to the comoss cacas or both at this point i'm to go with both jobidon arrived in israel to day and i met with the israely government in the immediate aftermath of thas he put out o stapemen to how outrage she was about the hit i'm hospital again am mig to behoved him to wait for five minutes to see if the fact actually come out meanwhile john kurby was the national security spoke person he u he said that dom that he would be asking that biden would be asking thitin ow who tough questions as a friend which is always yet after after your people get slaughtered definitely want to answer questions from the american president tough how many tove questions has a jobidan asked zolensky as a friend question sery i serious question has jobdnes a lot ofs hove questions of a vlodamirs lenski and you crane as a friend ever yer tha's hot a anguage aplied anywhere except with regard to the israilays of course here was john kurby trying to again start making the room for both siding it then bydn got on the ground and is weill see we he back tract tis thing pretty strongly when he talks sa preeson an a to the workanan a is tonbig doin o te tis wantis wnt agas tens ro thes raillyes about the i uation on the ground and more critically there ata tin ter plans ter ten in in the days a wes ahead and ho e askins on a questi to be askin to as a fren as tru friend tof israel way we aski o questons o a a he is askin to makei clear that we otinue to want to see this contli not why not is man not deepen in tough questions is for anyone biden immediately said he was outraged by all this then to day he said in israel we at by the way i notice that the other side did it meaning was palsing in his lomachy hut here as present bydn saying that t deep we said te ot rae by hear explos as os toin osea sue e ba wi seper o to as to i tete te i tu pos tos o te o ter i r w a l e a o er co lo ti i'm he was asked by the way why he believe that and he says what i was shown by my defense

forces in the release that wish to see this conflagration spread now it is n the interest of america to keep this thing contain they do not want censbelogettng intothe war if they do israls can go holhog against cus belie if isral does that syria may come in erron may come in and suddenly u have a resional war that makespannd outward to include soone states and maygo necle this is something the united state wishes to minamize in order for that to happen however it would really help if the media would stop promell getting blood libles against the sralies that actually end ongoing negotiations is already againt you have forces that are seeking to maximize the amount of conflict in the region that of course would include casbala another terrors grouping evil genicitle terrors group on israel's northern boarder that also happens to run the lebonese government by proxy at this point according to the jerusalem post cesbelog denounced what the group said was israels deadly attack on gosa hospital and it was a li and calld for a day of unprecedented anger on wednesday i mean it is hard to have dave on precedent an anger in a region where pretty much every day is the day of precedented angere man literally every friday is a day of rage over there by protests iv rupted outside the os embassy in baroots just hours after the incident again all of this promoted by the american media these massive protest spread pretty much everywhere huge protest in lebanon that ended with the evacuation apparently of the american embassy in bayroot because people trying to set it on fire there also massive protest in jordan a footed from jordan were massive protest broke out around the is rally embassy in jordan hers without look un seet look at the size of that protest of corseventy per cent of the population of jordan is palsinian arab which makes prvetents because originall the entire area was qonqu jordan was transjordan and then transjorn with sliced off the en tir area was conecul bitishman at palistine transjorn with sliced off that be came jordan naturally a huge prersenage the population is palsinian arab can see the size f the crowd then you had massive protest in cotar which is in eranian proxy state an alli worke very very closely with the with the genicital dictators in eron secure they were protesting in cotar sthe giant protest over in cotar therre massive protest in or on in favor of comas as well again look at the size ofe those om of those protest many of these devolved into into violent riots or people least attacking particular sites that included for example people who ware actually shooting ordinance at dom the at the is rally consolate in turkey s a fireworks were being shot at the israilly consolate in turkeaters with that looked as well it did not stop there by the wiy a crowd tried to break in to an american military base in turkee as well and all of this was ignited by the american media paradan homastocking points s again slow clat forour genius as and leg sy meea who only want piece gas their peace loving truth seeking people who exacerbate every conflict they can fine apparently meanwhile a massive prokomascrowd headed toward the us embassy in bagdab that was a another thing that happened lesson all this happened overnight because again the misinformation gets around the world before the truth can put its its panton in the morning here is a massive procraw of prokoms crowd headed toward the osembassy an bagdad anything lot of ut young males obviously as you imagian in erach a by the way from wondering what these out people are are chancing they ar chancing i quote america is the greatest devil just in case you tought that this was only about hating june is ifthere weren bad enough they a they hate amarica also things are one grate protestors in berood as we say the osembassy had to be briefly evacuated apparently because protessors in berood were a trying to get into the us embassy they a were flyng commass flags and draping them over the fences donry they thet they are not guys we have been told by the same legsymedia that the population in these areas hates commoss the commass is basically acting on its own that the population of goza they hate commos of judantomaria the called westbank they hate hooss that in all these countries everyone is peace loving and peace seeking they all want the same thing i'm notsing lot of evidence for that but we have been told it by our legacy media probably we should believe it meanwhile it is also hitting the west police in berlin actually had to set up outside a hollicoss memorial in berlin to preventsed from being defaced and vandalized here is video of that last night in berlin en the police presente around the holicoss memorials rented from being to face meanwhile we saw mass ove protest in canada as well in favor of commas those continue the weston amazing job by the way in importing tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands people who sympathize the terrac scrup those at that it turns at thosan amazingly smartme that is that is great im yew that is that is a lot o people who wem if you are ont and lem put in this way if you are on the west on an emigrant vesa and you suppor commos uestion taportio they should not be a particularly controversial statement it sems supporting terrascripts are pretty base line thing not to do if you wish to reside in the west massive protest broke out in greese as well terra simpthise ar running wild in spain around the glob around the globe this s day thing is the protesting grease u'm things are going really really well all credit tof me by the way remember all those people we are told are not allied with the terrasts en all those people who who really hate the terraslike macch moodabas he is the reasonable one in this particular region he is the a of the pausing an authority well i mean it is unfortunate then that e thalston and authority gave commss's terrace families close to three million dollars for murdering juws that is ae thing that actually happen according to palsin and meda watch the palsing an authority which again those of the moderas those ar the supposed peace partner they will pay familis of deadcomas terrace o combine total of twoponti million dollars tay paiv for slave system calld the marters fun the terrace family would be rewarded around fifteen hundred buks and ae threen or fifty three dollar alrouncs monthly for life the familyes terrace married into receivin even higher amount that is apparently a low estimate thoug those are the friendlies by theway those are the people o we are told actually want piece the isros probably make concessions problyas sease fire would be necessary meanwhile this had dramatic diplomatic fall out as i was talking abhout yesterday and throghout the wek on the show the reality is that every one in the region except for commoss has some interests in this thing coming to a clothes without being blown into a broader war erondos a want thatcaus if this thing goes hot and aron ans up in the war the leadership of ron will be dead and that is just the reality lebinon will be depose s the leadership of ron will be dead the're be a lott of thad bodies the're be a lot of rific suffering in carnate tha' what everybody is seeking to avoid at this point but because of this false report pareted around by the media because of that jordan has now cancilled a summit that was to be held with king abdula the dictator of egypt alseesy and machhutabas after the blast they decided to cancel that and dum and that was going to be sort of te lead off for trying to figur ut what happenes with gossi that is realy what those metings are about what happens with civilians and gozes they get some sort of temporary stay in egypt do any of them want to moe out it turns out lod people dont a sirlely want to live in gazac has dachly a crappy place to live on your governed by either the pousing an authorty orslomaty hod orkoms many people arn'e leave will they be aloud to where would they go tht'swhat those meetings were gongto be about whatl come to aftercomas instead that got cancel because of this false story that was towted around the world by legasy media according to the times ofvisrael the wite hose confirmed that the jordan portion of jo bidanstrip to the medeest has been cancelled twhos supposed to hold the summit in aman with the leaders of jordan egypt in the palsinan authority jordan announced it was scrapping o the meedea the meeting entirely which again goes to show you whe their hearts are does it not menyagon why why would that scrap the meting wouldn' they want the meting more desperately with the americans even if only to pressure the americans to push these railies a white house official sed in a statement the ecision to scrap the amon summit was made after bid and consulted with king abdula in white of the days of morning announced by abas following the hospital blast again thet they are all they are all playing up the lie because they want to play up the lie because they wish to exasts tor bade the feeligs of te called arab street the men lying their people for dacades and in doctrnating their children the hatred of jews wife stop now i'm that is the international situations occurrently stands now how fast cin thes liebe to bunked anybody's ges meany it is it is already been tobunks in real time but it does not relive atter because in the end in the end they are too many peoplein legsy media who still have a stake in the pre existing narrative they stilva a a stake in the preexisting narrative an there n to continued from on the lie the aerab street will continue to pick up the lie an ar b leadership wil continue to pick up the lie muslin leadership wll continue pick up the lie and the contract of the conflict rellman intractable which was entirely the point this has been entirely the point of the palstinian conflict since the very beginning i repeat that ifyou go back to ninet he is forty seven nineteen forty eight every war creates refuge es this what wars do ths why theyr three pont five millions syrian refuge es culnently living in turkey the difference between israel and its airb neighbors is that israel tried to encourage many people to stay which is whife twenty per cent of israel's population is culnenltly is raily arab meaning palstnian arab and also israel took an eight hundred thousand jubes from the surrounding regions all of them it took in the arb nations took in zero palstinian arabs to use them as weapon against the jews and tat has been the story since the beging at continues to be the story to day in a second we will get to what comes next internationally and the continuing crisis on america's college campasses first we do things here pretty differently at the dily wire because several of the top news potcass in the world longed a chocolate company overnight we just took on disny had to had by releasing a hundred episodes ofe kid's content tons of content well that means that were constantly growing more constantly seeking now

cam slesh d a i el wi w i r e ziperokreer is indeed the smarsway to hirgo check them out raght now ziprocr dot calm slash daily wire what comes next well the white house is already discussing the possibility of what they will do if cusbalat gets in according to axiosta kob the white house has ben discussing the possibility of using military force of cusballod joins the war in goza an attacks israel with its huge arsinal of rockets whell that of course matters the even the discussion the publiclly vailable discussion is meant to push casbalat away from doing just that and that is smart american's not want cusballa involved israel's not whon husbala involved no one wants husbla involved an emsur cusbal wonce cubal involks if they get involved they will not be on the map within a few weeks but they are being forced into it by eron by zircumstance is in goza by world opinion and all the rest the west promoting a deterine strategy here is a smart thing to do as i mentioned yesterday that is something that to the united states should be doing they should be pushiin cusbala from doing this peas again if cusbala fires those rocket were not talking about fifteen hundred ded use your talking about twenty to thirty thousand dedgues that tomany rockets they have and they are much more sophisticated and they can overwhelm iron don that that is the great fear to yous official side secretary state antony blinkin told tere leaders in the region that the use is not foolig around by sending many military ascets to the region in support of israel they added that any decision use force to be made according to the scope of the husbalak attack and israelsability to respond this why by theway you have seen cusblodoing pin prick attacks in the north the basic idea here is to tie down is raily troops and material in the north to redirect them away from the gozis trip but not goe hard that either israel strikes ful force or than america strikes full force either meanwhile jobin is expecto to ask congress for a hundred billion dolar package get jobine is trying to package together eight for israelin you cranes are too completely separatisues tthey are completely siperitues and the conflict in you crane ive bee an advocate of america funding ou crane to defend itself and to prevent russia from taking over the territory also the intractable battle field conflicts which is resulting in nothing is can need t have an offram and th united statesto can have to take a lead position in negotiating what that offramp is with the russians as much as i hate fladmer puten think that he is a garbage human being in dictator that the funning for ou rane is much more contrversiral proposition than re arming the israilies in the face of an on going terroriston slaught again arming ou crane to defend its on terri tory on totally fine with and tat hould continue because if not then russawins an walkin to keev that is something thatshould be preventid but l hinking the two issues they are too completely sebered issues and congress people should have the ability to decide to vote up on one an down on the other or vice versa the fact to bine is trying to link the two in ore to cram them through is i think strategic bad faith the funning levels which ould cover and entire year theywere lso cover border funding in hisastrades the're tring to lump everything together israel ou crane border fon another crapsandwhich from the bined administration ii do not know why this has to be tied together many house republicans are expressing skepticism over combineing all of this together some of the asome the senate hiher ups he democrats run the senate of course mitch mc conall is backing the bidin proposal mainly because he wants to make sure that the aid to israel gets done and the borde security gets done and he saying we do not run the senate or the presidency he says this zalt intere connected but republicans arginto push for strong border element in ore for that to happen obviously republicans at some point might want to nominate a speaker this is the other on going issue republicans still do not have a speaker of the house or yesterday they held the house vote twenty house republicans voted against jim jordan for speaker of the house steve's coleese who is previously the person who wante behind the scenes election among re publicans over jim jordan he removed his name cthe sibos n't gn o get you seventeen jorden deside to push forward and tried it do a pressure campaign against various sort of congress people who are waiting and it did not work twenty republicans voted against him for speaker of the house that included the house appropriations show himn cig ranger of texas represent maryo deas ballat of florda represent a kenbuck of colorado and quartett of new york republicans and prurple distruct many of them our fright as i said yesterday that jim jordan is very right wing guy they are afraid that he is gingto do things lead broad government shut downs that will lose them their seats and therefor the house its majority hat's this all this chaos and stupidity should just underscore how dumb it was to depose cevn mc carthy with no plan or actual ask is a fit of peak from some congrsspeoplewho tevy cameras that is that is all it was because far i'm not seeing what the win is what is the wind really what is the wind again the underlying in sentof structures precisely the same because if you only have two hundred an twenty one seats in te house which is a re publicans have and you majority of two seventeen and ore a do anything hat means five republican congress people tha any stripe can simply sink whatever te entire caucas want that is what happend with mc carthy but can also happen from the left wing of the caucas which hus gon what appen with jordan yesterday representative duglam mamalfa a long time represent ceve mc cart the ally who voted for him on the first ballid in speakers vote told reporters tha he will vote forjim jordan on the second ballat himennas said he would never vote for jordan vot oul consider other candidates mc carthy is pushing for jordan but again i it is un clear exactly whether republicans can ever get to to seventeen at this point biron donalds who is obviously aa very right wing pretty trumpy congress pesson from florda he says he had turns out that pressure campain against the moderate members of congress back fire ahe haandal tha wi talking about the haer hanhandahaneldang i con bot m gorn con war annonomously halling torte a tay forgetting bolladen a by wr thatny at that ur o pro omety members i believa wa a po a uo members wer they they tha that te to wat they neede o idon think that wa be should be doing ri now anit th all to the oters in or country i think it the or er members ik her your boys at i coi er te that ut i think that there are members or her who ther one of beable fon make the the thiin or beer an that w or a thin fomo the cachica ta at that ire they have not work what exactly oave the republicans can o do the answeris eh right now the're apparently on going conversations between the democrats and some re publicans to empower patrick mc henry who is the interum house leader to jus kenna continu with his job sor jus will not be ou speaker of the house was move along with patrick mc henry clearly thi's a big one for publicans clear they on't look their bun to morons in a clown car shooting blanks at each other ingli that obviis well thought out it was a genious again i'm all for a bit of a bit of boisterous activity in the house if it actually a complishes conserve of golls please name the conservative goals that' ben accomplish by this idiotic fit of peak can anyone name one jim jordan is sol on speaker of the house steivesolis is not speake ofte house then nobody speaker of the house and has not been for several weeks of this point he keim jeffrys is now telling sean end that his cack is is open to reaching some form of agreement with quotiqual traditional republicans to reopen the house they are talking about empowering ins from speaker patrick mc henry he said our fok is right now relates not just one in the individual but to getting the institution reopen i have respect for patrick mc henrii thing he is respected on our side of the isle apparently conversations seen senior democrats and republicans have accelerated in recent days what is this going to end with an all likelihood some concessions to democrats ha just you get a speaker dones to democrat wal vote for somebody slow cla slo clap for thes stritegic brillians of this entire of this entiredabocle really really high levelstoff and meanwhile americas universityes continued to be a moral reckage a place of moral wreckage university of pennsylvania is now in crisis because they have not only look to the other way on ratical antisemitism but a lot of their downers are beginning to realization been sending money there first of all welcome to the party pal i've been saying for literally twenty years twenty years i've been saying that doners and sort of doners should not be giving money to left wing colleges who promote garbage they should be doing it and many people at yabitit is my alma moder yeh but they told thus some good things yeh but beab here is the thing ye should not you shouldn whele universithy of pennsylvania no has a problmocoing to san en former yous ambassador john huntsman blant blasted th university of pennsylvanias response in recent montst antisemitism an is promising to halt his families tonations to the university the strong criticism from huntsman comes amit a groing backlas from doners and trustees the controversy be on last month when a moltie tay event took place on campasy you pen was caled the palestine rihtes literature festival you pen his acknowledged the events included speakers wof t a history of making antismetic remarks you pen leaders is soue to statement ahead of the festival andemning antisematism broadly but not the festival specifically a lot of powerful doners have now argued that upen leaders have basicly allowed this tue go on upen leader president lismc gill issue a statement sunday admitting the school did not handle the situation as well as it could have well here is the thing guys this is stemach probem is not going to be fixed by puting out a statement thisit this is why also lesley wexener's non profit group the wexon or foundation has with drawn financial support from harvard university after that giant student group led letter blasting israel for the recent terrorist attacks that murdered fourteen hundred israilies more of this please more people pulling money from these garbage universities that are overcharging their students for aids dgree and nonsense this what this what needs to happen hopefully if something anything decent can come out of this entire herrific situation perhaps it would be the dfunding of some of our worst colleges in universities perhaps it would be that already gis the rest of theshoe continues right now he has ave flooded the mail bag with questions about what is

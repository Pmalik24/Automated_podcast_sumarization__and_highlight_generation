this first ray parents leave their kids in the care of thirteen aghe son but instead of acting as a surrigate parent standing above sibbling squobbles and rivalries acting as judge and mediator the teenace baby sitter stays squarely in the centre of those rivalries but as rulering kang now with no parental forces tempering his actions he way frank has this cautionary tail about what happened the peeries grew up and rurelied a ho when their parents went out the oldest son dug was left in charge of his for younger siblings dug was the kind of guy who ruled the last three rows of the school bus theough a combination of forse and psychological pressure he told other kids that the best driver signed in agreement putting him in charge of the back of the bus he wore a bamar jacket he wrote a motor cychle still his parents thought he seemed res bponsible enough when it came to his brothers and sister there was a lot they did not now i had to be their candemes bank kid i was going to make a fun for me to youknow dug offin subjected was three little brothers to what he calls bravery tousks he would do things stuffed them in his sleeping bad and tied them to a tree ling or snap huge rubber bands at their skin until they stopd flinching i really hesitate the tailors from because it could have been i mist es rall anyway we had the ciguana i the big lizzard about it was about three feet long ar died well i was after the thing that i course do did not one take it out beryitfa put in the freezer and kept it l this is a fun thing for all of us boys to take out of the freedan thoughout and play with it you known thand we got tord of playing with it than we put it back in the frezer you known wuld freze it again and after about a year and a half of this we decided wul ned a new bravery cift we thought what can we do i think we should boil an et well and eat the iguana that would be the altimate bravery dif well we put it in a pot we bout the biggest pot my malmhad stuffed n there boiled it you knall ill wele been boiling about five minutes probly done by now and an ry got to thing out and am conste goodness gree meate omean that wenter oi i evan make some and they really i'm s ready to teath at that point it actually take o cannel sogot dug did all the gravery tasts an made is harders here who was righting there with them but they were on their own when it came to one who dogs long running baby setting pranks i spoke with dog and with his youngest brother an mighk who was the easiest target ther ten years a part wi we were convinced that he we were convinced for three or four years of our lives i think that he could actually turn into wewulf we would walk out of the house and the ngear this s and it literally stop you in your tracks an e just knew he was out there somewhere agan herst dog we had a pasture in the back and it was about mig be half an acre nd they go out clirp to the back fance an that is where they to sleep out this the perfect place for me to stalk im in the night you known snake out and and be the where wolf i wud gon a just crawl out into the shattles and and i could hear em out their talking and i'd be sniaking up to the bushes in mig'd go r and te just i'd hear dead silence and then i ter one on go doctor went off odog kept this up for years and they cans began to tread it whenever their parents went out knowing something scary what happens o in until finally it all came to ahead one night mike was eight years old the middle brothers were eleven and thirteen dog was eighteen it began the way usually did out in a pasture surrounded by potato fields here is dog we hd a full moon which was wonderful an mi cont o got towere the moon which was silhouetting me and they could not really see me and i i stuck a bunchof weed down in my glasses theyre poking out all round you known and i can a rose up out of out of the weed patch and on and they could see the silhouette with all tits looked hair poking out that convinced hem mi man that totally i was totally growing hair i was completely a where wolfs o run for your life and and we all of course knew that the best thing to do was to get aut if our sinking bags and run as fast as we could to the house because that was te the sher shelter what were you afraid that dug was getting do to you well is is sist the whole idead of being chased round in the dark and and it snol there was ever a lack of physical contact i mean he he u literally was was a situation to where you were scared for your life and we knew the dug was in between us and the house somewhere and a nd as we were running to the house dug was just sitting on the ruf andthe a gargoyl position just st as still as is to night and just staring at us watching us and we just kind a slowly can ituswalk nderneath him and ran into the house ole now i'm peeking in the windows im rattling th doors more i'm trying to get in in ther running from door t door tranel lock all the doors up and i was always rit on their heels as they as they got as they made it to the door and i'm i made sure that i did not quite catch him you on me wuld runnin a slam the doors just at about the time they thought they were all safe i snuck over and took the breaker e shook the breaker off to the house and am then all sudden blot the lights go out and it is pitch dark in the house it was this for all an a die it was just that they had no safe place they could think of to gointo one of a finely thought get to the car we got to get in the car and lockd the doors and as we were all sitting there looking around at each other we realized that my brother steve did not make it at the house ten e i n alm in te how lal let us introduce another brother this is steve an cor ta and my i her wet o youl

a a i'll think we wreplatet again after that point ball bothese days the brothers are all quick to say the dug was playing wherewol that it was just again none of them carry resentment towards him the when they were kids clearly feelings were running a bit hotter around the same time that dug had his little siblings convinced he wanted their blood he got into a motorslichal accident that nearly killed him he broke every bone in his face one arm and one irreplaceable neew cap the force of the crash made the helmet along with his scalp shoot off his head it took around three hundred and fifty stitches to sew him back up when i came home from the hospital ihead my leg in a calf marm in a calt i was in a well chair i my face as all banged up and and that my brother say malm we will take dug down the road in his welcher for a walk ind we can have some an she goes o cay and a git in the well chair they get me down the highway and and run as fast as they can and then let go and i'm you are

this brings us too act too ac too in the event of an emergency put your sister in an upright position on the day after christmas all across america divorced kids shuttle from one parent to the other if they fy their baby sitters of the airlines themselves this is baby sitting in kis in corporate procedure and corporate language kids fying without adults are called unaccompanied miners little ones get brightly coloured tags pin do their cots or hung from their nexs when you see him is hard not to feel bad for them i wonder whather gong to say about the experience some day when they grow up well baccon disember of nineteen itiaht on december twenty six divorced kids from all over the country got snowed in at o hair air port here in chicago susan burton was one of those kids now old enough to tell the tale she and her sister betsy were travelling from colorado were their mom lived to michigan were they grown up and were their dead with here susan there were two types of unaccompanied miners on flights out of denver divorce kids and skor kids you culds pought the skeear kids because they always were something to prove they would been to colorado they had liftickets fanning out from the ippers of their jackets our baseball caps that' s aid vail but since sto day was to sember twenty six we suspected that even the boy with the raccoon face tan the cin you get from skigoggles was us a divorce kid too as soon as our flight left denvar my thoughts turned to our lay over in chicago bat see and i loved the o hair airport with a shiny food cort and chain book stores and big glassyy tram ceiling it seemed a beautiful new mall when we landed in chicago it was snowing snowing hard enough to set the airpor down it was only the middle of the afternoan and travellers were eady reserving sleeping spaces by throwing oir park as over blocks of cairs even florce space was carce and some people were stuck alongside the moving walk way the mall had become a recfugy camp the departure bore chair that our flight to grand wrapis was cancel we went to a service desk were an aget took our tickets and type things into er terminal then she turned on our microphone and send o criptic message at over the piar i have two u ems at the service desk two u ems at the service desk o kay the woman told us some ins coming by for you a second woman appeared and we fallowed her to a gray un marked door she fumbled with their keys i squeeze betsy's hand the door opened on to a room packed with kids sitting on their winter jackets there were dozens of kids all kinds of kids some in small groups the young ones can bursing with stuffd animals others looking un comfortable in dresses or over heeted in moon boots that had ben too big to pack most of tem were facing a podium at the front of the room as if they would been dropped off at the public lif prary and were waiting for reading by shell silversteen at the podium a steward put our names in alist the woman standing next toom was wearing the uniform of another airline it' strange to see people from diffent airlines mixing almost something that should not be alloued there were a handful of folding chairs in the room and we found free one near the senter i took the seet and betsey settled on the floor beside me she got her baby blanket out of her bag and began to sniff it it seemed we would never been around many divorced kids at oncs back home most kids had both parents youd forget you were different and then you would be at someone is house after school and the dad would come home and from the landing on the staircase you would seeem sorting through the mail talking to the mother in the kitchen it was hard to explain why this was sad as a result all that most of our friendsknew about our divorce was that my favourite vidio to rent was cramerverse's cramer and betsy's was the parent trap nout was strange to her kids talking about the things we kept to ourselves a group near by was en gaged in a kind of divorced kid one upmanship the girl wying a swetcher with the christmas tree patch said she saw her father only couple times a year e boy lying on a stomach lan that he saw his dad even less they exchanged a series of anectates about stepmothers and took a pole whod been the object of a custody battle it seemed in proper to talk freely about these things i ad no way of expressing thess at the time bt it felt we were part of something on a gran's gale all these kids here in chicago at the trans for point between mam and dad the being babye at by the airlines was a lot wat gut expet gadagend started in and out consulting papers and making shushing noises and yelling out names from the podim hit seemed fluster anoimg normally the baby sitting duties were small scal they were gettad sheperding kids along moving walkways and doling out little pin shaped wings in the u m room they were verted to the same crowd control technaques that they used in flight secure the doors with whold information and discourage people from getting up to used the bath room we did what any group boof fet up delayed passengers dos we started to generate our own information in the late evening a rumor filled to through the crowd that the reason some kids were being escorted away was that there parents from making up bigger fuss than the other parents where were those kids going the question arose from those of us in the landlocked middle and travelled through the crown the answer was transmitted back to us by our intelligence forces stationed at the podium those kids got hotels the rest of us would have to sleep her in the u m room e divorce kid reac to his parents separation in one of two ways as the rumor about the sleeping arrangements spread it be came clear who was the divorced kid who avoided conflict and who was the divorced kid who acted out fart noises increased crush drink boxes began to litter the floor i realized that when groom with sufficient force a nerth ball could caus injury sooned word came around that the system had changed that our babies id has were mad and they did not care who your parents were or how many times they called now ther were taking the good kids first immediately betsy lay down on her blanket i took ot the book in my back catcher in the ry within an hour we were out of there by now it was one in the morning betsy and i in a group of others followed a steward as through the dim halls the metal gates were down over the entrance to the food cort and travellers was sleeping in chairs we would chair room with two other people the first was a girl close to my age who was waring glasses with pink plastic frames i con vinced myself that she was the same girl who been in my lane at swim camp years earlier when my parents were still married i did not ask her because i did not want a ruin it if it was not true the second person was a stewardess who looked about thirty she werelon a make up and she was big bones packed into her uniform she was not mean to us but she was pretty stand offich we settled into our room when the stewardess went into the bathroom the swim cam'p girl pulled me over to the window curtains were closed but red light shown in from the parking lat we you sleep in the bed with me in wont have to sleep but this stewardis she said i looked over at batsey she was sitting on one of the two double beds in the room sniffing her blanket i told the girl yes it just came out antonintntinnalmost immediately i felt awful when we lay down i inch us far to the edge as i could s that i feel nearer to my sister on the edge of the fat a cross the isle the stewardess came ot of the bath room where i controll top stockings and a lacy slip and got under the covers that i'd never seen a grown woman sleepin anything other than e flannel ligown i wondered if she always slept that or if it was just because she had to get up early maybe this was what all steward as sus wor under their uniform but maybe she just fell awkward i maybe there were rules about what you wore that you had to keep covered ir maybe she just in't want her bare legs near batsey ntoinintintint intini saw batsy shiptandof the covers and curl into a barl i now felt certain that this was the worst thing i'd ever done to my sister i wanted the strangest removed in my family re stored ti hated this swim camp girl sleeping next to me she was not fror michigan she din't have anything to do with my life on the strips to visit our father more than any other time o betzy and i had was each other i thought of the kids in the u em room at the air port the one sant crass things about the saddest thing that had ever happened in life and how reassuring it had been when i left at batsey sniffing her blanket the ways she always had the

to day sh responser by expressive pian tou yaur rub histery being seen and sold to advertisers now me neither get expressly pian right out expressvypiansi coms lash men well jump into the news momentarily first i want to announce to you that the daily wire is joining with the new civil liberties alliance as well as hat the federalis to sue the federal government over censorship the u state department is funding ye development testing in markening of censorship tachnology used to suppress first amendment protected activity by conservativ media alets the daily wire the state department uses its global engagements enter the g e c to finance the development an promotion of censorship tacnology and enterprises including organizations news guard and the global disinformation indecs those government funded government promoted censorship technologies and enterprises target concervativ mediolits including t the daily wire their goal is to paint us as unreliable and therefore to push advertisers away from advertising on programms this one websites the daily wire websites the federalist that is being pushed by the state department that is an ongoing prom we are suing not for money we re suing for in injunction and if you want to help us fight these censorship that you are seeing from the federal government the kind of censorship that on a broader level has reached over insu for example the f b i and other government organizations coordinating with social media in order shut off particular stories this is just one in erration of that vie of the state department if you wish to hlp us out you should become a subscriber at dailywire d o com slash subscribe that is the way the u connelps that is an ongoing lawsuit just we sued the bideadministratsion over the pathetic and ridiculous osh of the ax mantate we are now suing we u s state department for an injunction s they will stop their censorship regine already meanwhile i know a little but about the kind tof speech that are generally welcome on campas ive ben ban from quite a few capasses including it to paul university i've spoken at more than a few campasses at which violence broke out over my speeches including calstate university law santualis pen state wuniversity of california at berkliy i also know that were i a student at any of these universities and if i said as a student what i recenely say as a speaker i would undoubtedly we drag before the administration and hid with some sort of sanctions i be responsible for mik grow gressions for saying things western culture is superior and men are not women i be responsible for harmful language for saying that human beings ought to be judged not based on rase but on merit these are the kinds of things tht are forbotan on college campasses all over the country which by fre speech has never been a top of mind issue for many of the administrators on college campus instead sensitivity has but apparently at the top universities in america all of those sensitivities disappear magically for one group specifically juws yesterday house republicans held a hearing which the heads of major universities were grilled regarding the rise vantysemitism on their campasses over the past few weeks wee been talking about that spight in antisemitism for weeks from threats of violence to near riots from tearing down hostage posters to openly ju hating slurs being promulgated in public some of the students from these universities explain the situation on campus here for example was student embela inber of new york university t is it to be a jew at n oyyu being a jew at n moayyu is walking to class and passing torn and defaced posters of innocent hostages with the words occupir and murderer written across their faces it is going to both's library to study and being interrupted by unauthorized protests where students and faculty call for a globalized into thote revolution and incitement to viilence against jews everywhere and a call for the annihilation of the jewish state and my friends and family who lived there being a jw at n oyu is being surrounded by students and faculty whose support the murder and kidnopping of jews because after all as they say resistancs is justified when people are occupied it is being surrounded by social justice warriors and self proclaimed feminists whose calls for justice and abruptly when the rate victims are jews beng a jew at n oayyu has ment being physically assaulted in n myuse library by a fellow student while i was wearing an american is railly flagd and having my attacker still roam freely throughout the campus being a jew at n myyu is experiencing how diversity equity and inclusion is not a value that n oyue extends to its sjewish students shu quarnc is exactly right on awn them here is alia cobyat the university of pensylvani an describing similar experiences an that happ university i love pen ive wanted to atten this university since before i can remember i am sure because the pen i attend to day is unrecognizable from the pen i once use to know pen once renowned for ground breaking discoveries the amir and a axene is now a shewing landstate of hatron hostility ir university revere for its for sude of knowledge has devolved intoent a rena where juish students tiptot through their days uncertain and unsafe the situation at pan is esculat into a full bon crisis with students openly asurting their intentions to proceed with plants with or without university permission pent an bivolente fuels e crisis that is shattered my academic sanctuary paulisyes meant to safeguard us have become hollow promisis and let us be clear if they failed juish students to day to morrow they will fail the rasse of us novethe less i refuse to go back to nineteen thirty nine when use at the high the religious sembles and high who they are to to the intimidation and harasmonof us i used to think this wis nonsense furmongering until i is made aware that pen recommended to students cot not weare clothing slassiccassories related to judiism now imagine the blacions intorising congress to describe similar experiences calls for genecine celebration of terror and rape against black americans physical threns against black americans does any one think these respective university presens when a seat grinning at the law makers who are quizzing them on their actions that is precisely what happened yesterday again if you one asine that every one just be less sensitive whatever anything goes on campas that is one thing bat that is not what is happening on these coll ich campses or sensitivities extended to every one except for you would not here was represent of least defanic of new york questioning the presidents of university pensylvania harvard university i mit about genicidle language chanced on campus tisten to these responses long clibween a stop and started because there is a lot here doctor cornblusf does m at m i t does calling for the genecide of jews violate em itees code of conduct or rules regarding bullyin in harassment yes or no if targeteded individuals not making public statements yes or no calling for the genecide of jews does not comestitute bullying and harassment i have not heard calling for the genecide r jews on our campas but you have heard chance for into fada if her chance which can be antisemetic depending on the context when calling for the elimination om candl those would not be according to the m i tews cot o conduct or rules that would be on investigated of as harassment if perfasive and severe miss mc gill at pen does calling for the genecide of jews violate pens rules or code of conduct yes or no if the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment yes i am asking specifically calling for the genecide of jews does that constitute bullying a harassment if it is directed and severe prevasive it is harassment the answer is yes it is a context dependent decision conprswoman it is a contex condtentas to sian as your testimony today calling for the genecie of jews is depending upon the context that is not bullying or harassment this is the easiest question to anser yes miss mc gill is your testimony that you will not answer yes if it is if the yessor nos if the speech becomes conduct it can be harassment yes conduct meaning committing the act of genicide the speech is not harassment this is onic tephomismacgall i may to give you one more opportunity for the world to see your anser does calling for the genecide of jews violate ens code of conduct when it comes to bulling and harassment yes or no it can be harassment the answer is yes can be and doctor gay at harvard does lling for the genecide of jews violate harvard's rules of bullying and harassment yes or no it an be depending on the context what is the contaxts hargeted as an individual argeted as at an individual it is targeded at jewish students jewish individuals do you understand your testimony is d humanizing them do you understand that d humanization is part of antisem tism i will ask you one more time dus calling for the genecide of jews violate harvards rules of belieing and harassment yes or no anticimitic rhetoric and is not antithematic ratoric anticimitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct at amounts to vollying arassment intimidation that is actionabl conduct and we do take action the anser is yes that calling for the genecide of jews violates harvard code of conduct correct again it depends on the contact it tis not depend on the contacts the answer is yes and this is why you should resign these are unacceptable answers across the board i mean it theire amazing answers because again just substitute the language now we are not talking here whether the first amendment protects activity for example the c k k marching through scoky the first amendment does protect that activity we are talking about college campasses where there are strict speech codes that exist on every one of these college capasses sif you dn't wan to have speech codes do not have speech codes but if you are going to it is weird that it only applies to every one except for one group can you imagine going at harvard university and leading a rally saying t death to all black people all black people should be killed can you imagine that not being punishd by harvard university with exspulsion can you imagine university of pensylvania some sort of rally where every one is yelling at the top of their lungs death to gay people all gay people should die and thatand that not beng punishable at university pennsylvania but when you chan from the river to the sea palestine should be free or intofid a revolution there is only one solution when you chant those things that is now considered perfectly acceptable at these schools wutting what dependent on contect now what is amazing is that the contect very often includes conduct when they say things we are not worried about speech but when it bleeds over into conduct we have a problem that the truth is that depending on the conduct they are find with that to how many students have been suspended or expelled for actively harassing students ar juish for lining up outside libraries and pounding on the doors in acts of intimidation and all f this is ridiculous listen to the amount of obfiscation that they are putting forward listen to the amount of spin can you imagines during the black lives matter protest an y one saying something remotely similar as a university present about any of thus it is difficult to imagine these icons of sensitivity and diversity equity an inclusion would be nearly sanguine about slers against any other racial or ethnic minority in america simply put they would not one can make the case for free speech on campas i can and i do but one cannot pretend tat universities protect students against horasman and then solf pedl hollocloss level retoric these university presidents do not even free speech but the're perfectly fine not only mouthing language they certainly do not believe about free speech ut then smiling while they violate these prescription s why are they sanguine there are two reasons and will get to those in just one second first what to green eggs in your holiday family durnd having commen they both neta ham to be complete ou get a spiral cut

saying there are two reasons why the left is comfortable on campus with excluding the jews when it comes to all of their language about retoric diversity harassmen al the rest first the left and university presidents are almost the platonic i geal of intellectual leftus believe that jews are not part of the intersectional coalition of oppression by left is logic jws are part of the superstructure of power since all success is merely a reflection of hierarchies of power and jews are disproportionately successful success equals power power equals bad antisematism is merely the ugliest guie for the oppressor oppressed binary but it is not the only one just ast the newest white americans asian americans on university campasses who are now white because they scored too high on their essatees thust tocates disriminate against them then there is the second reason the left really really hates israel the left tatisrael because american jews israel is too successful in the region in which it is located israel according to the left is a colonialist outpost of the west the lest is evil because it is too successful the west is therefore exploitative and oppressive therefore israel tis exploitative and oppressive as a outlet of the west in the madeleast hence the deep and passionate attempt by the left to pretend that antisematism and antisin is nore unrelated the left does not want to be perceived as openly antismetic thy want to pretend that they are actually tolerant and everst but they understand that antisinism can provide a heartening opportunity to oppose jewish and western flourishing hence the lefts rabbit attachment to the idea that calls for israel's destruction are somehow not antismetic but actually a reflection of a more universalistic humanitarian creed sure that cree would result in the death of nmillions of jews and the dominants of ratical muslin terror all over themad eleast but that does not matter after all israel is the real problem because the west is the real problem and we know that is true becaus again the west is successful and because israel is successful and success equals power and power equals exploitation according to the left radical musle macimes that in poversh and oppress their citizens are not worth one bit of attention and means they are poor which means theyr victimized which meas that they are the oppresze israel by contrast being tolerant diverse open and successful ought to be destroyed that is why yesterday and a subtle bit of maneuvering harvard president cladin gay among the other college presidents acknowledged that israel does have right to exist but not as a jewish state which is saying that ireland has right to exist be not as an irish country president ga do you believe that israel has the right to exist as a jewishnation i agree that the state of israel has the right to exist miss mc gill same question i agree charlan fox the state of israel has the right to exist doctor corbluf absolutely israel has the right to exist israel has the right to exist but that is not the question you notice that the chair woman is actually asking as a jewish stte which is the definition of israel and all three of those college presidens ignore that they are doing that for a reason because it israel is bad phisrael is a jewish state then it does not have the rght to exist by that definition what ought to be done bill actment se yo of persiing square na mator doner to harvard wrote that the college presidents quote must all resign in discracet if a c yo of one of our companies give us similar answer h or sh would be toast within the hour why has antisemetism exploded on campus and around the world because of leaders president's gay mc gill and cornbluth who believe genocide depends on the context to think that these are leaders of ivyleague institutions that are charged with the responsibility to educate our best and brightest actmen is right of course but that is not nearly sufficien the universities a cross america are corrupt through and through the're indorsement of d e i diversity equity and inclusion has ee a curse to reason and decency theyr politics are viol those politics also make t universities corrupt factories of moral depravity which means that'r first every major's owner to these universities showed bill ackmen think about cutting funding of course some of us run this bandwagon years ago twenty years ago i wrote a book title brainwashd have universities in doctnane america's youth when i was still usial a i was nineteen years old whe book came out when i was twenty in two thousand four in it i wrot the conservatoives ought to quote pull money from universities i also said that tactic would not be nearly sufficion that other sources including radical islomic regimes would fill the gap which is what happens sady arabia cottar they are plenty of places we are willing to pour teir money into these universities because those universities very often reflect their values that means the universities ought to be hit with another tactic business people must stop falling for the credential and scam the universities represent they ought to be hiring bright kids out of high school directly and giving them internships or hiring from solid state schools that is what these universities are anyway they are just factories for deplomased and meantire idea here is that if ou get a really god essa tscore and you go to harvard this means your smart i can tell your smark just by the essa tscore and ugpia coming out o high school i do not need you would go two hundred thousand dollars in to debt and be in docrinated in queer theory in order for me to recognize the ar smart person instead businesses should just hir people out of high school if they have good essa te scores and good grades for example finally parents needs seriously think about not sending their kids to thse universities at all especually in the liberal arts they are in doctrination mills for truly immoral garbot if you on a cason point as to how bad these universities are here is actually a gray cason point young liberal jews a whole generation of young jewish kids have been sent to university by their parents who believed in the upwardly mobil american dream ot o yours parensat there who say that their gray dream is to get their kid into a place harvard there these kids were then turned against their parents and their roots the newar times has a fascinating story today wabout many young jews meaning of course people who were born jewish but have nothing to do with actual jewish practice or identity as even the times recognizes and the york timesize that many of these young jews are quot a bansoning israel in the name of left to stideology here is the times quote mark cornblatt prepared uneasily last month for his daughter louisa to arrive for ten days with the family her home comings once brought the comfort of moving nites and cardgames but this shere is different he and his wife judith had moved away from madison wisconsins live in tell of eve where they fell to real sense of belonging is jews around the same time their daughter attending graduate school at th university of california berkley came to oppose the existence of israel as a jewish state that' daughter wait for a wit for a wait for it sometimes uses the pronouns they then shocker it is all the uni thing it is all one thing everyone who supports transrites also supports palestine everyone who supports palestine also support supportion it is the uni left winged thing according to the times at berkley she read audray lord mariam cama ruth wilson gilmore and other black feminis thinkers who prompted her to consider questions around power privilege and whiteness miss cornblatk came to feel that her emotional ties to jewish statehood undermine provision for collective liberation over the last year should be hme increasingly involved in pro palestine activism including through jewish voist for peace an antizinist actovis group and the if not now movement i do not think the state of israel sould ever have been establish he said it is based on this idea of jewish supremacy and i'm not on board with that actually te concept of israel is based on uknow jewish existence but that is really what leftism opposes for all the reasons we have talked about universities are a disaster area full stop parent should pull their kids unless those kids are prepared for the raging hellstorm of foolishness and immorality they are about to be taught a cane just one second we are going to get the latest on the israelcommoss war and the battle insde congress over antisemitism first in a world filled with uncertainties

prepare with bendot comrate now tat's prepare with ben dot com they on the halls of congress people having a similarly togh tim actually taking on antisematism ther're some of this actually from both sides of the iy al for example republicans yesterday put for to resolution condemming antisinism as antisematism this led represent ofe jery natler to suggest that antisianism is not antisematism now the way that you get tha the reason he is doing this is because there ar people inside his own colition who wish that israeligious disappeare theye would be destroyed the' be ehin omar and recheeted to lead and he does not wish to condemn them he is gon a pretend that antisianism and antisematism are totally unrelated the way that he gets out of this particular box since obviously ohan omar and rechieted to leav our antisemites and hate jews and israel the way he gets out of this box is he suggest whell thereare some jews whor antiianist is t the favorite tactic tand the people he sites are sotmarchasidem which is a sect of ultra orthodox who by the way when it says their antiionist what is t be clear wha they mean by antisianist what' sot marcosidem this ultra orthodoxat which they tiny tin iin percentage even the orthodox what exactly is their belief system they are belief system is that there is should in fact be a jewish country in israel but it should be a devitic monarchy whit the reestablishment of the third temple not quite the antisianism of the palistinians who wish to see every jou obliterated from the region the sotmarcosiem do not believe in a secular state of israel they believe in a jewish theocracy o if you are talking about these people as though what they actually want is for all jews to be removed from the region ah know actually what they want is for the're to be a jewish momonarchic theocracy in the land complete with high priesthood tand a third temple built right now instead of what they think of is an obstacle to that the secular jewish state of israel that is what you'e talking about seere playing a word game when yu say the sotmarchosin want the same thing as for example rchieted to leav anohinomar that ther're the same kind of quonquot antisionist that is ridiculous that is ridiculous that is saying that somebody who wants a christian theocracy in the united states is is in the same camp as some one who wants to tear down the government of the united states ind replace with the communistictatorship not quite the same thing in any case heure's jery natler and what he is really doing here obviously he is colering for riion toleve no hin o mar other members of the democratic party we do not actually his ral and do not is unfortunately this resolution does absolutely nothing to genuinely count to the scourge of anti semitism nor does it help bring us together with the unity of purpose that this topic merits rather it is another attempt in a long series a vailed efforts by the geope to weaponise jewish lives for political gains it is another partisan gotsho gain thin amounts the cheap value signaling not serious action but if there ever was a time for real action it is now to day in the face of the largest increase in anti semitism both violent and virulent in this nation's history we have a clear choice we can abuse this moment to try to inflict into party political damage or we can rise to the occasion and do something real and powerful to actually help the jewish community ah well what is one thing that i noticed i notice that during that learn he says wel no we shoulnt wok to inflict intraparty damage on one another over antisematism again this the same guy who also did not vote she senter risheted to leav over her comments with regard to israeliter compplete antrismetic lies he says e vehemently disagrees with her but he is not called her for dample an antisemmit which she clearly clearly is o i'll take my ut my tips on antisematism from some place else meanwhile deppers te democratic representative wois frankll of flora same sort of thing she also will not condemn promo dipall whe spent yesterday thessily trying to walk back her comments that rape was know not that bigad deal and when it is against jewish ladies in israel from milegiapall house he answer in the question on y calling dawn of as on sunday on this did that play any part in your question ing a quesh to trapis resolution well this really has been in the work since ta psi said really with i but bidding the works for mit for many ones on we starto hearing the a stories from the women in eu crane and then of course again this now with hamas and its atrocities and and i try not to have my actions here bee dictated by inart for comments by other members this is a much more serious issue in our fit than one member mo an it has to been said by all rape and sectual sault as a tool of war as a weapon of war is not acceptable it is not hard for you to say this very eloquently and very clearly why is it for others now niter asking me to be a psychiateri psi psycholotist are what they have to answer for themselves and il answer for myselves but i din think i really i speak for the overwhelming majority rpublicans democrats here people a with good h ar tecta sal shul not be t a war ot ecceptable i haven oftomeconcimation there a has to be called ow i'n understan mi this very tough it really really is not and meanwhile on the rightside of the altomas amassy put out what is pretty obviously an antismaticmame yesterday it was a it was a mem in which he compared american patriotism to zianism is o congress these days american patriotits that it is the meam of drake th what there bastely to binary me one where he shunning in thing and whene we's giving ito the thums up this this congress these days shunning american patriotism congress these days giving a thums up dezianism a and obviously the ideahre is that american patriotism is somehow directly opposed tuzianism now there a couple reads on this that are possible there is the more charitable reed which is that theire democrats in the democratic party who for example do not american patriotism but thei're oca with zianism and that is weird and they hould be oce with both and then there is the reed which is the more obvious red which i that american patriotism is somehow opposed tuzianism you can' be both an american patriot and azianis which of course is ridiculous mean just risdiculous full stop crazy considering that that has been the mainstreume position in the united states since the birth of the state of israel is being an american patriot and beingan aziana and being azianist being in favor of the existence of a jewish stateof israel are not in fav are not in conflict in any way shape er form and you can read it in in either of those two ways there is the more charitable way in which the argment is that congres should not be shnning american patrip ism the should be embracing american patriotism in the same way that many democrats andbrazianism that is the more charitaboy the other way is that represent amassey whose voted a long side to illhan omar and rechita to leab with regard to any any indication of support for israel actually justlu lik zinism and what he actually wants is for congress to dismiss zianism and he is really saying the two are directly in conflict the white house and were tuge out scoring political points to th white house immediately jumps on that and the white house suggest that its time for republicans to condemn the post herby's thiskend of the whitehouse hat all americans including the house cop e leadership shuld condemn this vurulent antisemitism from a sitting member of congress here is the deal whi should condem antisemitism were evert exist if what massy meant is the latter which again given his voting record would not chockma that american patriotism in zinism are somehow n direct conflict then yat tha tantisemitism it should be condem also what promoe gipal did the other day antitemitism should be contem this is not particulay tup the fact that it is tough demonstrates once again everything can be made a pirts in issue even hatred of jews speaking of which when is a one of the things that is been lost in this enire an this entire fight beteen israel and commass is the simple fact that there is a good side here in there is a badside and commas is the bad side benjamen t to now who the prime minister of israel yesterday he gave a speech in which he he wis beside himself because he is pointing out that as the tales come out from october seven of rape of women by the weight reports of rape of men is well which it s wor ink inaa weirdly different level i mean i know stories of things tat are happenin g that happen to hostages there are not public knowledge at this point andi got to tell you it is way worse than anythng you have heard way way worse than anything you have hard and the inter national community is still poopooingness and pretending thathe'e somes fore moral equivalentere nitting owt whos beside himself yesterday speaking about thus the women's rights ovinizations to the yuman rihtsoginizations you rord of the rad ot is reain harrable atracotes sucta ulilation wy that a larin i expictal sothe lis leaders governments nations to speak up against thi sectroson well they are not going to when the reason the're not going to his again because they have to have that moral equivalent to israel is bad andthat mean to anything that is done against it is justified in the frans phanon oppressor oppressed coolition of the wretched idea the the basic ideas that if you are memberofthe oppressd class get to do whatever the hell you want to members of the called oppressor class that is it that is an that that has been a a moral tat quation tht has ben done by number of insanely antisimetic and self hating jewish people and it is totally it is totally while but is become mainstream it' become absoly mainstream by the way it is worth noting t this point that israel has actually hit a shocking number of terrors despite all of the talk by ut israelis not being specific enough in it is attack the reality is that according to te isrally military a leades report from an off the brief the recor brief and for foregn journalists suggests that israel believes that of the roughly fifteen thousand people thet commosses reported dad five thousand of them are terroris which is an amazing ratio by the way way better than the united states in for example eroch typically urbon warfare means that for every terrase you kill you are probably going to kill three to force civilians because they embed with civilians s israel's being incredibly specific and yet what is a mazing about this is that even if you point that even the yor times is now admiting that even the your times admitting that israel hit five thousand terrors in the course of killing fifteen thousand people again they'r golas to the five thousand terracs and thy killed fifteen thousand because come oss hydesmonks vilians and now they are complaining the israel has not kiled enough terrors according to the washington postquote at least five thousand comoss militons have been killed according to three israly security officials leaving the majority f the grups estimated thirity thousand strong military wing intact why dingtan get is why doyou think isrel has not kiled all thirty thousand the answers because they are being considered and how they go about this war ithe matter the narrative is set andthe media are going to keep pumping it out there that israels some how the inhumane party in this conflict which is truly an astonishing reversal of the truth oflgan just one second we will get to more fun in games on

sports meaning dudes competing with the ladies yu know our movy lady ballers the number one streaming movy on rotten tomatos in america o this led to in extraordinary exchange can rily gain to has a camio in our film lady ballers also more famously she is an ensee doublay swimmer who had to compete with leotommas who is a fullon dued in the pool and here she was in exchange with representative summer lee in which summerly basicaly suggests that rily gains is some sort of trans fobic terrible bigot and rilee is having none of it in terms of mensul health sthedys show that partithep panting

and rankin memberly if my testina testimony makes me transphobic then i believe your opening monologue makes you misagenis thank you amanager sees me i move to have o the gentlewomen's words thaken down the committee will suspend manam her sheis engaging in personalities can i just ask how it is fair to be called transphobic there is at thing i wuld say men disguising themselves as women are engaging and personalities order ha thom to withdraw ep one of order reject it the rily gains of course s exactly right if the idea is that men ought to compete with women how is that not mistogenistic and in fact t missagne is perfectly well on display one of the witnessis here was the m lawyer for the national women's law center she is a president the president of this organization ams president fatima gossic graves and at her answer to what should women do about the fact that bigger and stronger men are competing with them what shuld they do about that fact she is women should learn to lose to men gracefully a o k i mean 's har to think of something more misogenis than this exactly by oka and success in school sports depends on a whole range of factors including how hard you work and coaching and access to really good resources and facilities and transtudents participatand porits for this same reason as their kids because it is fun because it t creates belonging in community because it teaches much about persistence and leadersand and discipline and less they learn to lose gracefully hopefully and opten they learn to wen with dignay be hopefully im they learn to do the sort of work that means you have higher grades and stay connected to school i want every kid to have that chance to have the chance to play the distopian this the distopianism of women fatima gos graves smiling oh and that is why women should learn to get their asses kicked by men and that is really what is going to make this a better more tolerant diverse and sistainable world ol my god it is it that the smiling is what really does it ao she had her own defense ofa of transit women she said well if we ban men then we can have to check genitals in lock room ought what i noticed is that there are in the women's locker room when men are competing with women that is a thing that i noticed and that all the women also noticed aosy there with a proposed bam on transactlets that originally allowed for genital examinations on miners in order to quoe uncl opret hact women is that correct unfortunately yes and we are seing heren in this guse under the guise of not only trying to further marginalize transwomen and girls we are talking of opening up all women and girls to genital examinations when they are under each that is pretentially just because someone can paint to some one and say i do not thnk you are a girl that is t and were saying this in an environment of a postdobs america we are states are riminalizing ocess to abortion and want nothing more we not jeo hires on women to figure out when who is getting a menstrual cycle who does not have one and were thancles to believe that this is going to make us better she sand that agrsner shes such a bed actress a i pouith the pencil in any case she was just woint out here that actually do not have to general examinations on any one just seft to present under ohiolaw which is what she is referring to in original copy of merth certificate it is the reason why for example you should not be having genderless birth certificates because these things are actually quite important because the alternative is dudes playing with the ladies in being in the lock room with the girls you nofs uncomfortable for twelve girl girls having twelve yearld boys who pretend their girls in the lock room or who believe ther girls in the lock room and they have a right to feel un comfortable about all that what 's amazing to me is one republicans run from this culture issue this is such an obvious culture wor win for republicans there is sort of a a fraught battle for second place that is going on right now inside the republican primary and ih've said before i i'm a big van of governor rondisantis in florda if the primaries were held today i would vote for him in te primaries i macgehaley as well i said before i thought she was an excellent you an ambassador but i i really thing nicky stepped on a rake right here she was doing it n interview yesterday in which she was asked about trans children or anover and her answer which is well if if apparents decide to trans twelve girl thand that is totally fined that is not an acceptable answer the question is what care should be on the table when i shall twelve old child in this country aside female at birth says i shi feel more comfortable living as a boy what should the law allow the response to be i think the law should stay out of it and i think parents should handle at this is a job from the parents to handle and then when that child but comet einteen if they want to make more of a permanent change they can do that but i think up until then we say with ourteen ainch cins they go through a lot during puvrity they go through a lot of confusion they go through a lot of anxiety they go throuh a lot of pressures we should support them the whole way through but we do not need to go in infor something in schools we do not need school setting theire hiding from the paret d what nchanitor pro now thereants tand we do not main to have those conversations and schools that 's ther conversations that shoud be had at home oka she is right that schools shuld not be socially transitioning parents without the parents knowledge also parent should not be allowed to transition ther twelve year old kid that is absurd first fall transition is the bigest youfromism in the entire world you cannot transition a boy into a gurl sellink transitioning i'm struggling to youn comb with an analogy what else you transition in life in

the head of the f b i and he is not been doing an excellent job over the f b i between the reports of the f b i targeting certain types of christians in the united states ceenteps of catholics in te united states and the f b i targetting from temple pro life people and the fb is dis proportionate resource is spent on any one who is wandering around the capital on january sixth and the f b is complete failure with regard to the hunter by the labtop in twenty twenty is been a bad stretched fror the f b cris ray was on the hill and a senator john kennedy of luisiana red hin the riot act over the f i failure to say that the hnter by he labtop was real which the f b i full well knew during the twenty twenty election these are very week answers here from crissray why idn the f b say heh et ththe maptops rel why doin't you stell iver by the lap tops real we are nop baps an what is on it but is real the sitn a of fiction why yes you might imagine if b i cannot especially in a time that be talking about an on going investigation second i would tell you that least my understanding is that both thf b i folks involte in the conversations and the twitter folks of olling the conversations both say that the f b i did not direct twitter to a suppress but others were in government well i cannot again i cannot speak to others in government are that part of the point that i was trying to make because the fisisten e can f b you are not part of the wide house in part of all lan security you are not suppose to bi political you see ow this controverse a going on whilin the f b s an time out folks we are not getting e meddle this but the matops real again we have to be very careful about what we can say especially in the middle of an election season because that is precisely some of the problems that led i my predecessors av a negative fines from inspector didt you oka but that is not right because again failure to say the true thing because your predecessor said not true things that is not the same thing again actively involving yourself in an election cycle in which you announce that youre activity youre activity is on going which is what james colme did with regard to hillery clitton few days from the election in twenty succeeings had reopening the nvestigation because we found the slaptop hofdn't haf to announce thap because that was about his activity but if the f bi knows for a fact that a narrative is false and that i's beeng promulgated by one of the campaigns and the media and other parts of the government and the f b i knows that it is in fact in act ore omission that is material to the election for them not to say we know the lap up is real that is ridiculous either way you are quone quat interfering but on one side youre quotin quote interfering but on behalf of a true th ing tit is not the same thingis what james co me did in twenty sixteen meanwhile cris ray said o y ot by the way even though there is still cort caseis pending it suggest that we should not be cordinating with social media about what kenning cannot be seiling up to the uction we will still be cordinane with social media you concerned about the fifth circuit thing in fact that you cannot communicate with social media to alert them to threat we coursess this this the subject of aon going litigation a the a findings of the lower courts in that litigation ar things that are hotly contested a through the departments filings president trump himself rightly in twenty eighteen or nineteen ai should an executive order on this very subject calling it a national emergency sisy that sent intelligence committee anoverwhelmingly by partison basis identified much the same and called for more engagement more engagement with socionme companies not less the key the key is making sure that it is done in the right way and that is what wore committed to defokus on the hidden hand of the foreign actor not on the content itself post whay well i wish they would do that but i do not trust you and i'm sure that no one else does it either once again our administration is staffed ein the city's the man government is staff by peopll whyre just not either good at their jobs or who very often argod at their jobs but in the wrong way and meanwhile congress continues to debate over you rane aid according to the your times president by n's urgen pushed for plenish you cranes work chests and send eaight to israels on the brink of collapse in the senate where republicans are prepared on wednesday to block funding unless democrats agreed to add strict measures to plamdown on migration at the osporte with mexico why in the worlds that euven remotely controversial democrats will gt wht they want namely the full funding to you crane republicans will get a border that is not going to be completely open and democrats are some how blocking at this the melt down apparently took place on the evival critical testpote in the senate ionm one hundred and ten at billion dollar emergency spending bill and not only made at clear the measure would fail but severely dim the prospects for any by partisan agreement soon a vote to block aid would spotlight flagging you us resolve at a critical time in you cranes war against presienet in puten's russia we areabouts to abandon you crane said senator christmarif you walt what you could do is you could just allow ther to be borders security you could do that ivery an understand why this remotely controversial werer security by the way is being called for by democrats down at the border it is amazing that basically democrats in the senate are attached to ther open borders nonsense and they are willing to scuttle their own support for you crane aid senetal insy gramsis count me in on you crane if we oren't help get you rane and pouten gets away with this you will be in a war with mato i got all that teu'll get a robusts re publican vote for you crane isral ans i want if you ave real borders security but apparently the're not doing anything on the border chuck shumer is now suggesting that if the buill fails because the border that is on republicans well here is the thing either jobide wants the aid or it does not want the ate either you thi it is important for you crane out to collapse to the russians and for isral t o winnang goza or he does not if he does not thing its that important then nom i suppose the trucksumer is right and you will try to blame the republicans for it an thing's important maybe heu might try youknow shoring up the border here is tructume mor trying toblame republicans for it is obviously a democratic failure here let us remember three things as we move forward one how important you crane is it is a turning point in western civilization this is a historic moment and this cannot be delayed any longer wa zolinsky by the way could not make it to are said something happens at the last minute to our briefing at three but we will here and you will hear particularly from mar orner who knows this well how desperate you crane is for the aident that the president has proposed but it is vital vital second if this fails because a boarder that is not a by partisan failure that is a failure of the republicans and the republican leadership the only reason they added boarder was because tha lot of members of their hard right said they want boarder but a lot of those same members are not gan avote you crane no matter what is there i mean first of all that is not true fers wellis not true republicans oure saying why not add border to the package you have by partizan support for the bill republicans support the israel aid more than democrats to democratsport you craneod more than republicans to the idea is the compromise middl is going to be all those things plus border and trucktsumer's balking at that what is the high priority on leaving the border open why why exactly does he dust for the one to leave the board open this is why peuple are suspicions of what exactly are the motives over here oka in just one second we are goin to get to jobide makan extraordinary comment with regard to the twenty twenty four election we will get to

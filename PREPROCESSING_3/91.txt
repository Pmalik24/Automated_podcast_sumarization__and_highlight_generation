int tell you two stories the first story is from my days usea lay when i'snan undergrad students you are going back twenty years now the muslim student association in organization that it has routinelys supported commas and hasbela idealogically and otherwise put out a student newspaper at the time called all to leav that sudent newspaper joked in te run up to nine eleven about renaming the newspaper all talaban and making osoma ben lawden editor in chief they also again in rhetoric supported hamas cause what thit thedn't makany bones about any of this when i sought to wrighte about this stuff asnan undergrad for the useal ideaily bruin which was the campuss newspaper i was told such columns would not be run those were the only columns i ever wrote for the usala daily bruin and this back and two thousand two thousand one that the daily bruin ever refused outright to run story number to is about a decate togo mo weven't ive visited london it happene be boxing day an nowingthing about boxing they but y turns out that everything in london was basically closed everything except for madam tosos wax museum why we had nothing better to do my wife and i went there and inside the wax museum there were te usual bythe of famous figures in the final room there was a wax of alberdinsten took some funny photoes and then we turned around and what we saw was three young muslims to women and a man there were also taking pictures with the instein wax there were strangling the instein wax well it occurred to me that perhaps that might have something to do with the fact that instein was pretty obviously jewish but i brushed it off because i'm a good westerner now maybe these guys jst hated the general theory of relativity or something well at the time the museum also concluded with a wax of at off hitler now this was not a wax at my wife nit particularly wanted a photoeff but it turns out that these young muslims did this time they got reallybodybody with the wax they put their arms around hittler theyt post smilingly with hitler multi culturalism is a failure it has always been a failure multi culturalism the suggestion that all cultures are at root the same and quolity and beauty and truth it is a lie that lie is dangerous that lie leads to moral blindness as we have ben discussing the last few days it leads to a trocities murdered babies raped women kidnappings beheadings it leads to death it leads to carnage but multi culturalism does not just excuse evil abroad it brings it home multi culturalism suggest that we in the west in the united states thou cav france germany in the rest of the western world weave to open are borders after all if we do not were racist if you believe that all cultures are morally equivalent tat all cultures are equally meritorious the only reason then to deny some dy entry is races and that make you a racis there is a reason tat multi cultural advocates ore open borders advocates it is because thei're logic demands it what difference would it make to you if migrants are ariving from the gosci trip or from ti on underneath all cultures are the same well that is ridiculous and we will know it is ridiculous we have all been afraid to sayed for deckades even in countries where the leadership has recognize the failures of multi culturalism broadly speaking that same leadership has been totally unable to speak the truth about migration and when they do they are chastized by the media this is why the media has pretended a wait is proportionate criminal activity from middle eastern and africand migrans to europ to recognize the truth would be awkward it might seem races because were not alowed to point out that is not about race it is about culture and not all cultures are the same we are seeing this shyness to day across the world and the effects of it as fundamentsless muslems rally in favor of comas a terrogroup ther's slaughtered thirteen hundred jews in western countries they are joined by useful idiots on the radica west who believe in a coalition of the dispossesse they can help terrdown the institutions of the west hens all the talk recently by left wingers about mass murder of jews as just decoglinization question are these people we actually want in our country it is a serious question these are not people who are protesting for a palistinian state or even protesting israely policies these are people who are protesting in favor of a terroriust government that just committed the worst atrocities against jus since the holicost and there are thousands of such protestors in the west because multi culturalism is a failure we can pretend its not but it is and what we are watching right now breaking out from london to new york from our campasses to the streets of parist is a break down in the social fabric of the west it is a break down brought about by a failure of confidence in our own values an unwillingness to declare the superiority of those values now were feeling that in my community directly to day that is because comas has now called for a global day of rage in the middle of a war that they initiated because they decided to slaughter civilians in their bedst instead of directing all of their resources toward helping gosin civilians which is what a normal government might do they have decide that does matter at all instead what they are doing is they are calling for a world wide day of gehod that is for today theyre referring to the day as the aloxa flood according to brightbart the middle east mmmedia research institute memory which has been amazing work for years largely ignordyouve seen them on this show but a lot of other shows have not played their stuff all they do literaly all they do all they long as they watch comoste v and they watch palstinian arebt v and they watch all gezera in arabic and then they translate that stuff in tey put in on line memory reported comasasand quod we declar next friday the friday of the aloxa flood as a day of general mobilization in our arab anislonic world and among the free people of the world it is a day to rally support offer aite and participate actively it is a day to expose the crimes of the occupation isolated and foil all hit sagressive schemes it is a day for sacrifice heroism dedication and to earn the honor of defending the first keebla of muslims the third holiest mosque and the assention of the trusted messenger we call upon the free people of the world to mobilize and solidarity with our palistonian people and in support of their just cause and legitimate rates to freedomit dependents return and self determination they have called more specifically for protest they have suggested that palistinians rise up within judea and semaria in the called westbank they have call on arab citizens visrael to attack the state they have called on arabs in these surrounding countries to attack the wors of israel and these protests that they are calling for across the globe they are not just protests they have called for action i part of a global day of gehod well this is resulted in law enforcemen having to step up patrols on gewish houses of worship and business es according to enby sy news local an federal lawn forcemen t agencies a cross the united states are stepping up their patrols of jewish houses of worship jewish on businesses is rally diplomatic buildings i can tell you the amount of worry in the jewish community in the united states is extremely high whid people keeping their kits home from school to day because theire worrie about the global day of gehod and those worries are not empty we seen mass protest in a huge number of cities rit your re i leve in south flord them a bunch of protests lout of these protests have devolved into some level of chaos if any counter protesters show up the the attempt t go international with the sort of stuff is a new thing usually when they call for a day of rage its usually something that happend specificallyin the madeleast now they are tempting to broaden all this out how seriously is and why pety taking this wapparently the unwipety cancelled all training officer all training for officers on thursday order the entire force to be in uniform and on patrol the officials at the police partment said that they will ave additional securedy at large gatherings cultral sites and houses of worship all personnel haft report in lasantualists in uniform as well things are are getting very ugly in a lot of tese major cities apparently none of the online threats are specific incredible at this point but out of an abundance of caution again their schools in new york that are actively shutting down there saying theire no credible threts but i i do not know what what you ould expect jews to believe at this pont about a credible threat considering it was the greatest slaughter of jews since again the hollicoss a lot of jews are are very very worried to day some jewish schools i mention in new york have closed the worries are not empty the worids are not empty ad the reason that that the words are not empty is because of what his happening here in the united states as well as abroad sugges tick of quick example apparently according to audisy dotcom and tenten winds a nineteen year old woman attack to twenty four yearold mail is raly studen with a stick outside of columbia universities main library amid division on campass regarding the israel commas war the police responded two ireport of the assault in morning sideheights outside butler library at sixten piamon wednesday the attack occurred when the victim confronted the woman after watching her tear down flires displaying the names and pictures of his rally kidnot by hamass last weeken the victum who hask to be referred two anonymously for fair safety included say sufferedtom miner bruises but apparently what happened is that a group was hanging up posters of the people whoare crurntly being held hostage and the suspect ripped the posters down and when they said why ar you doing that the suspect than attack the people woere puttng the posters up ay might think that is an isolated incident you may they lall the sort of tuff happen time campas all the time except for the fact that what we see in broadskellon and universities are the very center of it is a green red allions and by green red a lions here on talking bout hommass green and 'm talking about far left red and that allionce has been on going for a very l ong time on campasses is now bled over into our regular politics and into sort of daily life for an amy horwits he went down to the east village of new york emember this is not the gossiscript is not h he least this is the east village of new

is is what honestly is just at t you need context you need new ants or perhaps whe have a lot of very very evil people who belive o very lot of evil things living here in the wast becaue the west is

obviously all of this it is creating an enormous amount of of uncertainty in the economic spher in hthe uncertaintin the economic spheere is going to dominate for the next couple of years if not longer than that one way for you to actually hederbats on that sort of stuff is to take a look at birch gold birchgold will help you at least diversify into assets precious metals in calberchgold to

only ratical muscle mactivity in the uninted states but also for generalize left wing activity in the uninted states farlesif the green red access the comoss comminist ine the comassfar left acis is going to form an li an toyusly's going down campset's precisely overseing we have much footage pouring in of protestors at at various universities demonstrating the moral evil i it is possible go through all that bet will tart with tha columbia i cure som protestors at columbia i in shouting from the iver to the sea palestine will be free that slogan of cours as a genicidlslogan men to destroy literally everyjew in the region and as wee seen from comeoss we know exactlo the means that meu's the fullskalls laghter of jews and those are americans presumably who are shouting that in the middle of the columbia university campis nowr member es are campasses theare deeply word about microgressions if you say that a boys boy in girl is girl then you may ave mite grogress to the point where you will be disciplined by the campus offices but if you shout from the river to te sea palestine will be free that directly the same week that thirteen undred jues were murdered in their bads well then that is that' just you nont complex mural mulons because multi culturalism gang itto different culture it isthe different type of thinking and we have to explain we have weeft understand that really things are very nuons and cycle of violency very very complex now you can feel people reverting backt their priors i set a couple of days ago that people have revelations about politics in hot moments in moments of clarity and then the immediately reverts the prires to can feel it happening in real time and already the shock of fact of peoplewho are protesting in favor of the people who just murdered and burn babies already the shock affecto that is wearing away because we are going already can feel it happening we are already going back to ore western priors which is everyone is reasonable ever have a conversation eve all cultures are basically equivolent everyone wants to be free and it is not true it is not true the people are shouting from the river to the sa palestine wi'll be free those people are not friends of the west those are enemies of the west those are people who hate the west just as much as they hate israel those are people are fully willing to give their full backing to a murrous genicidel antiy jewish group and then we all kind of rushedoff because we do not want t see we do not wan to see the blinders are riht back on can feel it happening in real time yon feel it happening people want their priors to be true and those priors are comforting the prior that antiseitism oitiv vestige of the past will never have a holicostican does not matter we just saw holicoss lo vislencs against jhus an israel jews killed for being jews it does not matter where in a recontexturalize it and pretend away the reason that hat happen organ manufacture reasons why it happen ore going to say that the jews are just as bad as the notsies that they face that is al are going to say an can feel it happening in real time because it otherwise to look at the specter of thousands tungue thousands people across the united states rallying infavor of a group that is as bad or worse than all cid up might be somewhat disquieting and might call insequestion some of our priors about who we should let into the country or about which cultures are equivalent to other cultures and which cultures are abjectly manifestly inferior there is no such thing as an inferior race races well i'm in it is not clear exactly where the boundaries are between races race is agenetic aspect that that has to do with facial structurer maybe has to do with point of origer it has to with your skinco none of that is relevant when it comes to human intrpersonal relations the only thing that really matters is culture culture of course is how you act it is the way that you think and all of that is invironmentally inbibed that does not come from your race that distinction is crucial that distinction es really important saying that certain cultures are worse than other cultures is simply saying that some ways of thought and ways of acting are worse than other ways of thought and ways vacting which is obviously true unless you are an idiot and you see a light mass protest people scrimming into foda into fid into fidameans uprising an this is a call for more pallistinians to murderjus obviously i and this a pretty mass ralley at my almamater again folks if you have a kid who is getting ready for colleg yes should think very seriously about whether you wish to send them st one these darbage and doctrnation centers and instead maybe you non't get them ajob hure is at what it looked it you seella yesterday but th wha you can see how many thse holoering masks either aring massnocks es eir frait cobed there is ther roaring masks is becaus they do not wish to be identified why don' they wish to be i dentifiged with their cause because they know t that caused eople that 's particularly true four the a for the members of radical muslin communities who are are not saying this stuck just for showed thei'r lot of can a fellow traveller liberals ofre trying to demonstrate their bonifities an the same with these top bunch a more ons glot in the street rallying with the perverse organization black lives matter in order to demonstrate their bonifieties their fellow liberal friendh shing a lot of that at these campses that would be the red part of the green red a lions her but the people are truly committed those itle ones are covering their faces they's a more of these protest on college camps is in just one sacond to ti got tell you my phone coverag it matters a loc to me these days have been spending literally every moment on the phone the phone covered that i trust pure talk as pure talk happens to be ray company they speak to they they have quar values that are a line with the values of the daily wire oure veterans gave everything to protect the nation and puretock understands the sacrifices that they have made they sent ambitious golds wo liminate ten million dollars in militaryes at by veterans day they cannot do it alone they need your help when you switch to pure tolks lightning fast fives you network hey'll do not it a portion of every new order to this noble caws yot can make a real difference just by choosing superior self onet service pure talks plans starte to twentybucks month offering a limited talk tacked more day to and moble hotspock just go to puretolk dock comslash af puro make that switch today let us rold together show are unwavering suport for american veterans ther's at puretolk tock com slash afpuro switch to pure talk today again they oppen to have amazing coveradge which is the reason i love pure talk i'm not surelhy durban a week in my life i ben on iphone as much of this week pure tocks been making it happen han or pure tock tock com slash af puros which to pure tock todaits the right move also again they are share your values it is the american way i ga america's college campses they have not just been dominated by a by fools tey're dominated by incredibly dangerous people these are not these are not people who share your values or american vallues the here is a protest at georget mason university here is what they look in case again here what they ar re a chancing whor their chancing is they have got tans we have got hangliders rory to the resistance fighter i tout your reference to temosmembers nd cantin in on resisted on on hanglirs in tin e a music festival and mowe down nearly three hundred people that is them it george maksing university openly cheering that againt pretend pretend as much as you want this is what these people believe this is what these people believe you do not believe they what one o the amazing things about the arrogance of the west is that they say it right out loud to your face and your now do not believe you do not bel it must be something else must be alterior motives com mossis one murder all the jews and read is but what is they really want yeat these people shouting that they theyre in fact glory to the resistance fighters who just mow down dan'e festival attendeves and ever is it not but what are they really one is really bout the complexities of the midalest isen and chit lot chin stroking these days lot people thing at all mygostrel youknow this doesit this conflect does have long history nellison we'n go through the history you are mi you to page i've an entire forty five minute explanation of the history in we aregn put on an ups o this weekend that explains frome them miths about all of this but that is olit t is about is that murdering jews and they are in favor of it up or down on the murderof jews n yes and relic we doft believe you i'm sorry you say you wnt a murder jusebul what i think you really want what youreally want is a better economic way of life isthey well if they wanted a better economic way of life may be they would have pursued that or put their focus there but i notice tat's not where the're putting any of their focus but by thway have gover noticed a the the dramatical lack of palsing anadvocates rushing to the macrophones to conemas an you noticed that just a little bit it all now it is a mazing in the united states whenever there is any sort of herrific shooting that is committed by somebody who ise even vaguely associate with the political clause everybody vaguely associat wit that political clause comes down condemns it of course because they want make clear they are dissociated from that evil have you seen any one coming out in being man that that camas grupe they are truly evil and you we are not associated with them they are truly evil and the answer is no the answer is no because again the cause is not a territorial dispute iszro could not give way land enough absen it is own destruction that would please these people they could not and by the way that entails that mens death of every jeuin th area for all the talk about one what is really a partstied lemmeg point out just a quick fact twenty percent of zrael's population is arab you not i noticed zero per cent of gazas population is jewish zero per cnt of any of the palising an ruled areas in the westbank are jewish zero presents of jordan is jewish zero presents of egypt is jewish zero per cent of awron effectively speaking is jewish the tiny jewih population zero presents a zerias jewish ero present of lebonon is jewish zero presents as at y arabia is jewish m weird weird that it just strange how that worked strange but do not worry it is it is its israel that is the problem and agan they say it right to your face they say it right they are not hiding the ball is the part that is it that is just astonishing to me an will never cease to be astonishming they do it right in front of you they say it right to your face and everybody in the media gos now no wed now now could not now the protest continued across the country aristok ers on a tat university had a big protest yesterday again in favor of commass i gan wh gn size thiss protest i've a question are these people who a who are marching in favor of comass that you would want working for your company serious question you get to choose yet to chos seems to me that supporning comoss a pretty good barrier to entry for out for people you will earning a solid living at chaseman han an bank or should be youniversity of washington had a mass procomas protest as as well here is it what that looked se as is dom antifa joined together with i howstinian advocates of course in mysap house naming fromss advocates and remember all the talk about how commosis separable from the movement a the movment is not trying to seppera comas from it i notice just the thing i notice it have you heard a single call for comasso turn over the hostages for many these people any call any buler of ourse not the do not care theyre perfectly happy for guish hostages to be murdered in tunnels do not care thnk if i sh they do not the do not care whether are come o whether gosen civiliansty has there been any call for because you rit israel set they turn out the water nd power and isrel said by thewy well turn it back on if you give us our hostages and everegos how could they turn off the water and power while i notice that the conditional statement if you turn the hostageis over we will turn back on the water and power and it seems not and onreasonable man since you are holding babies and women and holocoss survivers that sem by the way you are holding a dosin americans i it seems not the most un but has one protestor said that come oss might want to turn thse people over not not one has one protest or agnowledge that ofe commoss would would stop all of this if they if they would turn into legur goverment which is what israel wanted them to do for twenty years after handing over the entire gosistript to them that none of this would ave happen that civilian deaths are on the hands who of course not are there any demands on the governing body in the gosstrip which is comemoss to protect civilions no of course not because the goal is the destruction of israel and if they cannot do it by running into israel murdering every civilian then thy will atthempt to do it by relieving the insternational legitimacy of israel by planting babies directly in front of military targetes that is precisely what they are doing right now again these canpasses which are suppose s place is of safety and and openness and diversity whel when it comes to jewish students feeling yoon just t a well threaten by people whoarn out to fending mass murder of jews then of course there there is nothing to be done here jewis students a university of washington witnessing tis prohomas rally and being told by the authority's wellyonow that is just t way that goes out listen freespeech is indeed free speech also freesbeech has never obtaind at these campasses i've ein band from half these campasses for for trying to just speak about things egonomics thes tese are places were again if you use the wrong pronoun they will put you in t in the goologu but if you say jews should be murdered on mass and it is justified then if a jew gets upset that is obviously that freesb that is whent that is wone the freespeech bone kicks back in interesting interesting how they are standar kicks back in the minute the jews are the victims ho h wi gain it siys it remember it say im it is a michrowhy would jews livin fere after thirteen hundred of them were slaughtered and then all of their advocates come out on campas rallying for the slaughterers why would they be afraid in in the world of microgressions im i notice that theire cern microgressions begase do not seems to kept macro gressions rather they do not seem to care very much about at all now get back to this question of how much support thes commass have in these called moghterate palistinian communety are propalsinian commting the answers i'm still looking for the people whoart wildly attempting to dos dissociate from comossi tis point where are they i really where are they ofn givig an example there is a palsing namerican activist and human rights attorney names ot nura ericott who is on with katy sur them i the megia by thewey are desperately sorching for a palistinian advocate who will dissociate fromass and say the commass is utterly un justified a garbage organization and terr organization they cannot find anybody they cannot find anybody why cause it turns out that these folks do not think you they do not think you they do not think it is bad they do not think its inarguably bad to kill babies they do not i i do not want else to tell you they are saying it to your face i'm not saying it they are saying it how mantimes you they have to say before heu believe it is i din meat characterizing what they are saying it is them saying it here is i a moderate palsinan american actiist and human rghts attorney the is what human rights attorneys do as they worry deeply about the legitimacy o im of commass they worry deeply about how much a comss was provoked to this i this nor aricott saying that israel is responsible for all of it or the imag is that we have been seein for the passix days both inside of gasa and the amages of what happened to theisais citizens both have been got rasays difficult to watch it hit makes it feel there is that and intractability to this fight as hey've been studying thist what what can happen next i taiyes are are notaint got what chaan got renchan in i c is but they are also preven ible in it is an prevenible nasichocities the condition that the largest crimein e condition that sustains the violence is the prime of a puietit in te pli that i se that israel over ses and that the united states has been the primary supporter of an military pinatal and diplomatic support i'l get by the way nora arcot again a human right to torney she is very much in favor of human riht she says the commocity political moment here sheas explaining it is a political oman gids is not terrogrup thet murders civilians and ames rockets at babies and murders children in their bad and rabes women there political movement do not you see these are the moderates these the moderates whereare the moderates got where are they i onsly where are you is rals en searching for te moderates for forty years is ral does not want to govern two million palisinians in the gossistript they do not they wanted not to govern it strongly they handed it over to a fong terrorist group is ral wants strongly not to govern thery is gunene they hand it over to yas or arapat in actual terrorist who actively shot jews that is how much they do not want o govern it by the way not just israel i've mention this before is ral tried to turn over the gossistript to egypt you ron't intr ea your sai the i no we do not want them are you out of your mind they tried to turn over places gunins who jordanian control the yourans oure you kitting me no way is it but don mory commossel ake git political grup where the moderates where are they where are they she turns out that all your crap about the piece process it requires a piece partner but if there is no piece parcy you are can a wish castor way into a piece parter it are not gon to work again these are the moderates the moderates say the commoss is a political movement and a unitit governm ant comoss can say whether or not they cannot or cannot stat is not the ission because the alternativive what your sain is that we destimate hama and ar hav to reming eas amas is a political movement compries of palitins who believe in a freedom struggle for it they are not marly the sensational images that you sa the members the o hamas that you saw recently ray a just want to make clearo people that these are not mosters to rige from underground just wanting to terrories is rallies these are young men who have only grow upgon up under sates for the paseventeen years who have been subjects to four large skill offensive that have bon them in their homs that have tarteted metics and hospitals and water supplies that ave refew whose they remember there not monsters the people who rabed women and kin not babies and kill them they are not monster she says she says it by the way what pres it ithe the contect free insanity of what she sang here they have been te victims have grounded what way pray tell what might have proceeded those ground in cursions that israel had to fight who men what were the aerial bombardment that israel had to use in the gossip what may have proceeded that oh was it thousands of rockets falling on his raily cities might it have been that the gall of these people in the media by it because tey do not want t believe it they cannot believe it the refuse to believ that it unrminds their entire world if there are people who have cultures that are inferior it under mines ther entire i'm sorry any culture that calls commos freedom fighters and talks about the victimization of people murder babies in their cribs that is an inferior culture and if you cannot say that there is something wrong with you but thereis somethng wong it the media the thing that is wrong ih th media is they hate their own culture much that they cannot even deal with the idea that there are superior and infero cultures and theyve surrendered and when you surrender you lose by the way again not chest a problem for fraur media it is also problem internationally the number of mass protest that we are seeing all around the world in favorocoms should be truly terrifying to westerners who actually care about western values will get to that in a moment according to a recent report plan paren hod continues to rake an billions in tax par funding and private contributions and yet prolife organizations are winning the harts and minds of their clienttell while plan parenhood continues to rake in he bigbux the number of abortions performd yeur over year is slowly decreasing in short we are winning the fight to end abortion butt there is a long way to go this is why masho

strip since two thousand and six it is now two thousand and twenty three commass is in control of the gosses strip commas is holding hostages commass is in control of its own civilians those civilians live under the rule of the commass governments in the gossas strip those civilians are commasses responsibility it is a war crime to put your civilian in front of military targets it is a war crime to shield your rockets with children it is a war crime to hold hostages it is a war crime to put hostages in a war's own to protried to prevent bamie all of these are war crimes every ounce of blood that is build every building that is taken down every ugly photo u see from gasa is on commass it is that simple there is no duality about this what have i been unclear please explain the flaw in this particular thinking i'm waiting naturally the a the comas advocates they if they 've now decided that they have the grees an international wolich is exciting i alexander o caso crotes one of a most briliant expositors of international law being bartender and all ashea she says this is collected shes talking about the cut off of water and powe r she the gossistrep is really energy miniser cats he said no electricals which will beturned on no water hydra will be open no field truccll enter until the se real thy object he is are returned home well again seems a conditional statement at this point aelse he could say what they are holding a bunch of americans in abject care probably some of them at partyban raped if not all some of them in tortured many of them are proably deat aready but is shek calling for the return ofthe hostages of course not of course not instaid she saying that america has to draw line what the is ralies what the is railies the real war crime is israel fight ind come oss yeh she is a genius folks this is this is your rising starn than emocratic party slow clap for eu genius sis who decided to make her the face your party aror responsibility is to the stibility and the security of the region that means being able to suhorrc not support yet is real in its defenive compasi right in it na' not to port is real not know contec in butdy want maymn leafentyo that the notvy hase reponsibility to nsure a countibility to human righ to prevent the etniclansing o colistinion and to insure that horrors do not happen in the means o victims who do not want ther traty use to justify further violence and injustice she is going to speak on behalf of the dead jews in cfar aza she gon taspeak on behalf of the dead jews in stherote she s goin t speak on behalf of te grand parents who watch their grand children be murdered in cold blood she sbeak on their behalf iii want i want every democrat who is defended this i i want them explaining what she ment by that i want them explain iu ont herreplain what she meant what d shou mean when she just said that in the name of that they dn't want their vict theyn't want their victim hood to be used to justify this you are speking on behalf of the dead bodies in far betry that is way in ke boots bery that is that is for your speaking on behalf of let me explain something that is not how international law works geneva conventions article twenty nine the party to the conflict in whose hands protected persons may be is responsible for the treatment accorded to them by its agents irrespective of any individual responsibility which may be incurred when come ot in other words for those who cannot read and do not speak legal what that means is that if you are the governing party and you have civilians and you put them in front of military targets that is your fault article twenty eight the presence of a protected person that' be a civilian may not be used to render certain points or areas in mune from military operations which is precisely whut left wing more ons or claiming today that basically murderd jews plas i hide behind children means immunity that iswhat hey're claiming today that is the formula i murder jews pluss hide behind a gosen civilian i am now immune that is what they are tempting to claim seneva convention three no prisoner of war may at any time be sent to or detain in areas where he may be exposed to the fire of the combats on nor may his presence be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations that town familiar do not put constitues and linifire which is exactluiththy be doing or how about this icy cy statue nutilizing the presence of a civilion are other protecteve person to render certain points areas or military forces immune from military operations constitutes a war crime an international armed conflicts oabout the nineteen seventy seven additional protical one article fiftey one seven says quote the parties to the conflict shall not direct t movement of the civilion population ar individual civilions in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attax or to shield military operations you may hav noticed tht that is precisely what commoss is doing israel is currently telling people to leave and commosces crontly telling them to stay to use them as human shields according to the geneva conventions artical fifty three any destruction by the occupying power of real or personal property belonging individualy or collectively to private persons is prohibited except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations which is what is happening right now i mean i it is clear under an international law that a country has the ability to defend itself and t is also clearinder international lowth humorae violator is the person who stations babies in front of its rockets but i can i cannot get over ao se saying that i cannot i cannot get over her saying that done she speaks in the ame ofthe victims to leave commaselone the there are no words there are there are no words by the way hert her garbage rout ethnac clensing is a talking point that i justlact tive bunk e ilet ilect to clean the supero fast this talking point the palcinian a the palcing an population in nineteen forty eight which is the earthy establishment ofthe state o israel in that region in the in the region of gazat israel today juday and semaria all of it one poin threy seven million here are te populations to day in tese particular areas in the gazistrip two million in juday and smaria t the call lus bank three million inside israel one point six million another words there are in this area one pointhree seven million palistinians livin in nineteen forty eight to day there are almost seven million living in these areas that is a really bad job of ethnic clinsing i've notice however you noughtelse i notas the number of jews who are living in aroch they are tens of thousands of jus livingin arock in ineteen forty eight nomany live there now zero how many jews we are living in aron in nineteen forty eght hundreds of thousands unomany to living there now zero how many jews were living in jordan in egypt in any of these places before nineteen forty eight the answers a lot how manearling ther nou zero but whit happen historically speaking the state of israel the tiny seat of israel with barely a military took in all of them some eight hundred thousand jews were kicked out of arab countries moslen countries in nineteen forty seven nineteen forty eight and israel took in all of them meanwhile you not the arabs did with te these with these refugy populations they put them in ref gecapt and they left them there for seventy years for seventy years and this is why jake tapper yesterday whose pointing out i i notice that tot muslim countries are not doing anything t help gosand civilians all that is a shock that is a shock except unless you have read a book here is jake tapper yesterday what about the innocent a palistonians can they get out riht the women the children the elderly how can they get out thatthat still has not been figured out now egypt does not want to open the rof acrossing they refusing t they thedoldt right egypt geordan i mean cutter theua salty ray be all these countries that prepare thtthat the talk about how much they care about the palistonians they couldn help right now they could help the palistonians tescape they could help me they coan say o chey stop boy and we will go in there and we will we will we will help gaza lhat the come of thriving society they they could do all sorts of things they have money by the way i've heard that ye ye but ere are then wheree they is where they usually are which is ou know generally on the side lines an and pretty on my opiclay thinking about themselves plus they wat all lay caloss to go away ofm dhe're not takin any again egypt you loke that map again egypt right tdhere on the them wit that rofa crossing right there unite egypt said no way nowayin hel in fact not only that iem sure some pictures of the egypt gotaborder this woat the egypt gotabord lookslike you think a that that that terrible that terr separation wall the one that was breached by camas that is that is terrible i'm going to show you now what the wall looks between gosa in egypt oh look it is a two layer giant wall that is amazing who could have foreseen such a thing look at that it is a jgiant two layer wall backed by military also along that there are am there are tunnels massive tunnels haid been built and massive underground barriers that are twenty meters deep to stop those tunnels from entering into these fign i desert which is controlle by egypt the barrier is made of bomb proof superstrength steel which cannot be cut or melted a yah that that said that is a thing that that is ha thing that i notice as far as where the mslen countries are the answers where they always are using the palistonians as a tool for their own revenge while simultaneously denying thementry to their countries again in nineteen forty eight seven hundred thousand palistinians were either leaving or expelled i'm clear how many left preemptively because all eire poside you' broken down and forty haven forty eight and how many were kicked out but seven hundred thausand palistinians leave or are expelled zero are taken in by the ar countries zero and it then happened it turns out the palistonias to ended up another aereas there are subsequently kicked out by our countries in nineteen seventy dordn expeled twenty thousand palistinians and killed three thousand of them by the way in nineteen eighty two during the lebonon war the pialo was completely expelled and ends up in tunis in nineteen ninety one is the this one that nobody remembers but it did happen during the gulf war and the begining oft gulfwar there are four hundred thousand pallicinians were living in toate four hundred thousand during the course of the gulf war and after they number went to zero thy were kicked out they want to jordan nobody cares because how arab street other arabs to muslemstred other mslems do not care about that non't careabout that what we care about is tit if jews are victimize my muslintarror then jws have tobasedly let themselves be victimize and the only good jew is a submissive jew seems to be the the world's perspective on these particular issues all too often this of course is out why the world has decided immediately that the civilian casual teesind gosar brough about entirely bac camossit could be ended to marro by comos all of that i is on the jews not tolly ben at the former prime minister of the state of israel he was on an sky news and whe was confronted with this dumb argument and here is his answer and what about those potestinians in hospital who a or life supportand babies and incubatos wos et lifes suppotin incuba to havs be turned off because these radies ave cut the power togasa are you seriously keep on asking me about calestinian civilians what is what is wrong with you ave you not sen what happened were sighting noxes we do not target them no the world can come and bring them anything tey want if it you want to bring them melctricity i recan feet electricity or water ta my enemies if anyone else wants that is fine were not responsible this is the point a to te ien jou wana tr o men o ei a o a in aa nos i wor are youin not not i o i fother on loar you ere this en is a loer rover e an mysho and i am asking the questions youre raising your racilike ao askou and we have already people we already ston plase let me finish wov lready to sthing wi t you co o i want to to you showing mone syou wetrome to become weare not shame on you is nothinn a got an wit cin con t conversation atat veryserious situation here and you are recously useli eoul for immediately and agan an again absolute em always in there i o in cre responsible because i can tell you that when the you ka absoluring orestan was fighting the notsees through world word to no one asse what is going oninterest them that happens to be a fact no se a lot of i do not se a lot of the ankers on sky news shedding great tears over over all that is it happened along time ago but i'l just point out at this oine an for forgeta out world wor im and if you look lok a world or two in the amount of civilian death that was incurred by the allies in the defeat of noty germany and an fastious japan you are talking well in accis of a million people who are kill the fire bombing of drasden killed tens of thousands people the firebomming of tokyo killed hundreds of thousands of people in that that that why there were military target thei'r military target and now we have the luxury of looking back and going all wall that was bad maywe should ave done that may be shouldnav gone to harder when b oms were falling on london that are not the mentality but put that aside that was thos eighty years ago let us let us go more modern during the afganistand war that the united states fought nafganistand at least fifty thousand civilians were killed at least fifty thousand fifty not one not to fifty and tht was not an accistential threats to the united states a terrorism was a threats to the people of the united states commass is an exestential threat to israel especially because if commas were to emerge from this un skathed casballa would come in from the north an everyone knows that if casballa comes in by the wayoure looking i newclear war that is the real git is the international of this njust one second because what we are attempting to avoid here by allowing israel and i say we is the united states when we are attempting to avoid here is a very small regional conflict developing into a gobl war includin nuclear weapons i'llexplain that in one second but just to get back to the civilian point the number of dead civilians in a rac due to the arrak invasion of te united states approxinally two hundred thousand that is not a contry very far away that is not next store to the united states but put that aside how many dead civilians are there in libia thanks to the libian bomming campaign undertaken by the abomi ad ministration at least one thousand three hundred how many dead civilians we are there in the icis war at least one thousand four hundred ay those are just wards involving th united states when you look t dead civilians in the middle east theres onley lest five hundred thousand in syria in te last few years alone no one seems to care mwe are why i wonder why whereis all the human rights outpoin where is where is all the woe the huwad the huean cry by the anchors at sky news where are they where are they they are gone they do not care i notice they only care about one time one time there is only one time they care and that is what jhse defend themselves when jews defend themselves that is that is hen they get very up tight that' when it is i and does not matter those jews are taking more precautions to save civilians in gaza then the ruling power of gaza it does not matter it is the jews fault the jews have to go back to status quoante they have do theyve delict their wouinds absorbed their loss in wait for the next time the jews get slaughter in teir beds because that is that is what chose ought to do that is what jhose ought to do an order to justify that yeve to come up with them some sort of of moral self justification the way lot of people have done it is by a involving themselves in propagantistic efforts to deceive themselves as i said before everyone wants to go bact to their priors and going back tour priors the moral equivalence prior tht was always stupid it has been stupid for forty years the best way to do that is o just a ny though it is happeningis actually happenin and best way to do that is to pretend they y'r being lie to in take a quick example yesterday i treated out a photo and i shur an on the show it was a photo put out by the prime minister of israel yesterday by the first responders in cvar aza it was a picture of a baby burned to death itwas hideous horrible picture i did not want shoto but we have to know the nature of our enemies in the same way that we made a huge mistake as a country in the united states tby not showing ona loop what happened on on eleven whn we barred that from our tevis we blinded ourselves to what our enemies are and then we'e reminded of it every often when yeu know they take over a country i've ganistand and murrer tends of thousands of people and blow up a munch american soldiers then we are minded of it but we put ourselves to sleep people want goaback to sleep to what ar they do yesterday the community noted my tweat and claimed that the photo was a i generated the photol is obviously not a i generated if clearly's not a i generated and whenton a communty notes anyway and people who are gullable and who wish to both sides this thing es that is always the easiest position in any given conflict it is very very easy to say both sides both sides the probem is that this particular case it is pretty obvious at aim' both sides but if you want to both sides this thing what you have to say is the atrocities were not bad theatrocities do not really matter should we really be concerned about the atrocities and the community noted n obviously this is why again the propagand to wors commoss is fighting them right now and there a lot of gullable dupes out there who ant a believ if you want to believe i can only attribute your your desperation to believe in moral equivalents to one of two things one lack of understanding stupidity or too e actually hate jusin y just one and and you are perfectly fine withthe mingslauhter ifor versually everyone i'm no say one but there a lot of thus out there therea lot of tudes out the're many more than i would have thought that is for dam sure and meanwhile what is going on here with the united states statesioning battle carriers in the in the mediterranean sy i have een abouch visolationists who re why is the united states o en etting involved okay let me explain this once again for those ho are slow what the united states wishes to prevent its being involved in a warthe wall you avoid being involved in war is by demonstrating that if somebody does get involved an ware youare going to destroy them youare going to send them forward in the case of the uranean mullas to the to the stone age that is how you get them to not to the war you knon't invites war in themidliash weakness it te prevents war knowing that there will be a bom tt desends on your roof in five minutes if you start the thing the real risk for israel in not finishing off commoss raght now is that this is taken as a sign of weakness as it certainly would be by cusbela cusbela is a far more dangerous terrors grup than commoss commossisa dangerous terrascrupt thay is prove it by killing thirteen hundred jews cusbela currently has over a hundred thousand highly sophisticated rockets aimed directly at the north of israel estimates suggest that were husblout to fire all of those rockets would not be talking about thirteen hundred dedjuws you'ld be talking about somewhere between twenty and thirty thousand dead jews day on if csbela gets in israel will have no choice but to unleach the air forts if they enleash the air force they are not going to be worried that what about civilian casualte's at all they are simply going to have to evicerates the entire south of lebanon and topele the regime in lebanon that supports csbela if that happens they areon undoubtedly gets in and to syria if that happens and israel's now face with a with a full war in the north combined with a war in the south bease they will not hif defeated commas that is the predicate if israel is force to the wall the possibility of newclear exchange is extremely high that is why it is very important that the united states provide the material aid to israel and that they also dissuade husbellaw from getting in it is why drobide has been warning cusbela not to get in that is what is happening right now the united states gain jobidon made a fooly he is a fool for having ketard to the to the aranian regime for long it is what led to this in many ways it turns out that once gain showing your neck to the aranians ends with you being dad were your friends mostly theug the uniteds toits gets you friends killed but it certainly got a lot of americans killed in roch when we shut our nectoron in any case the united states and cottar which is a which is an eronian cut out have now reached an ageement to prevent aron from acessting six bmillion dollars recently on frozen as part of a prisoner swap now the real question here is why the united states not ptin pressar on cottar to turn over comas is leadership to an international court what why the united states has that con leverage over cotar perhaps they should be encouraging cos to commoss leadership to be arrested but they are not hey'renot doing that at the very least that is a tacit admission that what is going on in cottar the again the entireomos leadership theydo not care what happens in the gosestrip the workh millions of dollars in the living in cotar in posh five sar sweets as the very typical of terror group in the tegreat lie of these terragroups is that the leadership deeply cares about the cause very often leadership does not care about the cause they just getting rich and living in posh ustates nasar our fat by the time he was done was with hundreds of milions of dollars that he had stolen from his own people machmubasis a very rich man that is of comass agan living it up poshstyle in cottar far away from the human privation that they have caused in the gosestrip ot th bottomline here is that the interest te united states has no one wants o war this strw man that that every one is itching for a worth romic name name the person name the people a no linsey grahams has dumb words at sometimes but lie oside from lins y gram can you name people are yealis gotoworth is reallicent one worth ron no one thathis this bizare isolationist notion this straw man that it is you verseis all the war mongers no it really really is not it really is not thwhat it really is is people understanding the midleast an understanding that if you do not throw people off the ball right now it is gontn get way worse really quickly he is gain ron if ron gets involved aron has sponsership from both china and russia and things get really ugly really quickly ere well this week has been just devastating absolutely devasining on every level it is been devastating for westerners generally or should be if they had a a shred of of class or an ounce of dignity ave they are many millions people wo do i'm nom not discounting any of those people obviously ththe outpouring of support from americans for his railies and for jews generally has been amazing to watch i've gotten calls from tons of of christian friends calls from from tonsof people who are a religious ous people car seeking to help and god bless every one of you seriously god bless you and and god bless people who are who are willing to stands up for the lives of jews it is rarer than you would think it is been obvustly an unbelievably difficult time i do not know a single person in my in my no inner circle jeor notyou who has not been devi stated by this obviously in the jewish community it is it is a singular it is a singular tragedy its reminder of our vonerability it is reminder how many people simply want ted juws and are fine with the jews and cheerded jews it is reminder of all of those things but i'm wanted to end the week on it wih with ana on a a note of of heroism every time there is human eple that that exposes its fangs there are many people who rushed

own problems whoave krafted complex conspiracy theories about tho supposed power of the jews whoave sought to destroy to murder to mutilate to rape the jews from pharoh to hayman from hitler to hamas the words of the natsies are indistinguishable tfrom the words of the khomas charter the chain of jew hatred is unbroken for tumalannia since the destruction of the last jewish dynasty in the holy land of israel those jewhaters were ascended ll no longer that is the promise of the state of israel never again the jews will not stand by thet will not be murdered they will not leave their biblical

if you are northox trew in israel's one day and in america's to days and on saturday morning my security guids who are outside the synagogs thy always are as see the isthe security goy out sid my house andthen i se that there is a security gu outside the synagog and he comes up to mainy starts informing me of what is going on and over the course of the next two days the in formation bleed slowly od into my community because obviously nobody in my community has the iner net on has their phons on theremembers my community who are who han have no idea of their relatives are alive or dead in israel ofor the course of this two days iv av brothers and sisters parens and kids are in israel right now not knowing what is going on trying to trying desperately to to get information without violating jewish law and tum and obviously the information was was being disseminated we heard rumors weknew sum of what was going on and then and then we came back on laing last night and a and here is what we came back to over the course of the week end eight hundred to one thousand terrors entered israel for approximately eighty gaps in the fence in the security border that was supposed to be secure there may a lot of questions to be asked about the intelligence failures fore about the technical failures here and then proceeded to attack twenty ommunities and eleven is really defence for spasis id ye fasis at least eight hundred people are dad several thousand have been wounded for for those who roclaiming that this is because of israel's treatment of gozae us recognized israel hazno presents in the goestrip israel abandoned the gozestrip intwo thousand five under the called disengagement plan commos a terras group established in nineteen eighty seven nineteen eighty eight with the express purpose of destroying the state of israel and killing jews globly commos was elected to lead the goze strip intwo thousand six the 've raeled continuously since two thousand seven they have initiated multiple conflicts over the corse of that time in two thousand sixty thousand eightwo thousand leven two thousandeighteen the initiated large wars in two thousand eight two thousand twelve to thousand fourteen and two thousand twenty one and the generael is rayly security prorspective was keep them hemd in keep that wall make sure they con't been breachd that border everyso often their be beragh of rocket fire use iron dome to shoot down those rockets and essentially relegate your own population to living in bunkors under ground for several weeks every year welcomas fires rockets at them but long as the casual ties are minaimized just continued to live an men the weeken thet the time line of the weeken was essentially that about six thirty a m local time the commas terrists bhegan firing a baroge of rocket fire from goza into israel anding several cities ranging from tellof eve which is basically located in the centr coasts of israel down to rocovote and gadera and ashkalon those are areas that are thetre slightly closer goshkalon is petty close to the gozestrip i for thosewho do not know the geography of the state of israel state of israel ks a cenval wedge the goze strip is a is at the corner of that wedge if he as matchin israelsro anelongated diamond its at the lower left hand side of that elongated diamond its fairly small area phose about two million palistinians palstonian arbs and do the gozestrips i stay has benunder the complete an utter control of comas since two thousand seven israel has no presents in the gozestrip it does not control what goes on inside the gozestrip it does not allow weapons to flow inside the gozestrip it t has been providing free electricity and water to the gozestrp for literally deckades they started firing at about six thirty five a m of the sirans all went off the m people rushed underground and th turns out the dissolved distraction technic is a highly sophisticated operation plans and greenlit apparently by the aronian government the aranian government on a jeo political level is terrified that israels about to make piece with souty arabia hen that peces gan break out across the region providing original counterbalante to the worst terror state in modern history the aronian terrorstate which is spread it is tentacles of evil across a roc across syrea across lebanon into yemon into the goze strip at about tem seven forty a m the commos terrace began blowing up pirtes of the border fence this bordfence was supposed to be technologically sophisticated with called touch fence which means that a if there were ladders that were stacked on the fence then they would go off and then every would be alurted b apparently there as a simultaneous a tack a ciber attack on the border fence which meant that it was not functioning properly apparently about eighty places in the wall were breached they rushed through they proceeded to a blow up and and murder a bunch of jews in these idea bases and then they proceeded in to israilly border towns and they went house to house murdering people in their homes kidnapping children raping an kinapping women murdering them house to house understand this the worst disaster for the jews since the hollicose it is worth thin the nineteen seventy three yone could por war that was military operation designed out evicerating israel but at least it was a territorial military attempting to take on another territorial military tese are terras we have no actual military a genda they are only a genda is to murder as many jes as possible because antizinism is antisematism because the destruction of the tate of israel is coincident wit the murder of as many jews as possible with more juish blood spilled with the murder of infants thes people were shoting women they are shoting babies this is what they thisis what they do they proceeded to sterrot ich is an aria near the gos a border which has been none it with thousands of rockets over te years they shot at a civilian car theye bhen open fire on a variety of vehicles shooting as many people as humanly possible that was the basic time line for hours on end they were going through these cities these twenty cities and murdering people we had people in our community an our mediate community who had brothers and sisters in some of these communities thep wore tempting to hide the'rebeing dragged outoftheir houses in shot if they were hiding they were being their house were being burned they are being forced out and then shot and again peoplewere being kitnappe now i'm going to make you look at things this is your morning i'm a a make you look at things that you do not wanto look at because this is what evil looks tit was a blot on the moral imagination of the united states that after nine eleven we did not put ona loop tho footage you nine eleven tbecause people need to understand what evil looks thecause we do not we are lucky we do not encounter evil on a daily basis all of the people who we think are truly evil in american polisics or at least the vast majorityof them are not truly evil in people we disagree with many o the people whe disagree with on politics theve evilagenas but the're not evil what evil looks is what we saw over the weeken and ti'm to show you stuff that is that is going to be impossible to wash out of your brain aand i want you to look at it and and i want you to look at it because you do not understand what has to be done about evil that it must be absolutely evicerated and eradicated unless you look it in the face this is not a matter of territorial dispute this not a matter i've a negotiated compromise theres not a matter of failure of a peace plan this they group of people who want to murder as many jews as humanly possible the have the eviceration of jery the murder of innocence on their mind it is what they want it is all they care aboutd remember there wis no military engoll here the only engoll was the murder of as many jews as possible that is all this began by comoss prigade members invading a military post hereis some vidio of commoss brak ade members invading a military post as is put out by comos itself the vest majority of this vidio was not put out by these railies is put by cmmoss bragging about there they are evil in their human's rights violation here is the beginning of the military operation that they that they performed these were there actul breaking through the wall and you are going to see them invadin a military post and shooting as many people as possible obviously ranin herating memory to v which is i be shouting obviously as they a break through the security barriers a very tall cement barrier breaking through they blew it out and now they cut through in iron fence when they rushon intraily military basin is a short staff base because it was a jewish holiday theis tack ont remember for muslins for radical muslins it is obviously a violation of religion for a for any one to do anything during romidon but any jewish holiday is an excuse for terror is to murder as manych as possible walked into a military basin start o murdering as many human beings as possible this is a just more vidio of them doing just that and then they proceeded in too israly towns because again this was not about there is thing these are theire jeeps these are their hummer jeaps ah they then proceed into militive they then proceeden is vilian towns again there is simultaneous attacks on unmultiple civilian towns as well as a massive dance festival we will get to the mass ofe dance festival in a second because that was the chief place of doubt it was again thit is not a right left issue thit is not a political issue in israel or anywhere else these were largely secular jews at a rave an edium rave but hey call the piece rave somewhat near the gosi border get to that momentarily but e here is what iagain i'm to make you look in images that youdo not want to look at and because this is what this is what the world's really is when you ret when you rip off the venear of civilization when judao christian morality disappears when when morality disappears generally speaking what you end ut with is is words that that there are no words for this sort of evil ther're no words for it the you cannot describes not animalistit because animals wen not treat each other this way tit is not animal it is a endits o monstrous tbecause there are no monsters they are only human beings therere there only some of the most demonic evil pieces of human excrament ever to walk the planet that is what that is e commoss is here is a vidio of an entire family murdered you can see these are women on the floor hen men on the floor this is commoss puttig out this vidio again this is not the israilies comoss is putting out this vidio is an entire family in their home i'm in gun down and murdered and there jot shooting people horardy dad on the floor veum there is vidio of a father who is attempting to help his family escape from the top story of of his home in one of these villages a e can see in the corner of the vidio for those account watch he is he helping his family escaping and see ths are women and children or are escaping the top window here trying to get out terris are in their home imagine for second terrase or in your homein you'r trying to help your family escape tther tempting to get out and ta the last person nowt is going to be the father here but he is not going to get out he is going o be murdered he is n be shot n e's going to be killed in the vidio than people were sending taxs throughout this throughout this day to friends and family members telling them that they were about to be murdered and then thos who be the last toxhy can see this sum this father has been shot and he dies in the window here the m come oss wit avidio o entire families be murdered on the roads the straight literally straped cars filled with women children entire families i these are these arvidios thats a we are taken in the aftermouth the is a youan see thes people strewn on the ground entire families see here a just many vans filled with with the dad the they i ta it did not matter just a as a in the bible describes it describes om ta lake as a as praying on the week and the elderly that a this is this is what they do is a picture of a grandmother who as a murdered shea she was murdered bycamoss terrists the young woman in the picture found out that her grandmther had been murdered when she saw avidio the comasa posting on her grandmother's face book page of her being murdered is a picture of a couple e tie an cadasper chesky bot thirty they had ten month old twins ten month old twins the're a their village which is called far goza which is kee boots in southern israel kubots a sort of a commun in sothern israel a they they shielded their babies with ther with their lives the babies were we are next to their dead parents for twelve to fourteen hours before they were before they were rescued a but the comaston stop there of course they they proseeded to mutilate as many bodies as they could find this is a again all this vidios disturbing e's a this is this by the ways a tie worker who was a who is mutilate bmurered an mutilated nine american citizens by the wairdd at the very least ti citizens are dad german citizens are dad whyd vrivy tthis the worst terrs tottack on the planet since at least ye thousand one i'm you see thei're going around and and mutilating the bodies of the dad they heo this this gyis not thad he is just going in the're still mutilating him aer kicking him and beating him about the head and now they are taking a a shovel a spade and be heading him this is this is what these people do this is what the mons in theans teas at its i i do not want to show you this i do not wan to show you this but it needs to be seen it needs to be seen it needs to be seen these people this is thit peace partners moral equivalent cycle of violence or maybe not hit is not the onlyam mutilation of body vidia dead soldiers had their bodies mutilated kicked in the face beheaded this is a morvidia from commoss sise them rading the bodies t of the dead taking their ammunition then finding the dead bodies the corpses of soldiers they have killed and dom and kicking them in the face and mutilating them stabbing them and then posting this vidion line going body to body to mutilate the dead there can there can be no negotiation with this there can be no the can be no talking with this iy can youknow d'eling with these gees wretched pieces of filt there can be none of that there can be none of that and anybody who claims once again any sort of level moral ci evul see thei r people who did tvisit by the way thit is only the beginning it gets worse it gets worths what you'e seeing here murdered families women on the ground they getstowors they took they took hostages but before we get to even the hostages here is what happened at these railyng music festivals there is a massive music festival there is an eye witness account of that festival that is been printed over a tablet magazine this is according to leo lebaletts writing says i've spent he last twelve hours speaking to his railies were at the supernoble music festival theire testimonies as you would imagin our very motional at least one broke down at mid conversation was not able to continue his recollection the attack on the festial outside of vraim tbhegan round seven am the party was it it is piqued by than which ment that by then most people were inebriated at first party goers heard alout explosion which they took to be another sparatic rockt attack on southern israel the explosions grew louder an constant kept going for about five minutes the music stopped the police protecting the five or four or five thousand ravers began pushing every one to leav by then terrors were approaching in pick up trocks bearing commoss military markings shooting began many were executed on the spot two hundred sixty bodies were found far on the side ofthe ravets now probably in access of three hundred many of theyoung men and women started running in the flat expanse of the western nagav desert the terrace began rounding up the victims some were bound and kidnapped i saw vidios of the mail getting held by a group of arab kids their sixteen seventeenus of irisas their kids there young men already their holding the sgy he loks as is girl friend as beeng mound town byke can driven away from him womenhave been raped at the area of the rave next to their friend's bodies dead bodies several of the rate victims of puri to haveben later executed others were taken two gaza weill get to those vidios momentarily here is what it looked at the actual festival as you can see at the festival people were partying and tat in the back r on you can see in the distance come oss paragliders who flew in armed to murder as many dancers as humanly posstibl and see in te background there they were arriving huge majority the people in the vidio are probably dead now people were fleeing the music festal anmass these suse people running across s empty fields trying desperately to get away from the people would murder them for the great crime of dancing and being jews im anta here is zm and here is som vidio of the aftermath of the music festibal an can see what it looks after a massacre this this sis zum again horrifying stuff going throuh the ni lo young people tha enjoying themselves a donthing enjoying the music aas the sun was coming up and then a the mishile strikes they they interecips they iam them going off an old lat confusion and out of that confusion it appears tha hama ranl that a'm were just killing in a frendsed way any one that they could that they could reach any one a that they could not sort of pull back an take away get bac to gaza look at this vidia into dead bodies all over the place an see the burned out cars it sum body backs everywhere in that a in that earlier photo that se nan was showing cars on the side ofthe road because people were tempting to escape and com o set up a blockade and just began mowing down people as they were attempting to escape agan that is not even that is not the worst part commass has now taken in access of a hundred and fifty hostages when they went into towns they they stole babies they stole literal babies they stole women this is commass taking a woman hostage and shoving her into the back of vehicle and driving her back into daza where giant crowds of people cheering animals this women has obvious ly the grate mostal times she is bleeding through her pants an forse into the car in viciously raped you imagine sadomized from the amount of damages and done there this is zum cheering hanking their horns athe whu acpar ther shouting in the vidio the stuffing women in the backof trats and a if you are wondering what happens to the women they do this to here is zum the a here is wwell get in second to the wors of the other day heres a here more women who have been held hostage entire rooms filled with womenwho hae been held hostage who will be turned into regreat victims and sect slaves presumably entire lines of women whoare have been kidnapped an commoss releasing thes vidio is commoss doing this because they are under mistaken impression the his going to break the will of the je us of these railies theyare they are sorely mistaken they are sorely sorely mistaken theg the wrath of god that they just brought upon thus this is this is by far and i'm sorry to to make you watch this but i'm not sarry that done that we but i'm not sorry because frankly again we all have to watch this this is what evil looks it is what evil looks it is what evil looks its what evil looks this is a this is the body of woman a woman her name ishany look we know her we know her name es german citizen she is tat the rave this is a this is avidio of her mutilated body on the back of a trucke can see that her lives are bent in un natural positions because she is dad they are cheering a huacbar in a mass of crowd in gaza over her mostly naked body she has been mutilated she is clearly been murdered this is m this is who these these people are iamusing word people as loosely as as humanly possible more hostage vidiofs women more hostage look looking how many women thy've taken captive the the gol ere is to paralyze the state of israel to stop them from doing what must be done to clearer gaza of comass and destroy it utterly and completely to evicerate it to kill its leadership i should mentione d this point that every ounce of blood an gaza is on comas every ounce of blood an gaza because not only do they seek to murder israily civilians take women and children hostage we haven' gone to the children now i'll get tothe children but they hide behind their own cvillainstha be doings for years there is literal vidio atd i've played on the shobefor of israel calling up buildings and telling them to get out because civilians are in there and comass saying we want the civillians to be there there is a reason that they put their military headqorts under hospitals is they want israel to retaliate and then to kill civilians by hiding behinds villains hiding behind civillanss a war crime every ounce of blood that is shed here is on comss every ounce of blood palcinian and is raili is on comass an more hostge vidios andten we will get to a and tey 'll get to the children lling o e raile rate tank millitant group and here is em here is the if you think what weave done far as unwatchable just whay evil has no limits evil has no limits here is a m hostage another hostage vidio of om a twelve year ld te a child being dragged away a gain realeas by hamas and an attempt to terrify these railies dragging is rally children back across the border into goza mean this is holicoss tia style this holicoss style material i the worst ovidiother day in my opinion this is aam hostage vidio ofan is railly child is kid cannot be more than five or six years old he is being taunted by other by by palistinian children their htdin him with sticks and telling him to say ima ima ima means mother means mam in hebr i taunting him grabbing him by the head he is rather children other children ar mocking the child whos parence ere undoubtedly dad hitting him with stexs and telling him to saye ima these these are thse are hese are notses these are notses es are notses anybody who is called anyone in notsy on line these that is what notsius looks that iswhat noseas m looks this is they took his railly grandmothers the hostage one of them was at holicoss survivor this bidio comass grabbing in his railly grandmother and driving her again terrase wor driving in his rally grandmother across the border and thother celebrating his theasing ar that noises that ilele that is the m that is the celebratory

than ems oat's the terrace granhaml mother says get to the ground now and she covers the child with her bydy this is the hot this halicos material mother says i can be careful i cannot afford losing another life right now they have already lost there their older sister n then finallye's another am kinnap family taken hostge an another vidio a this is a from this is a the e a a father saw yet she called his wife and and then he saw his wife on the news and his two children being tanken hostage to women holding two red headed children and being and being pulled away by terrorists into the gosestrip of a hundred and fifty people a being takin taken hostage by these pieces of human debris come oss of course with celebratory about all of this because his what evil does they commit acts of evil and they celebrate the the act of evil come oss releast of idio showing their political leadership many of who are in cutar thanking god to celebrate thinking alah bowing down to celebrate the murder of innocence and the rape of women and the canapping of small children nd the torture of all these people here here they were thanking a thinking ala for his beneficence in all of this watching all to zero watchon anmgs an zer you can hear them celebrating smiling broadly euse of the leaders of of comas every one of whom should be put in in early grave as soon as shu nly possible on the gonot evil looks it looks men in busines suits and fancy business suits in catar bowing their heads and thanks to god at the rape of women in the murder of children that is what that is what it looks right there that is whot looks in the suit does not make you any less of ateris this is a come oss thanking aron will get to that a moment beause the geo political ramifications of this situation are are quite grave the united states as tempting to avoid the by dministrations tempting to avoid its own complicity in the fact that is provided hundreds of millions of dollars too various palstinian groups ranging from palcinan authority to homass itself billions of dollars to the are on resume the sponse or this will get into in injust a little while here as a come os leadership thanking aron for all of this thanking them for their help tiss a person whos massan ors is thanks to all these individuals groups and countries particularly aslamic re public abron wit supported us generously with money arms and other means providing us with the missiles that have been battering hesigna strongholds during past confrontations with the occupiers thayve also supported us with antitankmasens which by the grace of god and the faith of our fighters shattered the mith of desinist superiority and that really was the goal here obviously the goal here was to shatter the the notion of his really military in vincibility by murdering as many civilian as humanly possible whle these people are about to find out the hardway exactly wht it means to fall around and find out commss's leader ismalhon is malhanea has now called on other arabs to join and has called on israel to leave the land that you saw him earlier bowing down in thanks to allah for the gift of murdered jews here he was suggesting the real purpose the real purpose is not a territorial settlement the real purpose is not control the gossistrip amasa ben in control the gos strips in two thousand sect here he is calling on am all jews to leave the land na talping that for lothini anaa mething tha alabea wen is te i say to the sons of our pallicinian people and arabanislamicnation amaatin to day you are on te verge of a great triumph and a manifest victory will be in namagalaam what happens to day reveals the fragility of this enemy ag this enemies suffered defeat to day te sasea watedia wat political military intelligent securitere a security and moral defeat says this a evil ensait human o bry in schala we will crown all this with the resounding defeat yagamiaudabyna minuseathe enemy will leave our land our jerusalem our aloximas that is that be the temple mout and we will liberate our prisoners avere the goal here is not merely to liberate liberates by by liberat we mean have these monsters take over more territory which is as it turns haw by ley giving giving territory to some of the world's most evil people is a horrible idea i know that ta there have been those who have ben convinced in their sophistication that giving territory to the world's most evil people is actually a wonderful idea and that it is the best way to prummat world peace as it turns out is the bestway to promote rape of women murder of chils run kinnapping of babies now that is what that iswhat it turns out am the m their goals are very clear meanwhile ther secondary goal here is to have israel kill as many palstinian civilians is humanly possible in the hopes that this will somehow scuttle israels birtran and pieceteal with the souty royal government this is why it came out earlier today that the gaza ministry has been telling people not to pay attention to his really wanting to get out of their bilding o israel's does a process whenever anyone suggests that israel is wellfully colling civilians that is most ignorant bigoted antismetic bull eversad israel goes out of its way more than any army on earth not to killcivilians to the poin where they they literally have a type of bon that they drop on rufes to shake the building and warm people to get out they make announcements on radio to get people out meanwhile comas is literally telling people that tom the id effs tex and voice messages should be ignored why because they want the pictures of dead palistinians commass wants pictures of dead palistinians meanwhile the conflict is a is going more global according to the associateo press he same day all this went down or the following dan egyptian police person open firer on is raely tourists in alexandria killing at least thosraelies and one egyptian meanwhile commass supporters all over the world celebrated commassuporters in the called westbank thoad be judea and semaria they celebrate becaus this is wht you do when babies are murdered and when and when we meare killed by the way israel is now how many mothers hae been murdered israel is now calling on women in israel to donate brestmil because many women have ben murdered and their children are still alive small babies do not actually have proper nutrician theyarecalling on people to donate brestmilk that is hat that' tow many women were kill again eight hundred people at least dad at this hour here is comma suporters in the west bank celebrating see the small girl a tap hera a some aatopaman's shoulders carryin looks a in m sixteen or nusy thisser american m fors rather there been suggestions that those american em forse where those coming from if those are american em forest tere ben suggestions they came wait for it from afdanistand were jobidan surrendered to th teleban meanwhile cesbala has far not joing to in on the party the reason ces belos not trining on the parties because tey 'v the most to lose commas is a about to find dout exactly what it means to wake the sleeping giant that is the israelly military cisbela wants no part of that if cesbelaw were start launching rock ets across the border israel would not goin with ground troops israel goine with th the israely air forse the most efficient fighting force in thm at least and they would simply evicerate southern lebanon it just would not exist tomorow because israel cannot afford have a hundre fifty thousand rock its falling on it cities in the middle of something this but of course they did praise the situation has cesbala is of course funded by aron which is the which is the terror stape behind all of this cusbela's leader hosan and ostrala another terras you set it sends a message to the arab an is lomic world and the international community is a whole especially those seeking normalization wih the enemy that the palsting in cuaus is an everlasting one alive until victory and libration again that is the engull here the engol was to prevent the the possibility of a is railly souty

billions and inconunconditional finding to support the apartite government this heartbreaking cycl of vilencs will ah her solution is that we shuld continue to funcomass and we should pull our funding from the state of israel as americans in the aftermath of the worst terror taxas non eleven and the worst crime against shues since the holicost bhetter that is the perspective of islamist terror sympathize or extraordinary rechutets ly belected congress women from the state of michigan and member of the vaunted squad but te but don'ory the the squad goes ven further cory bush put out a

palstinians lives that been lost to a first vall the equivalente is not existent the palistinian lives that av been losst are solely the result of comast israel is targeting and killing leading members of commas and the are hiding behind women and children bcause this is what they do because they are the world's worst people they are comitting war crimes on every available side she says i strongly condemne the targoning of civilians and i urgen immediate seise fire and descullation to prevent further loss of live our immediate focus must be saving lives but our ultimate focus must be on a just and lasting piece that insure safety for every one in the region violations of human rights do not justify more violations of human rights and a military response well only exascurbate the suffering of palistinians ind is railies not ond a military responsful end the suffering of his railies that is the idea the idea is israel kills enough of the sons of bitches that this is not a problem again the issue here is whether israel vis ey to militarize zone that protects its own citizens twhether israel provides enough of a military hand in this areas prevent more rocket fir on a citizens whether israel annac sads of the gossistrip as damlall should because of it the palistinians have prove themselves in capable of self governente in the gosi strip by allowing comass to overrum them and not only overrun them govern them comas was an elected government this cannot be allowed to continue no soverein state would allow this if this were hapvening on america feel compare this to america southern bor ges if america southern border ere nachest being overrun by migran seeking jobs by terroris with guns walking into the st reets of lorado taxas and mowing down people and then taking women and children hostage driving them back across the border or firing tens of thousands of rock ets over the course of years in to el paso taxas for sandiewi california if youn a make back comparison bat would bethe comparison non america would do itwould vicerate the border ievicerate it occupy it annexit set up a damsy that is what would happen quory bushes trash aoc is trash oure as her statement s to day is devastating for all thse seeking a lasting peace an respect for human rights in israel and palestine i can damhamasas attack in the strong ast possible terms no chald and famly shuld ever have to enjure this kind of violence in fear this violence will not solve the on going oppression and occupation in the region an immediate stese fir n diescullations urgently needed sat you see the the scor was too short the jews existed and that was the big problem the jews by existing in their storied home land the holy land of israel by existing they earn this that is the message of the squad andthe democratic parties eat to sgrace in absolute abject disgrace for championing these these trash heaps of congress people the media's joining in as well is academia the harvard palistine solidarity group has put out a statement blaming solely israel for this for this debocle quote we the undersign student organizations whold the isrally regume entirely responsible for all unfolding violence to day's events did not a carn a vacuum for he last who decutes millions of palistinians and gos have been forced to live in an open air prison first ovall you knowh's force them to do that would be comoss commass as dedicated billions of dollars to terrorism zero to building actural infor structure to investing tastu making life livable for the people living there the doft give a damn about those people is rally officials promised to open the gates of phell an the maskers and gos have already commenced halsinians and gods have no shelters for nowhere and nowhere to escape in the coming days palsinians will be forced to bare the full brunt of israel's violence by the way i gosa does not need an ironnome cause israel is not target's villions that would be the reason the partside resume is the only one to blame is rally violence is structure t every aspect of palistinian existence for seveny figers you they are no they are no words strong enough for the vast moral garbag you are if you sign a statement this for the absolute thoxic waste of a human being youare an a moral leble tif you back the sort of statement good news it is supported by no less then forty one different groups including the afard c an american resistance organization amnestin international at harbard harvard act on a dream harvard chan muslim students sassociation the harvard college paxstanstuden association the harvard divinity scool muslem association the harvar 's lomic society harvard divinity chool students for justice in palestine harvard juws for liberation the harvard prison divest coalition the harvard undergraduate cungroup the harvard undergraduate o poly students association d fun these in these suposed institutions of higher education immediately and then of course you have the usual suspects in the media already the moral equivalente rolling off the pages of the york times o something to be hold they call it a cycle o violence already they suggest tit isrel brotted upon itself they suggest the tensions are riseing on both sides on both sides is a lie it is a lie i someone comes in your house and rapes your wife and kidnaps her and murders members of your family and steals your children and then you respond that is not a cycle of violence that is not both sides anybody who believes it is is morally bee nighted they aret there on the side of absolute evil emasand me se host i'min moyeldan blamed hamas's attack on israel as well because this is what trash people do that the abraham accords did not bring israel the peace thret that israelies wanted to bray ad brought them some business i brought the bodissa dailise again important staff dant if you are trying to solve a problem that is are now persisted for the better part of a century and you are trying to do the same way over and over and over again it is by definition instendid and what were seen today are very deadly consequences of fail policies failure on the american administrations part to change up ors to take a dif ferent course tof action with how we deals with the palistonians in theseraelies failure on israel's part failure on the regen's part if only if only israel had made more concessions to terror as this the certainly would meif only israel had tak pulled out of the intaragozal striping hand ad over control th comas and then avoided destroying hamas completely fer fer decates on an if only theyv done that oh that the unbelievable lies men while caran atia who writes for the washington post and a is apparently discusting human being echo to social mediopost by a fringe somala thats had puote what did youall think codecolonization meant vibes papers assays moozer that is a twist on the axpost on x suggest that those on left who band about turms to colonization but do not support terrism are hypocrites she then said she then added we are forced to see state violences has justified in moral while violence by non state actors is not this is changing well no actualy but to moral is rushing into towns and mer i cannot i can sa enough anybody wo the level of moral blindness that you have to that you have to demonstrate to do this is just it is beyond it is absolutely beyond a misery meanwhile israel has obviously declared formally war they have declared war that is not operation it is not an incersion it is not going to be a limited operation it is going to be a full scale war in which israel has now activated some three hundred thous and reservice apparently the revers reservis are showing up on mass one hundred and fifty per cent turn out for all the talk about is rally society over the course of last year and a half being wildly divided there is one thing that brings is rally together and that is the that is the threat of accistential destruction that is the threat to jewish life israel comes together round life palsinian authority is lomicyhatcamas that come together around death and the celebration of death is rel comes together around life and defending it venjamentinawho has put out a statement he is warning palsingans to leave gaza here is what he had to say tis e erslyi ce gol comasyour citizens of israel sh this marning on chabat and a holiday log chabut comeass invaded israelly territory you and murdered innicen citizens in luding children in the elderly beamay commass as started a brutal and evil waromos oem we will be victorious in this war despite nonbearable price su bo on is a very difficult day for all of us o com ss once to murder us all that is a vact e mo is an enemy an murders children and mothers in their homess in their beds yand in me the ducs the elderly children young women shuthat slaughters isand masters our citizens be shu isincluding children bo we simply went out to enjoy the holiday is what happen today is on precedent and israel and i will see to it that it is not happen again meanwhile president of israel as a curzag that is more of a ceremonial position but a sort of unifine position as a kurzag said our enemies have made a great mistake here was an is occursogny president of israel my belave citizeno is ren my dear citizens i know how diicul in panful thisis but this rail spirit has always peval and it shall triumph tho this time as well just a few hours the go i visited i the injured and ther a melisan i saw and all is raly striin o and e a vangen rosaty of and a have to say or anemies has made a grate mis taken ere a sessman of this trength of this raily spirit because even through bispiercing pain we can see this is raily power in full forests in israels military authorities ar declaring war idyefs major general hasan allyan he says that omases open the gates of hell and that is exactly right there cannot be there cannot be any limitation to israel's military operations here every alence of civilian blood is on hams every single ounce they hide behind svillage they hide behind shialn the hide behind women the murders railes in the murder thir own people an israel cannot hold back isrel cannot hol back on the basis that dhey are going to act with more discretion with regard to pausing in civilian life than comass is willing to avidence israel cannot risk its own citizenry it already has thousands of people are wounded or dead because of it here is here is israel's idea of major general hasan allyon no country worth its salt would allow terroris to diswade them from from saving and saving lives protecting their own citizenry by violation of their own human rightes its its insane here is idees major general hasan alan but that i soua howti c commas says ie on say one thing cmasses olpen the gates of hellens e gasastremamen monl you comas made the decision and comass will bear the responsibility and pay for its deeds who is behind thus it isto their bunch of questions thae are gon to be asked her the security failures are going to occupy is railies for decades in the the level of failure here is onthinkable and unimaginable and people on the ground an talking t them every minute pretty much ar ar stun by it as as well they should be but this was a very sophisticated attack this is not a base line attack in esh jerusalem by a palistanian air with a knife this was a highly sophisticate attack with hundreds of fighters breaching walls using highly sophisticating military weaponry accordig to h waster journals coming directly from aron quote aronian security officials helped plan commasses saturday surprise attack on his role and gave the green light for the assault at a meeting in bayroup last monday according to senior members of commass an cesballa another aron backed militon group s they are deliberately telling they are deliberately saying that it was them an it senior members of commass and casballa whare pointing the fingerrn officers of arons is lonic revolutionary gard quor had worked tof commass since augus s advise the air land and seeing cersions the most significant breach of israls border since the seventy three yunke por war details of the operation wer refindering several meetings in bayroots member bayroot is a a it is lebanon in its ad in ronian proxy state a tended by iargysy officers in representatives of fourt ron back militsan groups including commass which hold power an gasa and cusballa a shate militsan group and political faction in lebanon meanwhile you asked because it is dominated this administrations dominated by cowards their pretending none of this astappening they are the ones of course you sign billions of dollars over in funding to the aronians the pretending money is not fungible da do not worry sin conago for terrism but that is how money works if i sign you a chack and i say you cannot use it for drugs but i know you are a drug user i signyua track an i satescan to pay for your food what do you think you are going to do wit the money you were going to use for the food you now use it to by drugs the same thing is true here money is fungible the united states is granted billions of dollars to aron actess to billions of dollars not only that americahas been egotian with ron of renewclior program well theire own thei're own negotiating team led by rober malley was infultrated by ronian agents well documented youse officials have a stake an pretending aron had nothing to do with this a youse officials haid we do not have any information at this time to corroborate this ccount and secretary state antony blink in the nighty said we have not yet seen evidence aron tirectodor was behind this particular attack but there certainly a long relationship ask about the metings mach mood mere dalwy a senior omasoficials said the group planned the attack on hits one which of course is a li a spokesman forron's mission to the uan said aron was in support of gass's actions but did not direct them it said they are fiercely autonomus which is again ali the reason theireattempting to pretend that it was just commass is because if you aregoing to try to dissuade souty for making piece with israel you pretend t as commas alone if aron was behind it souty hates oron as much as the is railies do as had actually exascerbates the chances of a piece with israel meawhile jobidon the president of the united states spoke out yesterday i here is what he had to say about the situation e peopleers

holiest tof days ine dury cou is unconscin they will jobide better keep the support coming because he has an unfortunate history being pusilandmis about all this meanwhile the same day heyou made sure that he held he barbicule apparently according to the pool report from the white house six pm sunday evening a reporter said that theycul her live band in the white house when they asked about it the white house said that the presen first they were hosing a barbicu for the white huse executive resident staff and their family meanwhile antony blincoln he sending mix messages he says correctly the commossprings only death and destruction but as we will see he then admits that aron fon sarisman calls on israel fort restraint and the're basically two paths that are before the reson right now one is the path of of normalization of integration of people working together and by the way in that and on that path it is not a substitute for resolving the differences between his railies and pallstings on the contrary it needs s to be used to advance that effort as well but that is one path the other path is what we sing from amoss terrs harr and something that offers not only nothing to people throughout the region it offers nothing to the palistinians on the contrary everything that amos does makes their situation their plight even worse they bring nothing but death an destruction not only to his railies but to palicinians of course that is that is absolutely true but that does not answer the questions to by the by dedministration rein stated support fort the palicinian authority they suggest that they have not provided any port o commoss but in their own documentation they admit that shipping culled tumanitarian ait in to gos was probably being used for the sort of stuff quote due to its over all strength and level of control ofr gosol we assess ther s a high risk commosscol potentially dirive indirect unintentional benefit from yus assistance to gaza there is lass but still some yus risk yus assistans woul benefit other designated groups as well that is according to internal united states documents did not stop the by administration from shipping millions of dollars into the gossis strip antony blincoln has admitted that ron funs terrism if ship bmillions of dollars into aronor or least unfrozen billions of dollars flowing into aron here is blincoln the argument that money is fungable a ron may have known this money is coming and used other funs to help fun iss attack that haron has aro has unfortunately always used and focused his funds on supporting terris o mot supporting groups amo as i an it is done that when therere been sanctions as done that o ther have not bee sanctions and it is always priratize that wy exactly would we unfree's money to them te united states that is why explain the answer is there is no explanation its se suto sophisticate dults who believe that you can negotiate with evil and give them money and somehow this is going to make things all better by the way secretary state blinkin actually committed a henis ridiculous moral atrocity when he tweeted out yesterday quote turkish forn minister ho confidon who by the ways he terra sympathizer and i spoke further on comasis terrastacs attacks on israel i encouraged turkeyse advocacy forasease fire and the release of all hossages held by comss imediately a sease fire a sease fight you told that to the the terror supporting foregn minister of of turkey did you ansin blincon then to lead od that things are going really well over therefore the for the bidang administration speaking of which you es office of palistinian affairs tweted out quote we unequivocally condemn the attack of comas terrace and the loss of life that is occurred we urge all sides to refrained from violence and retaliatory attacks terror and violence solved nothing that was pulled down after am it became perfectly obvious that when you tell isral mots defend itself that is in fact in act of evil meanwhile blincon call on isrel to avoid civilian casualties he should cong on comasto void sivillian casualties since they are the ones who literally max ma civilian casualties for the cameras if this is at prolonged attack what kind of humanitarian crisis are you expecting here and impact on cevilians what we have seen this unfortunately a repeat itself although thethe magnitude the scale of what hamas did here is something we have not seen before but in pr in prir instances am those who have suffered along with the victims o a terrism ar o civilians including in thin gasi and whatever israel does in gasa as always we look to it to do everything possible to avoid cevilian casually something of course that homs does not do on the contrary not onlies is ot seek to avoid them it is deliberately target civilians gan bll hn you might stop talling israel to stop avoiding civilian casualties sos toat your actualy doing s putting the owness on israel to put it s own citizens in harm's way to defend civilians that comass is putting inharm's way no country worth it salt would put itself in that position not on its own borders not af the murder of eight hundred of its citizens and the cannapping of hundreds of others i biam gting lot of questions over the past yet twenty four hours about what people can do some i'm refer you in the

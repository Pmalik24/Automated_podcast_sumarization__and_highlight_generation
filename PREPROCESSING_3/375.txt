welcome to the huberman latponcans scuss science science pac to s for ai man druhubermen and or professor of narbiology and oplymology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor odedrichovy doctor odedrahavy is a professor of nerbiology at televeve university in israel his laboratory studies genetic inheritance now everybody is familiar with genetic inheritance as the idea that we inherit genes from our parents and indeed that is true many people are also probably now aware of the called epi genome that is ways in which our environments and experiences can change our genome and therefore the genes that we inherent or pass on to our children what is less known however and what is discussed to day is the evidence that we can actually pass on traits that relate to our experiences that is right there is evidence in worms in flies in mice end indeed in human beings that memories can indeed be passed from one generation to the next that turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how our parents experiences and our experiences can be passed on from one generation to the next both in terms of modifying the biological circuits of the brain and body and the psychological consequences of those biological changes during to day's episode doctor rohavy gives us a beautiful description of how genetic's work even if you do not have a background in biology or science by the end of to day's episode you will understand the cores elements of genetics and the genetic passage of traits from one generation to the next in addition he makes it clear how certain experiences can indeed modify our genes such that they are past from our parents to us and even transgenerationally across multy generationcs that is one generation could experience something and their grand children would still have genetic modifications that reflect those prior experiences of their grand parents doctor rihovy takes us on and incredible journey explaining how our genes and different patterns of inheritance shape our experience of life and who we are before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsors of to day's potcast our first sponsor is element element is an electorolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nerons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the properatioes and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehidration of the body can lead to dephasis in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactolectrolike ratio of one thousand miligrams that one graham of sodium two under miligrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolites and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweading lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elementy daccom slash hubermen to claima free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleementy docom slash hubermen and now for my discussion with doctor oded rohavy odet thank you much for being here totanin my pleasure ye this podcast has an somewhat unusual origin because i am familiar with your work but we essentially met on twitter where you are known for many things but a lately especially you have been focussing not just on the discoveries in your laboratory another laboratories but also ams are mean type humor that relates to the scientific process and weill return to this lobit later but first of all iting its wonderful that your active on social media in this positive stands around science that also includes humor but to day whald i mainly want to talk about is incredible questions that you probe in your lave which are highly unusual incredibly significant for each and all of our lives and very controversial and at times even a little bit dangerous or morbid a this is going to be a fun one for me and for the audience just to start off very basically get everyone up to speed u because people have different backgrounds i think most people have a general understanding what genes are what are ana is and on but maybe you could explain to people in very basic terms and i'll just preface all this by saying thati think most people understand that if they have two blue eyed parents that there is a higher probability that they their offspring will have blue eyes than brown eyes similarly to brown eye parents higher probabily that they have brown eyes rather than blueeyes and on but that most people generally understand and accept that if they spend part of their life let say studying architecture that if they have children that there is no real genetic reason we assume that their children would somehow be better at architecture because they contain the knowledge through the deana of their parents they might be exposed to it in the home call nature nurture s a nurture in that case but that they would not inherit knowledge or other traits and today i'm hoping you can explain to us why i collor but not knowledge is thought to be inherited and the huge landscape of interesting questions that this hopens up including some evidence that contrary to what we might think a certain types of knowl ledge at the level of sells and systems can be inherited that was a very long wen it openin but to frame things up what is theana what is arna and how does inheritance really work deana are the this is the material that genetic instructions that is containing every one of our seles we have the set of genes containing the intire set is calle the geno and this is present in every sale of our body the same set of instructions and genes are made of deana and ther are all they also contain a and cromosons that the are containing cromoson's commersons is the deana and the protins that condensed that eni because we have ae uge amount of thana in every sell at you need to contentit to thru am thread honor honaspool right uge amount ed you have to condent and we have the same genon the same deana in every sell in our body can i jus interrupt and i'll do that periodically just to make sure that people are being carried along i sometimes find tat even remarkable that a skin sell in a brain sell a noron for instance very different functionce but they all contain the full manu of genes and the same manougenes now it is amaze it is amazing ant perhaps it is good to have an aknology t to understand how it works this is hop this is not the commercial but this is the igia book that you have in every sell in your body thein instructions to make eveything that you need in your house the chairs the the the kitchen the the pictures by neverys in but in every room you one something else in the kitchen you one thinks that fit the kitchen in in the toilet you one things that fit the toilet you only re and remove one particular page of instructions which is the instruction of how to b the chair and this you place in the key in the an the living room and in the toilet to put in a torriso the teana is the instruction to make th the degenon the is the instruction to make everything is te car book and in every sel we we takes just the instructions for make one particular furniture and this is the alony this is the arnetiste sait and then the end you will you will build the chair the chair is the proting the thn the arnase thore are instructions to make one particular portan based on the intire set of possibilities and and this is er this is true for one particular type of arna which will not bi the stalfe of this conversation which is messenger hoane this is the rnated contains e information formaking potics in fact this is just a small percent of ar of the arnad the sell s we have a very big geno and less than two percent of ich conincoats for this messenger hgane however a lot of the the the genomis transcribed to make ornate does other things some of these arns we understand and a many of them we do not is a beautiful description in i gears not esponsero aparcas on that tol we fair game to to us the ideha catalogu has as the analogy for geana the specific instructions first specific pieces of furniture is the arna and the furniture pieces being approatiinstat a thetr sentially made from ourna using messengerare an rit thank you for that despite the fact that the same genes are contained in all the cells of the body there is a difference between certain sell types right i wil is it fair to say that there pasically one very important exception which is sematic cells werses germsells and would you mind sharing with us with that distinction is sho yes every sell every sell type is different because it expresses it brings into action different genes from the intire collection and assume then i thentid and iso we have we have tesells in the legs we have selled in the brain we have in that in the brain we have sell to the stopam in f selt to the saroton in on and we can make and different te separation different e distinctions but we can make one very important distinction between the somatic sells and the germses the germs said thout supposed to be the only sells that contributes to the next inarration that out of which the nection lation will be made ich of us is made just from a combination of the sperman inneg this a two types of germsels and thand the fuse and you make you youyou get one feltalized egg and out of this one sell all the rest of the body will develop and what happens in the somma which is which are all the said that are not that the germsel should stain the some should not be able to contribute to the nection ige this is vely important and is to be one of the main belliels for the inheritants acquire trats e inhelitants of merily and on because for example the example that you gave in with athe learning architecture if i learn about architecture the information is in coted in my brain and since my gran sels cant tancer in formation to the sperm an the egg cause the information supposed to reside in synaptic connection between diffenoilont in particular circut that a developed and what what yould what happens the brente should not be able to transfor nexganation if an simpler a simpler example should go to the geman you build up mascels that your kis will will we have to work out on their own it wont the this short at ont wont happend is something that we know intuitively and even if we do not have any bacg on in birlity and this is connected to the fact that as we said tit the beginning every sell in the body has its own geno and the nectionration will only sorm from the combination of the genoms in the sperm and the egg even if you somehow i acquire the mutation or change n your diane in one of popticolo bran tays it would not medow because these mutation there is no way to transferate to the dine of the of the germs that thit will contibute to the next panation despite that there is as you will tell us some evitance for inheritance of experience let us call it or a and here we have to be careful with the language right i just won a a put a big astrects and underline in the highlight that the language around what we are about to talk about is both confusing and at the same time fairly simple and controversial right is little bit in the a in the field of longevity people sometime will say antiaging some peoplel say longevity the antiaging folks feel that longevity is more about longevity clinecs they do not that antiaging is related to some other kind of niche a clinec sometimes aftia proved or a government prove sometimes not and theres lot of argument about the naming but it is all about living longer and living healthier in this field of acquiring traits or the passage of information to offspring what is te proper language to refer to what we are about to a disguss am theres is this idea and i'll say it you do not have to that tit is pack to lamarq in lamarqin evolution very controversial right a and may be not even controversial i think it is very offensive even to certain people this idea of inheritance of acquired traits the idea that one could change themselves through some activity use the example going to the gim we culd alsee is the example somebody wh becomes in durance runner thans decides to have children within another indurance runner and has in mind the idea that because they did all this running and not just because they were by us towards running in the first place but because they of the distance they actually ran that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners othis lamarquin a concept is we believe wrong how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits what is the proper language for us to frame this discussion we hapes to be very careful i to and therre many complications many a am begurits maybe could tell us while a marqui an evolution for those that do not know is am such a stained thing it is not polite fr perhaps perhaps we start we just te just say that we can talk about the inheritance a quie traits confmicion of parentalis ponset in heritance of memory all of these things and we can also tak about epegenetics and congen nation at a pegenetics and in tos o naation ot epegenetics are many terms that we need to to to make clear for for the audence ther the reason that the a talksic o contovella is very complicated and goes a long time even way be tolama even the the greeks be talked about the inheritance a quie traits la marq is a socatat we the term but it is probably a mistake though everyone talks about incruding people wo stadis la marq work he published his book about a little more than two hundred years ago and he a he believed in thin inhelitants acquired trate absolutely but just any one else in his time everyone believed it it this is it seeme obvious to them bey thit was long before men del and the roles of of a ganetic inheritant and also men that was long befor the the understanding the denays the healtheble matiler for this happened the long time ago every one believed in it including dalving laving was perhaps mol lamalk and the lamaunt really yes absolute right now er or getting into n an and and this is a in teinha in in the orgin of the species it is in all of is right lamar did not even really make the distinction between the generations he had many other reasons for being wrong but he connected the terms in helteds faqui trates to avolution and this is some of the reason he that he was vell con tovessial even in his time t were other reasons for exampel he ejected current the hemistly and though that he can explain everything bas on naris to tellian fluits earthwin fireand water there is some people nner ne think they can dhiscard with camistry and exwhain everything ass or erta when you hernd and this was not only biologit was also the weather and es that was part of the reason but m la mag solamag made many mistakes but it did have aaa foll tear of inhelitants which was a big a am step towards wele we are to that to day he had important contributions nevertheless although he was mistake about the mechanism wut he believed everyone else and drives the volution is the transmission of the trates that you acquire during your life oter tha the things that you do or dont you doit talked about use and this use of of certain organs that shape theeen our organ than eventually also the organs of the nextionrition he sounds a willbe the a the first self help public figure right wo this idea you nones is heavily embadded into a lot of the a helf and fina space on te and tweter in in sereminon te internet which is that and it is ye anat the idea tha were sold very early in life at this cern inite states and probly elsewhere which is that we can become anything that we want to become and that that will forever change the offspring either because of nature or nurture rigt and this is a very dangerous itim as il explain a second andly led to horrible things this is part of the reason that this is such at ta book it is not only self help thou your helping yor ol this help in yourself the problemits with when you arplie to others and this happened in a very very dramatic and horrible way an in in recent in the recent pass as i il tell him second la marg this what he believed and and he thought is what it is wt this is how wevolution proglesse pocesson and later an darvin and showed that its really naturalt selection the selecting of them the people that o of the organisms that are already am that already contain tha the the particular qualities out selected based on the wether they viveo not in poticular inverments and therefore the a evolution pogess ed they become more common and take ove this very different two diffent exsleches the most common wey this is a contrasted is that neck of the gelas is is the classic exemple accalding to to la mak the gelavs had to stretch their necks towards the treets to it when the treator when the trees were high and because of that ther the they transmitted this traits long next to the children also had long nes by the way the only mention this exemple yi know ahandful of times is siden really foks the and accorsing to that wi just that the agelathat would happen to be born with the long necks sorvive because it aite its genetic heritable matelias in knowabout genetics bat a are take over and the rest of the gelavs that have different heredeblematilas just die this natural selection vills as inhelitants for quitrit there are many reasons why lamacis e maninheltons are quite fate became such a bedturn one of the biggest is what happened in the soviet union under stalin there was th a scientist called thisemcle who thought that a mendellism and nomagenetics is a bourgeois science shouldnt be done and wever did nomagenetics was either killed or sents to thand siberia and and he thought that just yi said wakend not only weakend becomeyting tha wemant but we can grow everything that we want in every field can taker frosand fiel an ro potatos there and on and this led to massive starvation whroin agriculture in in ina inin the sovit unan also wo insides for many manils and put the very dark cloud on the entire fielt and only proply in the eighties of something thes the fil tarted to recoup ofit for that a side for that which is a very damatic thing there was also trazy stories a around and attempts to to prove the inhelitants or quitrate despite the ralisation of many scientthat this is something that is very there all that nomally does not hapent tititis not to nomal way that inhelptants work and i can a tell you about two such bamatic cases that will illustrateit please in thet in the beginning of the twenye century in viena there was the risalchar called pall camre was a very famous and and also very color for figure who did experiments on many different types of animals he did experiments on tolds that accalled the midwife's told because the male and a carries the dheeggs and a there is a beautiful book about it from from a castle telling the story what happened them and he the there couple of types of of toads some of them live under water and some of them live onlend and this tods are different in the shape and in their behavior and of course the capthe capacity to live the underwater is one thing but also the the mophology an an appearance changes the the tods that live underwater develop thise newpital ped is black peds on their hands that allowed the males to grab on to the female without slipping formadin formade and the one on lan do not happen he claime that he can take the toads and traine them to live on de water changing the temperature on all kinds of things very difficult animal to work with eventually according to camele they will acquire the capacity to live underwater and also change tho physiology in develop these new black nupital pets of their head with this discovery he traveles the world became very famous ad a this was a just the beginning of the previous centually and as the person who found the true for in heltons forquire trates despite the controvalty and on and ther n the beginning of the valusation of how it actually workh with the ananson not with the any but with the am an natural selecandina can livem and ther and people din believing he was actually under a lat of attacks but it seem convincing it the end what hammentis that they found that he injected ink to the toads to to to make them become black to have this nupital pes o efect the results and am and could not stand up with aand tand the accu accusations and and kill hemself well in this book by castelis just maybe it was it was the assisten to did tit who cilo them no no i who wejecttey to to sort of saving from because the the sampes lost the coloring of something it it might be who knows what well in science whenever there is a a fraud accusation or controversy that it is not uncomment to see a passing of responsibility ra a their recent cases their on going cases now or its he question who did what et cetera i shaly i two questions am a before the second story am i'm struck by the idea that he was traveling and talking u'mguessing this wis before power pointing keno but also before transparencies o which your actually were still in place when i was a i gradualte studen for those he do not know transparencyes ter basically am transpare a pieces of plastic papers the a that you put on to a projector and then you can write on them in dud a demonstrations but can show photographs andthings tha an sor housy giving this talks and would he travel with the to he travelled with the sempes i see and and mbasing this on this castler book which is ony its n vercontovelsa it is more of a beautiful story than perhaps athe truth but and and according to the story te had to stand one side of the lectureho with his hands behind the back whi i thes wuld exs examinin the sempes and pass them around and but he cheated some one she he probably he probably dy tat at least that that is the wat most people think ut this was not raplicated i mean also i do not think any one try to repplicate intersing a rerethis is just a point about rapplication and actually another tragic example not but a few years ago a saci who is a as far as we knew was doing very accomplish work an am the growth of ratinas grat literally growing eyes in a dish i think every one believes that result but then there are some accusations about another result u that turned out to be fraudulant and suck i killed himself ras s was a recent this was only but ma five ten years agar am it still happens ye ha i think it is rare butthe does happen e spicily in tis be hi pofa ii would argue i love to know what your number is but i would argue that ninety nine per cent of scientists our speeking truth than our well meaning honest people i to taly agr and a think that a even think when people are wrong it is mosti o becoser evil and tryin t act te lac tat may be the really want to believe their results ithat all kinds of waig to be wrong in an even to a bend truth without no just a blatand fro but bat this is according to the story an example of very bad fot which is igly is rare because most sient as you said this also my opinion or just trying to to discover truth and to the best they cannot wowhy else would you go into it because it is certainly not a profession to go into if you want to get re on the ma a its am holy not even the profession to go into if you want to get famous if you won to be famous youd go to hollywood or am become a serial killer cause they will make spetions o please do not a but a pleas do not do either n a hollywood i suppose for some is fine but in any case am o case o chemer arounnineteen o seven nineteen o six thi is iis likely before thet the hos tet the the cotovesle bok out after thei first wod won ok great am betemers gone his toads with ther am either ink or whatever nupitol pads they have to go back to mating onland id to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens i letic greens now called ag one is a vitamen mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundation on nutritional neends i've been taking outletic gren since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsering the podcast hereas i storry taking ot letic greens and the reason i still take out letic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiodics that i need for got health i got is very important its populated by got my crobioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly imp act our imedia and long term health and those probialics in tat ltegreens are optomo and vidal for microbiotic health in addition at letegreens contains a number of adaptegens vitements and minerals that make sure that all my foundation ol nutritional needs are met and it tas cra if you to try out lethe greens you can go to at letegreen stak come slsh humorman and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix abat lethe greens while you are on the road and the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vilemin the three ca too againd that is that letegreens tak come slash humorman to get the fiv free travel packs and th year supply of videmin de three ca to yo cso this is forget about that we have we also had that the lisanqu pisoed an no that a very big thing and and then in the you as there was in the seventies and eighties ariciser named maconel wi id very different experiments and he was also a character he work he worked on and he he was the joker typ o thain in the published many of his resolts in a and jona that he publishe that was called warms bridels casett and had many cartoons that ser he scarted his own journal he a yes and but one way the poblishoonbut bey also publishin in in very respected e jonas in pal but he was it was a psychologist american sychologist and he worked on a warm ad which i a flat warm which is called planria is very interesting s different and what will discoss to day different typoform and warms ar are very comes of four out of five animals on his plenets is a wrm really yes n numeric its just comt in the viduals we are the exception and teso but but that talk about ha very different warm later this is a flat mor bes called planaria and it is remarkable in many ways was also a moder that many people worked on including tha the fathers of of jenetics at people o saloginnetics likce mogan they worked on in in the beginning but its very very hout to study genetics in this warm because unlike us unlike what we explain beforeabouts how we all develop from spermana neg these warms most of the time the codus just py fisan there turred themselves apart they have a had and the tail and the part of the head wild just tur itself aparts on the tail growin neu t that the head will grow in nou tail the tail will grow in you hav you can even cut them to two hundred pieces each piece will grow into a new warm while and ands they have centralized brains with lobes neverything an even is degenerate iyes he study these warms nd he said that he can teach them certain things associations by carrying all at for i do not remember exactly what he teeds i think it was either lights or electricity with shockdom which wil show them wit with other thingsthat he could train them to learn and remember paticulathi i geth you mig get shocked on one side o the tank exactly and then avoid that side of the tank yes and then iges the question is whether not they areof theyr ripd apartselves and their subsequent generations woll know to avoid that side the tank without having ever been exposed to the shock right without ever been exposed to shock orer they wether the the new generation the new head will be able to remember to learn faster that is another the subtlety that you might have and and this what i said e havent he said he can teach hem certain things re move cut off their heads and new head with all the brain and will will grow and that it will contain the memoy this was the start of the controlsy not the end only the beginning then hi said something even much wilder which is e can train them to learn certain things and then just chop them ut put them in a blender and fid them to other warnts because they are canibolistic they eat each other and that the memory will transfer through feeling this sounds such a germatic feel and that that and by the way this this open the ft people did experiments that not only in planalia but in golsfly fish and certain brodens and thid this memory drain transfer essats inclanting prain and this is in the back when they they had the an idea that some memories could be bolaculos could have a molacolafon which is very appealing solmost sent siencs fiction you can have memory in a tu and the way we think about memoi no moley which is somethingthat ti thisabuted in nerona circats and incoded in the strength of particular scign op seas ant soon but but the idea a you can take and memory in the duceit into a molocool and transfer it around tis very veryinteresting this wy it is attracted many people this ended up in a catastophy there was an energe investigation could not no one can rapplicate anything it was a big mess although there were always scientist to said yes we can replicate is an this they wer in the ba ma conan stuff was tifferent athen people thought that they could not that that thot are problems raplicating by it was not necessarily but some people raplicat by it was not necessarly about replicating the whole thing but the question was thid the memory the transfer i specific or is it an overvor sinc citisation that transmittanc ri lik ecun imagine ha we get transmitted as a hyper sensitivity to electricity a suppostet the specific location that the electricity was introduced o or even more than that even just you knower highpensis pipingin and in general mor your more vigilant hn you learn anything's affast that also poi but his problem was not the accusation it was much worse that he was talgated by the unaborm il this telloways to sent letter with boms to many scientist for fifteen years and and his assistant aganyt assistant i think exploded than this is how his line of research ended just recently a few years t go a ristol chel from boston an mike levin and there and his postoc tauchomrat replicated some of macodofs experiment with the cutting of the head but in the very you sink very fancy equitment and automatthe tracking they could say that they cannot replicate some of this his e his e his experment really and they do not open tackages in that la they have they have interesting stories you should have mike over the ar a familiar with s wit the bett of this work now i did not realize they had don thalexye they publishd it yet a few years ago at this very interesting but course thit thit do not know how it happens the mechanism is unce ma conall went a step further than this nd what fascinating it is that this this rtspirments ere done in the seventen eihtivs hi said it can not only transfer the memoys fru chopped animals but he can take there the anima that that learnt and break it down into different fractions just the dena just the arena just that the fats tht the protayins the sugars and he said that the straction that transmit the memoy is the alena and this is very very interesting because it was a long time before everything that we know about a anitly i'll soon go into myrisas explain what wat we do and then you see that you can actually feed worms with out anay an get and and have manythings happened this is everyone nosises truly this wiy was appealing to to go back to that and anstudied by the way at the time it became pocolal nowledge everyone knew thise experments of the the the startlike episode about it from eighty for ther the are comics books about the books about it this was very and people were eating oulana cought the thought thatos arein in memory this was forst complete nonsense but but this was it made a lod of noise in tisiars she s part of the reason it was talksick until recently you could not touch because it i it was considered soto signs likelis sanco e came nort this was the something you rery diny one a tauch atoy and and then we go back to to to this te studies about inheritants of memory oin healthos of acquire trads in other organisms ind in memelsin in in inument and a side from the dark cloud the this an episodes left ther were alf also theoratical troblems owhy or of why this cannot happen berial that have to be breached for this to hapit and you cand you can talk about many different types of belrials a and and and you can also nevoy down to two main belrins efirst beria we mentioned it this is the separation of the soma from the german by the somaric sells they cant change in response to experience the sperm and the egg the called germsells cannot the was the idea oh their ie lated on what happenes in the som the man who wo wfirst thought about this berial is called wiseman orgos wise mendis wot in the nineteenth century it is called to day the wise man belri suppression of the som from the german only the germline transmitting meticton nextionration and this is also called the second law biology this is very vely undamentals natural selection is the first one tisis an second because it important to how we work to how our bady's work wise men by by the way thought that if you will have direct influence of the invironment on the germsels than perhaps is could transfer to the nextionration it he wasnn as strict as his barrial suggest but ther but this not hout most people remembereit but e thought that this is unnecessary it it is possible that natural selection can expan everything and he compaled to to a as e a boat which is in the ocean it is sailing and it has a sail open sho we do not have to assume that it has an engine the wind is blowing on't have to a somather thing the natural selection might be enough this barrier is still stend ing but not entirely it is brich in some organis we will go into that inte second the other barrier is the itwe now we have to to exto understand other bill we have to talk about epigenetics we have to define epigenetics and what it is and epigenetics is another tern which people misuse horribly and seabout everything that is apigenetics even people from the fiet that that the the then the word itself that the term was defined in the fortis by a wedding toncon for notwellington and he talked about the interrection between genes and that and and the product that act that in in the end bring about the senotape of the consequente and how genes influence development later people discovered mechanisms that are that that a change the action of genes that ifan mechanisms and sarly talking about thes as epigonatics for exemple the theana is built out of four basic elements is o the then th there eighty gilliensy r and thay can be mot chemically modified in addition to just the information that you have in the sequence of the teana you also have this h information in the modification of the basis the most common modification titas been stali moden others is modification of the leter sea of sitosine metilation thadition of a metal group to the sersy and and and this can be a replicated s after the the the thin a the sells divided and a replicate ogentic mateal in certain cases also tthis chemical modifications can be added on and replicate and be preserved for those wo aren a as familiar with thinking about genes a engiine structure an apigeon as coul we think on these imation fore a cleta basissegiaty am but could we imagin that a thrue things matellation a sor taking the primary colors and adding a achanging one of them a little bet changing that the hew just slightly which then opens up an enormous number of new options of colored i ino tatini just more combinations more ways more ifomition there are the modifications of deana and also therere the modifications of the fortins which condensed the deany that are called histons they also modified by many different chimicals again metilation is avery common and modification af cetilation even serotoni the selotonilation of o histons cratone this is a newpaper from nature from a few years can change deana that the not the deinitself but the potin that condenses essentially how am in the analogia use before of a of how the thread is wrapped around the spool sencial yes and and this determines that the the the gree of con densation of the deana whether the gene is now more or less accessive at and therefore can perhaps be expressed more or less this is this is one way to effect that the gin expression and and bring about e function of the gen a many addition wence not the only one thencs people when this was when all of these was starting to be lucid an people talked about epigenetics they sarted taking about these modifications forgot the origion of the phoenition and when people said epigenetis they talk about metilation and thinkling and am again to jist frame the subser we can imagine two identicals twins call mon as igotic twins am we cn go a step further and say that the monochorionic and they were in the same posantol sa cas twins can be raise in separate saxlity different early environments woud say those two twins are raise separately one experiences certain things on the other other things they different foods et cetera and there is the possibility through apigienary mechanisms that through matellation ascilation am seratonean production et cetera that the expression of certain gines in one of the twins could be amplified relative to the other i a ye we know that even i totally identical twins genetically the identica but thet they look different and the are this if we we experienced we all experiences and this is this can happen the cause of these epigeneticchanges i or e can happen because abothe mechanisms because genes response to the environments genes do not exist in a vactum there are a thengines are need to be activated by consciptions factoris an te the whole the the to the lot of machinery that is responsible for making gene's function we are a combination of our genetic material and the envowment when people talk about epigenetics and talks that talk just about the modification there also not exactly right my dephoenition of epigennetics is inheritance wich o cers ither cos sell de vision o moites thingly also for disthe cot cus now accostienerations not because of changes to the deana secuets by but through other mecans i think this is the the the e most e robast that the phenicion that that allows you to understand what you talking about and then again and and then and then the question is if this happens then what are the molecouset actually transmitt information acoscinations ale they that thes cemical modifications to the deana o to the cortins that condentte deana hil the ather modi ado agents the transmitte information and which modecotscion it and i actually think that the most interesting plails to day a alanemolecus but before i go into that i just one say that when we talk about the ballials to apigonatic inheritance of the bellials to inheritants of acquire trate in addition to the separation of the sommar from the german we discuss the other main bellia its called epigeneticarypogomin which is that we acquired are thef ourselves that the the genetic materalin in ourselves acquires all kinds of changes this cemical changes modification with discust but these modifications are largely erased in the transition between generations in the gernin in the in the the he sperman the egg and most o in the erlyamprio most of them te modifications are removed we can start the blank slaye base on the genetic instruction and this is coshal otherwise according to the theory is not clear that actually true because in some organisms dos really happen we will just we will not develop accorsing to the in species tipical genetic instructions to preserve this we we raise the mate the the all thes modification destarn on you and this is inimemas and inhumans this is loudly to most of themnifications on the in the sperm an in the a removes tom about ninety percendle somboly man which could be intest to the idea finershan correctly is that there' some advantage to wiping the slate clean and returning to the original te a plan in in the conjects of the ice of furniture analogy on the instruction book is the one tat tissued to everybody o care every cell right only certain instructions are used for certain celles say a skin cller an or honor of the vircellor on any other cell for that matter through the course of the life span of the organism the specific instructions are adjusted somewhat o caseo maybe a ike o furniture i sometimes u cthey send you seven at eight of particular screws where they send you the proper number but you put them in the wrong place and it sor changes the way that the thing works a little bet once that assuming furniture could r produce a but hearing the analogy the furniture as as the cellar or the organ in the makes with another organism that neens to be rapplicated and the ideas to take the instruction but go through an a race all the penan pencil marks arace all those additional lo modifications that the the owner use eere introduced to it and return to the original instruction i because if you want te bring back the instruction boo cumati to have all the potential to maecall the furnitues you now montit to be restricted to the mones that you made n the particula room it is essentially the opposite of acquired traits an caraterissix based on your a but we say in balgin a gek speak lineage base experience baway your parents experience writy in some ways we want to eliminate all that and go back to just the genes they provided yes but it is more complicant smore complicent that because we have some very striking exemples even inmemis worse some of them of the marks are maintain for example classic exempleis inprint impinting is a very interesting phenomena and the the way theany works that we you you inherit an a copy for every comozon from yor mado and yo fade and then you have in every cell of your body two copies if you are human an of everycoms and then every genius represented twice these are called alis te different versions of theand thend the thougp es that once you and the in the nectioneration the two copies that you inherited a are equal it does not mete whether you eq inquire inquired and from yo made or from yo fader rife there are some situations were indoes met thereis thereis the limited number of genes tha in pri a called inprintences we it does mete wether you inhebited from your mado o yo father and and this is happening through apigion that the conheritancs fhom not because of changes to the veanisequence wit becouse of maintain maintenance of this a cema cemical modifications acrosso itio and as i recall from the beautiful work of catherin dulach harvr that especially in the brain there is evidence that some cells contain the complete genom from mam or the complete geniom from that and it can also switch during your life for her works show that a early on in in in your life it is different whether you express that the matelnalo patelna cope than manor e more and mathu parents and children take note for those were eitherar saying o o the child is more you or more me that can change across the lifes men and if your thinking about your parental lineage and wondering whether not yu cotenco inherited some sort of trait am from mother or from father it can be of course both or can be just one or just the other which i think most parents tend to see and describe in their children from time to time that is just the father that is just mr frendsrattent but it is important to know that in this situation theyve environment played no world this was just whether it pas to the mother or the father snot that the something that happened to the madow of the father affectedis this is slightly the question is now can they envionment change the helitbanty it is very important to understand that there is a difference between nelto an nature aand this is very confuse and people are re its siller sutles or porgnable people tell me i am growing horses for many years and i just know that this horse has a particular a character it is very different from from the other holse and this is epigenetic inhebit no it could be just genetically determenet yes this horse inhelited a gifferent set of genetic instruction it is differed does not have to be aabout a pigenitics epigonetic inheritants a a means that the vironment of the parents somehow changed the the the children and there a there are these two main belrials that a feers that batternects that we have to think what type of molecool and how they can be buaghed one possibility is that this really this limited number of cimical modifications that vive and which is about ten per centalsoo thet could be very interesting not a small number not a small number but perhaps perhaps this is one one possibility the other possibility that ther are other mechaniss the the situation now in uments is that is just really unclear what transmit if it can transmit on which molequal dat we talk later about other organism where it it is a lat more clear but in numents any memas in general there are many exemples for a envilonments that change the children whether they the you need to invogue an epigenetic mechanism to explain this phenomena thisse unclear first wat because it is how to sepalate nels nature from ntur and second because the am the mechanism as just not understood there are classic exemples for in newments there were peers of femine starvation in different places in the world in the netherlands in china russia were people did uge epidymological study to study the next generation than thed the children of women who were starved due and e pregnancy are different t if in in many ways they havea a the different e birthwait a local sensitivity and also some norological change a higher changes of getin some norologic an diseass and this has been a shown a in very large studies is there ever a insio nse which starbation or hardship of some kind some challenge a sensury challenge a or survival bas challenge led to adaptive traits yes there are in different organisms it could be as a result of a trados they could be a downside as well at for exampedor to exep i the coming to mine one of them is that i feu strest mal in i miceor or or rets i do not remember this work of isaben mansui invetiate switzerland if you stress the mals ucan do its in many different ways and i do not remember exectly how they did but you cat you can doyou can separate then from the madels you can do shall defeats oll kind of things then the next an eretions ar lest ses e show less anxiet to the threshold for strassis hirer yes however i think they have memory the tecits and and ado ye abolecroach may be in advantage for dealing with strast could be i do not have any direct evidence at there some there some simmering ideas that u know our ability to anchor our thoughts in the past present to our future seems very adaptiv in certain contacts in other contacts that can keep us ruminating and not rited in a rat adaptedly present to our correou tan othe example is that e an nit nicot in exposure this athing the work of e orliverando i from yumes is i am i from co misthanking in this are not my stadies but they improve that the tolerants to exposur to simula bragus in the next onration the interesting thing here that its very nonspecific soyou you treat them with nicotin but then in the next nation there montolan an to nictin but also to ado tin coqain coqen or that sor make sense to me because a the obvisin nicatin am activates the coonergic system that oponergic system at peneferin and et cetera am and you can imagine that thereis cross over because other drugs who cane in fedemen mainly carget the catacolo men said the dope men in norpe and a fen in in in in this particolar study ifa remember coecti they show that these happens i helitabel effect even if you use an antagonis to blok the nicotin thesepto well it something more about clearancs of xeno bayotics and an hepatic functions that is transmithad in this very non specific what i love about all the examples you given to thaynd and especially that one is and i hope that people a you just listening iam smiling because biology is criptic sometimes he know h the the obvious mechanism is rarely the the one that is actually a plara and dam a people always ask or why wis it tus and i wull say you do not the onething i know for sures that i wasnt consulted the design face and if any one claims they were than you defanly i wanted back away very fast and the and the could de show many trados many tret for for exnape wi stady in also o the many and many other pit stady effect it bisar in in warmth we will go e go deep into that in e second but and show that when you starve than the next inerations an leive longer and this i think would be a trade of wi other things m fertility the nexonerations are mor thick and firt an an an less fir than petepticles of deat they leive long thet could be sno necessarily a goodthing i do not adraw you of course i cause this is magnificent what you are doing in and and a splaying out for us here but to recall there is a few years ago at actually ended very tragically you was an example i think it was down in santiego county there was a occult of sorts that were interested in am living forever and they a castrated the male self castrann themselves in the idea that somehow a maintaining some pu prepubrescent state or reverting to a sudo preprubescent state would somehow extend on cevity the idea that am sexual behavior somehow limited life spend this has been an idea thatas been thrown around in the cond more wacky lon chevity communities am they also shave their heads they alsoal wore the same sneakers but then they also all committed suicide right as the hell bop comect came on town am but that is just but one example of many cults aim that sort of a that obviously was not life extension that was life truncation but am aimed hat kind of eternal life for some sort of a through coloric restriction that is right this this calt also is very into the whole idea that by through coloric restriction we can live much longer which i may actually turn out to be true i think it still debated am hence all the debated by intermien fasting et cetera but also a it is known if you over eat you shorten life this is this is clear it is known that big bodied members of a species live for a shorter lifes than smaller embers of a great danverses or a choao for instance there is some let yu sir of shards of truths in all of these things but i iit seems to me that the rel questions a what is the real mechanism and and why would something this exist riht and why questions are very dangerous vlig you are hi right but but very interesting goes and and when it comes to ma abolecchanges and lutretion th numerous exampens well you i the overfit or star and gets effects in the nextinorations many of them that sometimes the effects contrast depending on the the way you do this andagain thes are none of we do not do any of that in imemos but people show that yustarving or overfeeding the mothers all the fades changes the bodywas of the the next inoration and also theblucostolerant and an other and an analso ta productivee fixis and them and and the defect that the is an effect that there' t that something transmit thes is clear the question is how meleculous is it and whether you need not knew by youligenepigenetics to explaint why do i mean by thit if you effect the nextoneration it does not necessarily has to go through the orsight or the pem and involves ther epigino you change the metabolism of the anymele as it developed and of is it will it a effected the when you for exemple aa starves wemen the tal pregnent as happend doing the the the this famousans starvation studi the the the bab is already inuto exposed directly to the invermet it is not even inheritable effect the baby ias itself that affected its a directessec ther intesting important thand has many implication and it will be separate from the deegenetic should have to take it into account to on to stand what is going on does not requile necessarily new biology nd you you byorogy of inhelitts not only is the embryo affected the embreo whilely nutoro already has gemsens it is also the nexgenerations or is directly exposed and you do not eet any new biology necessarily to explain it and yit does not have has to involge in atepigenetics or epigent ixi is clear to me that in the female feeders they total number avegs that she was some day producean apotentially i hav fertilise by spirm exist but te males with ha sixcydays prm pcycho an leas me the question to an fedale males a males as fedeses levingas feuses innermoms already shore producing spirm wor its the primordial selves that give rise to sirm iso im am not the enexposo don wonder going to the detals of exactly wench in memmer but but yes exposure of the of the mother also affect the eventually the the the the transmistion of the fadher of genetic information for the sperms father and there also many exemples of just resting the faders affecting the sperm and affecting the nextionration there if you go to the extugenas if you gotwo generations down the road not to the kids but to the grank it then it is a real epigenatic effect because e because you you examine something that happens although tha the nextionaty was was never exposed to the origina challenge when we set about epigenetic inheritance in through the paternal linas throug the fanders we talk about and two generations and when you go to the mother its pregeneration to talk about to to when you need to and invoke some real epigenetic mechanism and there the evidence becomes much more scars inment there are exempens more of less convincing the fild is i involging and improving a lot for example now to and many people use tha te cutting ages to use ivies in vit of fotilization or trancer of empreos to make su that you actually t the is the helitable information not the inviroment e o and that it goes through the germ line this is something that is being done out there are study egermeter repared idea for they take the deanay from mom the spirm from thadan they take the deanay from moment put it into a novel side of one or know not at all y u who just you just take the sperm and transfer it and feltalize t at the ther ther an aneg sa standard idea yes the under i weyela you can do it in many different ways but is i did that you separate that thet the environment al ofthe envowment of the mather from the inhelitants on he old envowt of the father and a to to control and separate nature from me that the enbarme becomes the culturagese yes the filly is is improving people do expermentet have a higher ends or more replicates and better controlled and there are some example for effects that transfer and it depends who you ask whether people believe it or not many geneticis do not believe it and many people do belite and it depends on the community ther strong resistance for many reasons some of them are are justified some less justify than are part of the scientific causes and how things work because it its its a new its challenging the dogma for this is very interesting on its on if you as psychologist many psychologies believe that thos heve able trow mind and thing ta population geneticis less this really depends and i think that we are just at the appointing time will we do not really now whether it happens at to what extent and when it digl studies even if you think about nomal just genetic studies where preople trying to understand the genetic unde opinion of a complex trates m any think that involves the brain pretty much we now know that you need to stady many many many people now this big genon wide associations studis biggenetic a studies involve hundreds of thousand of people now one deid an expements that is for opigenetic smuch rmor complicatebecause you need to also taking to account the environment an to if i know iam not even sure we know how to edesign such an explemet is very very challenging the part of the resistance resistant to the idea is based on to lor toa theoetical grounds because of this beryes and because of the of the controvercies on the other hand there is people really want to believe it people really want to believe it because it sorts of gives your lifes meaning if you can change you will be biology thrue changing of of your kids wrou changing your birot soto psychologically i can understand why many people want is to heaven even shredding ar the same as the phisitis he wrote a avery important book in fogty faults this was before them the double he lixs an the and i that it is callt what is life this is actually a book that was drove many by physicis to establish molecolobiology is very very important and he talks about the helitable matilant also toks about evolution and is said unfortunately la malcism or inhelitants of a quietfatis untenable does not happen an i ye rights this very very said or unfortunate because unlike dalvinism or matural selection which is gloomy does 't matther what you do tenectionation will be borne based on the instuctiun in te sperm and theeg does not met you cannot influente of course you can give your kis money an education but you cant by logicaly interented you can also am one thing a fascine by for a number of reasons is partner selection i mean in some ways we think o we we on i find some one who is deer kind that does seem to be by the way the primary feature least in a the date i tell us we davedbostsom apart casts om how women men that people or kind there is also resource potentialeres also beauty or im aesthetic attractin thess an males and females et cetera im mel male female female as the case may be but interms of re productions permag a male female obviously were selecting for a number of traits but presumably subconsciously we are also selecting for a number of traits related to vigor and in the idea that if we were to have offspring with somebody that those traits would be selected for and we actually ve a work on that inematos that i'll be happy to tell you about in h second after we be thedal o the dating and a the dathe daling in warmth we and and and were we understand the mechanism and and well goin to that e in a second but the or in a few minutes after we we we diving to the warmth but ther but yes the thor riginal am calcuulations of how population genetics work to simplifi things in to do the mat wit wud be as it was rando mating of course it does not work that complicatthings because we know and are thos wesas per about potential capacity to somehow sensee imuncompetability in things that which is i do not know i'm not an expert on that but and the neither my but my understanding is that of course were familiar with the other traits we selike for a potential nurturing ability whether not some one is reliable predicts something about their nurturing ability in for offspring potentiaemin that you can draw lines between these things without any a direct evidence but but they seem logical riht that somebody kind we might also stick around or be honest in these kind of things ther at hey make sense but that one would be selecting for certain biological traits a mun function or am some other form of robustness that were not aware of is i think of fascinating fascinating area of biology as this is were that thet the the workin memals spend however does also one adition of think to to mention which is that on top of am cemican ot difocations to the denin and am an eportinc condense tat the inawhich are called histons there also other mechanisms at might contmeting formation including tonsmission betweengionrations of alany and theare different types of agane not just the arnyth we mention before the messenger lagane which impotes for been formecio for making potin but oso ade anes the tregulatgian expression and this is and i think that in recent fears also in the mamelians fiel a arnay as the morlicote tas the potential to consmeti formenchbetween inoration to sento state i think this is the catinget and a lot more to understand han no bat rne has a loto potential for doing that as we will explain son but we have to go to worms first thank you for that incredible over view of genatics and arna and i epigenatics and was essentially a survey of this very interesting am and on the face of it e complex field but you simplified it a great deal for us in our transition to talkn about worms i would to plants o flag in the a in the humorman lab podcast and say that what we are about to discuss is the first time that any one on this podcast has discussed called model organisms i may have mentioned a fly paper here there oa study on honey bees and cathene and a flower preference at one point but tibically that is done in passing and we quickly a rotate to humans i know that many if not most of our listeners are focussed on humans and human biology and health et cetera but i cannot emphasize enough the importance of model organisms and the incredible degree to which theyve informed us about human health especially when it comes to very basic functions and sells right any one could argue okey that and there is been some debate telemers and mine to that really lead to the same tor of data on human tocete there are the those cases certainly but model organisms are absolutly critical and have been and basically and for most of what we understand about human health before we am start to goin to the description about worms per say could you just explain to the a general audience what a model organism is right they are not modelling they are not posing for photographs obviously am what what that means and what some of the general model organisms are and why youe solacted were elacte to work on a particular type of worm to study these fascinating topics that in there is ezero question also take place in inhumans at some level it is it is a as a real pleasure and an onoto represent the model organisms here 'm really happy just for that is is fosworth it an because as yousm modelorganisms i extremely important and we learn much about about biology through them that the modelorganisms mean that it is an it is an organism that many people work on tdoes the community of people at work on people work sudi many tafoganis but notaround everyorganisms o a ahuge community o reselselves that comthat a combine forsas to crate ll thet the we says t the tools nd t understanding that acumulaes there as just a handsful of modeloganisms in the his in the short history of the field of biors not long we learned about every aspecal violity through them including many important diseases a human diseases and these are a e call li bacthelia age which is a virus of bacferia am flies warms they are called feeling ants namatotis is what we stud in the lab fish which are called tebofish the pondico danyo deanyrs ritia and and of course there also modeloganis otemoi and mous and am and also a plans important plans the most imstudyes money is the roby doxes an perhaps less nowadays but none human primates machac monkeys marmorsat squirrel monkey in these i i do not know exactly how to the phenicion is but emaraging modelogans the many of modeloganines daly melging and there communities at afont including us up around the flanalia that we mention before the flat worm that re generate is the great moder for studig the generations if we could develope new heads twuld be incredible and we can learn from thise oganis and the reason that we can learn a lot also about humans by studying this animals is that we all evorv fon the same ancesto we shalled we shared we share a lot of our am our functions with them and also alot of our genes feelegants and and they have the different modeloganisms have different at vantages that serb us they an they sometimes have some things that aure much more apparent in them we can study for example learning in themoway was largely studied in the beginning in asnail a plesia whem many of the discoveries were made because it has big noy one that you can easily study and d an examile anyes smails learn as they learn even sthe elegancs the at this nematodes that we study learn and the ar mut simple de e another important reason to sending them of course as yhe can you car actually experiment on them we cannot do this to humans the thing that we do to thise animals am aand we can change their genes tho all kinds of thinks tothe and in some arsard interrupet in some cases think youare going to tells forinceance ind seelegancs in particular they what the presence of particular selves types is steriotype that you can look at several different worms than you can they at the community of people that study seleganceis literally numbered and named each nuron that two laboratories on opposite sides of the world cand publish papers on the same nor on knowing that it is the same noron unde lo different laboratories something that is extremely hard to do in any mamalian model a mouse or a certainly in humans and a as posed huge sha oenges that uf give greaty vanges to studies of things seoliant heas seeling at this is the star now of of but but and and this wot what we study these are mematod small warms round warms that the just one millionit alon you cannot see them with the naked i have to look undo te scope where di they live in in the natural world they ththe used to call them soing them a tout but this not really true the them in many places but the most in in brotten fruits and lives and an you can find them in the ground as well but you can also find them and and are three living the not paladites but you can some time also find them in snails but but the best way to isolate ims from rotten fruits i the idea ther not parasides i amonly fe will gets lose squeemish abutnushion heracides we has o they are not prisides theyre really fund to handed because small and easy just grow them on plates with eger and ecle i but tear this is what they eat in the lab you can to speak them with ta am with a smallera pick whyr pick move them around and change ther ther ergens and do many things o them but but they have many advantages for noyo sints and fo studying in helthencs as you mentioned they have always certain number of sets and the but seeling ats them a to always has nine hundred fifty nine set in its bady that is it canot nine hundred nd sixteen no na nine fifty a the nine fifty nine and out of which three hundred and twu are noyrons always three hundred there is the uge debate now overtwater on whether it is three hundred two or three hundred i iamin either one a get into trouble lo ke but people take this very very and hard i think it we hundred to but wi less not get into because i'll get into trab when we can equilebrate all things here by you say three hundred two granted your far more informed than the small organism that i am worever will be i'll say three hundred and then were balance in terms or aris in politics in the se elegan its an its always the same and each noyone has a mane you said and we we not only does every noyon has a name many of t of them we know what they do there is a am a few sells that our sensory norons that te a sens particular chemicals in serted situation we know that the and cemical will be sent just by one noyon thar the motonoyons and intono not of et we know how many dopomi noyones there and ottony nos and we know them all by the neme not only that we know how they are connected to one another we have a met a conecton since they eightis a sabway met tells us which no one talks with which ado noons and it is the same it was used to think to a people thought tht it was eexactly the same between genetically agandthe conworts now we know that o sli differente as but by loud it is the same and we have a met of old method we can use to study the called cannecto the connecto not only that the wars out transperent we can actually see the no ones fire using particular tut and we can activate genes and silogens using op to genetics i ca was discussing on the potcos we can make the warmth go for or backword or lay a neg by shining different wave of lang of of life on them and we have very powerfulful av toots for manipulating them brain on top of that we have great understanding of the genetics of the one of of the geno this is seeling at is the first any me to have its sequer its genom sequets before you for that of forteber macteriala and m and we know that and each warmth wroducin each mather poduses about two hundred and fifty babies wech are almost genetically identical we cans and and we know what we get wat were we grow them the th invomit is very contol of thet we growndin in the plate we just macteria we can easily separate tween nature and nelto and and one thing that i wonder about often is generation time even am the miceer not humans mce have certain evanages because their amillian species yu you cannot do all the dand ifisin things you can do in se elegants and mice but one major issue with miceis that the generation time is somewhat long in partu mice they mad you get amouts a litter of mice twenty one days later might semyoce a that is only twenty one days or but if you are grageus sunour postoctrine o do a project i mean that can extend the time to do experiments out three or four years comheard what you cal do in seal your absoltely rattis is on f the majo advantages the generation time in selicanst is free days freediys you can do hundreds of warm generations in one pigety tis very important not only that evere wrmth wu will produce hundreds of pogenies you will have thet augeneticaly identicals youl have rate statistics for your experiment and the worms probably do not mind living on these agar plates in munching away on ecoli were am tis the wood it is questionable whether not mice or at certainly a listen i i i a proponing of well controlled a over and as long as tere's overside an animal research it is necessary for the develoman of treatments of diseases that that am hinder humans but it is always a litw bit of of a of a kind of a a cringin go kind of thing when you are dealing with with maimals that are living far outside their natural environment you i be lying if i did not say that it it gets to you after a while and if it does not get you can of af ter wonder about your own psyche a bit i i also think that this is important but for me it is much easer to work on warmths an do not have to i no e feel bat about it yet they are happy at there happen t yo also a means if if or warm dies its lan less painful to the human than i an other more sensitive than ma a te a i would argue yes i agree yes ther the are many adventedes for studying selin and in the warm we now have very obvies and clear cut proof that there is inhebitants of acquire trate much that i do not think that any one pretty much in the apiinatic feeld argues against it well and in large part thanks to you and the work you have done could you tell us what was the first experiment that you did on seel againce that confirmed for you that there is inheritance of acquired traits because of course i the best experiments and experimenters am always set out tit disprove their hypothesis and when the hypothesis survives tdespite all the control experiments and poking im proding in the attempts to contradict oneself then it is considered ta victory but it is one that you have to be we all have to be very cautious about enjoying because a of the tendency to want out our hypothesis to be true what was the first experiment where you were convinced that inheritance of acquired traits is raal the first experiment i did was when i in my postok she did with olivohopetin unversive columbia and we set to fast wether warms can podusprungenration al for long men wulipatination tit resistance to vilses while this is a very pertinel heate which is relevand e and and warms these warms do not have dedicated in munces we do they do not have teseids or besais they defend themselves fom vises very ifficiently using alena in fact when we started these experiments there was not any natural vils that was known to infect the elegants which is amaz cosvilses are very good as we all experience now in infectin and th the wrms a resistent to visses because of a alanymol could showt anymollcuds that testoy vioses and these are called smolelanis now we need to discuss them for i explain my experiment in am two fousand and six two resatures that were studying selegants and to filand and clleg me lo gat the noble tries for showing that there is a mechanism the regoude gin that happens for smollalanies but they have shown it that if you in ject the warmsh with ainay molecurs with are which are doublesterindid they lead to the sihe to to they shut off the gins that course spont that that matth insequence to this lena su sort of lik taking the specific instructions for the coffee table from your icea a hambug and you in sert a copy of that into the book and in doing you prevent the expression of a you serv a rase the original page perfect expanation perfectlyssonation and for for they found it doules tendarane arnethe tos two strends is what starts the response leading to the production of small arlani molicors which are the one that actually find they messenger agane and leads to tis destruction silenceit you do not get protincitiem for that they got the noble price after people found that this is conselved in many organisms including humans and now they are now drugs this was only in two fousand six that the noble prize paper was publish in ninety eight they are now drugs that use this mechanism also in you ininoment n o just intrjection say that not only is a a recen discovery and an incredibly important one but any firin cragmaler also really nice people ybe gius have me very nice people an cragmes and excellent am i thing is a creet serfer a when i s at the only time when medewin person was at a meaning in her a black eye and i tho ocar well i guess heis also giduas ter something but turns aut hed a tan tha kit serfan am scientists actually do things other than am a do the laboratory a noble price whening scientess tads o c a that you continue thanksful alana indreadible scientism theye were also am studies in many organisms on the mechanisms of how this happens it is called arenane till slas are notet interferes in the expression of a gen in the in the function of a gin and it was also call gen silencing because this arnes infolcs the silenceing o gese instead of that yinc being expressed their silenceit and you do not manicesto function already in the pape the first paper that they published about this where they have shown the doublestendaranes whatch leads to the silencing ot the control they have shown too well important things one of them is that if you inject the warms with doubles andarane you do not only see ther action in the sell that you inject that or in the tissue that you injected tut you seit all over the worms body itspreads it was not exactly clear what spreds buit was clear that its spreads you see the silencing all over the body this includes also the germsonsso if you injected uble stendarane just to somatic says even to the head you will get also the effect in the jervses and in the next generation in the immediate cogin in the esane generation the the kis this was really clear poof that this is inherited however this is just one generation an this originals than later the shown something which will iimmediately remind you what i told you about with planaria that you can just take warms and fid them on bactilia that porduce this doubles tendarana and that the daubison and the silencing wid t e move fon the sight of injuscient from the gat wit the barterial eaten to the rest of the body and also to the nextenaration before we laght when i mention thi cannibalistic experiments of mecone with the planaria and now you see that it can happen and and this is not contovasa to this is being done wutinly every day by any seiling ants biologist in the word this has been alican a milliontime not only that you can also feed planalia tis other wormts we argena just put it in shopd liver and let them eat it and again tis will signences froughout the body wild and this is what we do wtinly we always when we want we use this technic to see what gins do if we want to see whether poticuloginis importent for a certain behavior oo but a certain than something the way to study is is to nutralize the gen activity and we do it by just introducing the worms with doublestan daranay that correspond in sequents that mention sequents thisgin this well lead to the silencin this activate the gins activity and then we and if then that that the ffect stops we know this geninis is involved in the n and we never wantedge ust examine one worm we feed the mather with dabstandarone and then we examine all of its cilder we can have the statistics over hundreds of worms or thousands of worms this is validated and not contovosa norland totaly woutin is it fair to say that meconal's experiments am chop bleanding up these worms regrafhicimage plending up these worms and then a feeding them to other worms a planaria that those experiments can yes be explained by an double strended ar nay which and through our nage rventially it has not been done yet we are working on it an mylev now in clobers in with other levs bas it was not publish but ye as this this could be the explanation i m file and melow di this experiments some other people ti this experments when i started my work a wanted to see whether in aticial to artificial daublestandarana some natural trate can can also cransmit costionations because of arene co the smorlones rit because them injecging our na ire an in intrsordernfering ar ns that is or an in a putting worms in to environment with an bundancs of inhebatory arnas as an experiment is very different and worms experiencing something and then passing on that acquired trat to their offspring and it is tet's a world a part in my opinion it as onos in ory manapulation the illustrates an underlying principle the other is something that infhery o curs in passage of an of generations just naturally we going from the lest subdificient to the mootisis and that the advantages just wi modeloganisms that the moraltificial ity is the hisit is to exactly what you did just now i thoud dos one fact o you can follow the resolt this has always the trad what i did was in allivos leb is to see whe ther the magic part of the magic for the worms resistance to vises is the capacity to transmit in formation in the form of alanemorcus in hibitoylane morcus to the nextionrations and it has been shown before in seelegance that the worms vas this vilses be using this mechanism this smaller anas in fact this is proably the reason that thes smller an is isvolved in the first place too that rid of vilu sens and ader an parositic genomic elements and and this is a mechanism to fighter and what i i did is a very simple expement i took worms and i insfected them with the vows when you do this this also has been shown in the pass the worms destroy the vows we them on stratte this very clearly using ta a flowwescent vows when if the it if the vol supplicate successfully the worms as turns gran a gren and if the varms is destroyed the worm stas black this very simpl secl clear cato not this you do not examine the worman as squhether it feels good you just see the green binary respon yes si and we we took worms we infect them withthe flowesin vows they destroyed this also has been done in but then what wih it is we neu tralize the machinerly that make smaller anase in the the scendents of the worms they can not make smallernas from the start on their own because they just do not have the genes that you need to to make thi molones and then we ask when we will what we happen will will effect these worms with the vows will they be green or black they cannot make their own smaller nis they cannot potact themselves on their own the only way for them to stay black for hav them not having the vol supplicate as if the inhelit ta smaller nets on the pe and this is exactly what happens all the worms proging although they do not have the gen that is needed for making the smalertanas ir black they signd the vows and this also continues folodition an genration they the parent worms affectively put something in tco the cinatic cinstructions of the offspring that would afford them thes but called an advantage in this case wet aford them an advantage if they were to be confronted with the same thing that apparents work tact and we know exctly what this advantage is that the inventage is are shsmall arnas that match the viral genon then just shop up that viros in the nextioneration and we can identify the smaller tanas in that the iipitoagonas in the dessentence anthough they do not have the machinery to make it just because in ha we can identify them by sequency i i aa sinquittinguich is theanysequeting youactually get the exceesinuents of the alanin woas and we can see that they colespond to the fos and they have the inhelity smalle anas only the pite penants wo infected with them their specificity there the sinspecifi yei's not some just general a rasilients passage ract i have to be careful in drawing in analogy that is not correct and i want acknowledge that what i am about say with certainty cannot be entirely correct but the the nalogy that comes to mine in mamals is this idea that if one generation is stressed that their offspring may in some cases have a higher tstrest threshold rasilients distress i can imagine why that would be advantageous either parents have a hard life they have offspring and they want their children to have a higher threshold the strassbi a stresscan in hibit reproduction et cetera and though i say it they at the end of the day and at the end of life a evolution is about the offspring not about the parents and every species pretty much seems to want to make more of itself in protectits young one way or another either through nature or through nurture this is a nature base protection of young is it fair to say that in themamalin experiment with a passage or stress razilients that it could be are in a based that that would be for absi set some new threshold on lucacorticoid production here iam speculating but and i want a highlat in em speculatie mi am speculating with a reason whichis i think for people that ar hearing about this in worms you do not a beautiful a job of splaying out wy a monlorganisms are really important but to think about how this may operated in our the passage of human generations i think it is a reasonable thing to entertain right and and if it is true that also ai in a memas now arnases in smaller anas or lindin candidates for sameply that couldmediates the consmition of of es protection or also of humful effects the cone between the nie perhaps arne do it however in warms the arnes hav one more triek that we do not we do not know the equivalentn memas et this is something very cusia that we show in that public without paper in the felst paper which is the affect that i descrabes this transmission of resistance to vilses through thes arnas toesn't only affect the nextionration it also of ect murti pe adition an eneris it gets past it get past and you af ter ast toself how does not it get dilutes why we wise't it diluted i because i mean every one produces two hun fifty babies you delute by toan fifty and if something is diluted for forgenevations it is two hund fifty times to afifted of the fortinations is the dilution of four billions completely omopatic would never work ther there is nothing left the secret of these worms is that they e have a machinery for umplyfind the smaller an i inevigenation this is called aganae depentent alenapolinas its a complex which uses the arana to find and once it finds the messenger or an a just great many many many many smallerante they do not get diluted than the pass on potition of generation and this is the the trick we later also identifie genes the tegulate for how long an effect would lest otherwise andin if if in beginning we ask why it dos how does in it stop af the on ineration now we have to ask quie dosin it last forever and it does not typically we see that the responseas last not only wit evawitis but also without otrete for a fugenerations free to five generation we found genes that function as th sort of a clok the times the duation of the inheritant what sorts of a genes arthos we call thes genes motecgenes motic i dont know how is your hebrew but motecs are mery it means sweetheart in hebrew but the actuony is modified fans on eration a lepigion atic in ad cinet that there are different types of genes that and for some of them if you mutate if you the srup their function now ar now the effect wil transmit stably for hundreds of generation would never stop cause ther rod is to stopp the inhebitants from going from fomjus you don on a carry over something forever otherwise you it will no longer fit the envowment of the parents thand youll be prepelled for the wrong thing this is importend there are what type of genes are they ongene that we stadid it is conmet to it actually a gene tat and function in metilation of the of the potin that condensi dini this is and thereare but been the athe genes tat effect also poduction of smaller lanate is there some mechanism that controls the deration of passage in a way that logicaly links up with the life span of the organism for instance i knew my grandparents met tem i did not ever meet my great grandparents and i certainly did not meet my great grea grandparents i could imagine tha my great great grandparents or my great grandparents experience certain things that were past into their children and and aperhaps into their children but it seems reasonable giving that humans live somewhere between zero and a a hundred years typically what now eightyyears that the typical ife spent morlans oge that the if i were in a design the system and again i was not consulte design face i would want an adapted a trait to be passed for two generations because given away that our given how longer species lives and certainly given away the world looks now as upos the eternal the previous centsure the tur the previous century def french tressers different adapt your different life environments and what i would want to pass on to my offspring i can pasidly edge pretty well i can place a good bed on the next hundred years may be the next two hundred but i do not have the foggy es clue what the world is can o look in three hundred years is is what i'm say ma any sense whatsoev it makes a lot of sarig and really it youwilling to to talk about two things in response o this first of all and yes you can imagine that the reason that the worms in herts fypically for i free to fivginations is that this is relevant to something that happen in their vauns for exappin an we also show that when you stout the wons it affects the nextenerations again for affugineration which iself as amazing i i just one a high that that a youcanmagin nexgenerations throw a genatic version of be careful ids but i may give you the sextral lunch pack in your geno the protects you against the possibility of starvation but it is also saying an were you to have kid strights they have at als yes i have to but just i have to just make ar disclam the we not don knon that necessarily its adapted tcould also be demage as i said when you start them the nectionerations live longer but this could we attrad of or a trad of or fatilio something othe laps t also a've also shown following our work that if you start the woms the nectionrations o also no resistance to housol starvation thes sounds thi's not my outword but thes sounds adapted but when whenever you token about at thetation you have to sit in the contects of revolution thas also this famous thaing nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of revolution and is it is very hard to say without doing thet labevolusion ex periments we actually see who ins tho once that in hert or the oncso don who takes over otherwise it is it is hard to talk about wet the it staptivo but when it comes to the doation of the response yes it could bwe cogramd to fit something for example if you talken about stavation worms transition between spelieds of starvation an trance pers were they have a lot of ootso let say the fin an apel for wit you generation there will consumed theapel and then the wills be stout for a while perhaps this is the number of generation that takes them to filis and ap o perhaps at the othe responses also to higho temperatures if you grow oms in hige temperatures e offins par are te ar diffent they change how they mate swhat im i loudthe to befor rellyng aa i tha as e relates o hold exposure whech many of lisner and perhaps it is somehow coelated with am o the cycle of the all but to tell you the truth i do not know as i said we we am we go from the mortificial to the less altificial if thothe stenda anagos sympetic arina is the most atifician starvation is motifish in more naturl out that it is not starvation an real the rell con tecs of the world in a real appel is is a plate widow without equal a boctilia it is not an appel on a tre exposed to the elements withother worms with buctere we are withall kinds of complications and it could be that we will see different duations of helitable effects the more natural we go wit just le much less controlable and hard to do wand again w when we token about humants part of the argument by people while the thisbelievers it is not about say but ou know the the critics say that this would not happen in humans is they say youknow the the worms generation times just free days the chances that the parents invowment will match the children in varmate is very hi because thet does not alot of time to for for the vowment t change it plas the can go ver y far small thar many examples of epigenatic inheritants in clents if the big field were the very established a proof for inheritants of a quietly for for apigenaticn has al be more careful a pigon at can in hastocratis more loaded then but in plands it also happens d that you also say thes out sesile organism they cannot run away the envowment is more content ideas i may be just a quic example that i've heard before tellme if i'm wrong i very well may be a frencees i a particular a species of plantat grows a a strat may be slightly bended stock might be exposed to some environment were in order to capture enough am sunliht andother other nutraans my nee to grow in a court screw form the corkscrewform can be inherited several generations this is example that i do not know but perhaps i tting wi that i s in tha someone would ot trust me the one thing we know about bout cassing and you to witl some one will tell us on has a pen please do we invite that ra but thos a long history of epgen atic inheritants studies in plants excellent studies werl control showing that it happens olso terl this is very clear it when it comes to humant you would say maybe my keeds weill go off to live in a different continent and that will be on the computer of every day and everything will be different it makes less sense to prepell them for the same holdships that i experiente however this in my opinion this is this argument comes a lot it is not the best argument because it depends on the scay oo how you locathings we experient we we meet for example am not saying that this is inherited but in humans but we expeends the same patogence in the same vils is all the times of perhaps it is worth preparingful than i cannot not saying that the it happens but but it depends on that on the on the scale but what you describing makes perfect sense and i do want to acknowledge these critics whoever they may be i do have the advantage that i do not work in this exact field and i 'm a happy to stand am an tothe to with those critics now and say that at least in terms of in inheritans of reactions or adaptive or maled after traits to strass or to reward you tought bat nicatine before in a passage of response to drugs of different kinds not being specific to nicatine wissorve a more general am assage of of some sort of information related to a reactions to chemicals present in nextame but other other drugs i have long been irritated am anhe little bit a tickled by the fact that people say oh we have this system for stress that was really designed to keep us a safe from lions and sabe or two tigers sure but the homark of the stress system is that it generalizes i mean if i get a troubling tex message or if i suddenly see a dark figure in that in the hallway when i go to the bathroom at night that i do not recognize both of those have the same generic response which is the deployment of a dranal and of in both brain em body changes in the obticts of the eyes quickening of the heart rat stress is by design generic and one could imagine that a passage of some sort of stress rasilients a or a maladapted passage distress would be also somewhat generic and that is actually advantageous over all same thing with the reward system we know and we have essentially have one or two chemical systems of reward i mean there is the opiot system and there is the canavonoid system but in large part anticipation and reward is governed by the dopoman circuits and anticipation reward of an ice cream cone for a kid is the same neral circuitry that is going to be repurpose when they get to reproductive age and they are anticipating a creating children with their mate and assuming they want to do that the doponurgeious systems can be engaged ice cream sac am a destress to weather stress to famine the the biology of of these more modal systems and especialy in the nervous system are i can have to be careful with the words by design are certainly generic and i do not see the need for for immense specificity i mean its not wore a what covid just happen cound you imagine that there is the passage of a a covid nineteen specific rasilients no i think what would probably be a pasilong wiuld be some sort of if it does occur would be some sort of rasilints to virusis more generally and that would be advantageous i agre and this if this open the question of watis the band we of in houe specifican be that it makes sense for it to be speciic and in the case of sieligans the response can be very specific frutis inheidents of arnies which are just siquen specific te dangegrelet the they the contol one bof piculelgi in other cases it could be a villi geneal response and and and and it is very interesting to think about it when we talk about inhelitants of memoies which is the mose interestingting we could in a can brain activity of sam solt tonsme at least in these words i said no i i said it is disclaim o woule betimes in in memas we do not know times will tel in warms me we know alot cen warms tons metoblan activity to to do they have the specificicbefore i say that i just say that we over the ilslend an lot about he mechan isons that shuttele the alenades between generations we know about genes that armitted just for that about one wuld be perfectly okey but just do not have the capacity to transter the alandes to the nextionerations we know about genes that would make the responses longer or shorten we know about genes that prevent tha transtor of alany between different issues about genes that make certain smolleranies we know a lot about hat and then the question arises we can we can finally ask can memowy canswer between generation i think that first what we need to define memois for that and the broadest the phoenicion would be any and change in your behavor because of what happened in the past or in your response because what happened in the pestl because of your history the mow entos think paut of courses to talk about memois that are incaldet in the brain and the reason is that the brain is capable of holding much more specific and elaboate memoies the i think that any tissues that transmit transtor er ar a to transfit alanyte to the nextinretion and affect anextionesit is interesting the gut mustled everything but the brain can sinthe size in formation about itvilment and about in tell that state and can also think ahad and the most provocative thing you can say is that you could plan how somehow the fate of your net of your netonetion using your brain nw after takan anythings int otisa without talking to them right without talking rit and in struction that again weh yo bact this instruction man youels wriding something ingent instruction man youl based on your own experience right and and can itn and what is the band wit can we transtor sucns and and then i have to agree with you that i would imagine that what can transe them and i could be wong is a a general something sensitivit wwe can mac the aknowlogy to a being inflamed or not wehiposensitive to patogians i hypervigin somethingess but it can also be something very specific we know we have to en to understant that the brain uses a different language then the language of inhelitance the brain the way we knomanlly think about the brain is that it keeps information in sinups is in the connection between theffernomons when you learn something you make you make some connection stronger and some con another connections wicker and you wire the nervous system in a different way the informetion in the brain is seenou ndit it is in the connection on the other hand helitable information of any sort has to go throug butten neck of one sell the feltalized egg because we all stout from just one sell wit can not be in the connections because this sell does not have any connections with out sellin there along it w heletable infommection has to be more lequolalt as to be inside is one ai the question is can you or do you conslate the information the frelystactu information or sin sin upstaids in the corntion between brans in the architecture of the brain can you somehow translated to helta ble information to a molecelofor it' an incredibly important and deep question it brings to mind something that was once told to me which as soon as i heard it was obvious but was very important informulating my understanding abiology which is that a map is just the transformation of one set of points into another set of points right a map of of the world assentially is just you take the what is been drawn out in terms of the architecture in the the coast lines at cetera and visions between states and you transfer that to an wa tronomap for a piece of paper seems obvious a sort of a do why we tallyu mathis but just a make sure that people understand what youare really talking about is but say the memory and i have a very distinct memory for a my childhood fon number phononumber does not exist any more and i will not give it out because then some other berston migh get your with repeat it calls but in any case i remember it it solely useless information but it lives in my you quart exs for my hyppocampus are somewhere as a series of connections between nerons at the locations as you call synapses would my grand children know that phone number there is no ron te lenly no no right would my shildren know that unless there was some adoupt if reason or some other reason for them to know and the upand this passage of of acquired traits a and what your saying is in order for that to happen there has to be a transformation of the nurl circet literally the wiring of nuron a b c d that relates o incarras the information that number in to the kind of newcliotied sequences that are contained in d ana or patterns and mathelation or orana more likely it is the transformation of one set of points in physical space to a translation of points in genatic space is ama and then we have many propets when first of all we do not know f a mechanism to translate between the two different languages the language of the brain and the language ofwe are not familiar with tha mechanismsecond the mexieneration if it is not a worn if it the mammit wuld have a different brin if an if it if if if any it was genetically identical to the peret the the wiling of the brain and thet u tecoulonly ona circles will be different if i true for twins it would always be true because it depends because it is partly random any depends on the envowment even if you have the sande he th let say you somehow had the mechanism millican mechanism to take thet freely information d translated to the mated to the language of inhebints you would then in the nection lation have to translated again to the brain although it is different this sounds very unlike i iam playing a tret on you now analy orc uneasy trai but but but but is is this is how it happend or if this was the quilet it could never happen in my opinion which means and i stiping a that there are certain memoies that cannot transfer trangeneration an this complex and things that you learn about th invarmet that albitraly fear if i none of our listnels kids will remember this conversation no way this is impossible and that orser lesion e rain is o nirarsion the wer yeur pares it erterles rather but but but it cannot transmit because its its random and it this are connection that a albitary this seems to be a limitation what can tancem on the other hand perhaps mor generaltings could pass some this this up ofthings idoubtis however you can nevertheless imagine that somethings that are very specific some memoies at arvevery specific could nevertheless transmit from the brain after learning to the next i give you an example you can teach worms even it al thou they have to spre an to normon you can teach them simple things about the world for example you can takan ado that they warms the wrms have thousands of oudoantecepto and they can recognize many many many moloculs they can smell them they can find food or avoid enemies you can take a fool that the warm s la and aldo that the warms and tell it to something bet starvation and then the worms will learn to dislike this ado we do not know that this learning involves necessarily changing in the strangst of scinences it is a possibility by it does not have to be the case it could be that just ther la septo for this particular audo is being removed when they and this is how they a now they wn't have theles epo they wont smell they will not thado this is a possibility this type of thing you can pe haps not that anyone has show that convincingly transmit to the nextioneration because all it would take is an arany that with well contole this particular ecepton this is a possible people have shown things that not in se elegance but people have shown things tike the sin memels they said that you learn certain thing and then just in nectioneration dus a palticular ecepto wild be matilatet or would change and this would transmit the response and on the one hand it could be true on the other hand you need to understand theyll need to prove an this was not done convincingly enough yet how exactly does information transfel from the brain to the germselves and then ina next o neration from the jumpsons back to the brain to wel the lasepo ni trap oseptonit to operate and this is a challenge this is tha current states oof the feel that this is something that mis to be poven but we thidn't se elegance is we showed that certain e that the brain can communicate with the nextionerations using smaller anies and that this can change behave l and it does not require any translating between any language it is very simple why we have shown it that if you takea warm and you change the poduction of smaller anise just in its brain in the next generations the will behavior will be different if yi though you do not mess with our brains tis the paper that we publich in two fausandin a in nineteen insaid we show that you gjust manipulate that coduction of indolgen to s natural aranaes in the warmsbrain that are always mada to you change tor amount and this changes the capacity of the warms in the next generation to find foot to fin not only in one generation but three generations down the rod and the way did it works is that pertoping the production of this smaller anise in the brain affect in the end the expression of tha gin in the germaan one gin is calles sage to do not know how it works but we can do all kinds of contorts were we manypolet activity of tegenincilities also affect behavior and this gin work in the grmses thin formention its to go from the brain to the jumpsisyt does not it to go beck from the jumps as to the brain to affect behavior and this depends we nothe disis are two apigenatic effect because goes on for multipa generations and also because it requiles the machinery the pranstels alanate between generations if you do not have the porting that physically carries dawlanatet in generation does not happen tot it has to be arn it has to be arni and i not we can actually we can also find allanate in the mexineration the change we sequents the actualalanase the change in mexeneration you mention that you do not know what sage this chene sage does but its it reasonable to assume that it does something in the contacts with the nervous system or that is unclear is well it is possible it is possible but we have reasons to believe for experiments to to show although the could be alternative explanations that its functions fog the german now you may ask how can you affect behavior just by changing the gemses iwell it would have to change the germ selvs in very specific ways because tas a people probly recall the germ wine germsells ar were the inheritable information is contained but you can imagine for instance on a justing the gain or s sensitivity rather on on some sort of a sensury foraging system right right and and that that the interesting thing is that it again can be quite unspecific it sounds will that you change emselves and its changes behave sperman but if you think about it is trivial if you castrate the dog if behaves differently right sadly i did that my dog in i nded a punny montastastron terpulater in a broughtem back tet just as a as a sie as an asire yes this is because the germsels affect the soma including the brain in many ways by te cr itting certain cimicas and also because thet e others sell develop developed from that from the gem ses some information could be transmited over development or the course of development could be alte because of changes the toceri in de gemses ind it for exemply membes o one of the explanations and for how helitable in formation cons met is that te it just affects something very on in development i i i togt you that the ticrets to warms inhelitents is that the have the capacity to omplifiedin smaller and is all the time this is what keeps it going prevents the delusion in memas we do not know of such an oplification that can you ask how can a litle bit of arne or something without complifing affectlanlantiogens and it could be that you just perturbed something in the very beginning iwhen you just have a few sels o even i the in the plasenta that develops inpeganthy and this laters throws everything off and because of that you has you have many problems n metabonies and an on and this is called that the is if thet idea of the developpele tevelopmental oigin of helthin deviv many of tha of the fuction oo car early on in development see raise a number of incredibly fascinating aspects to this i i do have question about one particular aspect and feel free to pass on this for a future episode if its convicus too far off track but something you said it really captured my attention although i was listening to all of it which is that the germ cells in the case of males its can be sperman in the case of females can be eggs something perhaps not coincidental about those cells an the environment that they live in is that yes they contain the genetic information passed off spring of course you explained how that works but also it is a sit it those cells live in a region that is rich with foremons that can be secreted and in fact ar secreated and through called endicran signalling communicate with other cells notjioust at the level receptors on their surface but also can enter the genoms of those cells and modify those cells in other words it seems to me that the michro environment to the germ cells the testis and the overies or rich with information not just for the passage on next generations but also for all tha as you set all the somatic cells of the body their telling the somatic cells of the body what to do in what to becoming the best example i can think about this wd be puberty bhath i mean i would argue that the that one of the greatest a rates of aging and and transitions we go through in life is from pubertium and a child becomes a very different person after puberty they look at the world differently they think about it differently the growth of it is much as about the growth of the hair on the jaw on the atams apple and breasts and on it is a transformation of the somatic cells from the same micro environment that the deona containing a cells reside once you think about yt this it becomes ovious that just by affecting the germs tas you can affect the rest of the body and inf eyly dons theasperment to show it is very clearly for exemple fot tha just take warmth and prevents perm production it changes the capacity to smel these are expermens done by oth which is obviously a draine function and in a casterated dog you are not just eliminating the the possibility of transferred of theana information to subsequent a generations youre also temin o cery tenation of t ya a without question my bll dog costell change after castration and it was a wonderful dog but at some point evolved some healthishes the introduction of a small amount of testostron every other day changed him fundamentally in that case for the better am back to aversion of himself that i had only observed earlier but also a different version the same dog an know he was not humping everything maybe the occasion only a particular people who hav s names i will not mention but it was absolutely clear that the hormoon was not just taking a system in amplifying it it was actualol modifying the system anyway i just wantted am high that and an now am thank you for indulging me i let us am if you will but continue down this path of a that we were going on because i want to make sure that we absolutly get to this issue of transmission of information about sex choice of offsperin the worms a he maphodates which means that they make both pirm and and e but they are also mades which are much more rare and they can choose to mate with ther mals or not and when they mae with the mad its sa use the siso because it is very costly nergetically and they also risk predation and all kinds of troubles the mals hurt them and reduce their lifesmen when they make with him people gan a draw all sorts of analogy here by its inevitable bu a herre es and ands most importently for evolution when you made with another endme you di lutyo genoman hae cause the wrms can just self felt talizes an pens mit they exact them general to the next lestion ben when they mate they they lutitin hev this is a big price to pay on the other had wen you made you they velsy fiogi maybe some commination of gin will be god and we know that in human somming you it is kin interesting that the braing circuits ar associated am with with aversion and with approach are am fairly hard wired for number of things puddle of vomet almost everybody can amange his plate of cokies if you cokies you move towards it but there is one particular word in a the englishman preslinis raily language that that ought to evoke disgust and that insest because incest is actually not just disgusting as a practice but it is dangerous cnatically right because of the in breeding creates a dilitarious metatii thee are studies or how people in israelly kee boots for exemple where they all grow together the children live together it used to be that dont e theytechother for theis a their clastic thing i talk to some of whom the koble y to me that is not true but but yeste thstadis that say but it makes them and in some country scanninavyan contry or in a la plen and isimmer populations are small they keep exquisite records aa lineage in order to avoid in breeding fit u rant you absolutely at but the worms its the safe choice for them is to self mades and and if they make with a male they take ar is but they they vers what what we found is that if you take the hemaphodat te the we can call it thet the female for just one second and you spress it with high temperatures then the next generations of wormth for free generations made much more with mades and they do it because the the female start secreting a phermon that attracts the mads ah o very criptic a mechanism it is not that she somehow changes and then go seeking males no it draws males they draws me when we know how it works we think we know how it wars but happens is that the spress their high tempratures compromise the production of spem in the hemaphodat the harmatho that do not they make spermenough to maken mextonations but the sperm be cause of defective smoller and inheriteds co the arnis are not inherited ocet the sper mis not made opti maly they make less spm and when they do not make a lot of spem they feel that they do not sell fel talise coectly they call the males by secreting the peromons that it would provide it is on spem and they can continue to make tabes we know this also form expermi you just take er maphotat and you kill it sperm thosicistia phromon and the males come it is a need thase ssal exactly incredible and i hope people can appreciates their hearing us that none of this we assume o i do not ow hav ta speak worm none of this we assume is a conscious decision in these animals i much hu human mating behavior which to us always seem conscious but is being governed by both conscious and sobconscious decision making none of this is a active decision to secret the hormon to drawin moremales it is simply a biasing of probabilities right the hormon is now secreted in in greater quantities or more greater frequency the males their for approach more its just increasing probability of interactions at at right rat but heapens natural knomaly if you do not stes the the ansestes is that the warm start secreting the fheromon only when theyr or is also no people will when theye run when tar running out of a their own fertilecs exactly because they only make the spem at the particula kine and then they run out of spell spem they can sell sell te lifes they have to call the males if the want continue to maywell this the sort of the a plastic surgery approach o cay a'll take the heat for that one but but it is true i think as as certain people age to a certain point and they feel that their fertility is waning if they want offspring they need to take any number of different approaches they can get a her which i moat a female but we could also do the reverse rightin we e am a sperm downer right or but if they want to attract the life long made or coparent with somebody oftentimes they will am do things to a just there a attractiveness in any number of different way psychological attractiveness or physical attractiveness i'm not afraid to bring this up because i think that the parallels are very important because i do think that every species and individuals within a species of course decides whether not they want ta re produce or not but has an in harent understanding conscious or subconscious about where they reside in the art of their life spend i do believe that not just based on experience am some people are very attune to the the a passage of time being very fast others very slow i think that knowing how long your parents and their parents lived makes a big difference i have friends whos am fathers in particular died fairly young and all these gise base o got marrin had kits really young rso here th lackly for me i do not have to get into psychology of the worms the explanation is just an instinct when the ranolph of sperm they sosicutin the selemonts and a trect the mate there are sthaties also in newmans about older fathers the children of older fathers have more the hirichance of have of becoming tisi theres that oredy enough they sad however in this case it is not clear that the seasn ot ti tesis something epigenetic would be just because of teanabemants because e acumulate yo nasshe nowadays there a we have an upset on fertility coming up both mal and female fertility and theirs a a there actually deana fragmentation kits first aat home deany fragmentation kits or spermanelses you send us purn back in e don indian people pi petting o a seemen at home woun be an odd picture let us not go there bhat the a but there are a clinics that do this for for phenominal charge but the am but it is i did want i ask about autism and human disease in particular am another thing that you hear sometimes and here i wnt acknowledge autism is on a spectrum some people get upset if you call it a disorder there are some adapt of autistic traits and e cetera but one thing that am often comes up is this idea that to people who are more of the kind of engineering a hard science if you will of finatype mat and have children higher probability of the offspring being on the spectrum uam some people would argue a but that is already selecting for people that might have already been partially on the spectrum may be it is a gene copy issue i'm not asking you the comment on autism in particular but when you hear things that that a the children of older fathers uam one from older fathers ten the higher probability of autism what is that u at the level of intuition does that strike you as an emptygunetic phenomenon as a nature nurture a mishmash or the possibity that is are in a passage a or anything does anything sort of a trigger the whiskers a you or our u spity sense in that case i would go with the moposemonious explanation which is it just lest fidelite o evo tein in lest theana maintnance and some damate that fasses on y does not have to be an empugenatic thig but the spurmer generated at once every sixty days the damage must be at the level of the germ cells not having the proper machinery ri might a condrer something or the dene repemsn the in ele pamising thatit would be defective o woul the work less well in ol ther people leading to the constant podaton of jumps as we mormiticient te sai the posiby do we know exactly what the deona repair machinery is yes therer many types of veaneripe the those on tha us other copies of the deneto to e a to corrects there ther onei just recognize old kind of vlegians on the dene and in removit a it its the very elaboat in complicated system and is it a system that is now tractable that can be a modified through formecology or through anything that soi none about drugs that correct h that impovit maybe they exist tand i am not o were that it is very well understood and the many people ave studytr the a one thing that am came across in the a exploration of the fertility work is that what am about to describe is not legal in the us it is illegal but is legal in the uche and in other countries as this notion of three parent a i an were it does seem that some of the eggs that persist in older females a do not a even if fertilize do not produce healthy embryos they have cromosomal abnormalities a replications in an delesions that are problematic for the development of the emryo such as trising me twenty one the ec down cindrum in part or in large part because of defasits in the mito condral geno what they now do as they take the because the mighto condroginomer resides mainly in the cidoplasm they will take the aan egg from the the mother the sperm from the father but they will take the nuclios from the mother and put that in to acidoplasm of a younger woman whose might a condrol deana is healthy then use the sperm to fertilize that egg and i a and that is why it is alled three parent iviaf then inplant that into the mother and this has been done several times for in cases of mito condreal damage or a or a mutations in the in the mother it works the question is whether or not those offspring will grow up to be healthy this of course is not just ap pure divergence it raises a bigger question that i have for you which is in terms of the work in either sealegans or in other model organism but in particular in sielegans where do you see this going next and if you would indulge us i would love you to tell us a little bit about the admittedly unpublished work that you are doing on temperature a exposure and enbironment i mean how maliable is the system because to me it just seems incredibly maluable and yet a lot of is still cloaked off to us thei're still a ton to learn soming that we will discave simula things in inhumant which we do not know that thise is the case but let te we we find i think tha many things you can do befor you changes for exemple a ou can you could also change it chant change and apparent inheritants by and having the the parent exercise somethings this have been done for example and e'll experments in in rodencs were is show that the overfeeding the ther the rolants crats problems for the next onorations for the for the children however if you let the the the rod and exercise then it corects tha belantin a this is one possibility nd you can also manipulated at the at the sols you can change if it is arnase that say you could in the future perhaps if we understand ow it works actually change the composinsion of the helit of alagonae by eating or nase tustli the worms a rornasand we know a the aronis in which woild be difficult because it is not ci doknow but but you could if you do isyes u when vit of fotilization you can perhaps change te composition of the agonase in the the stuff that you into dose but away be fore that what you could do perhaps even in the not far future is use is for dignostics theana base the dagnostics for a every couple at once to have a kid you can inisrael this is done for for most couples you can look at the theanay and look for genetic this is but no one look is looking at the arna the moment if we understnd how it works better we will have another level whole new world to look at and perhaps there will be some agonase that coelate wit disease that tat the will say o cay you knot have at the the beauty is that this unlike the innay it is plastic with the nay this your dear nay perhaps we can choose another embil but here you can say perhaps o again the future this siscienc tiction does not happen now if we understand is in its true we can say maybyou should run on the tread me the little bides will change the poor fallow of yo agonase and then we will luse it for ive yers this seems mow because just it correlates with healthy pofies o valanes this is a level that no one looks at now and holdgreat potential again with a disclaiment that we no know how it works in humans at all yet yet of course is wote wat wy quite interesting ya superinteresting me un incredibly promising long no lines of things that one can do in the short term and your experiments on se elegance a lovfou it chare with us what youre observing about cold exposure and how that infact subsequent generations of see elegance and i any few would indulge us with the story of this discovery some of the earlier stories you told us it is a a surprising and fascinating one il gladly tell you about this is noted a store about trungeon lesionnetit it i stor about memory within one generation a excuse me i will in one generation and agan as you said the stowe of how it happens it its its its totally by excelents e funny story and im i'm bring it this up because i now dana lanch afer the uge fen of your postos really be happy that t that i is sas her work this is her work and this is unpublished work if is iven i within even finishes owere working an oce on wor that is poblish wiwill feature the paper case i lof the stec sorifessol qret what happened is that when you we talkd about tanginerational memoies and i said that in warms ther are very long tongineration an memories if with a generation time for selling unts us three days some emois last many generations way beyond the the life spen of them of the orne the lifesmen of the worm is three weeks genere you have a nutunlation ovry three days but every warm lives for free wi but there was a lot of wice to shows that unlike helitable memoiwch can be very long the memoies that the warms acquire duing the life time is very short lived if you teach something after two hours it forgets for exemple you can teach the worm you can take an odor that it likes and pall it with starvation and then it wild dislike the odo and then there is a simpathet jus put it in a plate you put tha the order in one side and controloto another saden you see whether is prefers tis odoonot and it stops preferring it a there is felteals or mo of risat fotials of risos on on this showing that the worms forget af to two hours there ison i went to study she elegance is that i wanted ondersthan memoi co because such is simple nevosis simis i maybe have the contentious to aption in thano it worth but this is likely this apponty because the forget of to to us o what is it execa my idea was and i tried to convince students to do it for ten years is to take the worms teach them this association to dislike theodo that they nately and then just put the worms in minos eightyans freeze them frees them completely them and see whet that they still te member af to they ofthot the hunsol expresse and an ideala want to do it because i o cli resolvation of somepingn this i wanted to do it because as better than me manytea is about memory say that you need electic electivity to maintain the mem ne to revelbrate it in the brengurin dreams or replay of the thin or whatever and if the memoies will never the less be kept even though the worms were sosand in minos eighty it would mean that it was kept in the absence of of electricity begloselves no welectlicity in minosate degris this was th ided i asked many students no one wanted to do it because of wit is not easy and also sat a little craze well and when the pia the princebone dus getter alave has a pad experiment no one onts tha tatitoor ais universaly tle i i and then don agree to do it don a lonch i was very happy only lato to find out that she ignoed me completely and did the different experiment the expment that that a did in in instead is to just take the wrms teach them as sociation and place themonies she wanted to see how the kinnetics of memory ans forgetting change in low temperature because maybe whatever memory is the break down of the memory is affected by the temperature a very simple the idea we notring the experment the diffen experment here bu ta cooll experment very coger and what she found is that when you place the worms on iyes after the teaching they just do not forget if then even ten times longer than controll ones at that point after twenty four hours if no one wones forget of the two hours after twenty four the wrns woild become six nomally we do show to explements but for two hours the ones onfobes this is cool but it was only the begin because the bowing explanation is just what i just said that everything slows down in low temperatures the bregnon of memory and gan we do not know what it is but whatever it is happens slower in low temes res but this is not the case it is not merely the chysical its the respons is the changing of the intendal state of the worms which affect the memorykinatics how do we notice thos beautiful work of the last one is on called tolenans in se elegante nemators if you take the worms and you place them on ices she did but longer for forty eight ours they all die however if you take the orms uctly made them to lower temperatures for a few hours five hours eminmo and then place them on iyes they all vife they become called tolonent and people who study is showd this invoves changes in liping metabolism and manythings thanna took the wrms ucgly made t them to slightly lower temperatures made them called resistant and then toht them ther association and place themonice and ouly forgot immediately wich mean that when they changer intendal state to become called tolern they no longer extend memorisoniht whichc mins is not only the temperature because he temperatures it anyway low now the nonmorwe took this at tha starling point to under stend one which genes change when the worms il becoming call toler and onin of eyes and we found genes that when you mutate them the wors just remember longer always even when their off eyes considers the genes that nomally change wen ther trised on the eyes and these genes ill express just in one pail of noyones just two out of the three hundred two there is se said three hundred tune and we can manipulates the activities of these genes in this no ones to extend memory and then the punch line of everything that happen is that we found out that this this noion where this gene's function is one pair of novon is the only known in selecants whichis sensitive to lithium and litiome sir drug that is being given to by polo this older patient for that cates though it is not entirely clear how it work its rely very interesting tis also into think as an episode of course in your cortcast about is more the about this than meare lot but is oso intisen because i justineton re te di the big bank yet it wrks on our brains in such a fundamental way and wanted to see whether it works ondo oson de want tecosnisnolon was tied to this memo extens onthing that we found dana grude warms onlitou remove them from litio to them to association and found out thet the learn an lotlo the tey rememberle lotlonge an contolons not only that if you first make the warms coltolen and then litum does not work in them litium switches this forget for nes mechanism onenov anit it all in it all connected to coltolen amazing and amazing for a number of reasons and at risk of being long winded in my response sa is when to highlight something a that i think will be of relevance most people which is when a at some point we did a few episodes on memory and i haligted a a review that was written by the great james maga one of the great mamalian memory researchers who to worked a lot on humans and mice and i was a shocked upon intended and a amused to learn that in medieval times if people wanted children to remember lessons they can be religious lessons or school doctrine or whatever it was mathematic that they would take children teach them and then throw them into cold water to introduce a a memory in stilling event and we now know that the memory in stilling event is the release of a dranalin in the body which makes perfect sense if you think about dramatic events but it also this whold general mechanism also applies to learning of other types of information and if i understand correctly about the roll of litium in the roll of cold in experiments that you just described there is some general state sweat some internal states which that says what happened in the aminutes or hours preceeding this was important it acts o sort a highlighter pen ein in the book of experiences tam and i'm absolutely curious to know whether or not this is an are in a dependent mechanism in some way this do o literally the high lighter in the ekia instruction book the we do notno this we do not know and as i said tisis not even a finished work as not perevieu te just t the state that i toldo about but a but it it is very exciting for for me to to go into this newfelan in a wantitala be happy to who thought more about it ther and think about the implications on the connection sot te things om o more about the mechanism a well thank you for a sharing it with us despite the fact that it is not finish we am people now know that it is also not finishon i love a good cliffhanger well we we await the full the full conclusion and interpretation of these results to day you taken us on an amazing journey through the genom ar in a a short interfering arn is a a ton of history of prior experiments some of which ended tragically many of which unfortunately did not and they were true triumphs and am in particular the w r in your laboratory which is just incredible and also this introduction of model organism and i only mentioned a short handful of the things that i you have tcaught us about to day for one extend thanks for the incredible teaching i also one to say thank you for am something equally important which is i that absolutly came through but is what initially am brought me to explore you in your work more although i had certainly heard of you which is that your spirit an kind of approach to biology am is an is an extremely unique and intoxicating one it is ii even it i venture to call it sodoctive it is saiyou know there is at i i do believe that whether not its music or poetry or science or a mathematics that am the spirit behind something dictates the amount of intelligence and and precision with which that thing is is carried out and am it absolutely comes through if i making i feel on the spot about this ii'v succeed thing but i i know that the listeners can can a feel it it is it is a felt thing thank you there there are am many scientists out there a fewer with this penis type and even fewer that am youknow i think that can communicate with such a articulate precision thank you magink you it is been a real pleasure fleso was on my thankselo well we will do it again and we will learn about all the incredible things you are doing trying to transform science as it were at the level of publishing at the level of social medio ecaus ere's a whole other discuction there meanwhile we will corse point people in the direction of you and i'm to learn more about your work and am i look forard to hearing the conclusion of danas studies

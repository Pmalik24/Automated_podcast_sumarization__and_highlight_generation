welcome to the ubermen lao science sciencetay to i may interhuberman and om a professor of neurbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to talk all about healthy and disordered eating and indeed we are going to talk about clinical eating disorders such as annerexia ballemia and bingeating disorder as well as some other related eating disorders however before we get into this material i want to emphasize that to days discussion will inclod what it is to have a healthy relationship with food we are going to talk about metabolism we are going to talk about how eating frequency and what one eats influences things appetite and setiety as well as whether not we have a healthy psychological relationship to food and our body weight and called body composition the ratio of muscle to fat to bone et cetera as we march into this conversation i to share with you some interesting and what i believe our important findings in the realm of nutrition and human behavior i know these days many people are excited about or curious about called intermittent fasting intermitten fasting is as the name implies simply restricting ones feeting behavior eating to a particular phase of the twenty four hour or called circadiun cycle other forms of intermitten fasting involve not eating for extended periods of time for entire days or some people extend to two days or three days typically and hopefully they will drink water during those times sometimes referred to as water fasting hich means that they are ingesting fluids and hopefully they are ingesting electrolytes such as salt potassium and magnesium as well because while one can survive for some period of time without ingesting calories it is extremely important to continue to ingest plenty of fluids and electrolytes and the reason for that is that the nurons of your brain an body that control your movements your thoughts clarity of thinking in general et cetera is critically dependent on the presents of adequate levels of sodium petassium and magnesium the electrolytes in that is because nurons can only be electrically active by way of movement of particular ions which include things sodium potassium and magnesium without those you cannot think you cannot function and it actually can be quite dangerous whi all the excitement about intermittan fasting well a lot of the excitement relates to work that was done by a former colleague of mine down at the salt institute for biological studies in santiago name suchin panda suchans lab identifide some very important and impactful health benefits of restricting one's feeding window to particular times within the twenty f or our cycle or even to having extended fasts that go for a day or two days or mab even three days what they saw was an improvement in liver en simes an improvement in insolen sensitivity which is something that is good it means that you can utilize the calories and the blood sugar that you happen have being insolent insensitive is not good and is actually a form of diabedes what such ands lab and subsequently other lab showed was that restricting one's feeding window t anywhere from for to eight or even twelve hours during each twenty four hour cycle was beneficial in mice and some studies in humans have also shown that it can be beneficial for various health perameters however the excitement about intermittin fasting seems to be related to the foundational truth about metabolism and weight lost in weight maintenance and weight gain which is that regardless of whether not you intermittin fast or whether or not you eat small meals all day long or you eat one meal in the evening and snack up until then it really does not matter in the sense that the calories that you injest from whatever source are going to be filterd through the calories that you burn by way of exercise bazil metabolic rate which is just the calories that you happen to burn just being alive and thinking and breathing and your heart beating et cetera and the reason why many people prefer intermittin fasting to other forms of lest just call it what it is diet or neutritional framework is that many people find easier to not eat then to limit their portion size and here i'm not talking necessarily about eating disorders i'm talking about the general population i think that is one reason why their much excitement about intermittin fasting now within the contects of intermitn fasting on a circadian time scale once every twenty four hours you generally find two categories of people people who prefer to not eat in the morning either because they are not hungry in the morning or because they find it relatively straightforward to just drink things coffee or water et cetera and push their feeding window out to noon or two p m or three p m and then they will eat between say one p m and eight p m or nine p m it depends on the individual other groups of people find that they are very hungry when they wake up in the morning they do not feel well if they do not eat breakfast and they prefer to eat early in the day but then they limit their feeding windows such that they cut off their food intake or stop injesting any calories of any kind somewhere around five p m or six p m et cetera the duration of the feeding window has not been broken down into the kind of neu ants type of information that one would really want at least not n human studies saying well a six hour feeding wen or in eigt hour feeting wendow is ideal it really is going to vary based on life style in circumstances for instance some families really want to eat dinner together every night do you want to be the person that sitting there watching everybody eat because youre fasting from five p m onward i do not know that is an individual difference what you can startidentify howevers that people tend to fall into either one category the other people who prefer to skip eating in the morning or people that prefer to or mansho skip eating in the evening and there has been no evidence thus far that one is better or worse at least in terms of weight loss ar over all health prameters now you can imagine that some people might eat breakfast and dinner and indeed i have several many colleagues in fact who just choose to skip lunch because they are busy during the day they breakfast in dinner that does not afford the long fast associated with sleep whato i mean by that well if you went to sleep at eleven p m and you wake up at six a m by extending your fast until one p m in the afternoon you get quite a long period of no injesting any callories whereas when you do not eat during the middle of the day you are getting a fasting period that is probably anywhere from four to seven hours but it is not linked to the longer fasting period of not eating while you are asleep because most all people and i want emphasize most do not eat while they are asleep but we are going to talk about an eaning disorder that does exist where people actually eat in their sleep i know it sounds pretty wild but indeed a it that eating disorder does exist and has a very interesting underlying mechanism why are we talking about this and in particular whyare we talking about this during an episode that includes a discussion about eating disorders the reason is nobody not the government no nutritioness no individual no matter how knowledgeable they are about food and nutrition and food intake can define the best plan for eating for any one individual o ny repeat that nobody knows what truly healthy eating is we only know the measurements we can take liver en zimes bloodlippered profiles body weight athletic performance mental performance whether not your cranky all day whether not your feeling relaxed nobody knows how to define these and these have strong cultural and familial and socio socital influence if you hang out with peopl that intermen fast all day that will seem normal if you spend time with people have never heard of interementin fasting intermen fasting is going to seem very abnormal now we are going to talk about eating disorders that really fall into the category of clinically dige noiceable eating disorders for which there is actually serious health hazards and even the serious risk of death you will get to that topic but for the time being i want to emphasize a new set of findings that i think many people will find interesting and at least will want to cons ter in light of their current nutritional plan or pattern of eating whether not your intermittin fasting or not nd i want a cue up an important frame work for the rest of the conversation on healthy and disordered eating which includes and understanding of thinking decision making and what we call homeostatic processes meaning regulation of things that are going on in our brain an body and reward mechanism somehone a return to that in a moment but first i one a share with you these new findings that were just published in the journal sell report to sell press journal excellent journal this was a study that was performed both in mice and it included across overstudy with a human population the human population was women but it relates to a previous study that was also carried out in men i'm in a simplify this study we will provide a link to the full studies who can explore it in more detail and if you are really excited about the results i would encourage you to explore some of the references within that paper as well what was the study the study looked at giving mice or humans two meals and explored whether r not putting those meals early in the day er late in the day had an impact on muscle hypertrophy muscle growth and over all protine synthesis of muscle when we eat the emmenoacids from various foods are broken down and synthesized into different types of tissues they can be utilized for energy yon burned up for moving about and thinking et cetera or it can be synthes those amenoacids can be synthesized into skeletal muscle the sorts of skill to muscles that allow you to move your limbs this study explored how protine in take which included what are called branch chainamenoacids and a menoacids lucine which are important for muscle protine synthesis it explored whether or not emphasizing or skewing the protine in take toward early day or late day was better in terms of muscle hypertrophy and they also looked at some perameters of strength grip strength now mice are nocturnal before you say way mice or nocturnal how did they look during the day and its completely it does not apply cause it is in mice of course they knew that and they looked during them the mice's active phase of their circadian cycle which corresponds to our day and in humans they looked at whether r not eating most of one's protine early in the day was better than if the protinean take an these prance chanominoacids were placed later in the day and yes they had the mice due resistance training they did that by emphasizing overload to one limb of the mouse and that actually generates hypertrophy its a form of resistance training in mice s they do not have them weight training they were not doing you no curls in dipsin squats and things that sort they were moving their own body weight but they skewed that distribution of bodyweight by re stricting a limb and proting them to use one limb that did indeed grow in response to that and then in humans there was an exploration of grip strength and then with resistance training that was all carried out through a perferal study basically the take away from the study was that mice and humans can utilize a menoacids that are injested early in the day better than they can utilize a minoacids in jested later in the day in particular tored muscle hypertrophe and growth or maintenance of muscle which for those of you that are not interested in much muscle hypertrophe that are not tryn to grow your muscles ave talked before in the episode on building strength and hypertrophe that maintaining muscle regardless of one's athletic prowess regardless of one's age is extremely important because loss of skill to muscle is one of the major causes of injury as we age its one of the major causes believe it or not of cognative and metabolic dephisids as we age maintaining muscle is important building muscle might be important to some of you but what they found was in jesting protine early in the day and these a menoacids early in the day led to more muscle hypertrophe than if the majority of a minoacids in protines were injested late in the day this translates to intermit an fasting such that if you are interested muscle hypertrophe you might and one emphisize might consider making sure that your getting sufficient protine ind take early in the day what sources ofe protine you use as can be highly individual some of you ar meat eaters some of you do not eat red meat some of you eat chicken and fiss an egg some of you do not some of youar vegans it has been shown that the minoacid lusine is vital for the sell growth process including muscl growth because of its relationship to the called m tore pathway mamalian target of rapaminison yo talk about that more if you in a future episode this means that if your somebody who wants to maintain or increase the amount of muscle mac that you have injesting a hyprotine meal early in the day ought to be beneficial for that does it mean that you should not eat protine in the afternoon an evening no i think a lot of people might have misinterpreted this study and i do not want that to happen this is only pointing out the fact that in jesting sufficient quality a minoacids including lousine early in the day can be beneficial for maintenance and growth of muscle tissue it does not say that you should avoid protine later in the day now for you intermitten fasters this could be relevant i for instance with somebody who for a very long time skipped breakfast my first meal the day would be in the early afternoon mostly protine and salad in my case animal protine cause thats in alinement with my values than in the evening i would eat poste vegetables et cetera i might have some protine some small piece of fish or chicken or something that butaten't really emphasized that on the basis of these results i am experimenting with i wone emphasize experimenting with avent completely tossed out my old a protocal but i'm experimenting with eating protines early in the day and eating lunch and then dinner might be a light supper of some sort but not much protine later in the evening again if you on y six meals a day one e round the clock i'm not gon a stocp youare not telling anybody what to do as i mention earlier nobody knows exactly how to eat for one's particular goals but this study was really interesting because it really did show that we can utilize the protines that are ingested early in the day better than we can utilize the protines that ingested later in the day and of course there will be factors that can shift that princence if you work out very hard with resistance training later in the day resistance training is known to increase protine synthesis it stands to reason that in gesting a menoacids after that training would be beneficial however in the study it did not seem to matter when the resistance training fell within the twenty four hours schedual the morning ingestion or early day in gestion of a menoacid seem to be beneficial howearly between the hours of about five a m and ten a m four humans now just a bit of mechanism to explain why this happens why would it be that in gesting protine early in the day would lead to more synthesis of muscle then ingesting protine later in the day and the reason it turns out is related to the circadian clock mechanism that is present in all cells including muscle cells some muscles have fibres i think most people are ware of that that your muscles are not just one big blob of tissue e lot of these will fibers that contract within those fibres however there are cells with nucly i those nucly i containe d an a dana is transcribed into arna arna is trains lated into protines the dana of your cells including these muscele cells are under strong circadian regulation each one has a pattern of gene expression that is different at different times during the twenty four hour cycle this is an unescapable reality of all cells in your body right from your hair cells to your brain cells to your retinal cells to your to on both feet these cells make a gene called b mal b mal b m a l is a clock gene and the expression of this clockgine varies across the twenty four hour cycle and protines that are downstream of this bmal gene influence protine synthesis the circadian regulation of this bmal gine turns out to be vitally important for this protine synthesis mechanism how do we know that well in this particular study because they had a mouse that lacked bmal the gene was knocked out they had a bunch of these mice they were able to explore whether not this early day feeding effeced was present or absent in these mice that lack the gene bmal and indeed it wou s absent in other words the effect of increased protine synthesis early in the day was eliminated in the absence of the bemalgine what this means is that when you wake up in the morning assuming your following a standard schedual being asleep at night and awaike during the day your muscle cells are primed to incorporate a mino acids and synthesize muscle regardless of weather not you wait trained the night before at eight p m where you do not wait train at all are you weit train afterwards or before i said five to ten p m is the sort of critical window for this increase protine synthesis all this means is that if you are interested in maintaining or enhancing muscle tissue volume that you might one a consider eating quality protine and aminoacids early in the day you could train first you could train after you cannot train at all that is a entirely different discussion what is quality protine well quaity protine is going to be approtine that includs most of the essential amino acids and in particular lucine there is a lot of debate as to whether not you can get all the essential minoacids from up purely plant tha styet are wether not you need injust animal base foods or not the term quality protine has no strict scientific definition some people to find quality protine as a protine that has a high essential mino acid to coloric ratio what that means is a small piece of chicken or stake or eggs for instance will have many essential mino acids with a low colorat content relative to say beans or plantbase foods that can also get you essential mino acids but it requires more calories to access those essential mino acids now that is a debate that has many exceptions and nuancis and i for one and perfectly respectful of the foaks that just wanton just a plantbase foods in order to get their high quality protine i think that actually can be done one has to be careful and thoughtful in their choices about to do that this really is not about animal base for sis non animal bastes foods this is about getting quality a mino acids early in the day from whatever foods are enalignment with your particular values in your particular eating plan that is a lot of information but the keytake ways are every cell in your muscles has a cloccine the cloccines very such that protine synthesis is greater early in the day than it is later in the day such that in both mice and in humans ingestion of quality protines early in the day will be more sowing corporated into muscle than the protines that injested late in the day and of course there are the caviats of if yourd training hard late in the day if you are adjusting your hormon status through whatever mechanism et cetera protine synthesis can also be high later in the day but for most people it is going to taper off due to this scercadian b malgine related macan ism again we will provide a link to the study and the other keytake aways were that nobody knows nobody can tell you what healthy feeding windows are what the best feeding windows are there is absolute no information in that contact you talk to ten nutricionis or academics or trainers or individuals about what healthy eating is and you are going to get vastly different answers and that is one of the reasons why i believe that the internat in particular social media are filled with contradictory opinions but the calories in verses calory calories burned formula is the more or less wholly foundation of all things about nutricion eating and waigt and as we transition to day into the discussion aby eating disorders i'd you to keep this in mind because for the treatment of eating disorders it does not matter what psychological or early trama based effects led to the eating disorder if the person is not adjusting their feeding behavior in a way that is going to ameliorate the symptoms of that disorder which is ultimately the goal before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens at letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reasen i started taking athletic greens and thereason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which are vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gup microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentaly with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get thevitemens i need the minerals i need and the probiics to support my microbiom if you to triath letic greens you can go to athletigreen stock com slash

is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolites are an element and those are sodium magnesium and patassium but it has no sugar ive talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration an nd electrolies for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodia manesium and potassium present in the proparatioes all of those sells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optomized if the electrolites are not present and ifhydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes

want ta try element you can go to element element e docam slash hubermen let us talk about eating disorders and as we do that i want to emphasize again that nobody can really define what healthy eating is with a single protocal however there is some general agreement about what unhealthy and disordered eating is there are clear criteria in the psycheatric and psychological communities to define things and erectia balemia beengeating disorder all of which we will talk about dos we have that discussion i want to emphasize that self diagnosis can be both a terrific but also a very precarious thing we talked about the sylhobit in the episode about depression there is always a temptation as one learns about the symptomolodgy of a given disorder does not really matter what the disorder is to ask the question well do i have that does and that i know have that ah i see this sort of behavior or that pattern of thinking in that individual it is tempting to diagnose them end or ourselves as either having or not having a particular disorder however diagnoses really need to be carried out by people who are trained in that particular field and that have dep expertise in recognizing the symptomology including some of the more subtle symptomology of eating disorders if any of the symptoms resonate with you by way of you thinking that you have this particular disorder or one tat has a disorder i would take that seriously but i would take that information to a qualified health care professional that could diagnose or rule out any of these possible disorders i say that not to protect us but to protect you because information is valuable and i do believe that knowledge of knowledge can be very valuable in navigating any topic and improving our thoughts and behaviors around that topic but one does not want to were i should say one should not start to self diagnose simply on the basis of information without running that through the filter of a qualified professional what is in eating disorder well we have to take a step back and confess to the fackt that every society of reculture every family and every individual has a different relationship to food eaten disorders however have particular criteria that a low us to defind them and to think about different modes of treatment as it relates to the particular symptoms in particular the psycho logical and biological symptoms of those disorders now that is a mouthful no punintended what are the major eating disorders anerexian nervosa most commonly refer to his anerexia is perhaps the most prevalent and the most dangerous of all eating disorders in fact anerexia is the most dangerous psychiatric disorder of all even more than depression the probability of death for untreated anerexia is very high and sadly the prevalence of anerexia is very high what is anerexia and how prevalent is it anerexia fyou look at up on line or you talk to a qualified professional is essentially a failure to eat enough to maintain a healthy weight you can see all sorts of very troubling symptoms of somebody whose been anerexic for some period of time ey general loss of muscle mass because there in jesting fewer calories than they burn muscle is very metobolically active they can to lose a lot of muscle mass they will have a low heart rate this is the body enbrains attempt to lower energy output they ill have low blood pressure they will sometimes have symptoms fainting they will have a sometimes even hair growth on the face something called lenugo which is essentially the bodies attempt to insulate the body because of loss of body heat when you are that thin loss of bonedensity ostio parosis loss of periods in girls and women and all sorts of disrupted gut and immune functions there are just tons of terrible symptoms of anerexia that really place the anerexic into a very risky state which is why mortality from anereia gone untreated is extremely high now one of the misconceptions about anerexia is that it stems from an over emphasis on perfexionism were that because of all the images in sociamedia and in advertising of extremely fhin and fit or muscular people that individuals are looking at themselves and comparing themselves to those images and thinking that they do not match up and developing anerexia that turns out to not be the case if you look at the prevalence or the rates of anerexia in the last ten years or twenty years and you compare that to when anerexia was first identified which was in the sixteen hundreds and perhaps even earlier what you find is that rates of aner exia are not going up this idea that the images that were being bombarded with are causing anerexia does not seem to be true now that is not to say that the images that we and particular young people are being bombarded with are healthy for their psychological state of mind but classically defined anerexia has existed as sentially the same prevalence for the last hundred two hundred three hundred and four hundred years which is incredible and really speaks to the likelihood that there is a strong biological contribution to what we call anerexia nerrosa anerexia or vosa is extremely common its anywhere from one to two per cent of women and the typical onset is in adolescence close to pubrity but it can show up later in life as well in fact the identification in diagnosis of anerexia tends to be in the early twenties but if you look back at the history of those individuals there were typically signs of anterexia that stem back in to their early teens or may beven before that now of course men can be anterexic as well but anereian orvosa does seem to occur at ten times the rate in women and young girls than it does in men and young boys while there does seem to be more of a prevalence of nterexia in boys and young men these days that is probably due to better diagnosis and detection than it is to some sort of societ or shift related to imagery et cetera later we will talk about body dismorphia and some of the images that are present in media and social media and hallows are impacting other forms of eating disorders but when you look at anteerexia nervosa this failure to maintain weight even to healthy levels and often drops and weight that are very dangerous or even deadly that has existed for a very long time and seems to be somewhat hard wired into the biology of individuals that suffer from it now whon is a hard wire that does not mean that it cannot be treated or cured and indeed it can ballemia which is defined as bingeating or over eating i may explain what that is bingeeting is consuming vast amounts of calories in a short period of time over eating can be in jesting more calories than one needs but over an extended period of time both can exist of course but ballemia is also very common its more common in young girls and in women that it is in young boys and in men but it is present in both sexes ballemia and rates of ballemia might be increasing a sort of an interesting finding bits not quite clear whether or not its existed in its same form for a long periatife time or withan other new forms that are evolving or showing up we are going to drill into ballemia and what what it actually is in what it represents but one thing i want to be clear about just as the perfectionists mind set has been associated with anerexia and it turns out that not the case it can be but it is not always associate with anerexia there was the idea that ballemia is associated with early trama an childhood in particular sexual trama and while that can be the case there is no direct correlation between the two now obviously psychological phenomena and trama cand have a profound impact on the way that the brain wires up and the way that people approach food and other types of behaviors but the sort of classic idea was that all anerexics are perfectionists they want to perform well it is all about control and autronomy and ballemixs are can have disregulated an acting out against some early sexual trama those sterio types of the the psychological framework of anerexics and ballemics does not hold up when you look at the data many meny metanalysies have been done it just simply is not the case and in both instances both anerexia and ballemia their clear biological under pinnings to what is driving the under eating or the over eating we are goi to talk about the biology of undereating and overeating and appropriate levels of eating and by doing that wel starts identify some of the mechanisms that serve as entry points for the treatment of both anerexia and ballemia and as some of you ar probably aware anrexia and ballemia can be comorbid they can exist with one another there are anerexics who will binge and then purge in order to maintain that unhealthily low weight there are ballemics who fit the psychological criteria of anereia and there is a lot of overlap between those two categories a let us talk about the categrization for second and why the categrization has led to now a bunch of other eating disorders as defined by the psychiatric community one of the classic symptoms of anerexia is a loss of menstrual cycles loss of periods and the reason for that is when te body is under nourished the body fat stores send signals to the brain to inform that the body is under nourished or they turn off the signals that say look their enough body fat sells out here to support healthy metabolism and therefore lets shut down ovulation literally signal sent from the fat and muscle to the brain and the brain the hypothamis in patuitory will send signals down to the overies or they will turn off the signals heading to the overies to deploy eggs to matration of eggs in the pholical et cetera there are instances in which people have anerexia or have ballemia but are still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles or at least menstrual cycles and that has led to it whole set of other categra zations of eatin disorders bingeating disorder where there tends to be a lot of over eating but not the perging or categrizations of anterexia were in which people are underfeeting but they are not losing their periods and these have a number of different names and acranyms some of them include things ednos ednos is eating disorder not otherwise specified that is a subcategarization or osfeds osfeds is other specified feeting or eating disorder right now if you are to look on line or y lookin to the a psychiatric and psychological textbooks whet you find as that there is a huge constellation of eating disorders to day were mainly going to talk about anerexia bellemia bingeating disorder and body dismorphia you can even find eating disorders pica where people actually in jest things dirt or rocks or metal because they have a genuine appetite for those things i certainly do not recommend a sampling any of those non food items as foods itis incredibly dangerous people often poison themselves they often a can cause structural blockages some people have died from those sorts of things but none the less there are aspects of our brain and biology that when diserrupted can lead to very bizaar types of eating behavior sometimes pica s caused by mold nutrition but not always and today we are going to focus on the most prevalent eating disorders but we are going to build up toward that understanding by looking at what healthy metabolism and eating and satiety and hunger looks because one i realize that not everyone else there has an eating disorder and too i want people to understand this relationship between how they think the decisions they take about what they eat and how the body and the brain at subconscious levels are driving some of thes these behaviors healthy or otherwise because i do think that it can lead us to a better understanding of what healthy eating is for most of us and to increase compassion and hopefully even increased improvement in treatment of eating disorders for those that are suffering from them what is hunger and what is satiety sotiety of course being sated or feeling we have had enough food i wone to remind people of the basic mechanisms by which the brain and body communicate this is vitally important not just for this discussion but for any discussion about how we think how we behave how we feel the body is communicating two types of information to the brain on a regular basis but in particular around feeding and those two types of information are mechanical information and chemical information what i mean by mechanical information wealth you take a deep breath o and you hold your breath what you will find as ha yo can hold your beath a lot longer than if you exaile all yourre and you hold your beath with lungs empty and the reason is not because when your lungs are full you have enough oxygen and therefore you can hold your breath it is because when your lungs are full a particular class of nurons called barrow receptors send information to the brain and say there is pressure in the lungs and that means that there is probably oxygen in here and the trigger to breathe is actually suppressed when your lungs are empty even if you have plenty of oxygen in your system those barrew receptors send a different signal to the brain which is there is no oxygen in here and you should breathe and the impulse to breathe comes earlier likewise when youre stomach is full it send signals to your brain that are purely based on this mechanical fullness us nothing to do with neutriants that says i'm full and therefore do not be as hungry do not motiv ate to find or injest food whereas when our gut is empty even if we have plenty of neutriants or plenty of bodyfat stores we tend to focus on food a bit more volume and mechanical influences have a profound effect on how we think and what we consider doing our not doing likewise chemical effects when we injest food ore called blood sugar or blood lucos levels go up that information is signal to the brain via nuronal pathways and hormonal pathways and in particular there are nurons within our gut that signal to areas of our brain stem that are involved in satiety in our sense of having enough that there is food in our system that is chemical information how ar hunger and feeding and satiedy regulated by way of mechanical and chemical signaling you have i have we all have nurons in our hypothalmus that trigger eating and nurons that trigger cessation or stopping of eating we have an accelerator on eating and we have a brak and i covered all of this in a lot of detail in the episode on feeding in metabolism and hunger sof you want a lot more detail see that episode but ragy now i'm just going togive you the top contour of how all that works your hypothalmus is an area of your forebrain which tells you it is in the front but it is at the base of your forbransits or less above the roof for your mouth the hypothalmus contains lots of different kinds of nurons cluding nurons that stimulate sexual activity and desire wregulate your body temperature and control appetite and ceasing of eating and appetite therer two types of nurons within a particular area of your hypothalmus that are relevant here there are the called p o m c nurons c pro opioid malana corton nurons that tend two act is more of a break on appetite by way of another harmon call malanacite stimulating hormon and not incidentally when you are getting a lot of sunlight and your viewing a lot of sunlight that system is ramped up this is why appetite is lower in the summermonths than it is in the winter months is is true in animals and this is true in humans and you have a class of nurons called the a g ar penurons the a are penurons are the ones that stimulate feeding and they create a sort of anxiety or excitement about food can be positive anxiety or it can be negative anxiety what do not i mean by that well the ever seen kids heading in to get ice cream they are absolutely excited you see people getting radys sit down and eat a big meal they are excited to eat sometimes that is due to social factors but they have an increase in over all levels of autonomic arousal and depending on the contacts they can feel excited or anxious but it is a ramping up of energy these agi are penerons are what cause that in fact much that if you eliminate or kill these nerons which has been done in experimental malse models in the laboratory but also they are humans that have lesions or nerotoxic effacts on these agi are penerons and what you fine is that they do not want to eat they essentially become anorexic meaning they do not want in gest food they have no appetite for food whatsoever now that is not exactly what anorexia is but these agi are penerons ore an accelerator on wanting to eat whereas if you stimulate these agi are penerons or in humans that have say a small tumor near these agi are penerons they become hyprophagic they will eat to the point of bursting both animals in humans that have elevated levels of these agi are penerons are anxious they want to eat and they will ingest food to the point where they overreded those mechanical and chemical signals in the body and i know it sounds horrible and it is horrible they will eat until the until the point that they burst now they are signals coming back from the body to inform the brain about presence of different levels of nutriancs and that generally comes from three sources first of all is body fat the more body fat we have the more we secrete a hormon called leaped in eli p t ian leaped in from body fat leaped in goes to the brain and suppresses appetite this is a body to brain signaling mechanism that says look i've had enough not incidentally leaped in signalling is disrupted in people that have bullemia and obicity and certain forms of bingeating disorder that system is disrupted the i've had enough signal or there is enough body fat here such that you do not need to eat more right here i'm sort of in the voice of the body fat trying to talk to the brain that signal that dialogue is mixed up or messed up in some cases its absent entirely the body fat is signalling to the brain about how much reserve you have it sort of a saving's account for energy cause that is a body fat is got lippids in there and through lypolysis that can be metabolized fur inched in that process we both how to increase at end just generally how it works can see the episode on the science of fat loss the bodyfat is doing something else really interesting that relates to anorexia when theire sufficient levels of body fat and leaped in circulating in the blood and that leaped in signal gets to the brain the hypofalmus and the potuitary gland register that signal and in a completely subconscious way trigger the deployment of eggs in females and the production of sperm in mails when body fat stores are very low the reason why periods shut off or sperm production is reduced or even shut off is because there is not enough leapt in getting to the hypothalmus and to the patuitary and they shut off the signals the hormones things conatetropen releasing hormon lutinizing hormon falic stimulating hormo all these hormones thyo do not haft remember the names of if you do not want to that travel to the overyoar to the testees and causy overy intestes to ovulate ore to produce more sperm the reason why anerexic stop having periods when they stop cycling is because there is not sufficient leapt in in the bloodstream now there have been attempts to give leapt in to anrexix because leapton has been sequenced and the peptide as been synthesized into you can inject leaptin into people there are studies where they have done that when you when that happens it does not tend to alleviate the anerexia does not cause people start eating again and that actualy make sense because leapt in is all way of shutting off the hunger signals saying it is the body fats way of sang hay there is a lot a body fat hearer their sufficient body fat tor does even have to be a lot but it has in some cases been shown to rescue the menstrual cycling in some anerexixs caso body fat is signaling to the brain the gut is signaling to the brain theire nurans inyour got that are primarily responding to meaning they fire electrical signals when thei are sufficient fattyacids coming from fats you inst a mino acids coming from protines you ingest and sugars coming from carbohydrates and sugars things fructos glucos et cetera those signals are being sent from the fat and from the got up to the brain and therefore your body has multiple signals of directing you toward eating more or eating less ofve got two categories of nurans one that acts as an accelerator the agiarpeteron saying eat eat and gets you excited to eat and then you have a category of nurans the piomosinerons that are suppressing hunger theiare acting a brak and the body is informing the brain all the time about the status of the body and whether not needs more food or not you might ask why is it that people who are overweight and have a lot of body fat why they would continue to eat a lot well pass to certain threshold the body fat that is when you stare getting into the called metabolic disorders where blood glucos metabolism is diserupted leapt in signaling is diserupted and ther are all sorts of changes on both the brain side and the body end of things such that they are hungry despite the fact that the body has plenty of energy on reserve that i think is sufficient to explain that the basics of hunger and satiety and a kind of a biological mechanism and the importanthing again to remembers that their mechanical and chemical signals that come from fullness or absence of fulness that come from the presence of glucos in the blood or the absence of glucos in the blood when you have not eaten for a long time glucugon levels go up for instance jel pe one levels go op and those will drive you to seek out food and want food and then there are the signals tht are coming from body fat and from nurants in the gut ser's a lot of convergent signal lot of pathways i do not offer you all those pathways to confuse you i offer you those pathways to clerify the extent to which something as simple as eating or that decision to not eat is complicated weve perhaps heard or ihave certainly heard that oh it takes about twenty minutes for satiety to set in see you should eat slowly that you will not realize that you'r full until about twenty minutes that is i ou not true i doft know where that got started but we should probably all chew our food better and eat more slowly be more mindful of what were eating et cetera inanticipation of this episode i consulted extensively with a colleague of mine at stamford who sadly for us is going off to universiy of pennsylvania a our lossis univers of pennsylvaniofs win u his name is doctor casy halpurn he is a emty medical doctor and nurrow surgeon and a ph t whoe studyes binjeating disorder and other types of eating disorders and how they arise in the brain and he is developed some really pioneering treatments for them the talk more about his work lo bit later in the episode but we got to the discussion of why a body that has sufficien energy levels would desire to eat more at all this is not just the case for bingeating disorder or for bollemia but why that would be the case this is primitive biology that evolved over many tens of not hundreds of thousands of years you see to mice you seet in humans very similar types of pathways and effects how is it that human beings who have plenty of fat on reserve and plenty of glikagin in their liver et cetera inother words plenty of energy why they would be hungry why they would eat at all seems that just should not happen and he had a very important and i think clear and intuitive way of framing up all this stuff around eating and motiv ated behaviors and how they can go awry not just in eating disorders but in all of us basically what he said was from an evolutionary standpoint it makes sense that we should eat as often as we can as much as we can and as fast as we can that sounds crazy ove was told to eat not too often not too much and to eat slowly an shue my food but as doctor halpurn pointed out there are circuits in the brain to reward eating offin eating fast and cramming as much food into as possible because from a purely evolutionary standpoint food was scarce and seeking food was dangerous whether or not it was from animal sources or not and it is always been competitive for those of ye that grow up in families with a lot of siblings this may resonate with you i just one sibling we were competive about certain things but typically not compettive about food but i had friends that had a lot of siblings it was really interesting to see how food was served up and ahow it was a taken in those households food would hit the table and it was just it absolute war for portions and who got what and how much ind who got a slightly bigger piece of cake et cetera turned out to be a frequent happening in these meals and at these birthday parties whereas the only children perhaps were used to having more food presented to them without having to compete with other members the species every animal including humans has a hard wired circuit that we were born with that pays attention to how much food is available how much we are getting now and how much we are likely to get in the future and without going down the rabbit whole of arcue it nucleus biology in two sentences you have a hypothlemic area called the arcuate nucleus it is a fascinating areats ishal the area that houses these piamose nurans and these other types of durans that regulate hunger and society and these nurons in the arcuate nucleus start getting active when we see food and think about food they drive hunger and they drive hunger in a way that is responsive to what the food looks what it smells but also our prior history of interactions with that food and it takes in to account social contact wether or not we are going to get the whole pieci to ourselves or whether or not they are going to be others that we are going to have to compete with therre lot of signals that this arcuate nucleus in your brain are paying attention to doctor halpurn pointed out that you actually have an eccelerator that increases your level of a wareness and anxiety and f constricts your field of view and all your senses any time you interact with food and is driving a primitive reflex to injust as much food as you can as quickly as you can and then move on from there and presumably to do the same elsewhere that change the way that i think about eating behavior and eating disorders in fact we could think about eating disorders bollemia as in unmasking of that mechanism without the call top down control without the mechanisms that we use to regulate aur behavior and indeed bellemia and bingitin disorder are closely associated with impulsivity and with impulsive behaviors of other kinds something that we also will discuss more what is the pathway haw does this work what is doctor halpurn and its colleague's doing in order to try an treat things been jeating disorder well you can frame all of behavior good decision making in bad decision making in a pretty simple box dediagram model and i realize that many of you are listening to this not watching this in there is no diagram to look at i'll just explain it that you can conceptialize it in your mind we have knowledge of what we should do in one box we should eat that we should not eat that we should wait for dinner we should not wait for dinner and then we have what we actually do in another box now this is true for all behaviors we should say something or we want to say something but we do not we should not say something bat we do anyway that is the the knowledge that the kind of looping in your head i should do my homework i should go for ron i should not do this right now i should not be on social media all those kinds of shoulds and should nots that are circulating your head that is one box then there is what you actually do the behavior whether not you suppress the behavior you turn off your phone and you go read a book ore you go to sleep or whether not you stay up all night or you stay up for another hour even five minutes in between those two boxes are two intervening forces and those intervening forces are critically important those intervening forces are homeostatic processes called by some processes same thing homeostatic processes that regulate the balance of different systems in your body hot and cold awake or asleep dotbamene and the desire to pursue things ceretonian and the desire to just relax in and chill homeostatic processes and reward systems and as we now move into discussion about interexian ballemia specifically what you will see is that anerecia and ballemia are not a breaking of the mind set of what one should do or should not do it is a desruption of these homeostatic and reward processes such that decision making is completely disrupted and in many cases is not available to the anter acic or belemic now i do not wanto be abstract here what i'm saying is that the person who starves themselves to the point where they might die and in some cases sadly do die they can know perfectly well that their behavior is leeding to bad outcomes in possibly even death and yet they are not able to intervene unless they get particular clinical help because the homeostatic processes the signals from the body and brain that say you need food those are not registering in the same way that they are for other individuals and for the bellemic are the are the person that suffers from bingiting disorder they do not necessarily want to eat that food they simply cannot help it it is a reflex for them because the homostatic processes and the reward processes associate with food are such that they cannot intervene between the should do exquiresy or should not do exqiresy and what their actual behavior is now this is not just a biological mechanistic planation for what could have been summarize into sentences what this is is a road map of ware interventions can really mechadifference as we talk about different drug based interventions or behavioral interventions or social interventions i'd likeyou to think about wheather not those interventions are breaking in to or tapping into this box of the thinking the sort f pattern of thinking around food whether nots the behavior they actual ingestion or the restriction of food or whether're not its tapping into the homeostatic process the balance of energy systems and cond of getting enough but not too much or its tapping into the reward system and just as a little teaser of where were headed what you will find based on the datea clinical data experiments done very carefully very well by excellent groups what you will find is that anterexics have a sort of switch that is been flipped such that their decision making is actually pretty darn good it might even be better than yours in terms of avaluating food nutrictional content but their habits are disrupted they are not even consciously aware of the fact that they are making terrible and in some cases very dangerous food choices and turns out that habits and the way that we build and break and rebuild new habits is one of the most effective treatments for anterecia nowlats talk about anterexia this failure to consume enough energy such that the individual is at risk of death and if not death then severe metabolic disorders lack of bondensity et cetera mention earlier anerexia and things that almost certainly were and are anerexyo have been described as early as the sixteen hundreds and may be even earlier here are some records from the saints from the fourteen hundreds of people that refuse to ingest food another common myth is that anerexia is only the sort of thing that you see in rich societies these are spoiled children and with much food that they decide their only gen a focus on how slim they are how they look in bathing suits et cetera not true a careful analysis through medical epidemiology has shown that you fine anterexia even in cultures an societies where food is scarce that really speaks to biological mechanism now it is hard to unvail in societies where food is scarce because lot of people are starving and hungry but there are individuals that choose still to avoid food and seem to have some sort of reward mechanism that rewards them or makes them feel better if they do not eat despite the fact that there body is severely depleated of neu trance that is very interesting and points again to some desruption in some biological mechanism now i want to make sure that i'm emphasizing that i'm not in favor of people in particular young children atdalessons and teen ajors being bombarded we ith unrealistic imagery about bodies but the idea that that is the cause of or is amplifying anterexia the data just do not seem to support that anerexia in its classic sense requires that there be an endicrin meaning a hormonal destruption menstrual abnormalities lack of spern production or lotestastrone and mails in order to meet the classification for anterexia but as i mentioned earlier there now nuants and new classifications of antereia that even for individuals that still menstrate or that maintain a spern production that anerexia can still be considered a clenically diagnosible disorder now typically anerexia starts in adolescence rihd around puberty let us take a look at what puberty is puberty at a very broad level is the most significant and dramatic developmental step any one goes through in their life span the body changes the brain changes perceptions change one's own self perception changes and most of those changes are driven by changes in circuitry within the hypothalemus nerons the controlling the production of the called sexteroid harmones things testostron estrogen and related hormon's prolactin et cetera those are all changing at very rapid rates anerexia tends to show up around this time in a subset of individuals who on the face of it seem to find food aversive now the purely psychological theory of this is that they are fighting for autonomy they want control puberty is also a time in which children in parents are in a tug of war over control you were once a small child being told when to go to bed sent tour room naw your child that can talk back and say i do not want to or i refuse to and that happens a lot in various households as i'm sure you are familiar with adolescence and puberty is also when girl start menstrating typically or boys develop deeper voice ther start producing sperm et cetera there a lot of bodily changes that also drive perceptional changes and perceptional changes the drive bodily changes it is a drammatic shift for a young girl or boy that dosen nourish themselfes sufficiently during that period there are number of downstream negative effects a list out some of them these are a just a subset of the effects hypogonatism that is the lack of spern production or healthy eg production there is a menerea which is the lack of menstrual cycling oc a failure to have a menstrual cycle reduced insolence secretion insolent as this hormon that is released in order to help shutto glucose into various tissues for energy utilization that is down because energy levels are down much one of the symptoms that is a litle more criptic and that has actually interesting implications for sake of the collestral hypothesis is that anerexics who ingest very little food often have cosmically high levels of collestral including eldia lodensi approaching colestrl say how could that possibly be it we were all told and continue to be told from many sources that ingestion of dietary collestral is what drives high levels of bodily collestral cllestrals manufacture by the liver and in anerexics who consume very little food they often have cosmically high levels of collestral which is one of the kind of wrinkles in the calle dietary collestral hypothesis that all of our colesteral that we see on a blood panel is due to what we eat but the explanation for it is that under conditions where there is not sufficient collestral to symthesize the sex tor at hormons things tostosteron an esterogen which are required in both males and females those are made from collesteral that the body the liver will strart generating its own collestral will often overshoot the the mark to a dramatic degree the blood lypid profiles in anrexics are often very unhealthy despite the fact that their eating very little food in addition they intend to have elevate levels of things vasopressin which are hormones that regulate body temperature and salt and but a blood volume intend ave low blood pressure they can pass out i mention some of the other symptoms earlier in other words there are huge number of terrible things happening fighroyd levels are down heartrates are down it is if i'm painting a very bleaqu picture here it is indeed a bleique picture we have to ask ourselves what can be done for the anerexic right let us say it is a failure of the agarpenerons to stimulate appetite and feeding let us say it is too much anxiety around food let us say it is because of the way that food restriction was used for reward in the household right o making this up but you could imagine a hypothetical cenareo were o the let us tu say the mother of a particular individual i's very vocal about her avoidance of food we have seen this before right you probablys seem somebody who loves to cook and prepare food but then sits down and does not seem to eat and they always seem to in air quotes have eaten earlier i ate while i cooked i ate while i cookd right these people that you never actually see eating we all know people this are they anerexic possibly we do not know a child observes that kind of behavior maybe that individuals being always being told how beautiful they look or how wonderful or fit they look what incredible meals they they produce and you could imagine a purely sychosocial said of ethents that could lead a child to be anerexic that does not seem to be the case at least not in terms of driving classic anerexia of really extreme deprovation of oneself from food however there is a strong genetic component foranerexias you could imagine a mild form of anerexia in apparent that is supported or exacerbated by pra as that the person feels good from the praise their getting that ah they want to be a low body waight for whatever reason for asthetic reasons or for whatever reasons that happen to appeal to them and the child has a genetic predisposition right we never think about genes in terms of controlling behavior genes bias probabilities for behavior coun have a gene for depression of her scisophrania but it is not deterministic in the same way that there are genes that determine your eye color or your skin color or your hair color there is a genetic predisposition there and that genetic predisposition could exist such that if one is rewarded enough times for a particular behavior that behavior can start to ratch it in to our nerrl circuitry because behavior drives neurl changes alled neurl plasticity and you could imagine that that child could develop a full blown case of anerexia and this is why i raise to the beginning that no one really knows how to define healthy eating and therefore we have to rely on just identification of unhealthy behaviors but what do we point people to in terms of what healthy replacement behaviors would be rather than just look at anerexics and say they are not eating enough and there is this huge array of terrible things that they are doing to their body and they need to eat more we need to rescue them from themselves let us look under the hood let us look at what is known about the nerrl circuitry and the sorts of perceptions and behaviors of the neurl circuitry is driving in order to understand what they are truly suffering from at the level of caus not jous symptoms it is clear what their suffering from it the level of symptoms symptoms or how we diagnose at listed off a number of those things but let us look under the hood and try and identify were one could intervene in theory in order to try an rescue the aneraxic or help the anrexic rescue themselves because it terns out that the answer or at least one of the answers of how to do that is not intuitive at all at least to me was very surprising i would be remiss if i did not start with the obvious which is is there a chemical defect meaning is there some disruption in one of the major chemical systems in the brain that makes anerexics anerexic and therefore can we replace that chemical or can reduce some chemical and essentially eliminate anerexia and the answer is not really sort of maybe no here is why theire lot differen chemicals in the brain and body but there are category of chemicals that are particularly important that if you listen to this podcast before even if you have not or going to come up again and again and again and that is the category of chemicals in the brain and body called the neuro modulators nermodulators are different the nur transmitters in the sense that neuromodulators modulate or change the activity of brainareas in neural circuits you can think of them as microphones that are held between particular sets of connections in the brain that make those connections in the brain more likely to be active relative to others ha they make them louder to speak there are many neuremodulators but the ones that are important for sake of to day's discussion are the classic ones dopomina setocolin nor apineferon and seratonan let us focus on ceratonan ceratonan is a neuromodulator that tends to increase the activity of certain noral circuits including within the hypothalmus but also within the body that trigger a sense of setiety of having enough enough food enough warmth enough social connection enough of any modivated goal or drive or any type of thing or behavior that one would want more of cretonan tends to make those circuits quiet down now there are many categories of drugs that emphasize the ceratonurgic circuitry meaning they cause the release of or the efficiency of cereatonan in the brain and body things prosac zoloft paxil things of that variety those drugs have been used to some degree of success although not much to treat things anerexia nervosa that should make sense because if these drugs increase ceratonan if their general effect is to increase ceratonan it will be to lower anxiety that sounds a great thing lot of anterexis are really anxious around food will talk about why lowering anxiety you might think would lead to ingestion of more food but that is not often what happens increasing ceratonan by way of some drug regimen will tend to make one less hungry because with heightened levels of ceretonan in the blood and brain there is not the desire to go seek out the things that will raise ceratonan on their own now some interexics do well or benefit from these ceratonurgic drugs these drugs that increase the activity these circuits that lead to sotiety but if you think about the major goal of treating an anerexic it is to get them to have more hunger more appetite now i want a focus on some of the work that is been done around the habits and behaviors of aneraxics because those turned out to be ideal places for intervention the work i'm about to describe was done by doctor goanna stine glass and colleagues that columbia university in new york and there are other groups as well corse theyare doing this type of work but they did what i think are really some beautiful experiments and som beautiful explorations of potential treatments for anterexixs that seem to have a quite high degree of of effectiveness when they are applied correctly first of all there is a challenge in studying anerexia because in anerexia what ou're essentially studying is the absence of a behavior it is very hard to study the absence of a behavior as uppose to a behavior they did some experiments withinterexics giving them a gallery of pictures of different foods and allowing those interecic patients to arrange those foods according to preference about what they would select about food nutrient content about collorac content they essentially asses anterexics to a valuate food and in doing they were able to identify something that is very unique to anterexixs at the level of their perception of food what they found is the interexix rather than being anxious in the presence of food and that anxiety driving an avoidance of food what they found is tha interexix have a hyperacuity a hyper awareness of the fat content of foods almost of the point of being sort of fat content savants now they do not necessarily know that their doing this they are not looking at anavacado in thinking oke that is ex number of grams of foo of fat rather or looking at an aplin sanca that has no fat they start to do this mor less reflecively now it is a well known symptom of anterexia especially young interexix that they have cand of an obsection with food collorac contents macronutrient ratioes meaning fat protine and o carbohidrate ratios they know coloric numbers but then they sort of pass that information into a memory system in their brain that allows their interactions with food to be very reflecive in a way that they are actively avoiding high fat content foods calory rich foods and defaulting towards very low calory foods if they have to eat now this might seem an almost trivial result on the face of at you think oke they allikg to eat when they do eat they at localory low fat foods doe but it is the way in which they are doing this subconsciously that they learn this information and they pass it off to a reflecive habit and that is very important because what that means is that we need to look at what processes in the brain what brain areas what chemicals drive decision making and knowledge and we also need to look at the areas of the brain that drive habit formation and habit execution because for any of you that have habits and that means all of you the whole marked feature of a habit is that it is reflecive yo ve a mosquito bite on your leg you scratch it you did not necessarily even think im gin a scratch that in fact just to take a little bit of a a moment of respite and talk about habits in general the beautiful study that was done out of caltec university looking at the parking lot of ware people park in the morning without doesina parking spots and the trajectories that they use to walk to their offices in the mornings they put cameras up on the roof of caltec is cinthing that that nerty kids at caltec do i think it caltek if you calls some one a nertivethng its compliment my apologies to the nonnerds hat caltec i think there is one or two of you and for the nurvy ones of you a caltec you are welcome they vidiotape the behaviors of these faculty and students and staff and what they found is that people follow trajectories from their car that it remarkably steratype first of all they tend to park always in the same spot if they cannot they tend to get outheir car of course cas hn on the driver side or passenger side in the same place they turn and pivet their body at approximing the same rate everyday they close the door they put their bag on their shoulder or across their chests or howvord is that they carry ther the breef case whatever it is and they follow trajectories on to campas that are stereotype that you would wonder if you just trace he line after line after line what you would find is that every day is almost exactly the same and you do this too you do not realize it because four being vidiotape to in this kind of behavior it is not being release to you but your behaviors are stereotype to the point where if you were to see them laid out in front of you in kind of diagramatic format of the lines and the trajectories that you follow throughout the day the lifting of your mug and how frequently you you drink each hour you would be amazed and probably a little bit scared by how much of a robot we all are now that robotic aspect of our neral circuitory is vital because it is what allows us to think about other things and do other things and drive other behaviors but the work of doctor styne glass and colleague showed that in the case of the interecic those habits are exactly the place where things start to go ari and that drive this very thisfunctional under eating behavior that sadly often leads to death or certainly bad medical outcomes and it turns out that the brainareas associate with habit formation and execution are the best point of intervention what doctors styne glass and colleagues did is they took anerecics and they of course had control groups and they put them in an effarmari scanner which aare these brain scanners th y allow you to a value a which brainareas are active during particular tasks and because when you are in one of those scanners your actually you your i've actually been in one of these things your biting down on a bite bar and your your most of the time in most all these scanners your your immobi also you are looking at things on a teevious screen sometimes you can press buttons om to select choices and forth but you cannot really eat within those things ah what they found was that reward base decision making the drive to pursue a particular food or the drive to perform a particular task which is a lot of what we do throughout our day that was controll by a brainary call the ventrmedial prefrontal quartex let me simplifya ober to this bud omina simplified by giving little detail cause it is the huberman ladpodcast and i believe in mechanism mechanism is the way that you get true understanding and that you can then be very quick and give over views of things but you need the mechanism o you have reflexes and you have neurl process es that include what are called duration path and outcome type processes a duration path outcome tight process we can shorten with depo depio is for all types of gol related behaviors for instance if you want to get a particular grade on exame you want to learn something you wnt to complete to work out you wanto go to the grocery store and pick some stuff up and then head home you are going to think duration how long do i have oque to have forty five minutes to get to the store how longs it take to get to the store path which way m i gan ta drive there which way m i gan a navigate throughthe grocery store outcome was i able to get in get the items i need and get home in time ci depeo duration path outcome it is a very conscious process you tend to take into account different criteria related to what is in what is preventing you from accomplishing what you want to do and what is helping you are assisting you of course as you get to the check outline in the grocery storyun is the shortest line for instance that is all depeo stuffyt requires decision making and its reward base you use these depeo tight processes on in the short term to pick up groceries and pick a line of the grocery store and decide which trajectory to take home and you use them for navigating long extended processes in life trying to get a degree or raise children or i get through a particularly challenging year et cetera duration path outcome and that entire process relies on your forebrain this prefrontal quartex the prefront of quartex is what allows you to take information from memory combine it with information about what is happening in the present context and then to direct your behavior your speech et cetera toward particular outcomes and if all that sounds a mouthful it is and it is very metabolically demanding decision making is metabolically demanding it takes effort reflexes on the other hand do not involve the prefrontal quartexs in the same way habits and reflexes once how to walk you get up and you walk you dot ave to think about rightfoot leftfoot rightfoot leftfoot you just do it that does not rely on prefrontal quartex it is subconscious as it some times called but basically you do not have to use the parts of the brain thater involved in duration path and outcome type and halises in this particular study they examined brain activity inanorexex who are selecting different foods and as i mentioned earlier they have a hypericuity or awareness of which foods contain more or less calories than other foods and what the fat content of particular foods is in particular et cetera they are doing all this while in a scanner and then they look at what sorts of brain areas are active after that task is done and what they found was really interesting what they found was that the dor sylateral prefrontal qu rtex not surprisingly is involved in the decision making and the avaluation of this food which foods are going to be best to eat in this context which foods are going to be appropriate for at least that anerecics framework about what is ocay to eat in what is not ocaty and how much however there are areas ofte rain thet were active after that decision making process and those of the brain areas that turn out to drive the habit of avoiding particular foods and approaching other foods and in that case it was not the dorsolateral prefuntal quartext it was an area of the brain called the dorsilateral striatum now the striatum is a big area in the brain it is involved in a lot o different things includes areas the caudate and putanum and i just want o mention as i throw out all tese names you do not need to remember the names of these different structures theyre just there if you are interested in that level of detail but basily of a brain area and in er exis of or brain area that is involved in a valuating and decision making around food and then another brain area that is involved in the reflecive consumption of particular foods and the reflects ive avoidance of other foods you remember wayback the beginning of the episode feel that was a long timagono when we talked about how you have these sorts of processes in the brain but there are always homeostabic and reward systems influencing this cind of thing well in the brain of the anerexic it turns out that the reward systems have been attached to the execution of habits in a way that is unhealthy for bodyweight but at least from a purely neral circuit perspective the reward is now given this chemical reward in the brain is given for avoiding particular foods and only approaching these very lo calory lo fat foods thei really does seem to be a flip in the switch in the aneraxic brain that rewards them internally they feel good when they avoid certain foods and they approach others it is not a deprivation based model where they are flagulating themselves are massachistic or actively avoiding food in order to punish themselves which is interesting cause a lot of sychological theories support that idea rather once this transitions into a set of habits they are actually getting a sense of reward they feel good presumely from the release of a different nerimodulator called dopomine by approaching foods that are low fat lo calory content and their whole brain circuitry is scewed toward avoiding particular things and they actually are rewarded for that and they feel good they feel better than if they were eating in a healthy weight supporting way now the dorsilateral striatum is structure that we should think about in a lobit more depth it is p ard of a set of circuits that are involved in what are called go nogo tasks and i do not want to going to this in a lot of detail right now because it would take us too far down the rabbit hole of nurl circuitry but basically in terms of behaviors we both have depiotype behaviors decision making reward base behaviors and we have habits that we learn and we acquire and then we' just start to execute reflecively things walking things yawning when we are tired things taking a particular rout through the parking lot right we learn that the first time we go to a given parking lot of walk into a building but after that we tend to follow the exactsametragectory becomes very automatized it is just we just do it without thinking well the go nogo circuitry is another aspect of our behavior where we both have to select behaviors to perform and we have to select behaviors to suppress and the anerexic brain seems to reward suppression of one set of behaviors ingestion of hicalory foods and to reward focus or even hyperfocus and consumption of low fat lowcalory foods this homiostatic process that we learn about from high school onward that oh everything in your body is designe to keep everything in balance you stay awake firstern mountime you want to sleep you do not eat for a while than you want to eat to maintain weight right yeat too much than you ant to eat less those systems are disrupted and what beautiful about this work from the columbia group is that what it says is the place to intervene has to be the habit this stuff is already passed through all the learning its pass throughall the reward systems it is clearly not being overrun by the homostatic processes the body there is very little body fat there is no lept in whatever nurons in the brain respond to leptan are starved for leptin periods of shut down sperm production and to stastrone is lowered bone density is down clearly this is overriding all those homiostati processes all the signals that would tay eat eat eat those do not matter in the brain of the anerexic the brain of the anerexic is just performing habits and theire being rewarded for it when you come along and say look you shuld relly eat this whole pie or this whole petza you will feel better that is how she aversive to them since it appears to be a habit a reflex that is perpetuating the anerexic fenatype as we say in science it is perpetuating anerexia in this individual and telling them about all this terrible stuff that is happening in thei body will not work taking them away from all the images of thin people on line at cetera that is not canal work what is going to work what is going to work is intervening in the nurl circuitry tha's related to the habit itself and turns out that theire ways to do that how do you break a habit how toyu rewire the brain circuitry that is literally c ausing a reflex and in this case causing a reflex that is killing the individual or at least leading to very bad health outcomes the way that you do that is through a cognive mechanism where you teach the individual what is leading up to the habit this is low but similar to the way that somebody who suffers from a diction starts to put in different constraint type behaviors constraint type behaviors of the sorts of things weare the alcoholic will call a hotel ahead of time and say listen i want the many bar am taken out of the room andn' want a telivision in the room et cetera constraint type behaviors those are really ways of keeping oneself from the temptation but with these habits they work at such a subconscious level that what seems to work best is a commination of teaching the individual about their internal state and how to register their internal stay wat we call interreception this ability of perceive your internal state that they can start to learn to associate the interactions with different types of food with the sorts of cues that are occurring within their body quickening of heart rate a hyperacuity of focus tht we talked about earlier once they start to be able to notice that those things are hapening then they can start to intervene let us talk about what those things are that lead into a habit because those to turn out to be the exact points of entry for changing and eliminating and rewiring habits toward more helfee behaviors and i should highlight that this isn'n just about rewiring habits for sake of the interexic these are also the same types of mechanisms that one would want to incorporate in order to rewire any habit of any kind their toman features of thinking that go in to the sorts of habits that interexics execute the first is something alled weak central coherence weak sentual coherence is essentially an inability to see the forest through the trees it is a hyperacuity and focus on details within a given environment there is actualy an interesting protest for anterexia that involves something akin to count of a wears waldoh type a puzzle were an imageis put up a the one that i saw was one in which their their sa big a ray of coffee beans actually they are all brown coffee beans and a and your job is to identify wear in that array of coffee beans there is a face and indeed there is a face embedded in there t looks little bit a coffee being but once you see it you realize its the face not a coffee beang and it becomes very hard to not notice the face after that interexixs are very good at identifying the face they find it much faster then do non anterexics just really interesting right they somehow are able to home in on details and find those details and fixate on those details now eventually most if not all people find the face but once you do what you will find in whateverone finds is that you cannot onfind the face it just jumps out what essentially you have loss is the ability to see the whole picture because theyre some detail within that picture that youre obsessed by this as kind of elements of obsessive compulsive disorder but its not really obsessive compulsive disorder persay we call that weak central coherence it is ay hypericuity on one particular feature you miss the big picture the other is a challenge in set shifting that once you identify something that is of particular interest and that is driving some o f reward for the interexic that would be identifying the high fat foods or identifing the one food on the table that one could eat without any one hopefully noticing that their eating just the green beins and not touching any of the other food if you ever had a meal with an anteraxic you might be familiar with is it is kind of uncomfortable to be around actually they go through a lot of elaborate procedures acoun of hide food to theyll sometimes even chew food hold it in their mouth and they go the bathroom and discard it things very elaborate very troubling types of things to hereabout in a be around but you will knowse that they push food around their played a lot they become masterful actually at trying to keep peoples awareness away from what they are doing which is to home in on these low fat low calory foods and they cannot seem to set shift they cannot just relax and enjoy the meal because the meal for them is essentially this wares waldough or find the face in the coffee being task they are constantly monitering how much people are observing them and trying to navigate this what would otherwise be a really pleasant circumstance for most people theyre tryn to navigate through this because remember for them the reward is in the avoidance of certain things and the acquiring of only the foods that theyre brain rewards them for because those of the foods that have been preselected in er now habit what is amazing and frankly also important are these findings that once you teach an eracixs what is happening to them that they are doing this they are able to intervene now they need support i and another form of therapy that seems to work well for anterexics that idealy is combined with this habit rewiring is a family based model family base models are strying to surface a lot now in various therupy settings theyre be base models in short are basically ware the entire family is made aware of the individuals challenges with a paticular eating disorder or other disorder and in understanding some of the biology and psychology around it they stop condemning the individual they start to support that individual through a becuing them towards their own habits that they observe they give them some autonomy they realize that none of this changes overnight but they are taught about things naurol plasticity ind te ability to change one's brain in response to experience and there is a whole internal support network now for peole that live alone this is not available to them this is not the kind ofthing that you share with your co workers you might involve a close friend er or a spouse but it is not the sort of thing that people that do not ive in a family contact i can really benefit from all of these things fall under the umbrella of cognive behavior altherapy and i should mention that cognive behavioral therapies are often done in conjunction with pharmicalogic therapies i think that thereis this idea uf there that its either or when often its both cognine behavioral therapies are often combined with this habit recognition an reand rewiring approach which is starting to become more an more common and i think the date on it look really good that especially when individuals are taught this early in adolescence that there are positive outcomes over time the relapse rate of anterect is quite high about fifty per cent of individuals were relapse at some point often trigger by stressful circumstance but the commination of cogniv behavioraltherapy that ncludes this family model or at least habit reformation seems to be fairly effective and at present might be themost effective treatment now there are additional treatments starting to surface and that takes us into the realm of chemical treatments for anterexia and i just want to mention that there are clinical trials meaning legal clinical trials being done at john'shopkin school medicine by matthew johnson and others exploring how drugs m di ma which increases dopeping and seratonan to very high levels or sylocibon cale magic mushrooms which increases ceratonan and other compounds to very high levels within the confines of a professionally supported therapeutic environment can help people rewire their brain such that they can get relief from major depression and various forms of troma and now eating disorders are also being explored in the contact of m diama and sylisibon clinical trials i do want to emphasize that those are clinical trials the those compounds are not yet legal and in many cases most cases they are still illegal i do not think that they should be explored without a properly trained medical doctor that the clinical trials are essential to complete beflore one explores those compounds in particular because lately i get a lot of vemales about these compounds people telling me that they had amazing experiences and relief from various things not jus eating disorders but depression et cetera however i get an equal number of emales from people saying that they worked with some self appointed guide this would be outside the clinical trials i was referring to and they are now experiencing chronic visual snow their getting genuine visual field depasits they are havering tics that they never had before they have chronic and somnia i am not passing judgment on any of these compounds are the people that are doing this sort of thing i just want to see the clinical data and i do believe that we should wait until these clinical trials are done before people start approaching the stuff aand that is because they are serious comp ounde they can open plasticity but whether not they work quotenquo for different types of eating disorders or depression in trama the date are looking promising but that the clinical trials are still not done and i know a number of people are going out of the you askan into other countries where the stuff is being done om more regularly and there too i've gotten reports back of people doing called ibogain treatments some of you who are familiar with eating disorders will immediately be asking what what about ibigain does it work does i work well the clinical trials in this country are not complete a i've heard evidence direct i've heard directly from people who have benefited from these sorts of things for treatment of eating disorders but i've also heard of people that have developed chronic seizure disorders from pursuing things abigain for the treatment of eating disorders again i'm not passing judgment i would dislike to see more data and it is very important that the safety a a aspects of safety be in place say this is deffling not something to get renegate about it appears that once interex as established that habit breaking through self awareness of what the habits or is going to be a primary entry point that might seem kind of trivial you might say countryou have just told us that in one sentence but i want to return us to this model about homeostatic processes reward processes et cetera that leads us to a place where the short answer is no you cannot simply say break the habit an individual needs to be informed about where that habit comes from in the fact that what currently seems a rewarded habit should actually be a punished habit now i do not mean by actual punishment but what i mean is within the brain there is been a switch and the anterexic needs to learn that there is been a switch such that what should be rewarding is now punished and what should be punish starvation is now rewarded the beauty of being a human being is that knowledge of knowledge can allow you to make better decisions i'll say that again the beauty of being a human being is that knowledge of knowledge can allow you to make better decisions now of course when we are anxious when we are tired when we are intoxicated we have less access to that ability to use knowledge of knowledge to intervene the anerexic will often do things that are in keeping with their habits such as overexercising this is of area that any one whose treated anterexics are interacted with anterexics is well aware of that they are constantly moving there constantly on the treadmall their constantly running they always want to be moving in burning calories that they can feel ocay about interacting with food or because they ave the distorted body image well does breaking a habit mean that they should stop moving around and exercising no not necessarily there some really interesting studies that showe that shifting aner exics towards activities that for instance build muscle resistance training and allow them to eat a bit more food without necessarily losing wight but rather to put more muscle on their body can actually be beneficial not i'm not talking about inter exics becoming body builders as a whole body dismorphia associate with body building but certain forms of exercise are just catabolic meaning they break down the amount of muscle they reduce body weight over all other types of exercises resistance training or anabolic they allow muscle to be put on and there some interesting studies not not a lot but some interesting studies trying to encourage anterecics not to stop exercising but rather to stop exercising in this neradic catabolic way of breaking one self down but rather getting them shifted toward breaking habits of only approaching localory lofat foods while also encouraging them to embark on resistance training and to start to learn and reward the relationship between exercise forsake of making one's body strong including the bones not just the muscles but the bones which is important especially in interexixs and then to see food as a weig to nourish that process to building a body that could be of the stable weight hopefully thet once the inter exic is of a healthy weight that their maintaining that weight but that they do not have to constantly beyond this tread mill no punintended of balancing whatever food in take they have with activity and along the lines of that during the episode on fat loss and metabolism as well i talked about this neat and non exercise induce their magenesis where people who tend to be thin tend to balance around a lot their kind of fidgety and that burns thousands of calories a day anywhere from eight hundred two thousand callories a day that can be beneficial for the folks that are overweight and want and have a healthy mind set about food but are trying to lose weight and they it turns out to bite literally fidgeting and bouncing round this whe am doing this looks ridiculous you ectually burn a lot of of body fat and calories that way provide you ar in a coucolorctefpisit youl your burn body fat because body fat is not jous to passive tissue it actually receives imput from nurons that release nor drenaline an adrenaline and this neat ah has been described for several decates now and it actually as a pretty terrific weigh to burn off more calories with the inter exic you actue want to encourage them to not constantly be trying to burn off calories that can be very challenging shifting them toward activities weight bearing activities or resistance training that promote this more anabolic type of relationship to activity as suppose a catablic can be beneficial before we move on to talking about ballemia and some related disorders when i talk about an aspect of anterexia that is very interesting quite troubling in fact but that has received a lot of attention and that is that distorted elf image now an that episode on depression we talked about a very powerful aspect of major depression which is this antiself confabulation thet people who are depressed seem to genuinely believe and even confabulate about the fact that they are performing poorly in life and that they are no good or nar worthless et cetera it is literally a lie that they believe and their statements and their feelings in their behaviors start to reflect that lie they are not conscious of it that is what we call a confabulation anerexics often wi'll see themselves as overweight or imperfect in ways that are of an obsession for them they will think o their arms are a little bit fat or the contour their face makes they do not the pictures of themselves are they what i'm describing here is actually pretty typical behavior of a lot of people and how many people do that after you take a picture of them they sak can i see the picture and then they tell you that you have to throw it away that does not as only mean their anerexic are their suffering from some sort of disorder that just means that theire human being that cares about how they appear in the world we are not here to judge that in the case of the anerexic the problem seems to be that they have a genuine distortion of their self image much that they do not actually see themselves accurately their visual perceptions are off and the reason we know this ares because of some really important and beautiful studies that were done you might colic germany balanson's lab at stamphord he is in thedepartment of communications he is actually collaborated with a doctor halpurn that i mentioned earlier what is really interesting about these studies is they give us a window into the perceptial defect that anerexics have i've ustually done one of these experiments i i'm fortunate to not be anerexic but i've done some work with the vear lab over there and what you get to do as you get to a just this avatar of yourselfe to the point where you think it is as accurate is capossibly y u be and anerexics really distort this avatar another words they create this serious mismatch between their perception of themselves and the reality indeed it does seem to be the case now what is relieving or i should say what is encouraging about some of the therapies that we talked about before the family base model the comtony behaviour old treatments yes and the drug treatments as well but this habit intervention model is that as one starts to shift those things it does appear that the perception of self seems to follow that the perception ofself seems to shift along with the change in habits and that is a relief tleast i find that reassuring because changing one's perception is actually very hard as somebody whose work almost as entire career on visual perception and related things the perceptiubl apparati of the brain are not very amenable to nero plastisy man they do not change that easily whereas it appears that the circuitry that is related to habit formation and decision making and reward circuitry that stuff can be rewuired and interecics as they progress at of their anterectic state into one which they are intervening in their reflexes gaining better habits around food eating more more accurately accessing foods and and environments that theyre in related to food as they change their behavior and they start to put on healthy weight may be their also doing the sorts of exercises that allow them to put on healthy weight and avoiting kind of extreme exercises of catibalism in breaking themselves down they also manage to somehow just as a consequence of all that rewire their perception of self it does not seem that chuck trying to tellsom when omigosheer thin oureallyn to eat that does not seem to work they just do not see themselves the same way that you see them and i offer that as a as a point of consideration if one that santerecic or if you look in an anterecti can you think how is it that they are still critical of the small even non exist in amount a body fat on their tricepts or something how is that well it is literally that their brain as it relates to perception fisual perceptions in particular at they are completely off and fortunately by changing habits you rewire those circuits as well o caso let us talk about ballemia which is overeating and then purging on typically by self induce vomiting or by ingestion of laxitives sometimes also in concert with people taking stimulants and fat burners ar overingestion of stimulats to try and burn off more energy and then we will allso talk about bingiting disorder which has a lot of the same features as ballemia but typically no purging not in e list off all the clinical criteria that would allow some one to be diagnosed as belemac or been geating disorder but the general features are that they ingest far more calories than they need am anywhere from ten to thirty times their daily clorcan take oftentimes within a two hour period which ist just a staggering amount of food and neutriants in a short period of time oftentimes theyr overriding those mechanical signals from the body that their full am it is a really troubling thing to think about but people are literally gorging themselves with food is looks a lot a laboratory animal that has these agiar pener on stimulated these nerons that will eat until they almost burst or burst you wonder is that these agiar penerons that aire active almost certainly yes that theire involved although i do not think that that is going to be the major point of intervention patch were going to talk about other times of interventions their number of clinical criteria for incance if somebody has one of these binges once a year does that make them belemic tectly no am but i certainly do not recommend people do this a if you are one of these people who has calle cheat days right im some of you may be familiar with cheat days ithink there wil less common now but the ideas you eat clean for six days or five days a week or two weeks and then you have a calle cheat day where you dustcutting go wild and eat whatever you wanting whatever volumes is that ballemia e has some of the contour of of ballemia if youare vomiting afterwards or benjeating disorder if you are not does it constitute full blown ballemi are bnjine disorder it is pretty hard to say a the criteria that were described to me is that if somebodyese doing this at least once a month over a period of anywhere from two to three months than it likely would qualify and i certainly know people who do tese cheat days and a by those criteria they have something benjeating disorder but in general one of the holmark features of blemium binjine disorder is that people are unable to control their eating they are just simply they are not making the decision to have a cheat day hey're not making the decision to overeat they are simply driven from the inside without question by way of nerl circuitry they are driven from the inside to injust far more food then they need and in some cases then they would want to eat it is a lot the habit that we discribed for anterexia it is almost its turned into a reflax once they get going all the homestatic signals are being overridden all the signals from the body the leapt in the insolin the glue costs all that stuff is cosmically sky high and yet they are just what we beyond the the nerves i call hyperophagic theyre just eating crazy what is going on there well there been a lot of ideas about why the surrises there is the called thiroid harmon hypothesis that ones a tricky one it turns out that cortes all and thirod harmon concentrations very according to wen the binge purge happened there were some studies that looked at thirot harmon levels and they found elevated thirod harmon levels thirod harmon is involved in metabolism a and not just the burning of energy but the use of energy in converting into different tissues of the body cardilage bone ah that muscle et cetera i did whole episode on tharward and growthormon by the way for interested in learning more about thirar t harmon but thirod harmon can also be depleated at other phases of the benge pere cycle now without listning off all the terrible things that happen with thits benc per cycle it there are a number of things that are that are really a worth pointing out one is that the vomiting itself the use of laxitives that can cause severe disruption to the a mucoso lining the mutis lining of the digestive tract can severely desrupt the got mycrobyon it can cause all sorts of ev in a ulceration of the a asophagus and it just really terrible stuff a there is a lot of shame associated with ballemia a oftentimes because people are vomiting and its hard to hide that vomiting behavior a people are aware of it theire some social isolation see recall from the beginning it does not appear that sexual trama s are prerequisite for balemialthough sometimes it can occur the the halmarked feature of ballemia thet distinguishes it from anerexia aside from the fact that is over eating as supposed to under eating is a lack of what they call in hibitory control and that might come its no surprise a but first of all am the ballemic unlike the anerexic is hyper impulsive and oftentimes has other types of impulse behaviors they might have a little bit of alcohol and then start to eat crazy or as normally theire very restrictive that is a common feature of of ballemia sometimes they over in just alcohol during these binges sometimes they are sexually promiscuous not always but thets a general issue with satiety once they start eating and with impulse controlld generally and for that reason many of the treatments that you see for ballemia and bingiting disorder are the sorts of treatments that do not seem to work well or at least most of the time for anterexia the drugs that increased the narmodulator ceretonan for instance floxitine also call prosac paxil et cetera those things oftentimes can be effective in ballemia some of the drugs that are used to treat attention defisit hyper activity disorder in atitea topic that were going to talk about in depth here on the pon cassoon a some of those same drugs at ar al a viveants and things of that sort can also be used to treat ballemia been geating disorder why would that work well now you are familiar withthe prefrontal quartex you pobly no more about profrontal quardex than you ever wanted to a just from this episode prefrom the quartexs as involved in this analysis of duration path an outcome duration path and outcome is how we avoid impulsivity it is how we think oca if this than that if that than this you can imagine how for the obsessive compulsive or for the a anerexic these are circuits that are over active for the ballemic this is the circuit that is going to ssentially be underactive and is under conditions weare they think ow i should not eat anything i should eat anything and then they just carr ther fregerator open and plou through that and then at that point the'r ploughing through the coveards and then their ordering food and then their feeling horrible about themselves their dutend to be the cycles of bingan purge followed by feelings of real shame because they just cannot control their behavior and what is more embarrassing than not being able to control one's behavior as an adult or as a young adult really the polar opposite of what se in anterrexia this lack of impulsivity implies a lack of prefront or control what we call top down control why d we call top down because the prefontal quartics is suppressing the activity of deeper limbic and hypothylamic circuitry and things of that sort any time you feel you want to say something really a offensive a and you do not that is top down control at's your prefrontal qortex any time some one says something in you but our tooth port noutrans anything grittingyourteeth as topcontrol oke ah when you explode or birst er say the wrong thing or say the thing that you shouldn say or shdo the thing you shouldn do that is lack of prefrontol control and indeed people have a fronto temporal dimensia du to aging or a head injuries see this alot an a people play sports to get a front frontal damage am they become more impulsive bolemix have an issue with impulsivity a and therefore drugs that can increase certonan and sometimes these drugs that increase dopomine and adrenolin also cought apinefron will increase the tone as we call it the dopominergic tone or the norepan aits called adronergic but norepinefron levels in the brain allow for more topdown control and that is also why theyare used to treat ety h t an ontention ofica disorder they tend to create a hyperfocus they tend to push the brain in these drugs ten to create hyperofocus intend to push the brain and general mode of processing into one in which you think if this than that if this than that anticipating outcomes and for that reason drugs well butron bropriron which is an anti to present which mainly increases the amount of dopomine and norepinefron and less seretonan that can also be effective for certain types of binginin disorder is actually used to treat smoking to for promoting smoking cessation and for depression but also for certain forms of obisity related to bingiting disorder and the date are pretty good and their time release forms of this and nontime release forms and i think am you have to consult with u sychatris in order to get these prescribe because they are prescription drugs but it is a very different constellation of neurochamicls and brain areas and and approaches for bolemia the treatment of binjidin disorder has been explored from a new standpoint recently and that is the work of this now sadly former colleague of mine a doctor casy halpurn whos at at universy pennsylvania a they mentioned earlier they are using deep brain stimulation in order to treat bingiting disorder now why deep brain stimulation well work from doctor halpurn and others while at stamford showed that their are particular patterns of brain activity in both the prefront ol quartex but also in an area of the rain called the nuclios cumbent very important and a very relevant area of the brain in this contact and in any discussion about motivated behaviors of any kind feeding sex drugit a drug rele behavior people exercise compulsively the nucleus accumbens is in a on going dialogue with the prefrontal quartex and the nucleus accumbens has no mind of its own but it is associate with dopomin release its part of this a called reward pathway and what doctor halpurn and colleagues discovered is that their particular patterns of activity that ripple through the brain through these prefrontale networks and through this nucleous accumbents area those areas are connected a it is called delta oscillations deltage is being a particular frequency of electrical activity for you pysionatas is one tofor hearts activity ah but in any case those delt oscillations in the neucleas eccumbens are associate with food reward in both mice and humans somehow this reverbatory activity creates a perception in the individual that food is heipe re rewarding that is interesting and as allowed them to use a targeted deep brain stimulation approach to treat binjeating disorder and this deep brain stimulation is appearing to be a neffective treatment their still more studies that need to be done actually if you think you have beenjeating disorder you can find the criteria for that and you could contact doctor halpurn he is as i mention hs moving to universely pennsylvania they are recruiting patient throuh these studies all the time the studies are fairly invasive they involve a eftie approved a approach of literally placing a wire down into an area of the brain that a and allows the individual to stimulate a particular brainarea to offset some of these activity patterns that lead to a elevated sense of reward from food and binjeating and the data look really promising now i realize that tha very invetive approach not everybody is going to be a willing to have this wire inserted into the brain but for peol that suffer from binjeiting disorder this is a great and very exciting potential treatment because what i didn tell you is that many people have binjeting disorder are obise to the point where their health is greatly at risk now obisity causes all sorts of shifts in the dialogue between the brain and body some of which youill recognize from earlier in the discussion for instance lept in signaling is disruptives of the fat there is lots of body fat but even though that bodyfat is secreting this hormon leapt in in that signal should shut down the desire to eat the receptors to leptin in the brain or totally screwed up and the signal to eat is there but the signal to stop eating is not there soganiav an accelerator n or break in its lic the accelerator is always pushed down some these brains ti mulation approaches seem to be able to by pass some of that and of course their all the metabolic cindrums in the problems with having excess levels of body fat things insolent resist ance type to diabetes i mean as am disturbing as is to hear a there are many individuals actionly know some who a are obis that they strart getting bodily sores they they are not just bed sorces but they have a a skin sores that are very disruptive to them they do not having these sores om an in addition to that they can get perferal neropathies because their because of some of these metabolic issues theire not eting enough a utilization of of the neutreence in the tissue because a the way that insolent is disrupted insolence ing ling they act ly have to have certain portions of their limbs amputated and yet they continue to overeat this is not an issue of self control that a can easily be dealt with simply by telling the person look you have to stop eating or you'r going to die or you can have your legs amputated with inerexia there is there is a distortion in the relationship to food but the homyostatic and the reward aspects are disrupted unlike inerexia where it seems to be a habit based mechanism with bollemia and bingeeting disorder something deep within the naral circuitry is causing food to be hyper attractive and the break is off if you wanto develop some empathy for what these people are dealing with consider this it is driving a car you get on to a agrade may but ten or fifteen a degree grade in your heading down and you figure well you will dispump the breaks ta little bit but there is no break rights yu stare going faster and faster and faster and your only choices to use the accelerator r just a coast through it that is a sentury what is happening to these noral circuits the work of doctor halpurn and others i think is really exciting and even though it is highly invasive i think is going to lead to not just a some relief for the patients that do get that debrate stimulation but also the identification of what sorts of receptors are present in those brain areas that could help what that means is that once we understand which brain areas are involved into disorder and we understand what receptors those brainareas express then there can start to be additional interventions by way of none invasive treatments things drug treatments due behavioral intervention's work for bollemia in some cases yes provided that those interventions are done early enough regardless behavioral interventions coupled with drug based interventions are always more effective than either one alone fortunately there is a a decent sized kit of drugs that can help with bellemia i mention some of them before things proprir on well butrin some of the ceretonurgic drugs and some the drugs used to treat impulsivity we have on the one hand anerexia which seems to be a destruption in habit and a coupling of unhealthy habits in this case food restriction to the reward pathway and on the flipside we have beenjeating disorder and bollemia where a very unhealthy habit of gorging oneself with food sometimes followed my purging is not necessarily couple to reward they feel terrible when they do that right the anterrect it feels great about restricting their food in take they feel their winning some sort of game the circuitry is flip somehow that way with belemia they feel horrible about the fact that their binging there is inmense shame they cannot control themselves the reward is set up before the behavior the reward is set up in drawing them to food and in making food look something that is incredibly appetizing and there is no impulse break there is no way for them to stop that kind of behavior really kind of troubling thing to think about i on either case i think for those of us that no anterecxic sort of observed anterexia its hard to see somebody starve themselves to near death or to death what what more could be on disturbing well equally disturbing is somebody who has an abundance of food and is gorging themselves and then feels terrible about it a these are heavy topics an these are topics that frankly kno one really wants to talk about unless they know someone who suffering from them or they themselves suffer from them what i've tried to do to day is try and give you a window into what really underlies these things that we call eating disorders i hope i've done that at the level of biology nerl circuitry mechanism ante chronology and some of the psychology as with any episode o this podcast but especially in this month where we are talking about mental health issues in mental health disorders behavioal disorders there is no way that i can exhaustively cover all the different forms of treatment you have the maudly approach you have got all these different approaches to depression and to a interecy et cetera what i've tried to do as give you a framework and in doing that iave tried to give you a framework of understanding that also applies to this question thats i think equally important and goes alongside the treatment of eating disorders is what in the world is healthy eating what in the world is a healthy relationship to food i to think that i have a healthy relationship to food i know the foods i i enjoy them there ten or fifteen foods in particular that i very much i've mention of few of them mon the podcasts before a awas sort of amused surprised and a a perplexed as to wy for instance i do enjoy eating butter not in huge amounts but i do butter that seem to be pretty triggering for folks out there a a small selection of people decided that the ingestion of butter was a was a health conscern look to me a injesting butter in small quantities is something that i'm comfortable with and my blood lipid profiles feel good they look good to me for other people that might not be the case for some people the idea of eating an animal based food is probably repulsive that it actually can make them feel physically sick and i think that we should be aware that that kind of mental phenatype exists i'm not calling in a pathology for other people myself things butter an meat feel healthy now what quantities well i enjoy eating very much i'm not shy about this i've talked about in the podcast before enjoy eating some people have a very complicated relationship to food they do not think of it as nourishment they do not enjoy it socially it is distressful thing for them based on their personal history or maybe just general anxiety round food and i hope that in sharing this information about the fact that any time we approach food these nurons in our hin the arcuate ary of our hypothalmus actually increase our levels of anxiety this is related to that point that doctor halpurn made which was that from an evolutionary standpoint it is advantageous to injest as much food as often as possible as quickly as possible we now know that to not be healthy in this age of abundance where calories are essentially everywhere and yet lot of people feel anxious in anticipation of a meal what could be useful to them well whether not they have aneeding disorder or not it is very clear that developing methods to calm oneself in the presence of any anxiety or fear inducing stimulus can be beneficial of talked about some of these and episodes relate distress things the physiological side two annails through the nose in a long extail things mindfulness meditation certainly can help there are data lot of studies out their showing that meditation practice can help people deal with eating related anxiety and disorders i think is a general rule trying to avoid approaching a meal are sitting downd to eat ah in an anxious state is probably good idea but let us be realistic how often can we do that i think most of us are going to have circumstances where we are rushing around trying to just eat before we head out or get to a meal andthan we sit down and we find ourselves eating this is the one of the first times in human evolution where we mostly eat out of a desire to consume food not out of a neat for food most everybody could go a fairly long period of time just in jesting water and electrolites and not them suggesting people do that but let us face it we largely eat nowadays because of a desire to eat not a need to eat and yet we need to eat on a fairly regular basis and no topic is more complicated and new ants then food and nutrition and in particulars it relates to eating disorder the major take aways to day are we should all be asking the question what is healthy eating for us how do we develop a relationship to food that we can enjoy food hopefully both socially and on our own but that we are not nauraudic an compulsive about it for those of you that intermittent fast this also applies right what god forbid if you eat thirty minutes before your eating window starts what does that mean if it means something catestrophic doyou have an eating disorder i do not know m be ev an anxxiety disorder ah that is for you to explore ah if you do not manage to eat five meals a day and that is your obsession well then the same thing applie is these are questions that we can all ask ourselves to day we focuss on the extremes of food related behaviors that really qualify is genuine disorders they are in the psycheatric manuals and they are dignosible and and they are serious health concerns they are not just mentally troubling and concerning for the people suffering from them in the people round them but they are genuine health concerns just wone to reiterate that anerecti nervosa is the most deadly psychiatric disorder by a huge margin and if you look statistically at the number of people with eating disorders and that die of eating disorders it is not far off from the number of people that die from automobile accidents i know that that sounds e ridiculous number be can look this up this is particularly true in certain countries why that is we do not know but again this is noting new phenomenon this is not just related to ay body image issues that are created through social media media and as a final point on that many of you are probably asking what about plastic surgery what about all the steps that people are going to through excuse me to preen themselves and change themselves our people addicted to plastic surgery is that a form of body dismorphian indeed it is and we will do in episode on exercise related and plastic surgery related body dismorphia i think there is very little question that those types of disorders are clearly related to what were observing in social media and in media that this shift of for instance action heroes if you look at action heroes ind the adies there were very few men that were very large you had your terminate yet your stalones in your short sniggers and a few others but the men in movies tended to be if they were muscular they were far more sfelt than they are now there is this kind of there is literally a hypertrophe of the imagery and likewise there is been hypertrophe of the female body shape as its pertrade in the media there are body dismorphias that are related to those types of things and that relate to things plastic surgery steroid abuse diet drug abuse and on definitely important to think about and consider and definally deserving of its own episode you have learned a lot of nerrol science to day i hope that was useful in thinking about these disorders and in thinking about other aspects of feeding and motivated behaviors i would love for you to take away this model that was handed off to me that i think is powerful for thinking about all sorts of things nottious eating but all kinds of behaviors and perceptions that you have one box for what you think one box for what you do and what is intervening between those why is it that you can n o better and not do better well it is because you also have to cope with these subconscious homyostatic prostesses and reward prostessies and those oftentimes can be desrrupted in ways that we find ourselves doing things that are not good for us are not good for other people but fortunately there is this great gift which is that knowledge of knowledge can allow you to do better without question and that knowledge of knowledge allowing you to do better over time leads to this incredible phenomenon called neral plostessity which essentially is translated into doing better over time even if difficult eventiually makes doing better reflexive if

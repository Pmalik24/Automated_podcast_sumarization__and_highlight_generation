welcome to the huberman latconkens nn te of science science tase toc forini i man druhubermen and ofm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing kedemine kedemine is a fascinating compound and it is one that nowadays is being used both clinically for the treatment of depression and suicidality and pt ast and it is also a drug that is commonly abused that is kedemine is often use recreationally and t has a high potential for abuse to day we are going to discuss both the research on the clinical benefits of kedemie as well as the risks of kedemie we are going to discuss theimmechanisms of action by which kedmine produces what are called dissociative states i will define for you what a called kahole is in scientific terms i will talk about dosages of kedemie i w'll talk about delivery routes of kedemine and throughout i will be emphasizing both tha clinical benefits and the risks that is the potential harms of using kedemine out of the appropriate clinical context by the end of to day's episode you will understand thoroughly what kedemine is how it works in the brain anbody to produce dissociative states and to relieved depression and you will understand how it can actually change neural circuitry this is an important thing to understand about kedemine the acute or immediate effects of kedemine while one is under the influence of keemine are just part of the story of how kedemine modifies the brain for the treatment of depression suicidality in pt ast and by extension when people use kedemine recreationalli there are those immediate acute effects of kedemine but there are also long turm changes in the brain that are important to understand during to day's discussion we will also be talking a lot about neurol plasticity or your nervous systems ability to change in response to experience and we will talking about nerrow plasticity not just in the context of kedemine but as a general theme for how l your nervous system changes any time you learn anything and in that discussion you are going to her a lot about b d and f or braind erive neutrofect factor rainderav neu trophic factor is a critical molecule for all forms of learning and memory and changes to your nervous system in addition to learning about kedemine and how it works clinically and its relevants to recreational use and abuse you will also learn a lot about narro class tocity and b d and f and what it is doing in your brain right now as you learn before we begin ie'd to emphasis that this pod cast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero coss to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsers of to day's pot cast our first sponsor is roca roca makes eye glasses and sun glasses that are of the absolute highest quality the company was founded by two all american swimmers from stamfort and everything about roca eye glasses and sunglasses were design with performance in mind i've spent the lifetime working on the biology the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly when for instance you go from a shady area to a sunny area when you look at something up close or off in the distance roca understands all of that and if design their eyeglasses and sun glasses that regardless of conditions you always s with perfect clarity their glasses are also extremely light weight and they will not slip asf your face if you get sweaty in fact initially roca eye glasses and sunglasses were designed for use in sports things running and cycling et cetera and thy still can be use for that but really their eye glasses and sunglasses or design to be worn any time i wear readers at night or when i drive at night and i'll sometimes work sunglasses in the middle of the day although of course i do not wear sunglasses when i do my morning sunlight exposure which everyone should be doing to set the circadian rhythm if you would to try roca eyeglasses or sunglasses simply go to roca that is aro k a dot come and enter the cod huberman to save twenty per cent off your firs st order again that is aro k dok com enters the code huberman at checkout to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacite noi've spoken many times before in this podcast and elsewhere about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well and enough all of those things are improved and when we are not sleeping well or enough all of those things mental health physical health and performance all get worse now a ke component to getting a great nights sleep is that the temperature of your sleeping environment has to be such that your body temperature drops by one to three degrees in order to fall and stay deeply asleep end that your body temperature increased by about one to three degrees in order to wake up feeling refreshed with eight sleep mattress covers you can customize the temperature of your sleeping environment such that you always get the best possible nights sleep i've been sleeping on a naghte sleep mattress cover for about two years now and i must say it is vastly improved my sleep if youd to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dock cam slash hubermen and save a hundred fifty dollars off off their pod three cover the currently ship in the u ssay candida you k select countries in the eu nd australia again that is eight sleep dok com slash huberman o k let us talk about kedemine i realize that many people have heard of kedemne but most people do not realize that kedemine is very similar to another drug called pe c p or fend cyclodine which goes by the street names angel dust or sherm it has some other street names as well when i was growing up i heard a lot about p c p they taught us about it in school you would hear about it on now cop shows on telivision and the lor was that p c p would eliminate people's perception of pain and would make them violent you would hear these stories in drug education classes that when people are on pie c p their puncting light poles in breaking their hands they can fight off eight or ten police officers who are trying to hand cuff them i do not know whether not any of that is true or not but we heard a lot about p c p and it was associated with drugs of abuse things cokane metham phedemine it was lumped into that kategory nowadays when we hear about kedemine rarely do people mention that kedemine and pec p actually have the same mode of action more or less o cahave not tog about the specifics them talking broadly they have the same mode of action in the brain that both of them are dissociative anaesthetics and nowadays usually when we hear about kedemine we are hearing about its benefits we are hearing that it can help cure depression we are hearing that it can help reduce or cure suicidality that i can be used to treat p t st and indeed all that is true in the appropriate clinical context that the appropriate dosages and given at the appropriate frequency kedemine has proven to be a miraculous drug for some people not all people for the treatment of depression to acidality and p t st that said kedemine also has a very high potential for abuse and it may come as no surprise that we often hear about kedemie nowadays also in the context of its use at parties you hear about people going into call kaholes which is a particular state associated with overdoing the dosage of kedemine a little or a lot well get back to that ellobit later what it is how dangerous it is et cetera in any case kedemine is an incredible drug very similar to pc p vencyclodine and it is a drug that nowadays there is crossover between the clinical uses of kedemine for treatment of depression et cetera and its recreational use what do i mean by that what am referring to is people access in kedemine legally for the purpose of treating depression but taking that kedemine out of the clinic out of the doctor's office which is a very different set of conditions then most of the studies that have been done on kedemine and its rolling depression and not surprisingly if there is increased access to a drug kedemine really any drug that has a potential for abuse then we also see an increase in the number of people that it are using that drug recreationally and some of them do indeed get addicted to kedemine i know many of you are probably wondering kanyou get addicted to edemie indeed people can get addicted to kedemine there are some people who its effects enough that they find themselves compelled to use kedemine even though the use of kedemine is degrading their overall life performance work school relationships finances et cetera that said kedemine does have these established clinical uses nowdays the landscape around kedemine is oh different than it was ten or twenty years ago when it was lumped very closely with p c p fencyclodine and really just looked at as a drug of abuse there wore some early cases an the nineteen seventies of the use of kedemine in order to treat p t st this was mainly in soldiers in viatnom or people coming back from vietnom but really the clinical use of kedemine for the treatment of depression toacidality and p t st has really just taken off in the last five to ten years and that is what is brought us to this new landscape of interest and understanding and use of kedemin in the clenical and recreational context how is it that a drug that at one time was really just viewed as a street drug that was bad bad bad is now being prescribed widely and has all this interest surrounding it and really this has to do with our understanding of what depression is in what depression is not i'd to just take one or two minutes and explain to a little bit about the history of depression and its treatment but we observe starting about the middle of the last centuries around nineteen fifty but really taken off in the early nineteen eighties and nineties is the called mono amine hypothesis of depression mono amines as the names suggests are symthesized from a mino acids it is a god away to remember mono amines mono amines include things certonin dopomine and norapinefren although their other mono amians as well mono amines are nerro transmitters or more specifically they are neurro modulators meaning they change the activity of nerl circuits in the brain and body they can ramp up levels of ac ivity in lots of dfferen bran areas or they can reduce the activity of nerl circuits in lots of different bran areas as well as within the body your got has ceratonan and need ceraetonan dopamin also plays important roles in the body et cetera et cetera the monoamian hypothesis of depression is really centered around the idea that it is deficiencies in these monoameans either ceretonan or dopamine or noripinefran or some commination of those that gives rise to depression now in reality there is very little if any evidence that there is a deficiency of manoameans in any form of depression however it is very clear that drugs that increase certain manoameans drugs prozacker zo loff that increase ceratonan or drugs brupriron which is often called well buchon which is its commercial name which ncreases dopomin and norepanefran can often provide relief for certain symp toms of depression in some people however what we have learned over the last thirty or forty years is that drugs that are design to increase certain monoameans in order to treat depression only work in about forty per cent of depressed people that take them and they have a lot of side effects now some people are lucky enough that they can use a low enough dose or perhaps even a high enough dose that gives them relief from their depressive symptoms but does not give them side effects that make it uncomfortable for them to use that drug that they would choose rather to not take that drug however a lot of people that do get depression relief from things zoloft or paxil or from bruprieron find that the side effects which include things dry mouth athough more commonly reductions or increases an appetite or vast reductions in lebido or changes in their sleep patterns et cetera that those side effects really make it impossible or at least very uncomfortable for them to take those drugs and of course there are the sixty per cent of depressed people who do not respond to those drugs at all now i want to be very clear things ecessorize things well butrand have helped a tremendous number of people get relief from depressive symptoms and in many cases have warded off suicidality as well however there are also a great number of people who have experienced a lot of sideffects and problems from these drugs hence the desire to find other compounds that can treat depression without creating similar side offect profiles and that ideally can provide relief not just for forty per cent but for all people suffering from depression that is where kedemine enters the picture prior to the nineteen nineties they were mainly studied and narrow science and pharmocology laboratories for their abuse properties and for their anaesthetic properties kedemine is a dessociative anaesthetic it is actually used to induce certain forms of anaesia for surgery it is not always use but its often use this is something that if you have ever had a surgery you might want to ask your anasesiologist about what sorts of drugs are you giving me to go under what sorts of drugs do you keeping me to stay under and maybe even what sorts of drugs are you giving me to bring me out of anasesia cause it turns out that when you go into anasesia your inecesiologist is rarely giving you just one drug typically they are giving you one drug to kill off a little bit of anxiety and maybe eliminate a little bit of pain sometimes and then they will ive you another drug to drop you into a deeper plane of anasesia nd then nowadays theire sophisticated ways to moniter your plane of anasesia and ther sophisticated ways to if necessary get you out of a deep plane of anaesia if that plane of anasesi is too deep when i talk about a plane of anasesia i'm just talking about going from full wakefulness to of reduction and anxiety to falling asleep to a sleep to the point where even if some one were to pinch your to or your arm really intense pinch that you would not wake up from that ok kedemine has the property of being an anaesthetic it kills the response to pain and at certain doses it can bring you into deep planes of anasesia at lesserdosages it can take you into transition points between a w ake and deeply inestatize and it is realy that transition point between awaken deeply in etestize which we are going to call the dissociative state is kind of this liminal state a little bit dreaming it can have some dream qualities to it that is the state that has most often been sought after employed for the treatment of depression suicidality and petiastee which brings up a really important point which is that when people use kedemine recreationally it is not clear exactly what plain of anasisia or dissociation they are actually seeking and this is why we hereabout some of the desired effects of kedemine that are driving people to use it recreationally and why we also her about people having some unpleasant or even very unpleasant or dangerous experiences when using cedemne recreationally because we are talking about a drug that has a lot of different effects depending on the dosages and as well soon talk about individuals very tremendously in their response to different dosages of cedemine and the delivery root for cedemine whether not its delivered oarly in the form of a pill or put sublinguily in what is called atroch that dissolves under the tongue or its injected the not's injected into the vain or interemuscularly et cetera each of those can produce very different effects in terms of the speed of onset of the drug and the type of effects that it produces in the brain and body what happen in the early nineties is that laboratories that were studying animal models what we call preclinical models of things depression and learning in memory and to some extent kedemine but mainly focusing on learning and memory and depression made an interesting discovery there is a certain preclinical model of depression that is pretty common in laboratories that involves taking a rat or a moushe and putting it into a small container looks a beaker or a jar sometimes it is a tray and has water in it and you might be surprised to learn perhaps not that if you put a rat or amouse into water it will swim ca it is treading water in order to keep its head above water and not drown i realize for some of you this might be a bit of an aversi topic to hear about animal or search but this is one of the common preclinical models of depression which is put a rater a mouse into water let it swim and see at what point it gives up because what happens is if you put a rat or mouse into water it will attempt to save its own life by swimming but at some point it will just give up and it will just start sinking and then of course the researchor nes to rescue the ratermouse put it back into its home cage dry it off give its some food et cetera this preclinical model is called the model of learned helplessness and it is become a prominent preclinical model of depression because of course we cannot ask mice or rats if they are depressed or happy i suppose you cannot ask them but they are not going to answer in any kind of meaningful way we can only look at their behavior in order to understand whether not they have a sense of happiness or a sense of depression and of course that is very hard to gauge in an animal model of any kind you could make guesses based on other behaviors are they grooming regularly or they eating regularly things that mor less parallel what we think of its health or lack of health in a human whose happy or depressed but in the context of trin understand depression in these preclinical animal models having a behavior that you can really quantify carefully a cross a lot of different animals and conditions is really beneficial this thing of putting a rat or mouse into water and seeing how long it takes before they give up to save their own life is called the model of learned helplessness and what it alowed researchers to do was to take rats and mice put them into water see how long it took before they gave up and then to give them different drugs to see whether not any of those drugs either hastened sped up or prolonged the duration over which the animal would attempt to save its own life this actually has some meaningful parallels to human depression yot one of the hull marks of depression is that people stop thinking positively about their future depression of course can include a lot of other symptoms in one of the most prominent symptoms of depression for instance is consistently waking up around two thirty or three thirty in the morning and not being able to fall back asleep again now keep in mine it is not the case that if you are waking up at two thirty or three thirty in the morning and you cannot fall back asleep that you are absolutely depressed that is simply not the case but that pattern of lack of sleep plus some other things lack of anticipation of a positive future inability to imagine the future in any kind of meaningful or positive way et cetera are part of the key features of what we call a major depressive episode this preclinical model of learned helplessness allowed researchers to test a lot of different drugs an establish which drugs at which dosages allowed animals to fight for their life longer when placed into water it is really that simple as a model but it revealed some very interesting things at least one of which is that when animals were injected with kedemine this dissociof anaesthetic but they were injected with dosages of kedemine that were below what would induce full anaesisia these animals would swim for their life for a lot longer now to some extent that ought to be surprising and in fact was surprising to researchers because kedemine is what is called an n m d a recepter blocker now when i say blocker i'm not getting into the details of what specific form af blocker it is but i do want to mention that a blocker is sometimes referred to as an antagonist whereas something that promotes the activity of a recepter is called an agonist okhe if you can just remember that kedemine is an n m d a receptor antagonist or blocker then you should be fined for the rest of to day's conversation now i have not told you what n m d a is n m d a stands for n methel d espartate and you do not need to remember that but the surprise for researchers was that this drug kedemine is allowing animals to fight for their life for longer has this sort of property of overcoming what we call learned helplessness or a s ns of helplessness acha a anti depressent effects and we also know that it is an enemy a receptor antagonist or blocker and that is perplexing because we also know that the enemdy a receptor is critical for changing narral circuitry in the brain it is critical for narrol plasticity put differently here is a drug that blocks the receptor that is critical for nerral plasticity for changes in the brain and yet somehow it is allowing these animals to fight forther life longer it is somehow giving them more of a sense of hope at least that is the subjective interpretation of what one observes when a mouse or rat is swimming for much longer when it would otherwise just give up and sink to the bottom of the vessel now in general there are two kinds of scientists they are scientists that take a look at a set of finings that and say oh here is a drug that as to be terrible for us it is an anesthetic and it blocks an emya receptors and enemdy a receptors are good for nerrol plasticity and somehow it is also allowing these animals to swim longer and what is a one category of scientists would justs look at that and ju say while that is a big ballor tangle of confused facts how dos one even reconcile that right brain change ought to be good and perhaps even lie at the heart of our ability to recover from depression this is drug that blocks nor oplasticity but somehowas relieving depression i'min a walk away from that men a work on something far simpler and then there is tis other category of scientist which thank goodness exists who looks at that apparent contradiction of oc there is a drug which blocks plasticity plasticities thought to be important for getting over depression and yet the drug can provide some relief from depression at least in these preclinical animal models and they say m i a good puzzle right the more complex the puzzle the more interesting and they start digging in with preclinical studies and they start talking to clinicions who are treating patients for depression and i said thank goodness these sorts of scientists exists and thank goodness they did that because it turned out that when clinitions tried kedemine indepressed patients as a means to relieve depression it had remarkable effects it was about the year two thousand when the first sets of papers about the clinical use of kedemine for the treatment of depression started to emerge now we have to remember the contects in which all of this was happening now in two thousand drugs prosac and some of similar escess orize selective ceretona reuptaken hibiters things well butron were really hitting the market in full force and as we talked about earlier some people were getting relief some people were getting relief with a lot of side effects and therefore deciding not to take those drugs and a lot of people the majority of people that were taking those drugs were not getting relief there wers the real urgent need to find other drugs for the treatment of depression and kedemine the least based on it is apparent profile of being a dissoci vanecetic would seem the last drug that you would want to use to treat depression hided dissociates people even hereabout dissociation as a symptom of depression and yet what happened was a small number of very pioneering clinitions started to explore the use of kedemine in the clinic for the treatment of depression and in particular for depression that did not respond to any other treatment there was a real critical need to find other compounds and a bit more motivation to test some of these lat's call them a typical compounds for the treatment of depression one of the first landmark papers in the use of kedemine for the treatment of depression is entitled ant i depressnt effects of kedemine in depressed patients this is a paper that ie provided a link to in the shownote captions it is a small study ocaso does not involve many subjects at all relijous has seven subjects all of whom had major depression and they did interveneous injections with half of miligram parkilegram of body weight of kedemine now that dosage half a miligram porkilegram of bodyweight turns out to be very important for to day's discussion because it is going to serve as a reference point for later discussions when we get into other modes of delivery of kedemine such as oral pillform kedemine or sublingual kedemne and as it relates to things the kayhole or the dissoci of state ore the various effects that kedemie can have depending on the dosage and the delivery rout meanwhile going back to the study what they found is that when they injected patience with severe depression with kedemine the effects of kedemine took place within minutes within ten or fifteen minutes and that they experience a sort of pique euphoric state o kso they are not inducing deepenesesia rigte at this dosage their getting people into a kind of euphoric dreamy semi dissociative state that occurred within fifteen minutes and really piqued about forty five minutes to an hour after they were injected with the drug and that the total effects of the drug in terms of euforia were effectively over by about two hours or and that time course of effects makes perfect sense if you look it say the half life of kedemine which is how long it takes for half the drug to be active in the system et cetera but what was really interesting about this study and others it is that the patients experienced relief from their depression almost immediately after taking the drug within minutes to hours and that it persisted for several days after taking the kedemine kaso the dissociate of euphoric dream effects of kedemine take place very quickly their very very salent right the person basically is just lying there experiencing this euphoric dream dessociative state and they get some relief from their depression immediately and yet there is persistent relief from that depression which lasted at least three days out from the treatment now a key theme of to day's discussion is going to be that the anti depress inteffects of kedemine appear to be fairly short lived at least when one is exploring one or two treatments with kedemine in other words the typical contour is that people will take kedemine get this euporic dream to a seat of effact come out of that feeling some immediate relief from their depression this is one of the things that makes kedeming an incredibly attractive drug for the treatment of depression specially depression that has not responded to other forms of treatment which is that people get relief very very quickly indeed the same day that they initiate the treatment now this is a specially important when you think about the fact that the monoamian hypothesis of depression which drove the discovery and development of all these drugs assessor eyes while butrn et cetera those drugs often can provide support for people with depression again only forty per cent of people get true relief from their depression and again there are some side affectissues or majorside affectissues in some cases that have to be dealt with but even the positive effects even under the best conditions oftentimes those effects do not kick in for weeks or months after somebody initiates taking the drug now that might not seem a long time to wait for some of you but if you are somebody suffering from depression even another day even another hour with depression seems almost unmanageable and sadly many people who have these forms of depression will go on to commit suicide it is ever important that there be rapid treatments for depression even same day treatments for depression and based on the study it appeared that kedemin was and indeed still remains that drug now i certainly do not want to position kedemin in your mind as a miracle drug for depression in fact i do not actually believe in miracle drugs i do not think that there is any compound that alone can produce all the desired effects that one wants without any negative effects in a way that could warrant calling it a miracle drug that is just not how biology works there is always an interplay between pharmocology between our behaviors and what we choose to do or not do this ta topic will get into a lobit later when we talk about anti depressive behaviors and the role of cedemine in bringing about anti depressive behaviors for the relief of depression now with that said the study that i just mentioned as well as many many other stud ies that followed emphasize that kedemine could provide significant decreases in notjous depression and suicidality but also the feelings of helplessness and worthlessness that are associated with major depression and again it could do that in people that also we are not responding to other forms of depression treatment such as essessorise et cetera while we do not want to call it a miracle drug edemine turned out to be and remains an incredible drug for the treatment of depression in certain cases now in addition to that kedemine has been shown in clinical studies to provide relief not just for treatment resistant depression of the major depression type right theirs many different forms of depression but major depression is the one that we are normally thinking about or referring to when we talk about depression but kedmine has also been shown to be effective in treating by polar depression sometimes called by polar disorder ovo more commonly nowadays called by polar depression aden entire episode by the way on by polar depression if you want to know what it is and what it is not how it differs from borderline personality disorder et cetera can go to huberman labdokcam just put into the search function by polar and it will take you to that episode keemne has also been shown to be useful for the treatment of p t s d and for osed obsess ofe compulsive disorder and for anxiety and for various forms of substance ediction kedemine is not a miracle drug but it does seem to have broad application and to be very successful for the treatment of a lot of major psychiatric challenges now just because kedemine has shown these incredible applications it also has some serious problems that are directly related to how it works in the brain or at least from what we understand of how it works in the brain what i'm referring to hear is yes kedemine is very rapid acting it can often provide relief from depression almost immediately meaning same day however it is very short lived after about three days or a week or the anti depress in defects of kedemine ofte n wear off that creates a situation where people perhaps need to take kedemine every week and yet it creates enough of the dissociative state meaning it takes people enough out of their normal daily routine that the prospect of people taking kedemine every week is actually not that feasible and also because of some of the propensity for kedemine to become a drug of abuse that is for it to be habit forming and oreddicting one also worries that if people are doing kedemine every week to treat their depression that they can become called hooked on kedemine now fortunately there have been studies of kedemine and how it works not just in the short term but in the longer term that have led to some very important clinical studies that have explored for instance people taking kedemine twice per week for a duration of three weeks total and what they find is that yes after the first time they take it they get some relief from depression they take it a second time that week they get some relie from depression and they do the same thing the next week and the next week and when they do that they get relief from depression the whole way through that entire three weeks but it turns out that there is also some called durability to the effect such that if people do this twice a week dosing regiment kedemine twice a week for three weeks total they find that when they end that three weeks they get some on going relief from their depressive symptoms which can extend months or more before they have to repeat the twice a week for three weeks regiment now certainly not all studies of using kedemine for the treatment of depresion have used that exact dosed regiment twice a week for three weeks than take some time off repeat twice a week for three weeks take some time off repeat some have explored giving kemine once per week or even three times per week or doing it once a week for five weeks and then taking an extended period of time off before repeating the treatments scedual there a bmunch of different studies out there but when one looks at all of those studies an mass together it is very clear that kedemine is providing relief from depressive symptoms immediately and in the days after the treatment but that when those treatments are stacked fairly closely together that there is some durability some on going relief from depression and what this tells us is very important in fact i hope everybody really high this in their minds as their hearing it it is very likely that kedemine is acting by at least two and probably three different mechanisms in order to provide relief from depression one of those mechanisms induces relief from depression very quickly and seems to be associated with that uphoric dessociative dream state that one experiencs when they are under the influence of kedemy the second mechanism seems to provide relief from depression in the days and weeks that follow the kedemine treatment and there also appears to be a third mechanism by which kedmine can induce long lasting changes in the nervous systm and it is those three mechanism surt medium and long term mechanisms that produce the kinds of changes in neuro chemistry nd more importantly changes in actual neurl circuit wiring that allows kedemine to provide this incredible relief from depression next we are going to turn to what those mechanisms are because in understanding those mechanisms you will understand how kedemine provides this relief from depression but you will also come to understand the more important broader theme bof what depression is really all about at a neurl sircuit level and how relief from depression is all about ner plasticity as many of i've been taking agy one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsoring thepodcast a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole

you can claim the special offer of ten fre travel packs pluts a year supply of videmin d three k to how is kedemine really working we already establish that kedemine blocks the n m d a recepter and that the nm d a receptor is critical for many forms not all but many forms of neuro plasticity now i realize some of you might be familiar with called ligans and receptors but most of you probably or not a ligand is a khemical that binds to a recepter and a recepter is a little parking spot on the outside of a cell there can also be receptors inside of cells but most of the time when we are talking about nerve cells nurons and you hear the word receptors you are hearing about receptors on the outside of the cell the n m d a receptor does not exist in our nurons in order to bind kedemine it is there actually to bind all sorts of other things that are indogenous that are naturally made by us but kedemine has a very high what is called a finity t has a very high probability of binding to the nm d recepter if it is introduced to our blood stream when kedemine is taken in pillform sublingual form meaning under the tongue when it is injected into the muscler the vain it gets into the blood stream and then it is able to cross easily across the blood brain barrier hso call b b b blood brain barrier the blood brain berrier keeps a lot of things out of the brain but kedemine can very readily pass across the blood brain barrier once it is in the brain it has a very high affinity for meaning it knows how to seek out and bind to those n m d a recepters now the simplest way to explain how nm d a receptors ordinarily contribute to neuro plasticity is that they represent what is called an and gaite and an nd gate as the name suggests is a function in a cell or in a system where two things have to be present in fact for those of you that have a bit of an engineering or computer programming background you will be familiar with and gates for those of you that do not do not worry about it i'm going to explain what an and gate is right now an and gate in the context of nervous system function is when two things are present chemical a nd chemical b both have to be present in order for some process say nero plasticity to occur the nm da receptor as i'mention earlier is a receptor on the surface of nurons and it binds gludimate which is a molecule that we all make in our brain and it activates other nurons its what is called an excitatory nero transmitter now there are lots of different receptors for gludimate and those receptors are binding gludimate all the time however in order to activate the nm d a receptor there has to be a lot of gludimate present and it has to happen over very brief period of time the nm da receptor is an nd gate in the sense that gludimate has to be present and to bind it and it has to get a lot of electrical activity a lot of in put in order for that to happens it is a receptor that responds primarily to unusually high or frequent levels of electrical activity let us places in real world context th it makes a bit more cense i most all of you in moving my arms around a lot throughout the day now as an adult my motor cortecs the area of my brain that controls motor cordination of my limbs has connections from my brain to my spinal cord fom my sponicort to my muscles and that is what allows me to move my limbs under conditions of just moving my limbs and doing things throughout the day drinking a cup of coffee our our bamate walking outside to view some sunlight in the morning doing the things that i do every single day and that i already know how to do gludimate is definitely involved in that process gludmate binding to it is other receptor types which are alled ampa receptors for those you that want to know that is involved in that process it is typical level es of activity if however i were to sit down at this desk and be commanded to or decide to do some specific motor limb movement let us ay move my hand in a three dot sequence for those of you watching you can see this for those of either listening do not worry about its not very interesting to watch the point is just that i'm going to put my finger down in one to three points on the desk in front of me and then three to one points coming back to me now that is obviously a motor sequence that i can perform i just did it clearly i can perform it but if i were to do that for let us ay an hour what would happen is the nurons that are involved in generating that motor sequence of one to three three to one one to three three to one would be active over and over and over again and what would likely happen because of that unusual frankly motor behavior is that the nurons re responsible for generating that motor behavior would be able to detect it as unusually frequent unusually high levels of activity in the circuits that generate that behavior and the increase in glutimate that is in pinging on the nurons in that circuit would bind the enemdya receptor making it change several important things the first of which is that your nervous system is capable of changing but that is an energetically demanding process the incredible thing about nurro plasticity is that when you generate an unusually high or just an unusual pattern of activity motor activity or your hearing a new language your trying to learn that or your navigating a new city the nurons are firing in ways that are a typical for them and they are firing a lot more and the nurons are going to bind glutimate the enemdy a receptor is going to be activated and then down stream of enemdy a receptor activation are a bunch of what we call intereceller processes a bunch of things that happen in the cells to try and make that behavior occur again an again if needed but without the huge energetic demand you have experiencedthis before when you are trying to learn something and it feel sluggish ip feels hard it is frustrating and then eventule you learn it and it is very facile it is very easy one o the reasons for that is that when the enemdya receptor is activated by these infrequent or unusual patterns of activity it can then recruit other gludimate receptors the more typical kind the ampa type receptors to the cell surface and then those receptors can simply bind the glutoma and allow that behavior to occur without this whole process that is involved in neuro plasticity having to engage and do things build new protines in the cell build new machinery et cetera to just step back from this the way to think about the enemdy a recepter is that activation of the enemdy a recepter only occurs under conditions of unusually high or simply unusual patterns of activity that the enemdy a receptor yes controls neural activity in the immediate cense when it is activated it is changing the patterns of activity in the nuron sure but it also can engage gene expression and introduce new receptors to the cell basically giving the cell the ability to then recreate the same patterns of activity without having to do it in such a metabolically demanding way in fact a good analogy for all of this is the way that muscles can hypertrophe right if you overload muscles properly through resistance training of any kind and then give them a period of rest there is recruitment of specific things to the muscle fibrs as well as recruitment of changes in the nerves that inervate that control the contraction of those muscles and then those muscles grow they get stronger et cetera and they are able to function and use that new strength and new growth and you do not have to damage those muscle fibrs or trigger those adaptations over and over again to maintain them because you have this new capability now realize that is a lot of details about enemdya receptors in neuro plasticity but really if we need to o pick one biological mechanism that resides at the center of many many important forms of neuro plasticity it would be the enemdy a recepter and its functions that i just told you about now that you have that in mind that these enemdya receptors are critical at detecting unusual activity making changes to cells the cells can then respond to that t ctivity in the future you have in mind the conceptional basis for understanding how kedemine works because as i've mentiond several times already kedemine is an anm die receptor ballocker antagonist and yet we know that a lot of the changes in the brain that underlie the transision from a depressed state to a nondepress state involve narro plasticity what is going on there well what is going on there turns out to be extremely interesting and you can understand it very easily if you understand that theyare essentially two major types of nurons in the brain you have those excitatory nurons meaning nurons that when they are activated electrically they activate or excite other nurons at least they try to they release naro transmitter into the synaps which is the will gap between nurons the nurrons on the other side have receptors they bind those narro transmitters in this case gludimate which is the major excitatory nero transmitter in the brain and then there is a high probability that those other nurons will be excited that they will be electrically active that is one major type of called naro transmission in the brain the other major type of narro transmission in the brain is called inhibatory narro transmission inhibatory narro transmission involves nurons that release the narro transmitter gaba or sometimes also another molecule called gleicine but mostly gaba when gaba's released it has the property of reducing the probability that the next nuron will be electrically active in fact gaba's job is to bind a receptors on the next cell and to make it less electrically active we have got excitatory nauro transmission and we have inhibatory narro transmission and just to place in hibatory and exciatory noro transmission into context you think about a condition epilepsy which involves seizures of either the smaller type called petite mall seizures or grand mall seizures which are the type in which people have bodywide convulsions they are often disengaged from whatever's going on around them in those moments theyare shaking quite a lot its etera there many causes of seizures but to get to the heart of what a seizure is it is essentially run away excitation in the brain a small region of the brain becomes aspecially electrically active and that it spreads out from that fosie that focus of the excitazion and that recruits a lot of nurons in a fairly non specific way creating the seizure motor patterns in the body and patterns of activity in the brain that can involve thisengagement from immediate experience and lack of perception sometimes theres or a there is the whole discussion to be had about seizure and by the way seizure can occur in a lot of different contexts of course it can occur in epilepse that can cur after head injury et cetera will cover seizure in a future episode of this podcast of course but one of the major causes of seizure and by extension lack of seizure is that ordinarily inhibatory nurons and excitatory nurons are in this kind of push pull that for somebody that does not experience seizures puts the brain in balance they do not have seizures right the inhibatory nurons are suppressing the activity of many nurons that those many nurons do not get run away excitation you do not get seizures the excitatory nurons are feeding back on to the inhibitory nurons everything is kept in balance there is not too much in habition there is not too much excitation everythings in balance o caseanow you understand that there are enemdia recepters and these are critical for many forms of nuro plasticity you also understand that there are excitatory nrons which stimulate the electrical activity of other nurons and that there are inhibitory nurons in your brain that inhibit or suppress the activity of other nurons and that you need excitatory end in hibitory communication between nuronce at all times and that it has to remain in balance and that the enemdia recepter is normally just sort of sitting there not doing a whole lot unless levels of nural activity are elevated above their normal base line and then you can get changes in the nural circuits and those changes can be ver y long lasting andlet us not forget the piece of information most pertinent into today's discussion which is about kedemine which is that kedemine blocks that enemdy a recepter end there is the connunger might keep coming back to which is you need nurl plasticity in order to get releef from depression what researches have discovered is that yes kedemine blocks the enemdia recepter it actually quiets down nurons it prevents nurons from being as active as they normally would be and yet somehow almost paradoxically it increases nural plasticity in brain circuits that are involved in mood in reward in self reflection will get into what those brain circuits are in a little bit the way it works is that kedemine binds to the enemdia receptor present on inhibatory nurons and in doing dramatically reduces the amount of inhibition comi ng from those inhibatory nurons on to excitatory nurons when that happens the excitatory nurons in specific circuits of the brain are allowed to increase their activity they do what is called bursting bursting is a pattern of electrical activity whereby normally one of these exciteatory nurons is releasing gludimate in a pattern that might look or sound this actually does not make a sound in the brain but if you were to record from one of these nurons which people have done many times over and then you were to convert the electrical signal in those nurons to an audiomonitor you would hear the firing the action potential of those nurons as a that is what it actually sounds on the audiomoner something a lobit of static but if the normal firing of the nuron is which is the pretty typical base line firing of the nurons in the relevant circuits to mood that i 'm going to be discussing under conditions where kedemine has been brought into the system binds that enemdya recepter blocks the output of those inhibatory nurons on to the excited tory nuron now the excitatory nuron is firing in burst and those bursting patterns of electrical activity are the absolute perfect patterns of activity that induce not ja short term but long term changes in the nerl circuits associated with reward with dopamine release with disappointment and with mood in ways that are directly relevant to suppressing or providing relief from the symptoms of major depression now i realize what i just told you is a lot of information in fact what i just describe represents essentially what i would teach to an advanced undergraduate slash graduate course medical school course on nerow plasticity and howcedemine works keuve in mind that we are having a discussion here that is at a fairly high level and if you could understand even us tiny fraction even just one bit it what i just described you are doing great ifyou could understand more outstanding just to make sure that everyone is on the same page as we move forward because i do want to make sure that everyone understands cedemine and how it works because it does have the sort of cryptic functions of engaging nerl plasticity in ways that are not obvious if you just ask what is kedemin do when you inject it what is cedemean produce in terms of a feeling state and then how to somebody get relief from depression that can all start to get a litle bit muddled unless you understand the following some we to tell it to you again in just very top contour terms somebody takes a pill or an injection or sublinguacedemi it makes its way into the blood stream and then it makes its way into the brain once it is in the brain it binds to a particular category of receptors called the enemdie receptor the enemdie receptor is receptor that normally is quiacent just con a sitting there does intend to do a lot under normal conditions of everyday life however the enemdy a receptors typical function o caseo when there is no cedemine in the body or brain is to detect abnormal levels of neral activity and in doing recruit cha nges to cells recepters et cetera literally change the nurons in ways that allow them to respond to that activity in the future without having to be under such big metabolic demand and they do that by recruting more recepters et cetera much in the same way as when you overload a muscle in the gim it will eventually recover if you low to recover and it will get stronger through the addition of a bunch of new protines te nerve communication that muscle will change the muscle and the nerve to muscle connection change it gets stronger and sometimes it gets bigger and stronger in the same way a nuron can change the way it functions in response to experience and nurons do not know experience of life in any other way except the patterns of electrical activity and chemical activity that impinges on them k now kedeming the drog binds to and blocks that enemdy a receptor the obvious conclusion would be that kedeming prevent nurol plasticity and that is not what happens we know that kedeming actually induces nurol plasticity and it does specifically in the brain circuits that control mood the net consequence being improvements in mood how does it happen it happens because kedeming binds to and blocks those enemdya receptors on inhibitory nurons the inhibatory nurons of the nurons that normally suppress the activity of other nurons when kedeming binds to the enemdie receptor the activity of those inhibatory nurons is reduced and as a consequence excitatory communication between nurons in those mood related circuits increases and it increases it in a way that recruits nuro plasticity that strengthens those connections and makes them more likely to be active in the future now it is not the case at least at clinical doses that kedeming induces seizures it certainly can at hierdoses but at clinical doses when kedemine suppresses the activity of those inhibitory nurons and the excitatory nurons ramp up their activity the ramping up their activity a lot and enough to create ch anges in those neural circuits associate with mood and the changes are in the direction of making those nerl circuits more likely to generate positive mood and less likely to generate negative mood will get into the specifics of those circuits in a litwl bit but kedemine is not creating the kind of enormous increases in excitatory communication between nurons that leads to that runaway excitation now the point of the descussion we just had over the last ten minutes or with severalfold first of all i do believe it is important to understand the key components of neural plasticity which is this remarkable feature of our brain and nervous sistem that we all have right this ability to change our own brain circuits no other organ in the body as far as we know can direct its own changes but we can direct our own brain changes and the enemdy a receptors absolutely critical for that i also think it is important understand the difference between inhibatory and excitatory communication between nurons because that is just central to understanding brain function brain function is a series of accelerators and breaks it is not all about nuron stimulating other nurons it is also about nurons preventing the activation of other nurons that is just central to everything not just preventing seizures but its central to learning its central to vision its central to hearing its central to creativity it is at the core of brain function and the other reason to have the discussion we just did is that kedemine has this incredible property it can literally change the neural circuits that generate mood that generate your feelings of well being but it does through a somewhat convoluted pathway right it blocks the receptor that everyone thinks his involved i nurl plasticity and in doing it actually creates nurl plasticity now even though i just described all of that to you over the last ten minutes or keep in mind that what i just describe to you as a process that actually occurs in the brain takes many many days it involve cells changing gene expression making new protenes new receptors any time we say neural plasticity even when you read about called short termneral plasticity it is happening over the course of it least many many hours and more likely many days or even weeks the process iav just described of how kedemine creates nor al plasticity through blockade of enemdia receptors is very likely to be the process that explains the longer term changes in mood and affect that are associated with kedemine therapy for the treatment of depression now it is possible that kedemean blocking the enemdya receptor is also responsible for some of the immediate effects of kedemine that people experience when they take the drug the dissociation the in some cases uphoria and that sort of dream state that it can put people into that is possible but it is very clear that the enemdya receptor blockade is critical for the nurl plastic changes that are going to occur over the days and weeks following kedemine treatment and if you think back to our earlier discussion when we were talking about the two time a week over three week type regimen of taking kedemine or some variant on that now it might start to make sense as to why yes there is immediate and short term benefit of taking kedemine for depression in the clinicaly appropriate setting of course i'm not talking about recreationwal useright now but that also there is some durability of those effects that even after the three weeks of taking kedemine twice per week people often will experience weeks or months of relief from depression when they are not doing the weekly kedemine therapy cessions that longer term relief that are referring to as durability of the treatment is very likely to be the consequence of actual nurl circuit rewiring now there is an additional and very important facit to this whole discussion about narl plasticity in response to kedemine treatment for depression if you recall the the burst firing that induces that plasticity i told you it induces plastosity by dint tell you how now you already could imagine some of the mechanisms that could be incertion of those new gludimate recepter those emper receptors that we talked about however even for that to happen a bunch of other things have to happen first but one of the key ons to understand is the thing i mention at the beginning of to day's episode b d and f which stands for brain derive neutrophic factor brain derive neutrophic factor is an incredible molecule i should mention that it is one of many grow factors in the brain and it has its own set of receptors it binds to something called the trackob receptor t r k b treck b receptor when bedon f binds to tract b receptors on nurons it does a lot of things it sets off a whole cascade of things including the insertion of new gludimate receptors that those nurons become extra sensitive to any in put they get and that is one form of change that bedon f can create bedon f can also alter the overall shape of nurons it can cause nurons to grow new branches that it can receive new imputs from other nurons any time bed en f is discussed in popular books or the popular press people will talk about it as quoting fertilizer for nurons i do not really that term because it really undervalues the total number of things that bedion f can do bdion f actually can act as its own kind of nuro transmitter it can actually stimulate other nurons and it does a bunch of other things but forsake of this discussion about kedemine understand that that burst firing of nurons that very high frequency firing of nurons can invoke the release of bedian f in ways that make those circuits very plastic very quickly and in addition to that there is some evidence that kedemin itself may be able to cause release of bedion f directly without having to go through all of the mechanisms that i overwhelm you with a few minutes ago or hopfully did not overwhelm me with but that i taught to you a few minutes ago now what is especially exciting about bedion f in the context of kedemin therapy for depression is that it appears based on both preclinical and clinical studies that be d an f is in just one of the ways in which kedemine can invoke nurrow plasticity and these improvements in mood it may actually be required it may be the censral process to all of that now it can still be downstream of all that enmdia receptor stuff that we talked about before but therere several lines of evidence that suggests that kedemine induced release of bedan f is one of the cor mechanisms by which kedemine can relieve depression now the are several lines of evidence to support what i just said about bedon f in the context of kdemin first of all in mice that lack bedon f they have no bedon f they cannot make bedon f because they do not have the gan for bedon f we call those be d an f knockout mice in those mice if you give them kedemine and you put them into that learned helplessness task that we talked about a bit earlier where you put them into water and see how long they swim normally kedemine would allow mouse to swim longer to fight for its life longer well it no longer does that in a bdon f knockout mouse and the only thing that is different about that mouse as far as we know is the lack of bedon f and their ways to make sure that it is lack of bedon f in the specific norons that are relevants everything were talk about not just that their limbs do not work as well et cetera in other words all the appropriate control experiments have been done that is preclinical data because it comes from animal models in addition to that depressed people who have a mutent form of bedon f these humans are not knockouts for bedionf they can make bedon f but the bedonf does not function normally in those people they have a very reduced response to keemin treatment for depression suggesting that bedon f action is at least one of the critical functions that allows kedmine to relieve depression and as i mention earlier kedemine kan actually invoke the release o bed an f and get this there is some evidence that kedemin itself can bine to the track b receptr that is it caonbine to the bedion f receptr it kan mimic bed an f this is an entirely diferent way of thinking about kedemine than we normally hereabout now nowadays we hear a lot about kedemine and kedemi and therapy we also here fortunately about some of the problems of ketemine abuse we will talk about some of those concerns loit later and we hearabout bedi enf the called brain fertilizer but rarely if ever do we hear that kedemine itself konmimic the effects of bedion f in the brain but researches inclinations are definitely paying attention to this and it is strying to raise what i consider a very exciting model of how kedemine could provide relief for depression which is that it is acting as a growth factor in the brain or at least it is mimicing the action of growth factors allowing the specific neralcircuits that control things mood outlook on the future self reflection et cetera allowing the circuits to change in ways that provide significant relief for major depression and in doing and this is a very important point it appears that kedemine is relieving depression in ways that are entirely different from any other kind of treatment now in an earlier episode about syliciben and its potential role for the treatment of depression i went into a lot of depth about how scylicibon can induce neral plasticity to provide relief for major depression in certain individuals under certain conditions i do on a highlike that because indeed it is another case where nerl plasticity is involved but in that situation as some of you may remember or if you do not do not worry i'll tell you right now it was a pretty straightforward model sylciben looks a lot ceratone and khemically except that sylisibon bines a particular receptor when that receptor is bound it allows these brain wide changes those brain wide changes seem to change one's reflection on oneself called ego dissolution changes and mood that ar stable over time et cetera et cetera it was all pretty straightforward with kedemine it is clear their multiple mechanisms involved and perhaps most importantly with kedemine it is that immediate relief that occurs day of or close to day of treatment and in the days afterwards and it is that long term relief that very likely is the consequence of enemdya receptor suppression bar irst activity in nurons within these mood related circuits bedionf being released and changing neral circuit strengthening them in order to give elevated mood as a consequence of that bursting activity and kedemine mimicing bedianf in otherwords cedemine acting more or less a growth factor in the brain in order to make sure that whatever changes occur in those neral circuits to elevate mood are durable that they really are reinforced and last over time i to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors which is element element is an electrolite drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt sodium magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolite concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisits in cognitive end physical performances element contains a science backtolectrolike ratio of one thousand miligrams that one grahm of sodium two hundr milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot and certainly i drink element in my water when i 'm in the sauna and after going in the sana because that causes quite a lot of sweating if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc com slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el emente do com slash hubermen basically iave discussed two major mechanisms for how chedemine can induce norplasticity leading to improvements in mood an affect that gives relief for depression those two mechanisms are linked or at the very least are happening in parallel there happening at the same time in the brain now just to make matters more interesting there is an in credible twist into this whole thing of how kedemine works and when i say how kedmine works and not just talking about howkedemin provides relief for depression i'm also talking about why people use kedemine for recreational purposes and it is the following yes kedemine has all these impacts on excited turing arouds and hibitoring arounds beady enough et cetera et cetera but kedemine can also bind receptors in the opioid pathway now what is the opioid pathway do not worry here i'm not going to hit you with a lot of details but we have all heard of the opioid crisis by nowor at least most of you have the opiod crisis refers specifically to people taking exogionous opioids taking opioids rits of taking pills that act of ate particular receptors in the brain that lead to analgeza in some casis pain relief that lead to changes ind mood there is a lot to be said about the opod crisis it is called tha crisis for a reason many many people are addicted to those compounds that is a discussion for another time keep a mind that the receptors those drugs bind to are opioid receptors and those receptors that you and i all have by the way do not exist in order to bind drugs that are made by fivesuitical companies they exist in our brain and body to bind to the called indogenous naturally made opioids that we all make and those receptoreceptiverent names the mew opioid receptor the kapaopioid receptr et cetera they cin't have the names of greek letters to deferentiate them now kedemine kan bind to various opioid receptors and when opeoid receptors are bound we know that creates certain effects things pain relief things changes in psychic states dissociation for example if enough of them are bound you can get uforic states under certain conditions of hy dose binding of kedemine to those opiod receptors you can start getting into plaines of anaesthesia where people lose consciousness and actually have no response to pain whatsoever if you recall the clinical studies we talked about earlier where kedemine was used to relieved depression well the dosage used in that study as you recall was half a miligram per kilegram of bodyweight that is the dosage that will induce these dissociative mild euphoria those sorts of states of mind but where people are still conscious when you strarke get into dosages of kedemine that are in the range one to two miligrams per kilegram of bodyweight now you are talking about anaesthetic dosis and when that happens you are going to get full parking full saturation of all the potential receptors the kedemine conbined to those enempty e receptors it is going to block thoushe it is also going to bind to the cal mew opioid receptors and maybe this other type as well for those of you that want to know you offysionatos also the capa type opioid receptors and what we have got here is a drug kedemine that is hitting two different systems the gludimate related system and the indogeonous opioid system and researchers in clinitions have logically started to ask whether or not somre all of the effects of kedemine are due to the opioid system adthey want to know which effects those are now this is where things start to get really interesting both in the contects of clinical treatment of depression and recreational use first of all when people take kedemine again it enters the blood streame and it goes into the brain but it is metabolyzed to something called h n k which is hydroxy norkedemine now i do not expect what hydroxy nor kedemine is and i do not expect you to care about it until i tell you what i'm about to tell you which is that hydroxy norkedemine has an incredible specificity for the mew opioid receptor and maybe that kapa opiod receptor is well in other words when we talk about kedemine that is the drug people take but when it goes into the body it is converted into yet another drug and that other drug hydroxy nor kedemine is selectively activating the e opioid system this led researchers to ask at a very important question which is when a human being takes kedmine in order to treat their depression and they get some relief from depression is that the consequence of neuroplastic changes in all those enmdi a gludema bedian f related circuits that we talked about before or is it the consequence of something happening in the opioid system ey u cannot ignore the fact that kedemine has this property of binding to these opioid receptors because they have such a powerful effect on our thinking on our mood on our state of consciousness it is entirely reasonable that the opioid system could be a major player if not the major player in this whole depression relief thing and maybe even in the creation of dissociatof symptemology when people take kedemine recreationally what researchers slash coinitions did is they undertook a series of experiments where they gave people kedemne for the relief of depression but they also blocked the opioid receptor system and they did that using a drug called nal trecksone what i'm about to describe to you as a study done by my colleagues at stamford school of medicine namely doctor nolan williams and allanchatsburg an colleagues entitled a tenuation of antideprescent and anti suicidal effects of kedemine by opioid receptor antagonism and as a consequence of me reading you that titale a moment to go you now already have the conclusion of the study what they observed is that when people were given kedemine they got relief from depression that was not surprising again many studies have shown that before since the early two thousands if however individuals were given now treckzone to block the opioid receptor pathway and they were given kedemine well then the anti depressant effects of kedemine were no longer observed now that suggest that it is the opioid receptor system that is responsible for the anti depressang effects of kedemine and perhaps this h n k this hydroxy nor kedemine which is the metabolite of kedemine is the way in which keemie normally relieves depression now a lot of people took note of these studies because after all there are probably dozens if not hundreds of studies looking at the effects of kedemine on all that enemdie receptor stuff and indeed nerol plasticity and mood related circuits cannot be discounted as one way in which kedemine provides relief from depression but what was very interesting is that in people given kedemine end now trickson those people still experienced the immediate effects of kedemine the mild euphoria the dissociation the feelings that one would normally expect when people were under the effects of kedemine but what they did not get were the longer term changes in mood that we would call relief from depression now of course the goal of modern psychaetry is to treat depression not to block the effects of these drugs that are capable of treating depression now what the study does and by the way there are several studies it that support these general set of findings that part of the critical roll of kedemine in providing relief from depression is to activate the opioid system but what the study does is it really points to the fact that when we say kedemine treatment or we talk about somebody taking kedmine recreationally for that matter we have to pay attention to what is happening while they are under the influence of the drug we also have to pay attention to what is happening in the days in weeks after thei're under the influence of the drug and perhaps most importantly this calls to mind of really important idea which is that whether ot your talking about kedemine induced relief from depression or syllicibe in induce relief for depression or emdia may induced relief for p t st atopic that i covered on a previous episode of this pod cass we have to step back and look at the idea that the effects of the drug that people experience whatever those may be because obviously its going depend on what particular drug they took those immediate effects may not actually be related to the long term clinical benefit of those particular drugs now i realize that many people might not that idea and frankly i do not actually think that is the way that at works i do not think it is go ng to be in either or situation however because drugs kedemine sylicibe and emdiama have such profound effects on people's psychic states when they are under te influence of them and because at least in the proper clinical setting and use they do seem to provide impressive relief from a lot of these psychiatric challenges depression and petiesty people naturally correlate those two things they couple those two things in fact they collapse those two things and presume that their experience of what they saw what they heard how they felt while they were under the influence of the drug was actually the stimulus that created the relief from their clinical condition depression but what these data on combine treatment with kedemine and nel trecsone to block the meuopioid receptor really show us is that that may not actually be the way that it works it may be that the effects of a drug kedemine that one experiences while interesting perhaps even profound perhaps great insight comes to one when they do that therebe in the proper context it is not clear at all that it is that experience in the effects of those drugs in those immediate minutes and hours that is actually what is causing the relief from depression now again i do not think it is in either or i to view the whole situation more or less as a sort of wave front that the experience that one has subjectively while they are under the influence of a drug cedmine or sylicibon or emdia may sets off a series and in fact multiple serieses said a word multiple types of processes in the brain some of which rely on things enemdie recepter bedienough et cetera typenor oplasticity others which rely on the opioid receptor pathway and that each of these have different time courses such that some provide immediate relief in the days and hours after treatment some in the weeks after treatment and some more durable longlasting changes that can occur over months or may be vin years and a really important thing to under score in the context of all this is that throughout to day's discussion we have been talking about drugs and receptors and relief from depression but what were really talking about here are people who get relief from depression and almost with certainty when they get relief from depression they are also starting to do other things they are going back to work they are engaging in relationships again they are viewing themselfs differently again ofully their getting morning sunlight and exercising and eating well and doing all the sorts of things that we would call anti depressive behaviors and it is impossible to separate the positive behavioral consequences of a drug treatment for depression from the drug itself in a way that lets us say oka kedemine relieved depression and then as a consequence people went in did a bunch of behaviors that were healthy for them ore stopped engaging in behaviors that were unhealthy for them we can think of behaviors as pro depressive oranti depressive in fact we know that one particular behavior that is viewing blue light in the middle of the night between the hours of say eleven p m and for a m is known to invoke a pro depressive circuit it involves a structure cal a the habenula have talked about this on previous podcasts ittends to lower dopemine and increase cortus all in the days following that exposure to light et cetera et cetera there are pro depressive behaviors and thereare anti depressive behaviors we know that viewing morning sunlight getting regular and sufficient amounts of quality sleep proper nutrician proper social engagement there is now a plathera of quality research pointing to the fact that those are true anti depressive behaviors we can never separate out the effects of a drug from the effects of a drug that feed back on and combine with the effects of the drug that one is hoping for in this case depression relief oh case o i've been book ending this conversation about kedemine at two very divergent levels meaning weve been talking about high level stuff relief from depressive symptoms and we have not been going into a lot of detail about that but that is pretty high level were tock about thought changes behavioural changes that were calling anti depressive right changes ind mood and affect that are positive posive anticipation of the future et cetera et cetera nd then we have also been talking a lot at this other end which is very reductionis down at the cellar molecular level by recepters and finding a receptors in nural plasticity an trackbee and all that stuff weve completely neglected meaning i've completely neglected until now what bridges those two levels of understanding and what bridges those two levels of understanding are the nural circuits that actually change when one takes cedemie whether or not those changes occur quickly whether not they take a longer periative time whether not they involve and emdia receptors or the opioido receptrsystems or both we know that certain nurl circuits change when people take cedemne in these patterns of dosage and frequency of about half a minbligram prkilogram and again that is the injected form twice per week over three weeks and then they get some durable resistance to depression fortunately we can talk about those naural circuits without having to bring about a lot more noming clature a lot of new language and i say fortunately because i realized to day you have been hit with a lot of new terms now i've already mention one of the key brain structures and that is the hobanula a few moments to go i talked about the hobanula and the context of people who get too much bright to light exposure in the middle of the night that activates the hobanula it is a sort of disappointment circuit we can call at that because we know that it leads to prodepressive symptoms in animal models and very likely in humans as well and it does we know by reducing dopomine and increasing cortus all there is evidence that when people undergo cedemane therape connections between the habanula what we can broadly just talk about as a structure involved in generating a feeling of disampointment the connections between the habanula and the reward circuitry of the brain which i've talked about several times before on this podcast but for those of youither familiar with it this is the cal mesolymbic reward pathway as areas the ventural tegmentalarea the nucly sucumbence do not w orry at all about those names just know that this is a brain area that its chalka block full of nurons that release dopamine which is a molecule that tends to increase mood increase motivation in many ways we can think about it at least for sake of this discussion as anti depressive what we have got is a structure the habanula that normally provides inhibatory and now what that means inhibatory in put to this reward pathway that releases dopamine and when people take kedemine that inhibition is lessen such that the reward pathway is more available for engagement through daily life activities now i say available for engagement through daily life activities for very specific purpose which is that all of the changes in narrl circuits that were talking about that can come about from taking a drug well those changes do not actually do a whole lot unless those circuits are reenforced by particular behaviors this relates back to what i said just a few minutes ago about pro depressive and anti depressive behaviors somebody can take kedemne and potentially get relief from depression but if they continue to engage in pro depressive behaviors they are not going to get much if any releef from depression conversely if somebody takes kedemine and they are reducing the amount of output from this disappointment circuit the habanula to the reward circuitry of the brain and they do engage in behaviors such as seeking out work that stimulates them seeking out social engagement taking good care of their body their mental health or physical health et cetera well those circuits are not designed to respond to kedemi they are designed to respond to particular patterns of thinking and behavior again we cannot forget that when we hear that a drug causes plasticity in a given nerral circuit what it is doing as its bizing the balance or the probability that those neral circuits will be engaged by certain activities but one still has to engage in those activities now fortunately when people tend to have elevations in mood they tend to move around more when they tend to move around more they tend to engage in more things when they ten to engage in more things if they have a positive outlook on life presumely they are engaging in adaptive things things social relationships job related school related goal related behavior it is important understand that a discussion of nural circuit changes in response to kedemine is really discussion of nural circuit changes in response to kedemine that shift ones over all system toward having yet further nural circuit changes in response to daily activities and thereby bolstering health or in this case of mental health now it is also important understand that rarely if ever does it drug provide relief for some sort of clinical challenge in just a one trap kind of way the way to think about this is that most mental processies and certainly things depression are a two way road you have prodepressive behaviors and circuits and you have anti depressive behaviors in circuits and perhaps it will not be surprising to you that there is evidence that kedemine treatment can reduce the output from the habanula to the reward pathway this disappointment to reward pathway weakening that making the reward pathway more available for engagement through thoughts and behaviors that are anti depressive and in addition to that it can further bolster the nural plostesity within the reward pathway itself in particular with connections with the frontal quartex and for those of you that are not familiar with the frontal quartex your frontal quartex does a lot of things but one of the things that your frontal quartex is absolutely critical for is for establishing context dependent strategy meaning for allowing you to say oke in a given circumstance what should i do to get the results i want in another circumstance what should i do to get the results i want it is not strategizing of the manipulative type although i suppose it could be its strategizing of how do i get what i need from this social connection how do i get what i need from my goals in exercise how do i get what i need from my goals in terms of work or school et cetera your frontal quartex is that party or quartex this always churning ideas it is always wondering and my doing well in my not doing well and is adjusting your behavior accordingly it is now establishd that kedemine can improve conictivity that is it can strengthen the connections between areas of the brain that are associated with contect dependent strategy building and these reward pathways and other wrds it makes people more sensitive to whether not they are getting the results they want from their efforts and to how to adjust their efforts that they do get the results they want from those efforts and there is other evidence that n m d a receptor blockade is not the way that kedemine provides relief from depression namely there is a drug calle mementine it is used actually to treat alceimers and it too is an n m d a receptor blocker and it has no antidepressent effects now as you recall kedemine is a dissociative anesthetic and one of its primary effects as to create this feeling of dissociation for those you that are not familiar with what dissociation is dissociation is ware people feel separate from their body they can still think but it is as if they are observing themselves in fact an anticipation for this episode i consulted with several different colleagues in the department of psychootriate stamford school of medicine and one of them describe the effects of kedemne as described by a patient of theirs who had taken kedemine for the treatment of depression and that pation described it as observing themselves thinking observing themselves doing things even though they were lying completely still and perhaps most importantly describing themselves as being above their body and actualy looking down on themselves from the third person perspective now that i realize s of foreign experience to most people but of course there are people who experienced association even while not on kedemine and as many of dissociation is actually one of the primary symptoms of ptest and trama this raises a sort of conundermuna why is it that a particular state of mind that is associated with ptest and trama and in some cases depression itself which is induced by a drug kedemin can provide relief from depression and that all goes back to the n eral plastic changes that we talked about earlier and more likely that changes in the mew opioid receptr system that we talked about earlier but none the less the dissociative effacts of cedemin are profound for people that take them that i thought i'd spendimen or two explaining what likely causes that dissociative third personing of self effect and in far as we know it has to do with an uncoupling of certain brain circuits in particular neel cortical brain circuits the nelcortics is the part of the brain the lumpy outside part of the brain that is associated with action planning it does a lot of things really it involved in sensory perception it is volved in speech generation many many things but the neo cortek has connections to other regions which are called subcortical regions and it seems that when people take kedemine or fencyclotine p c p there is an uncoupling of those networks a quieting of those networks that starts to create a different dominant rhythm in the brain some of you may be familiar with rhythms in the brain caled alpha rhythms or alphapatterns of activity thats just dominant patterns of activity associated with particular brain state for instance alphabrainways are associated with an alert but calm relaxed state of mind where thoughts are sort of free flowing it is a little bit dream but it is not really a draim where anything can happen it has a structure to it when people take kedemine the alphapattern of activity is completely abolished at least for the duration of time that they are under the influence of the drug which typically is about an hour to two hours or and the different pattern of brain activity which is call the thata pattern of brain activity starts to really emerge it is as if it gets unveiled and that thata pattern of activity is the one that is associated with a dream state it is the one that resides mor or less at that limital border between wakefulness and sleep if you have ever been falling asleep and you are thinking something youare running and you kicked your leg it is very likely that you are in thata pattern of activity in your brain at that moment just prior to when you woke up whereas when you are more alert you see ptte ns of activity that are higher frequency things alpha bateo rhythms and forth kedemine produces particular patterns of brain activity and this sense of dissociation when it is taken at sub an esthetic doses if you recall the clinical studies we talked about earlier they inject it half a miligram perkilegram of bodyweight in order to provide depression relief for those pationts when people take kedemine they will take it by different ralts of delivery and now here we have to expand our conversation to include both the clinical context research studies and recreational use now i do that because typically when people take kedemine in a study in a clinical study they will get an intervenious into the vain or an intra muscular into the muscle injection of half a miligram perkilegram of bodyweight kedemie however when people are taking kedemine recreationally or when they are access in kedemine legally by prerscription and taking it at home which is becoming a more common practice they will often take it orly in pillform or they will take it sublinguilly by putting under the tongue or in their cheek and the tet called troch dissolves and the kedemine goes into their system ow an importanthing to understand is that when people take kedemine orly only twenty five per cent of the active form of kedemine makes it into the blood stream and when they take it sublingually typically only about thirty five per cent of the total amount of kedemine they take is converted into metabolically active kedemine that acts on the nurons in their brain when you hear about the dosages used in studies they are going to generally involve injections of kedemine and far lower doses of kedemine than when you heareabout people taking kedemine oarlier sublinguilly for instance i weigh two hundred and twenty pounds that is a hundred kilegrams if i were to be in one of these studies which i have not been but if i were i would be given fifty miligrams of kedemine by way of injection however if i were going to try to achieve the same amount of active kedemine in my bloodstream and brain as i would through injection i woul need to injest three times as much kedemne by way of pill and perhaps a little bit more by way of sublinguel kedemine if i wanted to get the same effects if i were to take fifty miligrams by way of injection in a study and i went to a different study and they said o kat we want to recreate that effect were ganing tiv you a pill typically they are going to give me a hundred in fifty miligrams of kedemin in a pillform or two hundred miligrams of kedemine in the troh sublinguel form now it is really important to understand this dose dependence according to delivery business because i realize that nowadays especially a lot of people are taking kedemine through legal sources they are accessing it legally but they are taking it outside the clenic and more typically they are taking it not by way of injection meaning thei'r taking hierdose kedemine and thei're taking it sublinguilly or oraly it is very important t understand this dose dependence according to mode of delivery business now in anticipation of this episode i put out a request for questions about kedemine on tuitter and i got many many questions some excellent ones therein one of the more common questions was what is a kayhole in scientific terms a kayhole is what is use to describe the subjective experience of when somebody takes kedemine typically recreationally and they end up in basically a pseudo and esthetized state what that means is that they took a dosage that for them put them beyond the boundary of the sub anesthetic dose and has them transitioning into the anaesthesia level dose of kedemine now i mentioned everything i did about dosages before because it is very important to know that different people even if they are of a quivalent bodyweight are going to respond to keemie differently depending on how quickly and how thoroughly they metabolized kedemine in the clinical context injections of kedemine into the vain or into the muscle are done at this half a miligram perkilegram dose and they of clinitions there they have researchers there who are paying attention to whether not the person is in a associative state if they are still conscious and to see whether not the person is going into full blown anastisia now that is one of the values of doing kedemine in the context of a legal clinical setting however i be remiss if i did not acknowledge that a lot of people are getting kedemine legally but than taking it at home hopefully not alone hopefully their some one there to monitor them or their insestion with their physician overzume that is icually happening morn more these days through telahealth but that itself also has certain resrit because if the purtness in need something and they do not have someone there immediately in the room to take care of it that could be a very problematic situation and of course there are situations where people are taking kedemine recreationally regardless of how theyre requiring it they are taking it and they are guessing how they are going to respond to it based on some crude understanding of dosages but when people talk about a kayhole what they are talking about is taking kedemine at a dose that for them takes them beyond the mild or perhaps even in extreme dissociation and starts placing them into full blown anastisia and that itself actually can be dangerous going in to enasisia planes of consciousness while not always deadly can be deadly and it certainly can be and has been deadly when people start to combine it with other drugs in particular drugs barbituits or alcohol i want to be very clear that the dosage ranges that you hereabout when hearing about kemine are extremely broad and is the very ability to any one given dose and too is the response to a given dose in a given person depending on the route of delivery you need to be very careful about the ability of kedemine to take you into deep deep planes of unconsciousness and in some cases death and of course as with any seditive one needs to be extremely cautious about doing anything driving or even walking in traffic or walking anywhere in some cases s if one is under the influence of kedemie additionally for those of you that are seizure prone either do to epilepse our prior head injury or tibour seizure prone and you do not know it kedeming kan indu eizures and it should be completely obvious to you now why that is the case kedemine blocks an mdiea receptors on inhibitory nurons and quiets threir activity which of course can lead to run away excitation in the brain if you are seizure prone when i put out the request for questions about kedemine on social media i also got a lot of questions about the different forms of kedemie when i say different forms that included questions about whether not intrenasal was better than orl was better than sublinguel et cetera et cetera to be fair with one exception the different modes of delivery probably relate more to dosage that actually gets metabolize than to anything else what i mean by that is most people do not know how to equate the clinical dose of half a miligram per kilegram of bodyweight into a dosage to take orly or sublinguilly or in some cases by the way people will take it rectily and te reason people take kedemin rectily is that rectal administration by passes the liver and indeed kedemine can be hard on the liver to metabolize it can dramatically increase liver an zimes oftentimes people that are taking kedemine frequently and do not want to create damage to the liver they will opt for rectal administration now i realize that unless it is somehow relates your profession any times somebody says introrectily it raises a few eyebrows and people kon lean back a little bit and i get it in a future episode of the podcast i promised to distinguish between the different modes of drug metabolism depending on whether not people take something orly sublinguily by injection or rectily another common question i got when i solicited for questions about kedemine on social media was about the r verses s verses r s forms of kedemie i must tell you that sent me down a deep deep rabbit hole of research in which i discovered very contradictory evidence for instance i could find papers i did find papers that said that the r form of kedemine had a much greater affinity for the endemdie receptor than did the s form of kedemne i also found reviews that said the exact opposite kay and there i was sitting with the two reviews in front of one another wondering if there was something wrong with my visual system until i called a collague doctor nolland williams whose a tripleboard certified neurologous psychiatrist at sandford school of medicine whose laboratory specializes in the use of kedemine for studies of treating depression and for treating depression in the clinical population i asked him what is the deal here i'm getting very contradictory evidence and he spelled it all out for min it appears based on the clinical data inhumance and on binding studies that the s form of kedemne is more potent that is it can more robustly bind to the enemdy a receptor and in addition to that the s form of edemine tends to produce less dissociation at a given dosage then does the combined s r form of kedemine or pure r kedemine he also added and sent me a study that ill link in the shown captions that there was recently clinical trial of r kedemines of pure arkedemine alone and it failed to relieve depressive symptoms i said great thank you much this is now all made very clear to me that s kedemine is the preferred form it produces less association and provides better depression relief and then he said no actually it is a little more complicated than that it appears the situation is the following the combined s r form of kedemine seems to be the most potent for relieving depressive symptoms the s form of kedemine is second best in terms of providing relief from depressive symptoms and is the one that is most commonly prescribed nowadays by nasal spray by oral dosing by sublinguall dosing and it is what is typically given by way of injection in clinical studies where they do injections and it appears that the ar form of kedemine is the least potent and effective intreating deprestion now i realize that by putting this out into the larger world and assuming that there are experts in kedemine out there either by way of use or by clinical study of their own that i will get a lot of comments back sayin no actually the r form was more effective for me than the s form verses the s ar form et cetera just to reiterate from the clinical trials that have been done we know that the combined us are form is more potent and effective than the pure s form which is still more effective than the pure are form that is what we know now based on the clinical studies but of course i acknowledge that any time a drug is out there as a clinical tool and its being used recreationally that people are going to explore and they are going to experiment and they are going to find what works best for them i certainly invite feed back about what has work best for you hopefully in the clinical contect whether not people have used kedemine prescription from their doctor whether not they persist cipated in a clinical study or whether not ther doing it recreationally i imagine that i will hear about those experiences and i will take note of them another commonly ask question i received was what about microdosing of kedemine and there is a lot of interest in microdosing nowadays people are microdosing syliciben people are microdosing all sorts of things hoping to get some of the same effects as the macrodoses but by using dosages of compounds that are below what would induce say in the case fof syllsive an hallucinations or in the case of kedemine below what would induce the kind of dissociation and uphoric effects that one would have to lie down for a few hours and disengage for the rest of the day i consulted with my clinition colleagues about this and they told me that at present meaning as of yesterday there is zero publish clinical evidence that they are aware of and by way of extension that i am aware of in which microdosing kedemine has been effective for the treatment f depression all of the positive effects on depression that i've talked about during this episode our gleaned from studies where people used this half melegram prokilegram dosage of kedemine or its equivalent by way of some other route of administration not injected but orl or sublinguell are there any benefits to microdose in kedemine as far as the scientific and clinical literature that is published as of today is concern the answer is now o kaso today we covered a lot of information we talk about what kedmine is remember kedemine and p c p angel dust very similar compounds both blocke the and emptya receptor we also talked about what sorts of subjective effects that produces dissociation and mild euphoria and third personing ofself that is the dessociation when taken at lodosages and when taken at hyrodosages it can induce full blown anasesia and put people into subconscious states and there is atually potential even for seizure and death if the dosage is high enough for that person again i want emphasize that people's dosid sensitivity varies tremendously rout of delivery will impact that and on and on we also talked about how the enemdya receptor itself and the activation of this incredible molecule bedian af braindrive neutrophic factor seem to be important for at least some of the anti depressang effects of kedemine both in the days and weeks following kedeming administration and in addition to that i described how kedemine impacts the opioid receptor system and how we simply cannot overlook the involvement of the opioid receptor system in producing the anti depressand effects of kedemine and we also talked about the brain circuits and the brain waves associate with dessociate of states and the depression relief that seems to arrive for many people who take kedemie and i tried to highlight some te unique features of kedemine first of all that it does seem to provide depression relief where other approaches have not but that the depression relief tends to be pretty short lived unless its applied in this multi times per week over multiple weeks kind of fashion to produce what i call durab l changes which almost certainly ivolve changes in nurl plasticity that is rewiring of brain circuits and another keypoint that i highlighted is that we always have to remember that when thinking about how chemicals kedemine or any other substance for that matter can modify brain circuits in order to change them and provide relief from depression or some other psychiatric challenge that always always always there is a requirement for engaging in anti depressive behaviors as a way to further reinforce whatever possive changes have come about through the drug treatment as a friend in colleague of mine whose expert in this area once aptly said better living through chemistry still requires better living thank you for

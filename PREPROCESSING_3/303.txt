not think many people come here and they feel they hafe to do certain things because somebody told and do what ir they bento go home and people o say what do you mean you did not see the pantheon what d you mean you did not going to the love in guessing t a good number of these people are tostanding here because somebody told them that they should do it wer con weu do not think that they are all museum gowerds at home i do not know do people o look back and remember the experience of standing in front of a painting wene might remember eating something or buying something or seeing something an accident or somebody whois really twisted up in some way but not looking at a painting de beam wrong we may be this disqualifi that for them that doesen't gettan i better than this but i do not know i just from people that i know that have come here they go to live because somebody told them tat they a dito day in a readia programm where you might go in paris instead of the wove i spent three days wit david cederis who writs a lot about what it is to live in france we never saw the ifl power or there damn musum the famous cemetery were marsell pruse and gemarsonar buried no historical sihtes nothing having to do with the culture or language of the people of france but if you one ta know the best place to by a model of a rotten two or collection of weeches or life size replicat a human head with the top cut off shr ac she was inside dhavid did shure me that this is a pretty good medical supply story wik thes body parts tat they have here theyr hand made and hand

think it probably cosst about sixty dollars which or si is a great prie for back but fot dayin our programm americans in paris and how our paris sometimes has very little to do with the one familiar to the locals tho you be easy chicago thits this american life amari glass the french government says that three and a half million americans visited paris last year the u s government says it was more two and a half million either way it is a lot more than the actual population of paris which is two point one million americans have dreamy and romantic ideas about paris more than other places i think in nineteen forty four at the liberation of paris from the nozes e b white road probably one of the dullest stretches of pros in any man's library is the articale in paris in the encyclopedia bretanaca yet when we heard the news of liberation being unable to think of anything else to do we sat down and read it straight through for beginning to end paris we began capital of france and of the department of sa n situated on the ille delaci ta the ill saint louis and the il loveier in the san as well as on both banks of the san the words seemed the beginning of a great poem a feeling of simple all overtook us as we slowly turned the page and settled down to a study of the city's weather grap and the view of the san looking east from netradom the rainfall is rather even le distributed continued the encyclopetis hevenly distributed we thought to ourselves the tears of those who loved paris but what is it actually in paris really without the rost coloured glasses if you are american well are this american live team headed over seas to find out and let us is posst rememment what exactly does that sound you wonder well hereis recorder we ate a toor a a an a te wea tis people w runa

towre of his favorite places in the city that he calls home at two sav american in which we try to answer the question what is it that some american see in paris anyway what is the draw a three noites of a native daughter why it helped sometimes to pretend your french accent is worse than it really is and why it is harder to cut into a movyg line in paris than in new york and whether it is the same for african american these days in paris as it was it the hayday of james badwin in cidney bechat answers stay with us atuon him talk pretty three days two years ago at the age of forty one barely speaking french tavid sataris moved paris he had no special feelings about france no particular interest in the french he would be the same if it is corea he said to me a sentence that i think if the french ever heard that he said it they would deport him he moved for two reasons one his boy frend huge had a run down house in normandy at two why not and over the course of two years he has written extensively about his experience hi stories for the radio for magazines for his newest book in is stories david petrays life in paris as a series of humiliations and near humiliations and if you h had with him for a few days you realize he is not exaggerating much this is my worst night mar are here he barely gone three bocx from his apartment on our walking toward of paris when he stopped on the sidewalk gi my liter has thrown out of fluard fluit which would mean that i would have to ask somebody if a for a match and to what i would say is hullo you have some flir but ia ni hate saying that that i usually carried four lighters on me i always have a back op doong intro be e e gra an no one mist o the lier and here i will not pend the asternoo asineor te a fire o or us curious but davids thoughts about paris precisely because he was never somebody who had any special feelings for the place he did not move here with his head full of earnest hemmingway bertrude stin and sarrture at pruse he was a blank slate and for several hours every day was in paris david would walk me to the places he finds most interesting and the first thing i learned was this it is tramatic to learn a new language that a lot of david's experience of cily a lot if his personal geography of paris has to do simply with wear people are cruel to him when he speaks and were they are not this is a hard wor store where the owner and the people who work there are really really nice to me i by things here all the time ni by things that i do not even need just because there is kind and may generally jo start laughing right when i walk in the door then the owner will call his assistante oute of the back room and say he is back he is back and i by things i bought a heating element for i can make tea in my hotel room cause i had to get to germany i can go en and say hello i am looking for a sdi that make the water hot hot to day i say ou really stopid things when i go in there but i i only say it

anwe go into ae chocolate chop in a book store in a capa and each place we go f thi's a little conversation just normol small tak and goes ou ca he is really delighted and can recide it off fror me afterwards fine by line when he first moved here when his french clast was not going well he was constantly being scolded by people for not understanding the simplest things direction prices but the proper change people here are crazy about exact change swares to me he realise it some point tat he could make it all feel better if he transformed himself from the innept foreigner to the innept foreigner with a charge card people would be really nice to you if yeu spend a lot of oney then i just started going out in byind things and have a bad da in school ind go out after school and by a dest or i crisy lamp because people were onfailingly nice while i was writing out that check i would say the most screwed up thing and thit would say you speak well nd t would compliment me and i would feel good and then i would leave an i would think wait a minute i took a while to get that under control si felt you ik just observing your dad as an outsider i thouht you woulde put yourself into this position were the smallest human acts of kindness i've turned out to mein much they have words before there were things that i did really think about does not take much to make me happy now where is before i feel at took quite a bit i sert maser more over feeling of adventure or more feeling of humiliation it is more a feeling i humiliation it would be a feeling of adventure if i were a different tiped person if i were a more adventurous person but for me to get on a train and go to switzerland i do not think oh good i get to have an adventure i think oh great i get to mak and ass out of myself in two different languages that to what i wind up doing in germany they always include breakfast with your hotel in i'm not a breakfast peater but i want a cup of coffee or something n we stayed at this i i stayed at the hotel in germany i dt remembr town the last time i was there and i go down stairs to have my breakfast the news six people seeted at table and usually they have got lots of table but here there is only one table and i'm thinking onderringly wont to sit with six people but if i turn around leave then hey'll think i that i'm being rood i i've got in this far i have to sit down an the table with these six people i pull out of chair and the man said something to me in german and i say oh no just coffee for me i'm find with that when he was trying to tell me was hat i was in his kitchen this was the kitchen of the owner and this was the owner of the hotel in his and his family sitting down to breakfast i just saw this door and i opened it and i was in their quarters and then he had to go and wake oup his nine year old and his nine year old come an explained to me in english that in fact the dining room was downstairs i do not see to that and i did not see it is an adventure it just happen they 've been moved here at a particular moment in slide havter years of making us livin quaning apartments carrying furniture he finally published books made the best sellerlas was on the radio one on tours unfilled two thousand and five thousand seet halls with people who wanted to hear an read and i think most people are built to take only much of that to have people think that were somebody i think for most people for people who were not hopeless egarmaniac s there is a normal balancing that has to happen i've believing that there is somebody to believing that there are nobody there is a watio a balance that has to happen in most people's heads i've know nivit for ten years and i think that what happened to him is that the somebody side of that acquation got crazily inplited fantastically inflated and the nobody side had hyperant flat to catch up they had to balance out iave b a nation of book buying a dults was going t tell him how great he was back home he needed an entire second nation of adults reminding him that really how important was it then that is ex ack to the case when i do go bak it is not going from i do not know having an audience to being anon amente ince beneath i in its beds beneath the plan tof the egge it is going from having an audience to being to being a foreigner which is the lowest life or is to be a foreigner when you were ai we going humiliated about yet made i always had did ont open my mouth because i les and i sounded a girl 's om its noaes te feeling that i'm you still the really the feeling that i yet here is more comfortable to me one day tavid takes me to a cafe that he goes to all the time often alone and i'm surprised when he tells me that he issomebody who until recently had trouble going to a restaurant our cafe by himself just to get a cup coffee because i'm always afraid that there not can to see me there an tin them just be stockd there and other people will say look there in an kno one's waited on that nind he is been ne fr ands an hour and he is not no one to doy with himself i can carribly self conscious in he situations me you i'm not scured tat from sitting in the restaurant alon that that they want see me tut i soon that that ell see me nd that the way on me ou on mean to business in they me the money and to though you sually wit on you not but i'm always convince that they do not see me and tat they are nokin aways on me and did you seem to happen to me many times in my life that i would going to a place and then youe to be ten your leaving of your own velation you been waiting for somebody and in that you look at your watchin i do not by gess or not can a shell an not can asiderg ound here and wait any longer and you make this home it is little play tha you do ut really nobodyis waching it but it isvery labrad and then you can get out get up and leave things li goild you are scriking is that youre sitting there and you think that othei people are watching in such a way that they will think of that gui haus n' gon waiter or it is tht's what i di i look at deshal that and i notice when it happens to other beople ans because i look that things that that i imagin that everybody else in itstren' ot to be quite a burden to carry into a foreign country it is somebody does somethinkg tupid in front of him david says het goes hon rites it down tells his friends sometimes turns it into a s tory that he reads in front of thousands or tens of thousands of strangers and when he says somethings tupid in french which he does daily he believes that it is possible the shop keepers or waiters to strugg it off never think about it again but it seems just as possible that they go tell their friends and laugh at him that is why i get embarrassed ot the way that i speak is because i go home and i write every thing down that is he wy i am i as some that verybody else on that way it is well yhou ougk to the places tha david by expest in paris and i's copping from one discreet island that david had already explore afound to be safe for human habitation to the next discret island ththings is the way that anybody gets to know any new sity especially a city we do not speak the language you try one place and they tries second place and you return to those places over and over slolly expanding your territory to gradually include more little spots it you return to the paces david takes me to usually hav one of these characterestates ther were fantastically unusual and interesting things to buy they were places of a type which sip

dares to ask the question w no after you madam if i can lay my cards on the table at this point in the programm i have never understood why anybody cares much about france i mean it is fine it is lovely but there is just this thing that some americans have for paris though is they are the first to admit it can be kind of ridiculous well when people ask me where i live i sometimes say paris and they say will i mean you live in paris a me but but that is my dream christan hoanatdo has lived in paris for five years ou know why do you live in paris and i sawolleno i i just sort of wanted to all the reasons that you give sound really embarrissingly say i ridiculous tat this pont im in paris as a stale dream and a and it is kind of folyune love with he most obviously cute boy in the class or the star of this are a movy starts being a grouping and and then you try to convince the other sot of twenty five women who hes lept with the last week wong i really love them i think he loves maintel no e somethi tit to come here and they sort of get off on that feeling of beim they think they are unusual because they put themselves in this position to me thats that is really countaffunin paris ithe very special yet they think it makes them special to live here as if it ay as if it is original and be an part of the horrifying thing about moving here now it is it is a shut a sort of disappinting experience to realize that your your dream is banal i mean this is a dream i had my whole life and it seems ridiculous to me now that it meant much to me with importantthe thing about loving a city christin says is it a city does not realy love you back whenever i asked americans who love france what it was about france that just got to them much when did o begin for them er feeling about france they all talked about scraps of french culture that madeit to them when they were very young the madelane books the red bagloon french films montesory french class in grade school i think there is still a part of america were the idea of paris paris not the space programme by the intrinette or moving to new york city paris represents reaching a world outside oneself which ou clime for start to coming here as a tea nagor from a small town of pennsylvania an is essentially cons tructed an entire life round the feeling that he got paris he went on to become a scholar and director of the roman'e studies department orno university father of several books eet fat it cigaretts ar sublime which are deeply suffused with a sensibility that is partly just on american or anyway seme paresia e sensibility that is all about the small pleasures of everyday life no i'm the french have a much moream much moon complicated and much what guilty willishenship to their body beginning wit of eating on not only the way they the cana pleasure that they take an eating i mean the american notion tha food is medicsion from sele is totally repulsive to to the french and yet ncreasiangly i man in merica i mean saw you here iman people et onlys the function of what they think is good for them and i mean nobody in friencs what he strictly as the function of what sqidfunte i i think really the hart of it was from me when i came here and sen gere for the first time was lay i they always the sent frol market parce right in the part or caris o no parkiner we are andd i e wer

arrived here josephin baker common scene an conquered blackdy eyes had come and conquered jas at simply conquered i wrote in a letter here're such an absence of or his hatred it seems a little on rear i wanted the talk to janet because it wanted to find out if it was still that way from paris dinsi possible realy and they have sentury since those days as been in influx of black africans to france and they are not below national front party with the spogan france is for the french whenc's fifteen per cent of the vot national elections could it be possible that african americans still get a warm reception here jonat said yes i'm not sure what it is all i knows that it feels very different to be around french white people then american white people just now i feel much more comfortable i feel that i'm not a black object richard rad after arriving here in the midnigheteen forthe staid that he felt that all f his life head been carrying a corpse with them and when he came to paris he felt it slip off his back did you have di you ot the contofeeling yet i really have to say that i have felt that way ever since i got here and 's a lot of my friends saying o why you living there in fact a frend of miniment to loschoo it he said what is it about speaking french that makes white people not races he who isn' very sceptical but it really it goes beyond that it is it is not just that we feel free of the burden of race because we are still black i still experience myself as blacket's just it that is not the centre of my identity it is not the first thing people relate to when i meet them here jana first came to paris an nineteen seventy five and moved here in ninety five she is a lawyer in the french office of the bing american company she grow up in the public house in projects in brooklin worked away into vassra college and onder graduate school mosscel in look golot a people who make the jump from very poor crimbred neighbourhood into the college educated uppermiddle class she felt she did notreally fitted anywhere not with family ind friends in the crojects wh were shooting heroine barely surviving not with the black sdudent she met in college i thought they were bourgeois southern bells i did not want to be any thing them an they an' wone to be meither they thought i was trassh i was project trassh i thought they were they put the be in bugy and i grappled a lot with that the racial identity what would my posture be on from the projects but you people say i talk a white girl and hen the white girls are i your project and then when i got here no thit matter because if i spoke three words o french that made sense people me an tey celebrated me i did not have to worry about talking a wike girl or project girl or anything ot was an incredible relief the central conflict of her life suddenly vanished in paris all the distinctions about what kind of whike persen she should be they were all moot if i the most distinguishing fact about hand it was not that she was black it was tha she was an america which surprised her i associated the word american wis white geyes with flags on their lawns who did not particularly me and people would call me american ni'd sound not american a'm black and these were black french people i you are american and they i remember these french west indian friends of mind this one in particlar from martinique was saying you even walk an america a lik what do you mean what does an american walk and she said they kick their legs when they walk that kick their legs forward i do not know i tell my frends cause o i was in brook then just im a few weeks ago an this woman who never been to europe was saying what is it and in france are they wan other people ow they prejudice i said no they us it is incredible a country full of white people and they us but it is still it is a difficult thing because they us but they do not other people who look us and that sort of the french paradot paris of course has its own housing projects in the suburbs surround the city now with generations of africans who were born on french soil if fay drobed discrimination housing discrimination and they are not well receive they are not welcome than they are french and in a way for african americans were in a very bazaare position it is almost being an honorary white an apartie south africa and i notice that you now as my french got better and better that sometimes i was not as well received as i would be if i played up my american accent when french people if i walking to a shop and people would think i was just noft baseto tho i say just another all just one of their own from martinique or guadlo it would not be the same reception if i came on with a very heavy american acts n or even spoke english i i would the yo you ti i ti hat you ere an african wile a little bit of a chill in the air mike a know yes when i help you not much oh was tat ti merely gin oh i love ob i love to speak english it is it is very vizaar it is a it is a hard thing to reconcile because i mean good feeling is good feeling and when some one receives you and makes you feel good you it is a positive experience when when you are in a shop and i yil te ti chillin the ar and they think of you as an african will you actually pay up your american acca well what happened was i started o experiencing that and i actually adjusted my my speech that at least i would get the benefit oh b i mean i'm here in this gountry i want to get the benefit of being an african american instead of walking and a we madame ogment teles i she saw i'd say we a sivouplaescovoupuve me de o maybe mabe i cerdn do that at at works yenit wcs a friend of janats is suggested to her than may be parisians preferred black people from america cas only a certain class of black americans usually comes to france educated cultured interested in france when jana asked the riter cornell west about this that a speec she gave this summer in paris that was his argument basiclly suggessat was a class thing and he said well look at you your professionally rarticulate im made if she brought fifteen of your cousin i ped a different thing vasically you was saying if i brought all my home girls from the hood who did not go to vasor an where at lawyers and who did not speak french olresepsion might be a little cillier even though they also are black american but i think if that is true that is not about raceis n and that is about class before i met jonet i read the book that she ware by what it was for her growing ot it iscalled project girl and was remarkable about it is how franc she is about all the compulsive things that she found herself doing during the years when she was regularly traveling betowin the projects and word of te aspiring up her mittal class ire's a struggle at er first youre advasser for instance she felt out of place that she started taking the train down to new york city to score heroine think she never even done when she lived in the projects just got ticked tout a school for that theres as if the further that she travelled into the world of college the more the project side of her personality was compelled to express itself somehow shed picts herself a somebody was depressed and in battle and toloss for years and the most striking thing about meeting her if you read the book is how comletely happy she seems to day she is one of the happies seeming people i ever met just relaxed and funny and at ease and her feeling about france the country with this trans formation took place it can be ta shocking to actual french people whenn be just one the yeuro two thousand ou was i came to work and i was telling the marack and secretary we won nou's een gane and she you just glars at me because she was not born here and she says i'm not french in marac and its just black americans i'm not american in black and i was we on we on and she is what do you talking about you not even franch but you mean we one i i'm french in my heart and this black friend of mine was saying now youar the only person i know who could sing the moulsay es that sons i co ixr you are why it is becaus i say to them i never had a country i never had a country i had o good i had broken but i never felt i had a country now i have a country it is a little one we always come in third or fourth place in the elentics but it is france chere is something else there is certain things about french culture gon says but just make life hear very plesant fone think people do not ask you personal questions wor ye grew up we work which her family which yheur story you were not constantly explaining yerself she says she has one friend which she knew for five years before she knew this woman had a grown son also there is not the same striving the same ambition to be number one is in the states especially compared with the corporate lawjob she used to have everybody was expected to put in sixty and seventy and eighty hours a week here that would be seen this very strange work just is not t an important to most people ik i'll get tears in my eyes just sometimes i look around the subway and i look at onlys french aplan thank you for letting me live here in your contry we had outside but you' i get your country bbit your ageinity here isin that a french pirsin tide of an outside i kn and i think that is what it is to be project girl i was always an outsider and i feel most inside right now where i most outside go figure you that is what freedom mit to it is not about nothing left to lose it is about nothing left to be you will have to be anything i was i was just thinkin about it this morning it' side i'm an outsider i will always be a fargner no matter how good my french gets i will never really be french no matter how much of a wana be i am and yet i feel that i'm home i'm just home around the corner from the caffet floor thas were the author james baldwin wook for a while jennat says she feels

welcome to the hubermen thascience science pace toce i mand your hubermen and i'm a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to talk all about hearing and balance and how you can use your ability to hear specific things and your balance system in order to learn anything faster the auditory system meaning the hearing system and your balance system which is called the vestibular system interact with all the other systems of the brain and body and used properly can allow you to learn information more quickly remember that information longer and with more ease and you can also improve the way you can hear you can improve your balance we are going to talk about tools for all of that this is one area of science where we understand a lot o bout the sells and the mechanisms and the ear and in the brain and forth were gong to talk about that a little bit and mem were going to get directly into protocals meaning tools we are also going to talk about ways in which the auditory and balance systems suffer we are gon to talk about tenetus which is this ringing of the years that unfortunately for people that suffer from it they really suffer it is very intrusive for them we are ging to talk about some treatments that can work in some circumstances and some of the more recent emerging treatments that i think many people are not aware of we are lso going to talk about this what seems kind of a weird fact which is that seventy per cent of people all people make what are called autocoostic emissions their ears actually make noises chances are you your ears are making noises right now but you cannot perceive them and yet those can have an influence on other people and animals in your environment the fascinating aspect your biology youre going to learn a lot about how your biology and brain and ears and the called inner ear that is associate with balance you learn lot about how all those work you' learn a lot of nor science i'll even tell you what type of music to listen to and if you listen to me you can leverage that in order to learn faster before we begin talking about the science of hearing and balance and tools that leverage hering and balance for learning faster i want to provide some information about another way to learn much faster i's a paper that was publish recently this is a paper tht was published in sell reports and excellent journal it is a pure reviewed paper from a really excellent group looking at skill learning a previously i've talked about how in the attempt to learn skills the vital thing to do is to get lots of repetitions you have heard of the ten thousand hours thing you have heard of ah you a lots of different strategies for learning fast or eighty twenty rule and all that the bottom line is you need to generate many many repetitions of something that you are trying to learn and the errors that you generate are also very important for learning it also turns out that taking rest within the learning episode is very important i want to be really clear what i'm referring to here in earlier episodes i've discussed how when you are tring to learn something it is beneficial it is been shown in scientific studies that if you take a twenty minute shallow nap or you simply do nothing after a period of learning that it enhances the rates of learning and the depth of learning your ability to learn and remember that information what iam about to describe are new data that say that you actually should be should be injecting rest within the learning episode i'm not talking about going to sleep while learning this is the way that the study was done the study involved having people learn sequences of numbers or keys on a piano lit is use the keys on a piano example i'm not a musition but i think i'll get this correct they asked people to practice a sequence of keys g d f e g g g f e g g g f g and they would practice that either continually for a given amount of time or they would just do that for ten seconds they would play g g f g g g f g g g f g g g f g for ten seconds and then they would take a ten second paws arest thet would just space take a space or a period of time e they do nothing for ten seconds then they would go back to g g f e g g g f g the two conditions the sentially were it av people practice continually lots of repetitions or to in gect or insert these periods of of ten seconds idle time where theyre not doing anything they are not looking at their phone they are not focusing on anything theye just laking theire mind drift wherever it wants to go and they are not touching the keys on the keyboard what they found was that the rates of learning the skill acquisition and the retention of the skill wat significantly faster when they injected these short periods of rest these ten second restperates and the mthe rates of learning were when i say significantly faster were much much faster il reveal what that was in just a moment but you might ask why would this work why would it be that injecting these ten second rest periods would enhance wrates of learning what they call them was micro off ling gains because there is have takeng teir brain off line from the learning task for a moment will turns out the brain is not going off line at all you probably heard of the hippocampus the area of the brain valt in memory and then yo cortex the area of the brain that is involved in processing sensury information well it turns out that during these brief periods of rest these ten second rest periods the hippocampus and the cortex are active in ways such that you get a twenty times repeat of the g d f g it is a temporal compression as they say basically the rehearsal continues while you rest but at twenty times the speed if you were normally getting just let us to say five repetitions of g d f g g d f g g d f g per ten seconds now you multiply that times twenty in the ress periods you have practised it a hundred times your brain has practise it we know this because they were doing brain imaging functional imaging of these people with brainscanners while they were doing this this is an absolutely staggering effect and it is one that believe it or not has been hypothesized wor thought to exist for a very long time this effect is called the spacing effect and it was actually first proposed by ebington in eighteen eighty five and since then it is been demonstrated for a huge number of different what they call domains in the cognive domain for learning languages for in the physical domains for learning skills that involve a motor sequence it is been demonstrate for a huge number of different categories of learning if you want to learn all about the spacing effect and the categories of learning that it can impact thre's a wonderful review article i'll provide a link to it the title of the reviewarticle is parallels between spacing effects during behavior and seller learning what that reviou really does is it ties the behavior learning in the improvement of skill to the underlying changes in nurons that can explain that learning i should mention that the paper that i'm refering to the more recent paper that in gects these ten second little micro off line gains a rest periods is the work of the laboratory of leonard coen not the musician leatern coen he passed away he was not a nerw scientist a wonderful poet musicion but not a nerrow scientist again the paper was publishd in sell reports and we will provide a link to the full paper as well the take away is if you are trying to learn something you need to get those reps in but one way that you can get twenty times the number of repts in is by injecting these little ten second periods of doing nothing again during those ress periods you really do not want to attend to anything else as much as possible you could close your eyes if you want or you can just simply waiht and then get right back into generating repetitions i find these papers that a reports and other jounals have been publishing recently to be fascinating because theyre really helping us understand what are the best protocals for learning anything and they really a leverage the fact that the brain is willing to generate repetitions for us provide provided that we give it the rest that it need inject rest throughout the learning period and if you can based on the scientific data you would also want to take a twentyment an nap or a twenty minute d compress period were you not doing anything after a period of learning i think those could both sinnergize in order to enhance learning yeven further although that has not been looked at yet before we begin talking about hering in balance i just want to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching an research rolls it stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i want to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast and make it clear that we only work with sponsors whose products we absolutely love and that we think you will benefit from as well our first sponsor is athletic greens at letic greens is an al in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the

deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens it get the vitemens

times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium an potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly nd all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that youre getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you to try element you can go to

cm slash hubermen can you hear me can you hear me o ca well if you can hear me that is amazing because what it means is that my voice is causing little tiny changes in the air waves wherever you happen to be and that your ears and whatever is contained in those ears and in your brain can take those sound waves and make sense of them and that is an absolutely fantastic and staggering feet of biology and yet we understand a lot about how that process works some one to teach it to you now in simple terms over the next few minutes what we call ears have a technical name that technan the technical name is oracles but more often theyre called pinna the pinnas p i n n a pinna and the pinnas of your ears this outer part that is made of cardilage and stuff is a range such that it can capture sound in the best way for your head size were in a talk about ear size also cause it turns out that your ears change size across the life span and that how big your ears are or rather how fast your ears are changing size is a pretty good indication of how fast your ageng get to that in a few minutes but i want o talk about these things that we call ears and some of the stuff contained within them that allow us to hear the shape of these ears that we have is such that it amplifize high frequency sounds high frequency sounds as the name suggests of the is the squeakier stuff right low frequency sound costil of snorying the background that is a low frequency sound or high frequency sound oce we have low frequency sounds and high frequency sounds and everything in between now those sound waves get captured by our ears and those sound waves for those of you that do not may be fully conceptioalize sound waves are literally just fluctuations or shifts in the way that air is moving toward your ear and through space in the same way that water can have waves set the air can have waves o it is reverberation of air those come in through yor ears and you have what is called your ear drum and on the inside of your ear drum there is a little bony thing that shaped a little hammer attached to that ear drum which can move back and forth a drum silitle membrain you get this hammer attached to it and that hammer as three parts for those of you that want to know those three parts are called malleas incus and stapies slike it but fasy yon just think about it as a hammers you gethers ear drum and then a hammer and then that hammer has to hammer on something and what it does is it hammers on a little coiled piece of tissue that we call the coclea sometimes called the coclea depending on where somebody lives in the country sotifically in the midwest on these causes they call hem cocla and on the west coast we cal them coclea same thing this snail shape structure in your inner ear is where sound gets converted into electrical signals that the brain can understand but i wanted just bring your attention to that little hammer because that little hammer is really really cool what it means is that sound waves come inthrough yars that is was happening right now that ear drum that you have is a it is the top of a drum it is membrain or it can move back and forth it is not superrigid nd it moves that little hammer and then the hammer goes uuuutu and hits this coil shaped thing that were calling the cocla now the coclea at one end is more rigid than the other one part can move really easily and the other part does not move very easily and that turns out to be very important for decoding or separating sounds that are low frequency costellofs snoring and sounds that are of high frequency a shriek or a shrill and that is because within that little coiled thing we call the coclea you ave all these tiny litt what are call hair cells now they look hairs but they are not at all related to the hairs on your head or elsewhere on your body thar your shaped hairs we call them hair cells those hair cells if they move send signals into the brain that a particular sound is in our environment and if those hair cells do not move it means that particular sound is not in our environment o just to give you the mental picture of this sound waves are coming in because there is stuff out there making noises my voice it is changing the patterns of air around you in very very subtle ways that information is getting funneled into your ears because your pinnas are shaped in a particular way the ear drum than moves this little hammer and the hammer bangs on this little snail shaped thing and because that snail shaped thing at one end is very rigid it does not want to move and at the other end it is very flexible it can separate out high frequency and low frequency sounds and the fact that this thing in your innour ear that we call the coclea is coiled is actually really important t understand because a long its length it varies and how rigid or flexible it is oury mention that before and at the base it is very rigid and that is where the hair cells if they move will make high frequency sounds and at the top what is called the apex it is very flexible and it is more a base strul basically what happens is sound waves come in your ears and then at one end of this thing that we call the coclea at the top it is essentially in coding or only responding to sound to boun bon boun boun whereas at the bottom irresponds to high frequency sounds symboloquet and everywhere in between we have other frequencies medium frequencies now this should stagger your mind if it does not already it should because what this means is that everything that is happening around us whether not its music or voices or crying or screaming or screaming of the light from small children who are excited cause thei'r playing or cause they get cake all of that is being broken down into its component parts and then your brain is making sense of what it means these things that iave been talking about the pin of your ears in this little hammer in the coclia that is all purely mechanical it has no mind of its own its just breaking things down into high frequenciese medium frequencies and low frequncies and f you do not understand sound frequency its really simple to understand just imagine ripples on a pond and if those ripples are very close together that is high frequency they corret high frequency if those ripples are further apart slow frequency an obvousy medium frequency is in between just you can have waves and water you can have waves in air that is that is really how it works now we are all we are all familiar with light and how if you take a prism and put it in front of light it will split that light into its different wave lanths its different colors red green blue et cetera right sor the pink floid dark side of the moon albom i think has a prism in its a converting white light into all the colors all the wave lanes that are contained in white light your coclia essentially acts as a prism it takes all the sound in your environment and it splits up those sounds into different frequencies you can think of the coclia of your ear sort of a prism and then the brain takes that information and puts it back together and make sense of it those hair cells in each of your to coclia cause you have two ears you also have too coclia send little wires what we call axons that convey there patterns of activity into the brain and there are a number of different stations within the brain that information arrives at before it gets up to the parts of your brain where you are consciously aware and because some of you v asked for more names and noming clay sh i'll give that to you if you do not want a lot of detailed names you can just ignore when i am about to say but basely the coclia send information to what is called the spiral ganglion the spiral gang a ganglian by the way if you are going to learn any nurolscigns just know that any time you hear ganglion a ganglion is just a clump it means a bunchon nurons a clump of cells the spiral ganglion is a bunchon nurons that the information then goes off to what are called the coclier nucly eye in a brainstem brainstem is coming down near your neck then up to a structure that as really cool name called the superior olive because it ah you have one on each side your brain amen five were to bring you to my lab and show you the superior olives in your brain or any one else is brain they look little olives theeven have a divid in them that to me looks a pemiento but they just calld them the supthe superior olive and then the nurons in the superiolive then they send information up to what is called the inferior colliculous only called inferior because it sits below the structure call the superior colliculous and then the information goes up to what is called the medial gerniculate nucleos and then up to your neo quartecs where you make sense of it all now you do not after remember all that but you should know that there are a lot of stations in which auditory information is process before it gets up to our conscious detection and there is a good reason for that which is that more important than knowing what your hearing you need to know where it is coming from it is vital tar survival that if something for instance is falling toward us that we know if it is coming to our right side if it is going to hit us from behind we have to know for instance of a cars is coming at us from our left or from our right and our visual system can help with that but are auditory an our visual system collaborate to hlp us find and locate the position of things in space that should come as no surprise if you hear somebody talking off to your right you tend to turn to your right not to your left if you see somebody is mouth moving in front of you you tend to assume that the sound is going to come from right in front of you desruptions in this auditory hearing and visual matching are actually the basis of what is called the ventriliquism effect which will talk about in a few minutes in more depth but the vantriloquism effact can basically be described in simple terms as when you essentially think that a sound is coming from a location that it is not actually coming from el talk about that a moment but what i you to realize is that one of these stations deep in your brainstem is responsible for helping you identify where sounds are coming from through a process that is called interoral time differences and that sounds fancy but really the way where things are coming from what direction a car or a boss or a person is coming from is because the sound lands in one ear before the other and you have stations in your brain and meaning you have nurons in your brain that calculate the difference in time of arival for those sound waves in your right verses your left ear and if they arrive at the same time you assume that thing is making noise right in front of you if it is off to your right you assume it is over on your right and if the sound arives first to your left ear you assume quite correctly that the thing is coming toward your left ear it is a very simple and kind of mechanical system at the level ove sound localization but what about up and down f you think about it a sound coming from above is going to land on your right ear in your left ear at the same time a sound from below is going to land on your right ear and yur left ear t the same time the way that we know where things are in terms of what is called elevation where they are in the up and down plain is by the frequencies the shape of your ears actually modifies the sound depending on whether not its coming straight at you from the floor or from high above and already at the level of your ears you are taking information about the outside world and determining where that information is coming from now this all happens very very fast and subconscious but now why if people really want to hear something they make a cup around their ear they essentially make their ear into more of aphenic fox type ear if you have ever seen those cutlile penic fox things they af these big spiky ears thac count look lie a french bulldog although theyre kind of foxers are version of the french bulldog these bigs big tall ears and they have excellent sound localization and when people lean in with their ear with their hand this if youare listening to this om just cupping my hand at my ear i'm giving myself a bigger pinna oan if i do it on the left side i do this side and if i really want to hear something i do it on both sides because this is not just gesturing this actually serves a mechanical rule and actually if you want to hear where things are coming from with a much greater degree of accuracy this can actually help because you are capturing sound waves and fundling them better as really remarkable this whole system you have got these two ears and because of the differences in the timing of when things arrive in those two ears as well as these differences in the frequencies of that certain things sound or i should say the differences in the frequencies that arrive at your ears depending on whether or not the thing is above you were right in front of you or below you you are able to make out where things are in space pretty well now you are probably starting to realize that these two things on the side of our head that we call ears are there for a lot more than hanging ear rings on or for other asetic purposes or for putting sunglasses on top of there are very powerful devices for allowing us to capture sound waves from our environment now i have a question for you which is can you move your ears turns out that unlike other animals humans are not terrifically good at moving their ears other animals can move their ears even independently costelle is pretty good at raising his ears the two of them together he cannot really move his ears separately some dogs can do that really well in fact site hounds and some sent hounds do that exquisitely well some animals dear and other animals that really have a very acute hearing will put one ear down to a very particular angle and will tilt the other one and they will actually capture a information about two distant sound making organisms those could be hunters coming after them or other animals coming after them they are very good at doing this we are not good at it but about sixty percent of people it is thought can move their ears consciously with out having to touch their ear can you do that maybou should try it as some one to look at you and see whether not you can do it the typical a distances that people can move it is a usually no more than two or three milimeters it is subtle but can you flap your pina with a just using mental control if you can or if you cannot try looking all the way to your right or all the way to youre left if obviously if you are driving a car r doing something are exercising do not put yourself in danger ight now but if you move your eyes all the way to your left which i am doing now ar all the way to my right you might feel a little bit of a contraction of the muscles it is a that control ear movement i now one ask you this can you raise one eyebrow i'm not very good at i can do a little bit but it is mostly by cramping down my face on one side and i certainly cannot raise my right eyebrow i can only do my left eyebrow tryng atolklum doing this as well lookstrangh people who can raise one eyebrow very easily almost always can move their ears without having to touch them it is control by the same motor pathway and there does seem to be a small but statistically significant sex difference in the ability to move one's ears typically men can do this more than women can although plenty of women can move their ears as well now if you think that is all a little strange or off topic it is not because what were really talking about here is a system of the brain but also of the body of the musculature for localizing things in space and it you might find interesting to not that one of the things that we share very closely with other primates with non human primates machac monkeys in chimpan'sease if you look at their ears their ears are remarkably similar to our ears or rather our ears are remarkably similar to their ears the eyes of certain monkeyse machac monkeys are remarkably similar to human eyes s one of the reasons why if you look at a baby machac monkey it is or look it has this unbelievably human element to it but the ears of these primates is very similar to our to our ears our ears similar to their ears if youre interested in ear movements and what they could mean and some of the things that ear movements correlate with in other aspects of our biology there is a nice paper actually scientific paper of the author's lastname is code c o d e it was publishe in nineteen ninety five i'll guve a a reference that it is a review article the discusses some of the sex differences in ear movement control as well as the relasionship between ear movements and eye movements and it is of pretty accessible paper its one that i think any of you a who are interest in this topic could a could parts fairly easily and a there some very interesting underlying biology and some theories as to why humans would have this a called vastidual or ancient carryover of a system for moving our ears now if ear movement seems strange next i want to talk about a different feature of your hearing and ears that is even stranger but that has some really interesting implications for youare biology and i'm guessing that you not heard of this what am about to describe are called autoacustic omissions and autocusta commissions as the name suggests are sounds that your ears make believe it or not seventy percent of people make noises with their ears but they do not actually detect them i co said you have never heard of this c that is that is not what i mean but what i do mean is that seventy per cent of people's ears are making noise that is cast out of the ear and these autoacusta commissions acthing can be detected by microphones sometimes they can be detected by other people in the room if they have very good hearing now turns out that women wher i should be technical here females who report as themselves as heterosexual have a higher frequency not frequency of sound but a a higher frequency of autoacusta commissions then do men who report themselves as heterosexual women who report themselves as homosexual or bisexual make few ere atoacusta commissions than heterosexual women these are data that come from deniz to mac faton slab at the university of texas austin yet she discovered these what are called sexual diamorphisms and differnces based on sexual orientation without looking for them he was studying hearing is a auditory scientists and people were coming into his laboratory and they were detecting these autoacusta commissions and they started to notice the group differences in utocusta commission they start asking people about there sex and about their sexual orientation and these differences fell out of the data as we say and it is interesting becaus autoacusta cmmissions are not something tht we associate with sex r sexual dimorphism but what these dat ae really under score is first of all a lot of us armating noises with our ears some of us more than others and that exposure to certain combinations of hormones during development are very likely shaping the way that our hearing apparati meaning the coclia and the pinna and all sorts of things how those develop and how those function thoughout the life spen we did do an eprsode on hormones and sexual development which gets much deeper into the other effects that ormones have on the developing brain and body fyou want to check out that episode we will put a link to it in the captions now i want a shift to talking about wags to leverage your hearing system your auditory system that you can learn anything not just auditory information but anything faster i get a lot of questions about called by noral beats by noral beats as their name suggests involve playing one frequency of sound to one ear and a different frequency of sound to the other ear it might be dundundundun to your ight ear and it might be dinnnnnten to the left ear and the idea is that the brain will take those two frequencies of sound and because the path ways that bring information from the ears into the brain eventually cross over they actually share that information with both sides of the brain that the brain will average that information and come up with this sort of intermediate frequency and the rational is that those intermediate frequencies place the brain into a state that is better for learning and when i say better for learning i won to be prescise about what i mean that could mean more focus for in coding or or bringing the information in we as you may have heard me say before we have to be a lert and focust in order to learn there is no passive learning unless were little tiny infants can by noral beats make us more focus can by noral beats allow us to relax more if we are anxious i know some people they go to the dentist and the dentist offers by noral beats as they drill into your teeth and give root canals an thing that sort probably causing some anxiety just describing those those things right now but those are available and several dentists te many dental practices their by noral beats have been thought to increase creativity at least h have been proposed to increase creativity what is the scientific day to say about by noral beats there are number different aps out there of that offer by noral beats their number different programs you can i think you can also even just find these on on a youto been on theinner net but typicall ats an ap and you will program an of particular outcome that you want more focust more creative fall asleep less anxious et cetera what afe the scientific day to say believe it ore not the science on by noral beats is actually quite extensive and very precise sound waves are measur red typically in hurts or kill a hurts i know many of you are not familiar with thinking about things in hurts or kill a hurts but again just remember those waves on a pond those ripples on a pond if they are close together then they are of high frequency and if theire far apart than they are low frequency when you hear more hurts what youre essentially hearing is higher frequency i and of its many more killa hurts than its much higher frequency than of its fewer hurts or killer hurts and you may have hrt of these things as delta waves or fata waves or alpha waves or bata waves et cetera delta waves would be big slow waves o low frequency and indeed there is quality evidence from purereviewed studies that are not sponserd by companies that make binorl be aps that tell us that delta waves one to four hurts very low frequency sounds think costello snoring can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep and that fat rhythms which are more fortat hurts can bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep or meditation deeply relax but not fully asleep and then you can sort of ascend the staircase of findings here to speak and you will find evidence that alpha waves eight to thirteen hurts can increase alertness to a moderate level that is a great state for the brain to be in for recall of existing information i and that bata waves fifteen to twenty hurts are great for bringing the brain into focus states for sustained thought or for incorporating new information and especially gama waves the highest frequency the most frequent ripples of sound to speak thirty to to a hundred hurts for learning and problem solving now all of this matches or i should say maps on to what ihave said before about learning really nicely which is that you need to be in a highly alert state in order to bring new information in in order to access a state of mind in which you can tell your brain or the brain is telling itself ochai need to learn this this is why stress and unfortunate circumstances are memorable as because our brain gets into a really high alert system here we are talking about the use of by noral beats in order to increase are level of alertness or a or our level of calmness now that is important to under score because it is not that there is something fundamentally important about the by noral beats they are yet another wave of bringing the brain into states of deep relaxation through low frequency sound or highly alert states for focused learning with or high frequency sound they are effective and i'll review a little bit of the daton in detail theire effective but it is not that there uniquely special for learning it is just that they can help some people bring their brain into the state that allows them to learn better s o thereare lot of studies that allowed us to arrive i should say allowd the field to arrive on these brameters of slow slow low frequency waves or con a bring you into relax states high freguency waves into more alert states there is very good evidence for anxiety reduction from the use of by noral beats and what is interesting is the the anxiety reduction seems to be most effective whand the by noral beats are bringing the brain into delta those slow big waves sleep fata and alpha states and ill link to a couple of these studies although i will probably link on more to the list that really segregates them out one by one who you can see them all next to one another there is good evidence that by noral beats can be used to treat pain chronic pain there is three studies in pure review journals chi took a look at and they seem to be of good quality a not sponcered research as we say not not paid for by any specific company by noral beats have been shown to modestly improve cognition attention working memory and even creativity but the real boost from by noral beats appears to be for anxiety reduction and pain reduction some people mi find these beneficial for these oral surgeries i a believe it or not there are people who would rather have the entire route canal or cavity drilled without novicane and that is because they sometimes have a a stringephobia or something on that sort or they just on't being numb from the novicane or maybe there is an underline medical reason but think most people do do not enjoy getting their teeth drilled even if they have noviocane in their or a route canal and it seems that by noral beats can be effective in that environment and you do not have to go into that sort of extreme environment to benefit from by noral beats by noral beats are a either relatively a inexpensive thing to access mostlhy apts are pretty inexpensive i do not have a favorite by noral beats apt to recommend to you i confess i did use by norl bets a few years ago i and have shifted over to other what ar what i call o menesty ar non sleep deep breast protocals in favor those but many people by noral beats and un say that they benefit from them especially while studying or learning i think part of the reason for that relates to the bility to channel are focus when we have some background noise and this is something i also get asked about a lot is it better to listen to music and have background noise when studying or s a better to have complete silence well there is ashia quite good literature on this as well but not much as it relats to by noral beats but rather whether or not people are listening to music called white noise brown noise believe are not there is white noise and there is brown noisers even pink noise and how that impacts brain states that allow us to learn information better or not now i'd to talk about white noise and i want to be very clear that white noise has been shown to really enhance brain states for learning in certain individuals in particular in adults but white noise actually can have a detrimental effect on auditory learning and maybe even te development of the auditory system in very young children in particular in infants first i to talk about the beneficial effects of white noise on learning there 'r some really excellent studies on this the first one that i to just high light is one that is entitled low intensity white noise improves performance in auditory working memory task an ephemorize study this is ay a study that explored wheather not learning could be enhanced by playing white noise in the background but the strength of the study is that they looked at some of the underlying neral circuitry in the activation of the nural circuitry in these people as they did the learning task and what it essentially illustrates is that white noise provided that white noise is of low enough intensity meaning not super loud i not imperceptible togh not quiet that you cannot hear it but not super loud either it actually could enhance learning to a significant degree and this has been shown now for a huge number of different types of learning there is a terrific article as well as in somewhat obscure journal at least obscure to me which is the effects of noise exposure on cognive performance and brain activity patterns that is a study involving fifty four subjects they basically were valuated for mental work load and attention under different levels of noise exposure background noise and different e sentially loudness of noise and the reason i the study is that they looked at different levels of noise and types of noise and they they varied a number of different things i supposed to just doing a kind of two condition either white noise or no white noise type thing and what they found again is that provided the white noise is not extremely loud it could really enhance brain function forsake of learning any number of differen kinds of information now that is all great but it really does not get to the kind of deeper guts of the mechanism and as a norro scientists what i really want to see is not just that something has an effect not's always nice is always nice to see in a nice purereviewed study without any kind of commercial biasis that there is an effect ocay by nor beats can enhance learning or listening to white noise not too loud can enhance learning but you really on't understand mechanism because once you understand mechanism not only does it start to make sense but you can also imagine ways in which you could develop better tools in protocall i was very a relieve to find or i should say excited to find this study publishd in the journal of cognive neral science this is a twenty fourteen paper white noise improves learning by modulating activity in dopaminurgic midbrain regions end write superior temporal sulcus i do not expet o what the right spiritemporal sulcuses i do not expect what the dopami midbrain region is but if you are me you probably took high lighted notice of the word dopamin urgic dopamine is a nural modulator meaning it is a chemical that is released in our brain and body but mostly in our brain that modulates meaning controls the likelihood that certain brain areas will be active and other brainareas will not be active and dopamine is associated with motivation dopamiis associate with traving motivation is associate with all sorts of different things including movement but what this studys nicely shows is that white noise can really enhance the activity of nurons and what is called the substantial nigra vitie the substantian nigravitier is a very rich source of dopamine and that is because it is very chalk a block full of dopamie nurons it is an area of the brain that is perhaps the richest source of dopami nurons and you actually can see this brain region under the microscope if you take a slice of brain or you look at our brain without even staining it for any protines or dopamine or anything it is a two very dark regions at the cond of bottom of the brain and th the reason that is called substantial nigra nigrameaning dark is because the dopamin nurons actually make something and that makes those nurons dark and you got these two regions down there that contain dopaminand can release dopamine and and essentially activate other brain regions and activate our sense of motivation and activate our sense of desire to continue focusing and learning but you cannot just snap your fingers and make them released dopaminou actually have to trigger dopamine release from them now that trigger can be caused by being very excited about something or the fact that that thing gave you a lot of pleasure in the past or your highly motivated by fear or desire but what interesting to me is that it appears that white noise itself can rais that what we call the bazil the baseline levels of dopamine that are being released from this area the substantial nigra now we are starting to get a more full picture of how particular sounds in our environment can increase learning and that is in part i believe through the release of dopamn from substantial nigra i'm not tring to shift you away from by norbeats if that is your thing but it does appear that turning on white noise at a low level not too loud you may say will how loud andi'll tell youin a moment but not too loud can allow you to learn better because of the ways that it is modulating your brain chemistry how loud or how soft should that white noise be while you learn well in these studies it seem th at white noise that could be heard by the person it was not imperceptible to them it was loud enough that they could hear but not loud that they felt it was intrusive or irritating to them o c that is gan to differ from person a person because people have different levels of auditory sensitivities can depend on age can i depend on a number different factors i cannot tell you you turn to level too on your volume controller that since i can work also i do not knw how far you are from a given speaker in the room or if you got your phones in your head or you have got a speakeris in the room or if it is coming out o your computer i do not know those things what you'rn have to do is a just that white noise to place where it is not interfering with your ability to focus but rather it is enhancing your ability to focus i think a good rule of thumb is going to be to put it probably on the lower third of any kind of volume dial as opposed to in the upper upper third were it would really be blasting and really blasting any noise frankly is not good but that is espectially not good meaning it is especially bad if you have headphones in i do want to mention something about headphones before i talk about white noise in the developmental contact and why it can be dangerous there when you put headphones in your ears you has this incredible effect of making the sounds they come from inside your head not from out in the room and now that might seem kind of a du but that is actually really amazing you'r brain assumes that the sounds are coming from inside your head as opposed from the environment that you are in the moment you put headphones in sif you are listening to an audiobook or maye be listening this podcasts with headphones or that is very different than when you are listening to something out in the room and their other sounds other soundwaves specialy if yous these noise cancillation headphones if you are going to use white noise to enhant studying or learning of any kind or this also could be for skill learning motor skill learning why you are exercising my suggestion would be that if you are using headphones to keep it quite low why this is an effect on the mid brain dopomin nerons that is a background effect of raising the base line of dopaming release the way that dobeming or on's fires the're always firing yours are firing right now sor mine when something exciting happens they fire a lot and when something disappointing happens that firing the release of dopening goes down below base line what you are talking about here is raising your over all levels of attention and motivation which translate to better learning by just tickling those nurons a little bit raising the base line firing o kind this is not tut you are not turning up the white noise to the poin where you are feeling amazing this is not turning on your favorite song this is actually the opposite this is about getting that base line up just a bit o i recommend turning it a the volume up just a bit tha you can focus entirely on the task that you are trying to do and of course you have turnd on white noise to your attention might drift to that for moment is it too loud is it too soff if you can disappear into the work to speak if your attention can disappear into the work then that is probably sufficiently quiet and for those of you that say wi really loud music and if i just blast the music then i forget about the music i do not suggest blasting music and this is coming from somebody who really likes loud you do not loud music yaund i gro up with kind of a loudfast rules mentality and if you do not now a loudfast rules means am then i cannot help you but you it there is a time in a place perhaps to listen to music loud but especially with headphones you can trigger had you can trigger excuse me hearing loss quite rapidly and unfortunately because these hair sells that we talked about earlier our central nervous system nurons they do not regenerate they do not come back now along the lines of hearing loss i should just say that the best way to blow out your hearing for good to eliminate your hearing is to have very loud sounds superimposed on a loud environment o case loud environments can caust hearing loss over times if your work at a construction sight clanging really louder if your if you al work the sound board and in a club or something you are headed towards hearing loss unless you protect your your hearing with with your plugs and headphones a nowadays some of that that your plugs are very low profile meaning you cannot see them that is kind i seeyor not the on i was younger you dont one to be the dork to go to the concert with your plugs but turns out those dorks for smarter than everybody else because they are not the ones who are craining their neck to try and hear trivial things at the age of ah a thiridy or c as they blow out their hearing if you are in working in aloud environment ore you expose yourselves too loud environment you really want to avoid big inflections and sound above that loud environment plus fireworks loud environment plus gunshot lod and a loud environments plus very high frequency intent sound that that is what we call the too hip model when you this is also true for concussion that you can take a a kind of a stimulus that normally would be below the threshold of injury you add some another stimulus at the same time that would be below the threshold of injury and then suddenly you kill the nurons i i do not won make people paronoid but you do want to protect your hearing it is no fun to lose your hearing if you are goin to use headphones and you feel you on a crank it up all the way just remember that the more that you can get out of a lower volume meaning the longer that you can go listening to things that at lower volume the longer you will be able to hear that music or that thing again i'm not i'm not the hearing cop that is not my job but ah as somebody who ise lost some of its a high frequency hearing i can tell you it is it is it is not a pleasure it the the old argument that it helps you a not have to hear or listen to people that thyou do not on listen to that does it does not really work they just send your tuchs messages instead what about white noise and hearing loss in development no lot of people with children have these noise machines sound waves and things that that help the kids sleep and a look i i think a kid's getting good sleep and parents getting good sleep as vital to a physical and mental health and family health i i certainly sympathized with with those needs however there are data that indicate that white noise during development can be detrimental to the auditory system i do not want to frighten any parents if you played white noise to your kids its does not mean that their auditory system or their speech patterns or can be desrupted or that their interpretation of speeches can be desrupted forever but there are data published in the journal science in science being one of the three apex journal science nature cell the most stringent journals data published in the journal science some years ago i should buy a scientists who i know quite well his name is edward chang he is a medical doctor now hi's a narrow surgeon is itual the chairof nor surgery at you see us of and he runs laboratory where they study auditory learning noral plasticity et cetera he and his mentor at the time mike merzenic publishd a paper showing that if young animals and this was in animal models we are exposed to white noise the very type of noise that i'm saying it as a older person and when i say older i mean somebody whos in their lagteens early twenty is an older could benefit from listening to that at a low level in the background for sake of learning well what they exposed very young animals to this white noise it actually disrupted the maps of the auditory world within the brain and we have not talked about these maps yet but i wan to take a momen and talk about them and explain this effact ind what it might mean for you if you have kids or if you are exposed to a lot of white noise early on auditory information goes up into our quartacs into thes the essentialy the outside portion of our brain that is responsible for all are all of our how higher level cognition in our planning our decision making et cetera crectivity and up there we have what are called tonatopic maps what is a tonatopic map well member the coclia how it is coiled and at one end it response to high frequencies in the other end it responds to low frequencies sore a piano the key sound different as you extend down and up the piano keys and it is organized in a very systematic way right's not all inter make high frequencies an lofrequencies it it is organized in a very systematic way from one end to the other your visual system is in what is called a retnatopic map neighboring points in space off to my right my two fingers off to my right are mapped to neighboring points in space in my brain and the space right in front of me is map to a different location my brain but it systematic it is regular it is not random it is not salt an pepper it goes from high to lower from right to center to left in the auditory system we have what are called toneotopic maps where frequency high frequency to low frequency and everything in between is organizing a very systematic way now our experience of life from the time were a baby until the time that we die is not systematic we do not hear low frequencies at one part of the room er at one part of the day and high frequencies another part of the room another part of the day they are al intermixed but if you remember the cocliest separates them out just a prism of light separates out the different wavelings of light the cocali a separates out the different frequencies and the developing brain takes those separated out frequencies and learns this relationship between itself meaning the child and the outside world white noise essentially contains no tonotopic information the frequencies are all intermixed it is just noise whereas when i speak my voice has now i'm getting technical but has whats called a certain envelope meaning has some low frequencies and some slightly high frequencys agamag ma avoice hirealthough i'm not very good at them i ways starts to crack and i can wite my voice lower although not as low as costello snor has an envelope has a container white noise has no container it is all the colors of the rainbow spread out together which is actually what you get when you get white light white noise is analogous to white light one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise during development for long periods of time can be detrimental to the development of the auditory system is that these tnotopic maps do not form normally at least they do not inexperimental animals now the reason i'm raising this is that many people i know in prettyular friends who have small children they say i want to use a white noise machine while i sleep but is is it o cay for my baby to use a white noise machine and i consulted with various people scientists about this and they said well the baby is also hearing the parents voices and is hearing music and is hearing the dog bark it is not the only thing their hearing however every single person that i consulted with said but there is norro plasticity during sleep that is when the kid to sleeping and i do not know that you would wanto expose a child to white noise the entire night because it might degrade that tonotopic map it might not destroy it might not eliminate it but it could make it a little less clear ligke sort of taking the keys on the piano and taping a few of them together right you still got the highs and lows in the appropriate order and everything in between but when you take the keys together you do not get the same fidelity do not get the same precision of the noise that comes out of that piano i'm i do not again i do not want to scare anybody but i would say if you were in a position to make the choice of either using white noise or something similar pink noise is just account of variation it is got a little bit more of a certain frequency just pink light has a lobit more of a certain wave length than white light can if you are in a position to make choiceis about things to put in a young especially very young child's sleeping environment white noise might be something to consider avoiding again i'm not telling what to do but it is something to perhaps consider avoiding i do not think most pediatricians are gong to be aware of these data but if you talk to any auditory physiologists or s or an audeologist or somebody whoe studies auditory development i'm no fairly certain that they would have opinions about that now whether not their opinions agree with a mine in these folks that i consulted with or not is a separate matter i i do not know cause i do not know them ah but it is something that i felt was important enough to cure you to a specially since i've highligte i've highlighted excuse me the opposite effect is true in adult hood once your auditory system has form once it is establish these tonotopic maps then the presence of background white noise should not be a problem at all in fact it should not be a problem at all because you are also not attending to it the ideas that it is playing it a low enough volume that you can a forget it in the background and that it is supporting learning by bringing yours your brain into a heightened state of a lerness and especially this heightened state of dopamine dopaminergic activation of the brain which will make it easier to learn faster and easier to learn the information now i want to talk about auditory learning and actually how you can get better at learning information that you hear not jous information that you see on a page or motor skill learning there are lot of reasons to want to do this a lot of class room teaching whether not it is byzoome or in person is auditory in nature not everything is necessarily written down for us it is also good to get better at listening or i'm told there is a phenomenon called the coctail party effect even if you have never been to a coctail party you have experience and participated in what is called the coctal party effect the coctail party effect is where you are in an environment that is rich with sound many sound waves coming from many different sources many different things in a city in a class room in a car that contains people having various conversations you somehow need to be able to attend to specific components of those sound waves many you need to hear certain people and not others the resent's called the coctail party effect is that you and meaning your brain are exquisitely good at creating a cone of auditory attention a narrow band of attention with which you can extract the information you care about and whipe away or race all the rest now this takes work it takes attention one of the reason s why you might come home from a loud gathering may be a stadium a sports of end to coctail party for that matter and feel just exhausted is because if you are listening to conversations there or trying to listen to those conversations while watching the game and people moving past you and hearing all this noise clinking of glasses et cetera it takes attentional effort and the brain uses up a lot of energy just at rest but it uses up even more energy when you are spaying strong attention to something literally coloric energy burning up things glucos et cetera even if you are kee to janic its burning up energy the cocktail party effect has been studied extensively in the field of narro scince and we now know at a mechanistic level how one accomplishes this feet of attending to certain sounds despite the fact that we are being bum boarded with all sorts of other sounds theire coupleways that we do this first of all much as with our visual system we can expand or contract our visual field of view we can go from panoramic vision see the entire scene that where you we are in by dilating our gaze talked a lot about this on this potcast and elsewhere we can for instance keep our head and eyes stationary or mostly stationary enough to be rigid about and you can expand your field of us to you can see the walls and sealing and floor can see yourself in the environment that is panoremic view to what you would accomplish without having to try at all if you when to a horizon for instance or we can contract our field of you i can bring my focust to a particular location when we call avergence point directly in front of me now ampointing at the cammer directly in front of me cet we can do that we can expand and contract our visual field of yiou well we can expand and contract are auditory field of vieu to speak or are auditory window you can try this next time you are in an environment that is rich with noise meaning lots of different sounds you can just tun out all the noise to a background chatter you can just you try not focuss on any one particular sound and you get the background and of chatter of noise and you will find that is actually very relaxing in comparison to trying to listen to somebody at a coctail partin your shouting back and woard enough youare very very interest in that person ore getting to know them better or what theire telling you or some commination of those things then you will be very motivated to do it but none the less it requires energy and effort and attention how do we do this well t actually quite simple or at least its simple in essence although the underlying mechanissms are complex here i have to credit the laboratory of aguiding might wear w e h re up at the univershy of organ who essentially figured out that we are able to accomplish this extraction of particular sounds we can we can really hear one person or a sm ll number of people amidst the huge background of chatter because we pay attention to the onset of words but also to the offset of words now the way to visualize this is if the background noise is just a bunch of waves of noise it is literally just soundwaves coming every frequency low frequncy high frequency glass is clinking together fyou hat a game people are shouting people are talking on their phone there is the crack of the ball of somebody actually manges to to hit the ball all the announcsir et cetera but whatever were paying attention to we set up a cone of auditory attention a kind of a tunnel of auditory attention where we are listening although we do not realize that we are listening for the onset and the offset of those words now this is powerful for a couple of reasons first of all it is a call to arm to speak to disengage your auditory system when you do not need to focuss your attention on something particular if you ore somebody you are coming home from work if at a very long day and you are trying to make out a particular conversation on background noise you might consider just not having that conversation just letting your auditory landscape be very broad almost panoramic vision if you are trying to learn how to extract sound information could be notes of music it could be scales of music it could be words spoken by somebody else maybe somebody is telling you what you need to say for a particular speech or the information that you need to learn for a particular topic and thei'r telling it to you deliberately paying attention both to the onset and to the offset of those words can be beneficial because it it is exactly the way that the auditory system likes to bring in information one of the more common phenomeno that i think we all experiences you go to a party and or you meedt somebody knew and you say hi i would say hiam andrew and they would say hiam im jeff for instanceand a great gret musa and then a minute later i cannot remember the guy's name now is it because i do not care what his name is no somehow the presence of other auditory information interfered it is not that my mind was necessarily some place else it is that the signal to noise as we say was not high enough somehow the way he set it or the way it landed on my ears which is really all that matters right when when it comes down to learning is such that it just in achieve high enoughf signal to noise the noise was too high or the signal was too low or some commination of those the next time you aske somebody is name remember listen to the onset of what they say and the offset sit would be paying attention to the je in jeff and it would be paying attention to the in f in jeff scuse me right and chances are you'l be able to remember that name now i do not know if people who are superlearners of names do this naturally or not i do not have access to their brains i do not think yoy gon ton give me access to their brains either but it is a very interesting way to take the natural biology of auditory attention and learning and apply to cenarios where you are trying to remember either people's names or specific information now i do acknowledge that trying to learn every word an a sentence by paying attention to it is onset and offset could action be kind of desruptive to the learning process this would be more for specific attention you are asking directions in a city and somebody says oke you you say you are lost and they say yo kay you are going to go two blocks down you'egoing a turn left and then ou're ging to see a landmark on your right and thenyou are oing to go om in the in the third door on you'r left it is lot of information at least for me k the way you ould you ould want a listen to that is yofre going to e go down the road and i i see i already forgot you are going to take a let you are going to go left and you are just gin a programme and insted of just hearing the word left you are gangto think tha el at the front of left and the te you' ar not left ok and then you are coding and specific words and what this does is this and of high jacks these naturally ccurrying attention mechanisms that the auditory sistem likes to use sa little bit of data that for auditory an coding this kind of thing can be beneficial there are a lot of data that attention for auditory coding is beneficial there are a little bit of data showing that deliberately incoding auditory information this way meaning trying to learn auditory information this way can be beneficial or can accelerate learning and some of these features of what i'm describing here map on to some of the work of mike mersonic and others that have been design to try an overcome things stutter and to treat various forms of auditory learning disorders but more importantly and perhaps more powerful is the work of mike mersenic that was done with his then graduate student greg reckonzone that show that using the attentional system we can actually learn much faster and we can actually activate nerl plasticity in the adult brain something that is very chalenging to do and that the auditory system is one of the main ways in which we can access nerl plasticity more broadly just want to take a couple of minutes and describe the work of reckonzon and merzonic because it is absolutely fantastic and fascinating what they did is they had subjects try to learn auditory information except that they told them to pay attention to particular frequencies now you kno what frequencies are etsense essentially high pitch sounds are low pitch sounds what they found was just passively listening to a bunch of stuff does not allow the brain to change and for that stuff to be remembered at all that is not a surprise we have all experienced the the phenomeno of having some one talk and we see their mouth moving when i y othes is really important this really important were listening were trying to listen than then they walk away anything i can get any of that and you wonder whether not it was them maybe the sapeneureno may you wonder whether r not it was you you wonder whether r not you have trouble with learning or you have attention defisit it could be any number of different things but what reckons on immersonit discovered was that if you instruct subjects to listen for particular cue within speech or within sounds that not only can you learn those things more quickly but that you can remap these tona topic maps in the quartec that i referred to earlier you actually get changes in the norl architecture the norl circuitry in the brain and this can occur not only very rapidly but they can occur in the adult brain which prior to their work was not thought to be a menable to change it was long thought that norl plastesy could only occur in the developing brain but the work of reckons on and mersonic in the auditory system actually with some of the first that really opened up everybody's eyes and ears to the idea that the brain can change in adulthood heare's how this sort of process would work and howyou might apply it if you are trying to learn music or you are trying to learn information that you are going to then resight you can decide to highlight certain words or certain frequencies of sound or certain scales or certain keys on the piano and to only focus on those for certain learning bouts iso i'll give an example a that sort of real time for me meaning it is happening right now i know generally what i want to say when i arrive here i even know specifically certain things that i want to make sure get a cross to you but i do not think about every single word that i am going to say and the precise order in which i am going to say those things that would be actually very disruptive because it would not match my normal patterns of speech you ned probably think i was sounding rather robotic if i were to do that one way that we can remember information is as we rit out for instance something that we want to say we can highlight particular words we can underline those if we are listening to somebody and they are telling us information we can decide just to highlight particular words that they said to us and write those down now of course we are listening to all the information but the work of reckons on and mersonic and the work of others in addition them is former studen or former postok i do not know which a michael killgard whos now got his own lap down in texas or others have shown that the cuing of attention to particular features of speech particular components of speech the way in which it increases are level of attention over all allows us to capture more of the information over all and i do not want this to be abstracted all what this means is when you are listening you do not have to listen to every word you are already listening to every word all the informations coming inthrough your ears what you are trying to extract is particular things or themes within the content maybe you decide with you are listening to me that you are only going to listen to a the word tools or you are only can the listen to when my voice kind ofgoes above background you get to decide what you decide to listen to her not and what you decide to focus on is not necessarily as important as the fact that you'r focusing i hope that is clear the auditory system does this all the time with the coctail party effact what i'm talking about is exporting certain elements of the mechanisms of the cocktail party effact paying attention to the onset and offseted words or particular notes within music or particular scales or you can make it even broader and particular motifs of music or particular sentences of words or particular phrases and in doing that you extract more of the information over all even though you are not paying attention to all the information at once now i'd to talk about a phenomenon that you'v all experienced before which is called dopler the dopler effact is the way that we experience sound when the thing that is making that sound is moving the simplest way to explain this is to translate the sound into the visual world once again if you have ever seen a a dockor a goose sitting in a pond or a lake and it is kind of bobbing up and down what you will notice is that the ripples of water that extend out from that doc or goose are fairly regularly spaced in all directions and that is because that docker goose is stationarye's moving up and down but it is not moving forward or backward or to the side now if that doctor goose were to swim forward by paddling its little webbed feet under the surface you would immediately notice that the ripples of water that are close to and in front of that duck or goose would be closer together than the ones that trailed it that were behide and that is essentially what happens with sound is well with the dopler effact we experience sounds that are closer to us at higher frequency the ripples are closer together and sounds that are further away at lower frequency especially when they are moving past us if you have ever for instance heard a siren in the distance that is essentially myrandition of a siren i do not know what a mbulance er police or what passing you on a street that is the dopler effect the doler effect is one of the mainways that we make out the direction that things are arriving from end their speeds and trajectories and we get very good from a very young age at discerning what direction things are arriving from and the direction that they are going to pass us and and the dopler effect is probably saved your life many many times in this way you just do not realize hit because you will step off the curb or your driving your car and you pull to the side that the ambulance or fire truck can go by because you heard that siren off in the distance and then you pull away from the curban you get back on the road ipart because you do not see it any longer but also you do not hear any other sirens in the distance now some animals such as bats are exquisitely good and navigating their environments according to sound now we have all heard that bats do not see that is i should not true they actually have vision but they just rely more heavily on their auditory system and the way that bats navigate in the dark and the way that bats navigate using sound is through dopler now they do not simply listen to whether not things are coming at them or moving away from them and pay attent to th dopler the siren example i gave for you what they do is they generate their own sounds a bat as it flies around is sending out clicks i think that is my best bat sound or may be is and they'r clicking their actuul propelling sound out at a particular frequency that they know now wheth another conscious of it i do not know i've never ask them and if i did ask them i don thyn they could answer in if they couldt answer they could not answer in a language that i could understand but the bat is essentially flying around sending out soundwaves pinging it is environment with soundwaves of a particular frequency and then depending on the frequency of sound waves that come back they know if they are getting closer to an object or further away from it f they send out sounds at a frequency of this was much slower than it would actually cur but you knowt let ay one every half second and it is coming back even faster than they know theire getting closer right because of the dopler effect and if they comes back more slowly they know that there is nothing in front of them the bat is essentially navigating its world by creating these aras of sound that bounce back on to them from the various objects trees at cetera buildings and people i you re to thing about but yes they they see you with they experience you with their sound they sens you and they are using doplr to accomplish it now i'd to talk about ringing in the ears this is something that i get asked abuot a lot and a speak of signal to noise i i do not know if i get asked about a lot because many people suffer from ringing in their ears or because the people who suffer from ringing in their ears suffer much that they are more prone to ask it could be a sampling by us i do not know but i've been asked enough times a and some of the experiences of discomfort that people of expressed about having this ringing of the ears how really motivade me to go deep into this literature the ringing of the ears that one experiences is called tenatus not tenitus but tenatus and tenatus can vary an intensity and it can very according di stress levels it can very across the life span or even time of day its very subject to kind of background of fects and contextual effects i think ye know we all know that we should do our best to maximize healthy sleep we did a number of episodes on that assentially the first for episodes of the huberman lapodcast rale about sleep and how to get better sleep we all know that we should try and limin our stress an we had an episode about stress in was to mitigate stress as well however there are people it seems that are suffering from tenatdus for which stress or lack of sleep just cannot explain the presents of the tenatus tenatus can be cause by disruption to these haircells that we talked about earli ar or damage to the hair cells that is another reason why even if you have good hearing now that you want to protect that hearing anmd really avoid putting yourself into these kind of two hit environments environments to where there is a lot of background noise and then you add another really loud auditory stimulus this is also can happen at different times i should mention if you go to a concert or you listen to loud music with your headphones and then you go to a concert or you go into a very loud work environment the hair cells can still be vulnerable and once those hair cells are knocked out corrently we do not have the technology to put them back although many groups including some excellent croups at stamford and elsewhere to of course are working on ways to replenish those haircells and restore hearing there are treatments for tenatus that involve taking certain substances there are medications for tenatus in the non prescription landscape which is typically what we discuss on this podtcast when we discuss taking anything there are essentially four compounds for which there are quality pure revudeta were there does not appear to be any over commercial by us meaning that nothings reported in the papers as ino funding from a particular company and those are melatonan ginco bill bo zinc and magnesium now i've talked about melatonan befor i'm personlly not a fan of melatonan as a sleep aid but there are four studies first one entitle theffects of melatona melatonan on tinitus tinitus scuse me and sleep second one treatment of cential and censuri neral tinetus with oraly administered melatonan and then the title goes on much longer buts o randomize study i'm not gong to read out all these mlatonan can it stop the ringing to a interesting article double blinded a study and the effects a melatonan on tinitus each one of these studies has anywhere from thirty to more than a hundred subjects one case a hundred two subjects both genders as they list them out tipically ah its lissenas sect not gender and studies it should say both sexes but on none the less a an age range anywhere from thirty years old all the way up to sixty five plos i did not see any studies of people younger than thirty all three focuset on melatonan not surprisingly because of the titles looking at a range of dosages anywhere from three meligrams per day which as sor of typical of many supplements for melatonan still much higher than one would manufacturer indogenously through your own pineoglan but three meligrams in these studies for a duration of anywhere from thirty days to much longer in some cases six months and all four of these studies found modest yet still statistically significant offacts of taking melatone in my mouth it is oraly administered melatonan in reducing the severity of tinitus that is compelling at least to me i it does not sound a cure and of course as always i'm not a physician i'm a scientis i do not proscribe anything i only profess things i report you the science you have to decide if melatonan is right for you if you have tinitus and certainly i say that both to protect myself but also protect you you responsible for your health and well being and i'm not telling anyone to run out and starttaking melatonun for tinitus but it does seem that it can have some effects in reducing its symptoms ginco boboa is an interesting compound it is it is been proscribed for or recommended for many many things but there are a few studies again double blinded studies lasting one to six months any whereone that has of an impressive number of subjects nine hundred and seventy eight subjects ranging from age eighteen all the way up to sixty five on and forth that show not huge effects of ginco but the as they quote limited evidence suggests that if tinitus is a side effect of something else in particular cognitive decline age related tini dus might be helped by ginko billbo i will not go through all the details of the zinc studies but it seems that zinc supplementation at higher levels than are typical of most people's intakes of fifty miligrams perday do appear to be able to reduce subjective symptoms of tentus in most the people that took the supplemented zinc there are not a lot of studies on that i could only find one double blinded study it lasted anywhere from one to six months forty one subjects both genders list it out again here forty five to sixty four and they saw decrease in the severity of tenatus symptoms with fifty miligrams of elemental zink supplementation and then lasppenot lese is the magnesium study again only a single study it is a face to study looking at a fairly limited number of subjects sonly nineteen subjects taking five hundred thirty two miligrams of elemental magnesium for those of you that take magnesium there is magnesium and elemental magnesium and it is always translated on the on the bottle but it was associate with the lessening of symptoms related to tenatus for you tenadus sufferers out there you may already beware of this you may already be taking these things ah and had no postive effects meaning they did not help my be not i hope that om you will at least consider these talk toyour doctor about them i do realize that tenatus is extremely desruptive i cannot say i empathize ah because i do not a from a place of experience that is because i do not have tnetus but for those of you that do not including myself you can imagine that hearing sounds of things that are not there and the ringing in one's ears can be very desruptive and i think om would be very desruptive and explains why people with tenatus reach out often with questions about how to alleviate that and i hope this information was useful to you i'd to now talk about balance and our sense of balance which is controlled by believe are not our ears and things in our ears as well as by our brain and elements of our spinal cord but before i do that i want to ask you another question or i would rather i'd to ask you to ask yourself a question and answer it which is how big are your ears turns out that the ears grow our entire life in the early stage of our life they grow more slowly and then as we age they grow more quickly may have noticed if you have family members who are well into their seventies and eighties and your fortunate and hear in to their nineties and may beven hundreds is that the ears of some of these individuals get very very big relative to their previous ear sizes it turns out that bialogical age can actually be measured according to ear size i yet to take a few measurements but there is beliit or not there is a formula in the sign ific literature if your ear circumference o the distance around your ear ears plurel presumele of to most people do in millimeters youan take the circumference of your ears and millimires how would you do this i how woul yous weu maybe you take a string and you put it around your ear and then you measure the stringth that is probaly can be easier than marching around your ear or somebody else's ear with a ruler and measuring a millimeters what is your ear circumference on the outside do not go in on the divid or anything you are just going around as if youre gon trace the the closest fitting oval assuming your ears are oval closest fitting oval that matches your ear circumference take that number and millimeters subsubtract from it oh excuse me i should do this correctly do that for both ears ad them together at those numbers together divide by two get the average for your two ears get your average ear circumference oricruss your two ears then take that number in millimeters subtract eighty eight point one and then whatever value that is multiply at times one point nine six and that will tell you your biological age now why in the world would this be accurate but s we age there are changes an number of different biological pathways one of those pathways is the pathways rel ated to college in synthesis not only are our ears growing but our noses are growing too mino seems to be growing aa lot but then again i did sports whre ihave get my nose broken something i do not recommend s always point out you do not get a nose mind doing yoga but none the less my nose is still growing and my ears are still growing and i suspect as i get older if i've the good fortune of living into my eighties and nineties my ears aregain continue to grow a comparison between chronological age and biological age is something that is of really deep interest these days and the work of davids and clareit harvard medical school and others calld horvath clocks that people have developed have tapped in to how the epiginom an the ginom can give us some insight into our biological age and how that compares to our chronological age must vsknow our chronological age because we know when we were born and we know where we are relative to that now but you can start to make tha little chart if you about your rates of oar growth your rates of ear growth actually correlate pretty well with your rates of biological progression through this thing that we call life it is not somethingthat we thing about too often but just our d ana and our epiginom and some other markyrs of metabolic health and hormon health relate to our age does our college in synthesis and one of the places that shows up the most is in these two little goodies on the sides of our heads which are our ears even thogh its e low bit of a bazaar metric ah it makes perfect sense in the biological context let us talk about balance and how to get better at balancing the reason why we are talking about balance and how to get better at balancing in the episode about hearing is that all the goodies that are going to allow you to do that are in your ears they are also in your brain but they are mostly in your ears as you recall from the beginning of this episode you have two coclia coclias thet are one on each side of your head and that is a little spiral snail shaped thing that converts sound waves into electrical signals that the rest of your brain can understand right next to those you have what are called semi circular canalse the semicircular canals can be best visualized as thinking about three hoolahoops with marbles in them imagine that you have a hoolahoop and it is not filled with mar marbles all the way round it is just got some marbles down there at the base cipso if you were to move that hoolahoop around the marbles wou move round shshsh ok you have got three of those and each one of those wholahoops has these marbles that can move around one of those wholhoops it is position vertically with respect to gravity it is basically parallel to your nose it sit is this of youre watching on avidio but bas 's upright another one of those wholahoops is basically at a ninety degree angle to your nose it is basically parallel to the floor if you are standing up right now if you'r seeded ki and the other one it is kind of tilted about forty five degrees ind between those now why is the system there well those marbles within each one of those holahoos can move around but they will only move around if your head moves in a particular way and there are three planes or three ways that your head can move your head can move up and down a nodding right now that is called pitch it is pitching forward or pitching back okin it is a gnawed up and down or i can shake my head now side to side that is called yaw you pilots will be very familiar with this yaw not yawn yaw and then there is roll tilting the head from side to side the way that acupe puppy might look at you from side to side oki where thetif somebody does not really understand or believe what you are saying they might tilt their head very common phenomena i me known oit does that to me but they they do that to each other pitch yawn roll are the movements of the head and each of the three major planes of motion as we say and each one of those causes those marbles to moovee in one or two of the various wholahoops oki if i move my head up and down when i gnod one of those whola hoops literally right now the marbles are moving back and for they are not actually marbles by the way these are little an little kind of little stones basically look calcium deposits and when they roll back and forth they deflect little hairs little hair cells that are not the hair cells that we use for measuring sound waves tey're not too different but they are not but they are different from them not the hairs on our heads but theyre basily rolling past these little hair sells and causing them to deflect and when they deflect downward the nurons because hairsells are nurons send information up to the brain if i move my head this there is as physical movement of these little stones in this holahoop as them referring to it but they deflect these hairs send those hairs which are nurons those hair sells send information off to the brain ahad from side to side different little stones move if i roll my head different stones move this is an exquisite system that exists in all animals that have a jaw any fish that has a jaw has this system a puppy has this system any animal has a jaw has this called balance system which we call the vestibular system one of the more important things to know about the vistibular the balance system is that it works together with the visual system let say i hear something off to my left and i swing my head over to the left to see what it is thereare two sources of information about where my head is relative to my body and i need to know that first of all when i quickly move my head to the side those little stones as tom referring to them i realie they are not actually stones but as whei'm referring to them they quickly activate those hair sells in that one semi circular canal and send a signal off to my brain that my head just move to the side this not that it went this and pitched back or not that it tilted but it just move to the side but also visual information slid past me my my field of view i did not have to think about it but just slid past my field of view and when those two signals combine my eyes then lock to a particular location now if this is it all complicated you can actually uncouple these things very easy to do you can do this right now in fact i'd you to do this experiment if you are not already doing something else that requires your attention and certainly do not do this if you are driving i you gan a sit down and youare going to move your head to the left very slowly youare going with your eyes open you are going to move it very very slowly the whole thing should take about five six may be ven tend seconds to complete i just did it now iofmen to do it very quickly i'd you to do it very quickly as well now do it slowly again oquet well you probably noticed is that it is very uncomfortable to do it slowly but you can do it very quickly without much discomfort at all you ust move your had to the side the reason is when you move your head very slowly those little stones at the base of that whoolahoo they do not get enough momentum to move see you'r actually not generating this signal to the brain that your head is moving and what you will notice is that your eyes have to go boom boom boom jumping over step by step where as if you move your head really quickly the signal gets off your brain ind your eyes just go pright to the location you want to look at moving your body slowly is actually very disruptive to the to the vestibular system and it is very disruptive to your visual system now if you have ever had the misfortune of being on a boat and you are going through big oscillations on the boat for those of you see sick you folks thoy get see sick this can actually makes certain people ee sick just to hear about it that was big oscillages going up and down and up and down those are very desruptive il will talk about nausi and a mentd how to offset that kind of nausio i get prettyseasick but their ways that you can you can deal with this but this is incredible because what it means it is ha purely physical system of these little stones rolling around in there and directing where your eyes should go ocas you can do this also just by looking up let yus say you er sitting in a chair you n a look up towards the ceiling and your eyes will just go there you are doing this izes open you look down as it now try doing it really really slowly some people lievin get motion sa doing this which i if you do then just stop oquet you can do this also to the side although it works bast of you are movingyour head from from side to side om it were nodding up and down what we are doing here is we are uncoupling these two mechanisms we are pulling them apart the visual part and the vestibula part just to illustrate to you that normally these mechanisms in your inner ear tell your eyes where to go but as well your eyes tell your balanc system you'r vestibular system how to function i you to do it different experiment hem experiment i'm not koing to do it right now but basically stand up f you get the opportunity you can do the safely wherever you are you can o stand up and youregoing to look forward about ten twelve feet youou pick a point on a wall or you can an anywhere that you if you are out in public just do it anyway just tell them you are listening to to cuberman lappangast an num than some one's telling you to do it anyway if you do not undo it do not do it but basically do it stand on one leg and lift up the other leg you can bend your knee if you and just look off into the distance about ten twelve feet if you can do that if you can stand on one leg now close your eyes chances are you are going to suddenly feel what scientists call posteral sway you can a start swaying around a lot it is very hard to balance with your eyes closed i think what and if you think of that is what why is that that is crazy why would it be that it is hard to balance with your eyes close well information about the visual world also feeds back on to this vestibular system the vestibular system informs your vision and tells you where to move your eyes and your eyes in their positioning tell your balance system your vestibular system how it should function there is a really cool way that you can learn to optimiyes balance you are not can i trying do this by learning to balance with your eyes close what you can do is you can raise one leg and you can look at a short distance may be off to just the distance that your thumb would be if youre to reach your arm out in front of you although you do not nesser let to put your thumb in front of you may be just about two feet in front of you then while still balancing you can a step your vision out a further distance and then a further distance and as far as you can possibly see in the environment that your in and then you are gon to march it back to you now what the literature shows is that this kind of balance training where you incorporate the visual system and extending out and then marching back in the point of which you direct your visual focus sends robust information about the relationship between your visual world and your balance system andof course the balance system includes nocisthese these wholahoops the semicircular canals but they communicate with the sera bellum thes slok called many brain ashly means many brain the back to your brain combines that with visual information and your map of the body surface that pattern of training is very beneficial for enhancing your ability to balance because you the ability to balance is inpart the activation of particular posteral muscles but just as much perhaps even more it is about being able to a just those posteral musts muscles scuse me it is about the ability to adjust those posteral muscles as you experienced changes in your visual world and one of the most robust ways that you can engage changes in your visual world is through your own movement and most people are not trying to balance in place right they are not just trying to stand there a statue on one leg most of what we thing abou one thing about balance is forsake of sport or dynamic balace of being able to break ourselves and o when we are lunging in one particular direction to stop ourselves that is and then to move it in another direction or for scape warding or surfing or cycling or any number of different things gymnastics the visual system is the primary imput by which you develop balance but you cannot do it just with the visual system what i'm recommending is if you are interested and cultivating a sense of balance under stand the relationship between these semie circular canals understand that they are both driving e movements and they are drivin by ey movements it is a recyprocal relationship and then even just two or three minutes a day or every once in a while even three times a week may be five minutes may be ten minutes you pick but if you one enhance balance you have to combine changes in your visual environment with a static posture standing on one leg and shifting your visual environment or static visual view looking at one thing and changing your body posture cas those two things we now know from the scientific literature combine in order to give an enhance sense of balance and there is a really nice paper thoas publishing twenty a fifteen called effects of balance training on balance performance this was in a healthy adult it is a systematic review in a meta analysis a metanalycis s when you combine a lot of literature from a lot of different papers and extract the really robust and the less robuss tatistical effects it is a really nice paper as well there are some papers out there a for instance a comparison of static balance and the role of vision in the elete athletes this is a essentially the paper that i've extracted most of the information o that i just gave you from and that paper and there are some others as well a but basically i distilld them down into their core components the core components are move your vision around while stying static still but in a balanced position standing on one leg could be something more complicated if your somebody who can do more complicated movements om younalateral movement seem to be important standing on one leg is opposed to both right or trying to generate some tilt is another way to go about it or imbalance meaning one limb a symmetrically being activated compared to the other limb and then the other way to in courage or to cultivate and build up this festibular system and your sense of balance actually involves movement itself acceleration that is what wergon to talk about now up until now i've been talking about balance only in the static sense standing on one leg for instance but that is a very artificial situation even though you can train balance that way most people who want to enhance their sense of balance for sport or dance or some other endeavor want to engage balance in a dinamic way meaning moving through lots of different plans of movement maybe even sometimes while squatting down low or jumping and landing or a making tragectories that are different angles for that we need to consider that the vestipular system also cares about acceleration it cares about head position and cares about ey position and where the eyes are and where your looking but it also cares about what direction your moving and how fast and one of the best things that you can do to enhance your sense of balance is to start to bring together your visual system the semicircular canals of the inner here and what we call linear exceleration if i move forward in space rigidly upright it is a vastly different situation than if i'm leaning to the to the side one of the best ways to cultivate a better sense of balance literally within the sense organs and the nurons and the biology of the brain is to get into modes where we are accelerating forward typicallates forward while also tilted with respect to gravity now this would be the carve on a scapewoard or on a surfboarder of snowboard this would be the taking a corner on a bite while being able to lean safely of course lean into the turn that your head is actually tilted with respect to the earth any time that we are rigidly upright we are not really exercising the vestibular system and balance this is why yen you see people in the gim on these un one of those bonciballs bocubout bonchballs the one that the gise role in the park right boncy balls were their balancing back and forth that will work the small stablizing muscles but what iam talking about is getting into modes where you actually tilt the body and the head with respect to earth what i mean is with respect to earth's gravitational pull now the serabellum is a very interesting structure because not only is it involved in balance but it is also involved in skill learning and in generating timing of movements it is a fastening structure deserving of entire episode or several episodes all on its own but some of the outputs of the srabellum meaning the nurons in the sell sarabellum get inputs but they also send information out the outputs of the sarabellum are strongly link to areas of the brain that release nuromodulators that make us feel really good in particular saratonan and dopomine and this is an early emerging subfield within neurol science but a lot of what are called the non motor outputs of the saraballum have a profound influence not just on our ability to learn how to balance better but also how we feel over all for you exercisers out there i do hope people are getting regular healthy amounts of exercise we have talked about what that means in previous episode at least a hundre and fifty minutes a week of endurance work some strength training minimum five setsper bodypart to maintain musculats ure even if you do not want to grow muscles you want to do that in order to maintain healthy strength and bones cetera if your doing that but your only doing things curls in the gim squats in the gim riding the pelaton or even if your outside running and you'r getting forward ecceleration but youre never actually getting tilted right you never actually getting tilted with respect to earth's gravitational pull you are not really exercising and getting the most out of your nervous system activation of the of the cerabellumen in this way of being tilted or the head being tilted in the body being tilted while in acceleration typically forward exceleration but sometimes side to cide has a profound and positive effect on our sense of mood and well being and as i talked about in previous episode it can also enhance our ability to learn information in the period after generating those tilts and the ecceleration and that is because the carabelum has these outputs to these areas of the brain that release these naromodulators ceratonand and dopomen and they make us feel really good i think this is one of the reasons why growing up i add some friends some of whom w might have been the world heavyweight champions of laziness for essentially everything except they would wake up at four thirdy in the morning to go surf they were drive thay woul get up early to go serve i ol it is not just surfers of and some surface by the way i should point out ar are are not lazy humans they do a lot of other things but i knew people that could not be motivated to do anything but they were highly driven to gett into these ecperiences of forward acceleration while tilted with respect to gravity likewise with snowboarding or scheing or cycling those modes of exercise seem to have an outcised effect both on our well being and our ability to translate the vestibular balance that we achieve in those endeavors to our ability to balance while doing other things and i do not mean psychological balance necessarily i mean physical balance for those of you that do not think of yourselveses very cordinated or with very good balance getting into these modes of acceleration forward movement or lateral movement while getting tilted even if you have to do it slowly could be beneficial i do believe and the scientific literature points the fact that it will be beneficial for cultivating better sense of physical balance it can really build up the circuits of this vestibular system and then of course the feel good components of ecceleration while tilted or while getting the head into different orientations relative to gravity while that is the explanation for rollarcosters some people hate rollar cosers they make them feel naucious many people love rollar costers an one of the reasons they love rollar costers is because of the way that when you get the body even if you are not genering the movement you get the body into forward acceleration and youre going upside down and tilted to the side as the tracts go from side to side and tilt et cetera you are getting activation of these deeper praiyn neuclyi that trigger the release of naromodulators that just make us feel really really good infact some people get a long arc a long duration kind of bu is from having gone through those experiences some people who hate rolar costers are probably getting nautious just hearing about that i encourage people to get into modes of acceleration while tilted every once in a while provided you can do it safely it is an immensely powerful way to build up your skills in the realm of balance and it is also for most people very very pleasing it feels really good because of the chemical relationship between forward exceleration and head tilt and body tilt now speaking of feeling nautious some people suffer from vertigo somepeople feel dizzy some people get lightheaded an important question to ask yourself always if your feeling quote an quote dizzy or lightheaded is are you dizzy or are you light headed now were not gan a dignoce anything here because there is just no way we can do that this is essentially me shouting into a tunnuls we do not know what is going on with umeachin every one of you but if ever you feel that your world is spinning but that you can focus on your thumb for instance but the rest of the world is spinning and your thumb is stationary that is called being dizzy now if you feel your falling or tht you feel you need to get down on to the ground because you feel light headed that is being lightheaded and oftentimes with language we do not distinguish between being dizzy and being lightheaded now therre lot of ways that dizziness and lightheadedness can occur and i do not even want a begin to guess at the number of different things and ways that it could happen for those ov you that suffer from it because it be any number of them but oftentimes if people are lightheaded yes it could be low blood sugar it could also be that you are dehidraded it could also be that you are low and electrolights we talked about this in a previous episode but we will talk about it more in a future episode many people have too little sodium in their system salt and that is why they feel light headed n i have family members who for years thought they head diserrupted blood sugar they we get shaky gittery lightheaded feel they were nautious et cetera and simply the addition of little seasalt to their water remedy the problem entirely i do not think it is can a remedy every issue of lightheadednes out there by any stretch but just the addition of salt in this particular case help the person and they are not alone many people who think that they have low blood sugar actually are lightheaded because of low electrolights and because of the way that salt carries water into the system and creates changes in blood volume et cetera low sodium can often be a source of light headedness as can low blood sugar and of course other things as well now for dizziness or seasickness we were all taught that you need to pick a point on the horizon and focus on it but actually that is not correct it is true that if you are down in the cabin of a boat or you are on the lower deck and all you can see are things up close to you that getting sloshed around or the boat going up and down i thing f yo will see sick even as i do this and i describe it focusing on things close to you can be problematic and in that case the advice to go up on deck and get fresh air and to look off into the horizon that part is correct but focussing your eyes on a particular location on the horizon is effectively trying to move very slowly as i had you do before we are trying to move your head very slowly while fixating on one location your eyes in your balance system were design to move together really what you want to do is allow your visual system to track with your visiyour vestibular system this is why sitting in the back of an uber or a taxi and being on your phone can make you suddenly feel very naucious sometimes the cabs particularly new york city they have a lot of a cluders they have a lot of stuf blocking your field of vieu tits usually little portal out that we can see out to the front of the of the a of the front winshield but there is all the stuff now telivisions in the back seat in you are watching that tellvision and the cab is moving you are in linear acceleration and sometimes you are taking corners your breaking that you yyour vestibular system as to adjust to that if you are looking at your phone or a book or even if you are talking to somebody i sham serring feelle naucis tomit i promise i'm not in o finish this episode by vomiting at the end at least not her but what you what can happen is that your uncoupling your vdivisual information from your motion from your vestibular information you want those to be coupled this is why a lot of people halfe to drive they cannot be in the passenger seat because when you drive you also get what is call purperarcept to fee back your body is sending signals also to the vestibular system about where you are in space when youre the passenger you are just getting jolted around as the person is driving and if you are looking your phone it is even worse nd if you are looking at the e clder between you and the the two front seats that is even worse this is why staring out the front winshield is greape but you do not want to fixate ocase o hopfully i spared i feu people and hopfully if you cab drivers of having people get sick in their cars or ubers let your visual system and your vestibular system work together if appropriate get into linyour acceleration and you will improve your sense of balance once again wee covered a tremendous amount of information now how you her how you make sense of the sounds in your environment how those come ind your ears and how your brin process system in addition we talked about things low level white noise and even by noral beats which can be used to enhance certain brain states certain rhythms within the brain and even dopamin release in ways that allow you to learn better and we talked about the balance system and this incredible relationship between youar vestibular apparatus meaning the portions of your inner ear that are responsible for balance and your visual system and gravity and you can use those to enhance your learning as well as well as just to enhance your sense of balance if your learning

last week an went ou in the woods an oragan with his bird exbirt no stricker looking at birds every day he goes out for eastan hour often is thout more when trails round his house that he and his parents cur back when is a kin and ive never been birding i hav no idea how much a bird watching grap he just listening for the birds we set out in the morning mut still foggy already i can hear somg birds calling tow there is a spotted to he rong calling just behind me that was a california quail waking out did you get a little w that was the sound of a steller is jay imitating a red tailed hawk we the birds well enough you can tell when a bird is imitating another bird badly yes is not a real red tailed hawk steller's jays are just kind of bully's in general and they imitate red tailed hawk as far as i can tell just to tearorize at other little birds in the forest there is a word i do not know honestly whichs word about this is if no one can tell that it is not a red tail hawk and he is not even a bird cannot other birds tellmen for him if they can why would't stellar ja keep doing it cannot s o that question no one tells me about how tupe years ago he bought this powerful microphone a harabolic microphone the capture bird sounds from a great distance the first bird i ever aimed it at was hi steller's day sitting up on a branch he turned on his recorder fron't have fhounds and waited fort to make some noise and i realize it was sitting ut there with it is beat clothes singing a very quiet whisper song to itself that only itself could have possibly heard because it was quiet tha just blue my mind i have never listened to birds the same sense i think they do make noises just for their ownsake allot of the time bgoing a birding would know is going out with somebody who is insanely knowledgable about birds he is written five books about the behavior toward the world seeing six thousand of e near eleven thousand existing bird species in just one year and twenty fifteen he knows a lot he is also still completely excited about birds cankat enough he to mie the story he goes to antactica for months studying penguins some as he gives tours to visitors of the penguin colonies first he says they love it they go into the colony they see the baby penguins which are supercute and men day five or people get up in the morning in er where are we gingto go to day and you say we are going to a penguin colony and there is this look that i've learned to recognize it is i've just been at eight other penguin colonies in the past four days how as this one going to be any different but for me i have never felt that look in my whole life iave never got penguind out he happily goes back to the same colony wit the same woods around his house everythingle day now says this endless interesting birds began in sort of typical ways if with grade he first notice birds for reo when his teacher suctand copped of bird feeter to t e classrom window and he could stare at the birds through the glass just inchis away he staid reading the field guide looking for birds on his own doing to look a bird in cob everybody else te cod by the way was in ther sixty seventies and eighties he was twelve the one gid energetic birde no hy house or a person kno actre does have cond of a ne patro carisfibe but the thing he says that changed him from that kind have leisure time birder it somebody who organized his entire life around it happened because of turkey vultures one particular pack of them we were sixteen i saw this episode of a teety sho called the life of birds were david adenborouh goes into a trinidady and rain forest and he has this smelly old on piece of stake in his hand and thany burries the stake under the leaf litter on the florest floor in the rain forest iand then fast off and then they cut and then forty five minutes later is one this turkey vulture i comes sailing down through the canope of that forest you and flies unerringly right to the spot where the stake is and it digs it up to love the leeves aside man he gets the meat it seems almost unbelief when i saw that in the life of bird as iciclar iad just immediately had ones tot wa was i got a try this at home that is the best bird veety idea iave ever seen in my life seemed incredible to him it he might be would word these birds usually see from far away torkey bultures are shy hard to get near the might be ol to see them cose up he thought we dave it outonborough got one bird to show up wisome old piece of stake maybe he would improve hds it is ma with something bigger imagine how many turkey vultures tal attract with a dedeer there' many deer here in rural or again on the side of the highways in threeways i can now go out and find a road kill bring a whole carcass home and a see how many turkey vultures we can attract but it was cut hard to find a road kill as it turned out it took me a month to track one down nothe way t put that last sentence if yeu were in a sixteen year old very eager to see turkey vultures up close n only took a month to find a deer carcass noa restled the heavy blooded ghastius yellow jacket covered putred smelling deer ly into the trunk of his vlf as sitdown got home put the deer in a wheel barrow weeled it out to this very spot were we are standing in this pasture and dumped it it is right here were were standing this is the spot i chows this point in our a burdwalk we were standing with an eye shot of the house at yeur uan wrbut not too close the copasters overgrown that was for his white oaks around its ed o is asurkere i thought this would be a good spot because you can see it from the sky itd has multiple approach pabs from the air they will be as attracted as passible to this deer carcass iis dark he went to bed no idea of this little work gets up the next morning and there were turkey vultures everywhere they were sitting on these trees regd yer there wre vultures sitting on the roof of our house i ten of hem lined up on our roof there re vultures circling overhead they were probably thirty or forty turkey vultures hang it around the yard and when i look up and realies that this had happened i was happy i rushed out here and id set up a little camiflas tarp next to the deer carcas here was o the tarp was just cunit in this wet grass if i come of a year i was hunker down right about here s if i cannot get down i was sitting under a tarp with the hole in it in my camerlands sticking out hes maybe ten feet rom the deer he waited in and then finally it was magic the irst one came down and once one came down they all started just piling down it was not what he imagined tht was can be chaos wik a pack of lions ripping into his eebro down hat unfolded was very polite yetthey were just delicately walking around an standing on top of at and starting to pick at it gingerly it was not a brute force kind of thing at all and they were very well behaved i thought ther was almost a pecking order involve they knew which birds we are get to eat first and they adheere to it i soas very orderly it was an orderly seen of turkey vultures eating their breakfast where do they starte i thought i was call the softest parts of the deer that is where the turkey vultures would start sticking their heads into they did not i was expecting them to tear a big hole in the side and just go at it but that is not what happened at all they actuallyt started by pecking the eyes out i guess those of the softest part of the deer they went for the eyeballs and then they went in and very carefully ate the gums out of the deer around its teeth theyftr go vor the soft parts consideren a very strong feeling or beaks instead a turkey vhicher just cut it sticks its head up inside the body ittended bawl and red with no feathers etwhich is handy for sticking inside of carcasses and not getting your feathers all mest out the turkey vhochras next started eating around the wound on the deer's shoulder m where got hid on the highway took turns eating round there till they got begenough opening to get access to the chest and gots and everything else no i would go off in the mornings and do ten ast camp another kid stoff thengn back to his tart for hours and hours i do not know how many hours i spent out here that week but it was full afternoons pretty much every day all wek long i got to see the whole process at the beginning the deer carcass was relatively frash and then gradually it was stripped away and by day five or day six they were starting to disassembll the skeleton that was pretty much picked clean it was being drawn into another world that exists in this world that we are very seldom apart of being close to these birds that do not normally allow us to get thack close to them whais passing through some kind of force field or something and emerging on their side of the divide and feeling that n their world is not the same as ours no an it is existed for much longer than ours has i mean humanity is not that old turkey vultures hav been round for quite a lot longer than we have man and you stare into the eyeball of a turkey vulture and it blinks its third ilad that birds have that is just unsadiling they are strange strange animals they just have this weird very reptillion vide efore this of course are easeing lofts of birds but was checking them moff e list this one an that one that he red about the field guide he never just stered one group of birds for long and watched how they related to each other bu what they did turkey vulturs are what i would call a spark bird for a birder a spark bird is the one you see usually in some kind of unexpected situation tit grabs you in a way that you have not been grabbed before by birds and turns you on to a wave

carmen have sentury later it is probly hive to say he ad that part right coming out he rarest bird species in the world rare that only one family massachusetts has ever spotted them wn till right now even knows about them that is in a minute chcogabub a gradio wen our progam continues tismercan life from my rat last day show spark bird during this week when the tradition is together together at a table around a bird we have stories of spark birds the birds said get it all started for somebody that make you see things differently and a you are just trining ain we began t our progamtidy with no a stricker who is the author of the thing with feathers and other books and bird behavior sobody who sparkbird was the turkey vulture and whatif our producers cally win or i spent hours trumping around the woods with him and crestwell oregon which was hours of actually doing the thing that tiday show us about learning to see things differently through birds and i just one of put you little more of this because much of what know it told us long the way was new to me in cloy wy princens knoer was telling us how the summer we one night he was home and youere this bird sound he never heard before i on't even knows oonow ani came running out here with my flash light as it was dark cause i'd no idea what it was intracted down and it was a fledgeling screech owl sitting on a branch and its just a had not learned to yet how to make the proper screech out noise yeh birds babble just human babies do scientists will call it sub song and have these other technical terms for it but istjus birds learning had a sound birds birds babble human babies do i did not know owlesly never think about the fact that it wive in the middle of a whole world of birds i do not notice om i do not hear them singing but o course knoa cannot stop himself from hearing them and instantly recognizing that that is a pacific rend that is a chestnot ta chickety or whatever and he does not just youare the bird sounds when he is walking around outside becoming an bird ar ruins holly would movies for you forever because whatever bird sounds are in the background in the sound tract whether theyre just natural or whether they dubbed them in even there never the birds that would be in the place that the movy has sat at the season that it set and and it drives me nuts anding how hard i it it be to put the proper bird sounds in there wi qout to movyou that this happened to yoan well just yesterday i saw the movy spencer the new lady die movy they had red winge blackbirds in the background this is sppose to be what europe in th oucase somewhere red wing blackbirds do not live in europe that is a whole clontin in away from where they would actually live they had stellers jays in the background and all kinds in north american species obviously this move you is silmed by north americans who ere dubbing in north american birds into a completely wrong background and just the lengs to which they go to get all the historical deetails in period pieces ac your head at you sheep it the headlight that no one is ever get a know honestly when you wanch the movy and yet the bird sounds are all over the map and there are many birders out there me who know what they are listening to that is not unusual this i guess would be the downside if having a bird if wen rize to something about the world the most po ont notice itwould me or to fixus know says therr arcises wit most bird sounds maybe soundet itors knowi would love to hook you out job my mine he says the cous problem is word does not care about birders how ie would knows that thel continue to show up wit their factur we an accurate movies and stream their error ridden tell of ison shows caus resting n to go when they need to watch somethng its indoors an not wild alive and feathered that too a scrub is a bird there cannot get no wove from me we now i'm traing to a spackbird that strutded a pludical fite a fight that is lastit for a very long time conserning one states official state bird be mada won me tells the tale the thing about an official state bird is that it just really does not matter i say that with no intended disrespect to bird as across the nation some of my best friends a birdars but think about it on was the last time you sat down and truly considered the cisertelled fly catcher who is the avian embodiment of the state of oclahomer exactly it is absurd it state bird has nothing to do with the states g d p for example it does not tell us how happy the children are it makes no one's life materially better or worse and yet in florida the debate about which flying animal deserves the tital of official state bird has been on going for more than two decates the state bird means nothing but somehow in florida it is come to me in a hellof a lots florida was actually one of the firt states to designate a state bird back in nineteen twenty seven it was plobably a simple choice the northern mocking bird is a good bird as birds go it likes the saying it has an incredible talent for mimicry and with its gray coloring it is cute here is the thing bir the northern mocking bird is the official bird of another four states besides floridar its actually the third most popular state brd behind the northern cardinal and the western meadow lark after seventy two years some people that had enough of this spreadstin stae bird enter the spark bird of the story the scrubja the floride scrubjay is the only brd on the planet that is found only in floridar it is a sturdy looking bird with tae dull blue head and wings it is un clare exactly wy the late republican rep howwoard futch was such a champion for the scrubjay but in nineteen ninety nine he cosponsito bill for it to become the state bird maybe it was the fact that futch represented bravad county which used to have the highest number of scrubjays in the state but i think he just likes the bird iss he put it it is got good family values it is kind and it is a bird that likes people scrubjayes do something called cooperative breeding which means that each nest has an adalt pair but it also has helpers usually the older siblings of the new e sjay babies who help feed the young and defenterajry very different in fudghis opinion from the mocking bird the mocking bird a lot of people love that sucker he said but it is pretty mean pch there is nothing human beings cannot make about themselves even birds and the fight over the florid e state bird very quickly became loaded with familiar political tropes on the side of the state as quor the side of the incumbent mocking bird was one a florida's most famous senias marrian hammer hamer is a long time lobbius with the national rifle association and the architect of florida stand your ground law and she is no fan of the florid a scrubjay in her committee testimony hammer dismissed the bird as a thieving scrounger in the strongest possible terms they eat the eggs of other birds she said that is robbery and murdar and in response to the scrubjays alleged friendliness exemplified by the wade eats outi human's hands she had a rebuttle begging for food is not sweet it is lazy and it is a welfarementality the response from the other side was just as harsh democrat rap mark pafferd called the mocking bird and obnoxious plagerizing and promiscuous b ully state rep furch and the scrub a had the audiban society on their side and they also had a chunk of floridar citizens school children thousands of them sined a petition in support of the scrubjhay hamme had a hunch about who was behind these passionate school children she suggested they had been influente by environmentalists trying to secure extra protections for the scrubjay it is adults hiding behind impressionable children she said if they get ed on the endangered list you can kiss your property rides good bye this had begun as an argument about something that means nothing but now it had become an argument about the biggest things it would have been neater if the camps were strictly a republican versus democrat but bird choice in party offiliation did not always aline the choice o state bird became a proxy referendom about what traits floridians should find admirable depending on which side you were on the mocking bird was either a standin for rugged talented individualism or it was a raucous bully and the scrubjay seem through one lends as nurturing family values and sweet enough to palaround with humans somehow also became the poster child for ae reliance on big government and its handouts here is where it is now in the twenty twenty two legisletive session there will be three new bills from democrats and republicans alike to changed the state bird by the way there are other candidates besides the scrubjhay every previous bill has died in committee it always dising committee but hope die last is recently is last months hammer was defending the mocking bird and making the scrub jays sound phantoms from a ninety crime bill calling them evil little birds that rober the nests of other birds and eat their eggs and kill their babies one might call that street gang behavior in the avian community uirr r and very familiar with irrational and hypobolic debates about regional forner in my own home country the uka we are not abub turning benine animal behavior into weird politicking here as long been a piar battle waged between the indigenous and endangered red squirrel by some accounts an noble and scrappy creature and the gray squirrel a larger in vasive american interloper who has ideas well above its station it has brought forth every tipe of nativest narrative you can imagion in a debate in the house of lords in two thousand six lady salton of avenethy likened the red suirrel too quiet well behaved people who do not makan nuisance or an exhibition of themselves or commit crimes and do not get themselves into the papers in the vulgar way gray squirrel to do one i was at university i swear i read tabloid stories that basically compared gray squirrels to american geis juring and after world war too over fed over sext and over here since two thousand and eight prince charles has been the patron of the red squirrel survival trust in twenty seventeen the prince backs of government plan te sterilize gray squirrels using the teller as bate that is a step beyond what floridians are doing they have yet to webonize any spreads or condiments in their fight to choose the state bird the state bird whose anointment will make no one's life worse or better thbe mat of wen ma there is no bird in respects only one the crorel t om a dring we need talk about bird way get just what i say word about what i find interesting about this next story i'm i think every couple there are the things that you share and talk about with each other and you no then other thng you do not shor much but each couple has o kind of invent or discover the territory of stuff that they have not commen and where they meet up and the more stuff in the terri tory proby the better caus the more chigas yo have do connective for closean all that the couple in this story they had their stuff they were you do not even raising kids together with otb is a huge thing that but as the kid's got order the couple invented this whole other original common ground for themselves also this birds shon call explains before i get into what the stories about i just want to say that the couple in question peter and his wife matty are normal people they must be mat i i grats s year o tan theyeter howein northhand in massachusetts is normal its of age four bedrooms upstairs on for each kid peter and matty crammed themselves into the attic for a long time there are blended family peter came to the marriage with two sons matty has a son and a daughter all of them are ground doing well now 's just the parents at home acen smaty works is a lawyer recentlly one o big case through the innocentes project i do trial work and i do a pallawor i aw peter is a professional musician nust towards europe playing bock arrangements on a special guitar he designed you'l i been an artisstall my life really al why think om really grateful for that and it is for more than ten years now a sizible number of their conversations with each other concern a family of imaginary birds with whom they live six birds who do not exist and yet each have names and disting t personalities successes an failures most of them have corresponning stuffed animals associated with them peter and matty might spend more time talking about these birds than about anything in reality the birds lives resemble those of great school children they attend bird academy right there on the bird bus and they'r kind of little menaces always accidentally spilling things on themselves and throwing parties of the house when peter and maty were away yet they somehow also meddled in the olympics and recorted to grammya word winning record here is matti it is odd i mean i know it is ot apon reflection because it is this is noteen story li now it is every day and it is woven all through the day and for example if i was doing something at work lect a difficult meeting with e cliand a a jailor something then afterwards when i would call peter to say i'm on my way home or whatever then he would say how howar the birds how did they do and then i would say terrible usually usually the birds do terribly the birds had a tanthum in the car with my collagu the birds were rude to the investigator that is sort of howit a rise is a lot is asking how the birds managed what we were managing sort of when peter went up to mame to visit a sonchester ho just fixed up an old boat that he was sailing and living on which peter's really proud of him for having accomplished and a of course wone i'm on the phome with matty callin her from up there it slike well the birds thereally the boat the boat is really small it is really they thought it was get you the boat on succession on the tevisho succession h tie yacht which by the way is not how peter felt about the boat the views and opinions of the birds do not necessarily reflect to those of peter and matty sometimes they do but it is not that simple it is more their this messy greek chorus that always has to be accounted for in factored into almost every experience it is a very elaborate running joke they seeing what each others can at come up with next poke fun at each other vee of the birds pushin pull and go no the birds do not do that the birds throug this you kno there wule talking about you now the birds hateskating it is we wut ot birds o ice the birds havan annual o than cogbirit fassed which is always cancold at the last minute at the last minute it will turn out they did not really have a perminute they had not really spoken to be on face mna jar the throwing out ideas and coming to a consensis is a lot of how they built the bird world for instance the birds are raly ing to milkshakes their birdmobiles ere outfitted with special shake machines but they fidtle law suit against shakeshek after one of them got his head feathers caught in a ceiling fan which is really ashame because the birds loveshakeshi they are not beend from shakesha not ben but t must have soured them on the whole shakeshak experience i i do not think mony they got a tonomoney and they still can get shakesthere ye it is important to say too this is the first time peter and mattiy have ever talked about the birds in front of any one nott other than their kids and peter's therapist once or twice in passing they have never mentioned the birds to a single soul until now it is just too out there they told me and too hard to explain which means this is also the first time they have had to answer any questions about the birds they have never examined any of this even in private when i asked them something why they do it or what they get out of it they really had to puzzle together those answers in real time as thiy sat with them i'm not trit to ye i'm not try to sell you don'n't say i'm just reporting it that it is happening here and the whole thing with the birds it is not just frivolous it is actually been helpful in the family in some ways un hurtful too which i'll get to but just to say o it began the birds first entered their lives about a dozen years ago when matty's daughter peter's stepdaughter eva but matty a little stuffed tway monster technically it was something called an ugly doll but to matty it looked a bird eva was only about twelve years old at the time and i do think it was the first thing that she had ever bout for me it was a very sweet geft and i just leved at much and then i gave it this felly name birdly birdly was the spark bird the bird that sparked the capital bee birds mattiy started bringing birdly everywhere birdley wrote in the car with her she took him on vacation peter would idly toss him to the other side of the bed and matty would be hay careful and this had not dawned on matti until we talked about it but this was a round the same time that her custody arrangement with her ex husband was changing used to be the kids would ever be away from her for more than three days at a time but then they switchd to one week on one week off and in the beginning the week that i did not have them fout an at turnity i could not is a challenge i think it was fair and i think it was the right thing to do but that was the period that i was misthing my children i think that ma hav been why tat supera toched even to the bird that she gave me and very quickly birdley grew personality of his own tadventureus irresponsible mattiavellian he' take our creticards in peter and mattie's names aneglect to filis taxes for five years but matty would dote on him none the less at first i found birdly really annoy she just got exaggerated about how precious he was and how and i would just fee o k at please and then somewhere i crossed some line and moved over into a well he does not you he did not do a thing to hel do the dishes sir something you kow ik participating it it and then it she would be what he had to work on his presentation for school tomorrows we the psychologist and marriage expert john gotim and talks about how couples ere always sending each other these little requests for attention subtle wo would you look at that sunset sometimes the other partner to shrugs but in some couples the more contented ones the partner responds enthusiastically ah whow yet it is beautiful think the birds are a request that sometimes the birds will even swoop in and help them communicates something that is difficult to express this one time he is fine now but peter was deathly ill yet abacterial infection in his spine and they were driving back from a doctor's appointment where they would got in some bad news the wood in the car was dir and after saying nothing for a long time peter goes oh we have to stop at them all the birds want to go to them all i mean what els ie gan a say rii remembered as the best way for me to say something do not worry about me i mean you ki you cannot tell her not to worry but but you can talk about the birds what about the birds they wont wont of them all o and then her's the way in which the birds have not been great for the family again theyr four kids and they each had somewhat different responses to bird world the oldest torston thought it was kind of funny and he left for college anyway not long after it started hank was indifferent except that it as some kind of code that is parent she is to communicate chester the very youngest of the for thought it was annoying and not funny and then there was eva who again gave matty her mother the doll in the first place and who was the most agrieved ol i was devenly jealous this is eva she is twenty five now i was jealous of birdly i do not ko if i felt forgottin but i was dovenly jealous now as the youngest of matty's two kids eva was used to being the baby doted on showered with affection and suddenly she had to bear witness to this overwhelming overweening guyser of praise and attention her mom gave birdly and the other birds the theme that bothers me the most is if you say something about your life and then the birds have their own thing about their life it would be if you gots and a the birds either got in applus plas or they got in f miness but momm is still somehow more interested in their af miness that she is in your ay which jempser was not true but that is just how it felt at the time tats really when the intense dislike of perfectly began to filt and builled and builled and builled until sometimes at exploded i do not think i was clear enough that i was not kitting when i am saying that the birds thing bothers me i'm not playing along with the bird universe where nobody likes the birds and their sticky and annoying and they are failing out of classes and their teachers are reporting them i really really do not it i could not say that or i was not saying it right think that it was it always felt it was playing along until i had a tam dram and i would screem mat her that they are not real which a think did hurt her feelings and looking back on it now eva says her mother was giving her an appropriate amount of attention affection praise all of that but back then she really felt she was in competition for it and after all the birds did not deserve it because them not existing in all anyway for the first couple of years who was just birdly just the one bird and then this one fateful day eva took action i'd had enough and i stole him nd i hid him between the box spring and the mattress of the bed that i slept on am and i forgot that i did that i honest to goodness for got thati had done that i felt panic i tord the house o par i mean i felt the penic that you fe if you havin in dor ou dar cat and they do not come ho mat ni i was disappointed in myself that i had you nowt carelessly lost tim which of course in eva's mind confirmed all of her fears that mattie loved birdly more o got even more jealous and then finally peter went out and bought another birdly exactly the same doll same collor wholl thing but instead of telling mattie here honey i know how much he mist that doll i bought you another one he claimed to have found the original birdly which was just more wilful suspension of disbelieve of course birdly is not some one you can just go out and purchase at a store any old time he is unique a bird in a million and thit was good enough for mattie felt a lot better but then come a months after that mattie's doing a really thorough cleaning of the house is inner daughter eva's room turns the mattress over yeu can see where this is going she comes to me and she is look what i found and i was that is that is youre right that is birdly and that is because all this while his twin sister has been pretending to be him to make you feel better while he was he had to go out into the world and is twen sister being the newer more plant cleaner one richt ba who had an amazing this for him it is out of what is twelfteh night or's something it is dislike some i controud of that o although i'm also he bewildered by it and she just loved that that is how birdle dat was bon bird ledett birdley's twin and soon all the other birds joind the flock to one of peter's sons gave matty adoll she called doctor bodly he looks a little a robot and that he is a bird and a doktac he is received the no bout prize for medicin for having cured spacethrash eva gave me the insideer schoop on doctor bodley he is also missang i think that i hit him and i do not know where is garrently missing he is been missing for years but if yasmam she will tell you he is on sedatical next came hobiletta wer hoobsy she is an owl ten there is panguena a penguin studying to be a bird mobile mechanic he is in the car aand we is him as a lombar pillow and finally there is wing who he is not embodied no physical incorporation whatsoever stuffed or otherwise at this point eva's original goal to disappear birdley that matte would not pay much attention to him could not have back fired more badly her parents conversations now involved exactly five hundred per cent more birds than there had been and to make matters worse her older brother torstin when he was home would occasionally get into the act egging their mother on to keep telling bird stories and again hit was it there is no malice there they thought it was just to saye as any other teasing that we as a family did all the time but i felt replaced t and there is there is no way that that could have been addressed cas whate us just even say after having yolt yelled at tan i know the birds are fake i hate you i hate you in your fik birds they are not real there is stuffed animals to then be but also i do feel ther real and you are hurting my feel i as e feel real they are rea yo are rel i mean what is real other than what everyone around you says it is real right i mean there' no if everybody around you is talking about them a and they are having significant sochal emotional psychological an pact on your life i do not see what is realer than that eva says she is still not of fan of the birds these days but in the last couple years she is finally reached a little equanimity with them the lots changed she is older as a good job not living at home any more his helpe plush she is unpacked a lot of personal stuff than made her especially hyper senseitive and in secure as a tea nature sheleven ask her mon from time to time how the birds are doing just as a way of connecting with her she read me this taxed conversation she had had with mattie a couple of days before our interview something about the birds needing an attachment in their birdmobiles to hold the dipping sauce for their french rise i said birds need that there is ranch all over the bird mo beall te steering callam can barely turn it is giy with honey musterd and then she said exactly honey musterd is the worst things that attracts fruitflies i said yes the gearshift is all sweet and soured up also ranchesterian it it is a total nightmare that was a totally normal birg oursegen totally entertaining totally fine i started it and mattie's met eva partway too sheven apologized for filling the house with much birdliness especially when she learned through this story amazingly that eva actively stoleand hid birdly way back when i had planne to ask matti about that thing evasaid earlier about the birds being quoten quote real son my list of questions but before even got to it she actually brought it up first told me she had been worried i was going to propose the ordey real question youn ave sought here i am thats i gens in amazing that i'm ean defencelayer and then i'm asking myself the question i did not want to be asked but i mean i'm right i'm putting it o ther i i cannot say that they are not real to me i cannot sheft offa that i will not sheft off ta is what would happen if you do i mean what would happen think we be a huge loss i think it would be a huge loss the kind of lost you might feel when you have to stop playing your favorite sport as your body cannot hack it any more wor maybe the lost you feel when you finish watching all five seasons of your favorite show except way way more because this is their show they created it and constantly up dated and it is been going on since ther real children were in middle school it gives them some of that feeling of being parents i think except without any of the worries and without having to watch the birds

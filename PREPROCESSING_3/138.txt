com slash men well the trump phenomenon has been puzzling people ever since donald trum poped onsto the political sceene and started making waves and drew enormous amounts of support from members of the conservative bates from people who are high school graduates in ohio for people who are college graduates in florta where was trumps support base coming from and the left was utterly puzzled by this after all donal trump was not historically socially conservative donald trump was not somebody whos historically even early a re publican donal trump was merely a major cultural figure who did not seem to sneer at those people unsi ever sincs people onal left m in trying to figure up why is his brands durble why is it that many people feel connected to donald trumpen is particularly true because donald from continues to pole extremely highly among republicans do spite the fact that his shot at beating trobidon is probably weaker than that of othe republicans despite the fact that h's facing down a bevy of indictments now all all that happens to be true trumpright now is vulnerable mainly in the early states the primaries are not it over if you look at the early states iwat in particular donal trump's leeden iwa is twenty four points as opposed to thirty seven points nationally sthat is a a pretty significants differents and rondo santis is in second place with twenty per cent for ss trumps forty four in iwatim scot earning nine per centage points rom ma suammy at five hayly at four pence at three et cetera hi there are some vulnorabilities there but the pulling stats on foreample the indictments surrounding donal trump show a disconnect between what conservatives think therest ofthe country things and what the rest ofthe country actually thanks conservatives think that people are going to immediately react to news of the spurious trump inditemen in washington be see with the sort of rage that they feel that that we feel the people ma believe that donald trump is in fact being unfairly targeted by legal inforcemen while hunter bidon is being let off the hookan that he is that this is really happening because of course he is the front runner for the republican nomination and because denmocrats hate the guy and also because demacrats would to see him elevated to the nomination and we tend to believe ok ka wup now if donald trump is the nomine many people in the middle will rescinate to that argumen that he is being treated on fairly therefore he should be elevated to the nations highest office but that is not actually what the poles show when you look at holl voters see the indictments what you see is that on the twenty twenty election dictmen fifty two per cent tof voters a prove of the federal indictment the same number on the clasfi documents tondictment which suggest that it is really not about the topic or even about the legal case agains donald trump basically fifty two per cent o voters want to see donald trump in the dog that is realy wha that comes down to which is a sheer majority because the classified documents case is a much stronger case legally than the twenty twenty election indictment case now among independente there actually is a differents this is what is kind of interesting among independente fifty nine per cent say that they approve of donald trump being insited on the on the twenty twenty election for stuff only forty nine percent hat they prove on the classified documents stuff which is again fascinating you wuld think that would be the reverse because again the classified document cases much stronger legally speaking than the election stuff from twenty twenty all it really shosen that independence really do not donald trump talking about the twenty twenty election tey really do not what he did in the afterm aft of e twenty twenty lection they really do not january sex get but there remains this massive disconnect between the conservative bates and independence and the rest of the contry with regard to presinen trump and this raises questions why is it that many ur publicans are really really behind trump in deep and abiding ways and and the answer is that it has less to do with donald trump than it has to do three action to leftest eletes that really is the and that is always been the answer i've said since the begining ofthe trumphenomina the dot donal trump has always represented two conservatives and to traditionalists a giant pulsating middle finger a orange middle finger directed at the entire left wing apparatus that is what he is ret the single bestimation of the trump phenomenon is and get ready heritably buttan trump because you right that has always been the appeal of donal trump thows the apiale donal trump in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen as the peal donald trump and twenty twenty tan i's even more the appeal of donal trump in twenty twenty three twenty twenty four you do not get to tell us what to do is sort of the generalized mood with regard to presen trump to the question is where does that mood come frum where where is it come from and the answer is it is direct reaction to a liberal eletes who have decided that their values are more important than your values wi've decided that their priorities are more important than your priorities and franklly it comes from a a group of people who could theoretically be called valus traters gets up to understand what exactly is going on here yet yesord have to think of the framework of history brawled broadred a carl mark's famously says the beginning of the comus manifesto along with angles e he says the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class truggle and this is wrong now that phrase has shaped neur leap every fury about politics in the modern era everybody ranging from francis fucleama to the marks is theorious of the early twenty century is shaped by the idea that everything isabout class today's politicions left andright burney sanders and on the right people tunker carlson very often tend to conflates issues tat are values laden with issues that are economic laden to the idea is that def regotten man is actuall the person is being left behind by the new maritocracy by the economy that that everythigisabout class conflict and if only we could re distribute if only we could subsize we could do all of that we could create solidarity again all we oud have to do is change the economic systems by which we live and this would magically fix everything but it is not true the history of existing society for all of human hastory has not actually been about class conflict in fact virtually know conflicts in the history of humanity have been fought purely over class this what world were one did to the markest idea world ware one completely defeated the markest idea the marks idea in worldler one is that there would be europe wide a class revolution to end world were one in fact the the home of mark's revolution was not supposed to be in russha which basically had no classes it had a group of a few eleates and then it had a giant giant proletariat basily farmers serfs people whoere very poor itewasn's most apening poor countries if you look at carl marks's witings who supposed to happen in great britan if supposed to happen in richer countries where the eccesses of capitalism would eventually cause much income into quolity and wealth in a quality that lower classes would rebel against upper classes and thus when world were one broke out markes were utterly befuddle because instead of the conflict breaking out between lower classes niddle classes an upper classes the conflict insteadbroke out between nationalities an broke out over borders and germans who re very poor cided with germans were very rich to fight british people where very poor and brih people were very rich and it did not cross polonate a cross class marks was wrong world wre one proved him wrong but his idea continues to be the motivating factor in nearly all thinking politically still which is the idea that economic circumstances determined class solidarity which in turn determins politics and i's not true the real answer to the driving force behind history is in fact community community communiy of interest if we are going to rephrase marks what wou'd come up with is the history of all hitherto existing societies the history of communitye struggles struggles between creedal communityes wreligious communities if people who have a common interest because they live together because they share certain values that is the real struggle that is taking place in america and that is the real reason that donal trump is a representer of a particular class is not a representative of the lower classes donal trump becuse there are bunch people me make a lot of money who would support donal trump against dobidon and did in twenty twenty there are bunch of people wo are middle class car supporting donal trump against jobidon and thereare bunch people who are lower class ho are supporting donal trump against gobidan despite the redistributionist promises ofe demacrass what is that about that is not about economic circumstance is not about pure redistributionism it is not about class struggle it is about communitye struggle et to what that means in just one second first what is talk about how you protect your asset base here is the reality as the united states continues to down grade the value of zon economy as you have places fitch downgrating america's tat america's currency could be in danger in the future its just that' semple we have already inflated our currency tere will be deflation there will be inflation therewill be speculation in th markets one way to protect yourself

which is a description of how society works which is a description of of what what are the sor of cleavage points the points at which american separate from one another and where do you in wordoid's plenty of to explaim where americans unify we do not unify round class middle class people in california do not necssarily agrith midle cluss people in florida poor people in missippi do not nesarily agree with poor people in new york rich people in nebraska do not necssarily agree with rich people in chicago such really not about class it really isabout communities of interests historically that has often men religious community f you'r talking about historic wars basically from the down of time until the piece of lesfailua virtually all war was religious to nature then afterward it turned in to nationalistic war and now we are sort of back to religious war as it turns out wars are very rarely fought on the basis of pure economic ideals alone and if it is an economic ideal is not because in economic ideals because it is religion marxism has effectively decome a religion thee communism was tay religion with a great sainted leader at the top who must be worships it thu the real cleavage in american society right now is not in economic clevage persay it is a values cleavage itis a community cleavage ay it is a cleavage between people who have more traditionalist vallues with regard to the united states and people who do not and that has led to a class conflict as people who are high in come erners have escentially left behind their church and their community of interest and have formed a new community of interest with other people who earn s we are now transmuting what were values conflicts into class conflicts which is wear because again if you ecually go over to sylican valley widely perceived ats as a left is top at nino hunds of people in silican vallay talk them regularly the yu should go over to sylican valley in you talk to the heads of social media companies the same people wher promoting adversity equity in clusion invironmental social gomnants those same exact people in their own homes they are practicing conservatives those same people are married admared for twenty years they have kids they do not let their kids play with the with the social media aps that they themselves create the values they actually live out in their daily lives are fairly conservative this appoint that charles murry makes in coming apart all the same people wor preachion liberal monsen s directed at the very poorest and society who they see as essentially plan things of the gods the gods being themselves those very san people live values that are much more consistent with conservative middle class americans traditionalist americans and i it sort of a fascinating phenomena to understand that youeft understand two separate ideas of what they call the forgotten man the forgotten man is a phrase that is used in politics all the time and who is the person at whom politics ought to be directed the forgotten man the person who is left behind who exactly is the forgotten man that phrase was made famous originally by franklindellino roosevelt back in nineteen thirty two and the forgotten man according to franklin dellino rosevelt was the gy who is poor and the gat whofis realy poor he is been forgotten by society and t's our job to make it up for him and the way to do that is to essentially redestribute all of america's resources with that guy in mind leave maritocracy behind leave the idea of performance behind the person at the bottom of thespectrum is the person we ougt to folkson an this is define democratic party policy for a very long time you con mind that on economic level with the idead liberal social policgot to prevail and that basically d finds that emcratiparty today according toe democrats the forgotten man is the poor guy who must be given money and then preach to about the virtues of transgenderism in social justise and then there is another concept of who the forgotten man is and that is the actual original concept of who the forgotten man is there is a yaluniversity professor named william graham sumner who is a clergyman and a and a classical liberal and he wrote a pece in eighteen seventy six about the forgotten man and here is what he says quot as soon as a observe something which seems to him wrong from which ex is suffering a talks it over with be and an be then proposed toget a lawpass to remedy the evil and help acts theire law always proposes to determine what se shall do for acts or in better case what ab ncy shall do for acts what i want to do is look up acts is look up se i want to show you what manner of man he is i call him the forgotten man perhaps the apellation is not strictly correct he is the man who is never thought of i call him the forgotten man he works he votes generally he prays but he always pays and to who is the forgotten man according summer that is the person who has the tradition al ines it is the person who goes to church the personung supports his community and the person who is targened by the people in the ilee class on a value's level because tey on't care about his values thereon't careabout that and he is always the person who they are taking from both in termis of values for themselves andthen attempting to destroy the values and institutions upon which he relies and here lso taken from economically in certain ways as well but it is really more about the values than it is even about the economic takings because the truth is in the united states the people the very top of the economic pect rom pay nearly all income taxit is not the middle class pangincome tax in the united states it is the rich people pangin come tax really what is this its not a class conflict it is a values conflict in which you have in yu lea group at the top whore promulgating a set of values that is absollutely destructive that they themselves do not live by to people in the middle class and people who are in in the lower economic classis that is not economic conflict that is in fact a community truggle as i say that is not part of the history of class conflict it is community struggle and this is what is under girting david brooksis column today it is a fascinating colum in the yor timestre's trying to grapple with the trum phenomenon he cannot quite escape the sort of marks is tinge to to all history being described by class conflict but he is start it is tartington dawn on him that perhaps a tax on traditional judao christian values are in fact the do finding feature of our politics right now and that when america is dividing it is not dividing along class lines it is dividin betwen people who believe the traditional judao christian values are good and people believe thet traditional judao cristian values are really really bad you wonder why culture wars our first and foremost in everybody's mind thecause the things that we actually careabout it is not actually predominantly our pocket book we all care about our pocket book that is not predominantly what we care about when it comes time to make our life long decitions about what mattrs tos it is values it is always values at will always be values at alluys been values economics determine what jobs we take they may determined where we live but it is values that determine how we live and that is the thing in the end that shu matters the most to us when you havean intire codray of he leat liberals who presumably do not even live their own values but our cramming down and iall turned ut set of values on all f america in the name of the quotincual marginalize when that happens there is going to be backlesh nat backlash is taking the form of trump not because trump is a great representative of jud tr traditional judao christian values but because when you are assaulted nough all you wan to to his throw the bird that is what trump is rget to that in just one second first let us talk about your sleep quality le may give you an example of sleep that is a problem last night eleven p m and o my baby son couple months old i's got cauf is got a cold that as is if you h've small babies that is atully camme can a dangerous cas baby's our obligat knows reathers that means that you have to be up all the time taken the s not out of his nos and a i a

per sents off all mattres orters pluss two free pillows for listeners it is their best offr yet hurry on over to he lik sleep do come slesh ben with he liks but ta sleep starts right now i'l cae all is to lead up to the david brook's colum which is making a rounds today called what if we are the bad guises here and here is what davebroks rihts quot thon trumps seems to get intidown a weekly basis it he is utterly dominating his republican rivels in the poles and he is tied with jobiding in the general election surveys trumps pall mumbers are stronger against bidin now than at any time in twenty twenty what is going on here why is thi sguystill politically viable after all he is done we anti trumpers off an telli storie to explain that it was encapsolated in a quote the university of north carolina political scientist mark hetherington gave to my colligue thomas etzil recently quote republican see a world changing around them un comfortably fast andthey want a slow down maybe in take a step backward but if yhoureperson of color a woman who values gendera quality or an el gi b te person would you want to go back to ineteen sixty three i doubt it in this story says david brooks we anti trumpers are the good guis the forces of progress and enlightenment the trumpers are reactionary bigots and authoritarians bmany republicans support trump no matter what according to the story becaue the end of the day he is still the bige in chief the embodiment of their resentments and that is what matters to the most i partly agree with this story says david brooks but it is also a monuments who leat self satisfaction let us be clear about this the se lead self satisfaction really took the fourth barokobama bere's a fascinating interview ofer its tablet magazin all about barockabama and his value system and all the things the media ignored about barockabama including the fact that he was a bleeding antisemite back in his college days novis but he is a member of te liberal elete who hated the values of the called bitter clingers and it became a a sort of cultural cashe to to rip on people who had traditional judao christian values with regard to to life davidbrook says let me try another story on him i ask you to try on of antage pointin which we anti trumpers are not the eternal good guis in fact we are the badguides and here is where david brooks somewhady's about says right and some of it is a conflation of sort of marksis theory with the actual history of humanity which is the story of community struggle quote this story begins in the nineteen sixties when high school grads had to go off to fight in vionom but the children of the educated class got college teferments e that that is true rity he' tryingadrovs is a class conflict that high school grads went to fight in vionom but the children of the educate class gat collge tover that that is certainly true however it is also true that the objections to theanon wore did not calm from the hight scolleghated class they came from the same college eletes who got the college teferments patriotic americans were willing to go fight ing vionom and they did and they died large numbers by the way dist proportionately white people ey saw all all the myths about how veonom was bunch poor black people were dying that the sisu not trueas eighty eight per cent of all casualties in vionom we are white people fifty per cent of all people who were serving in vionom were middle class it was not all kin of poor brown people as the as the platoon myth would sort of suggest virtually o a huge percentage slike eighty six percents of everybody who served invionom was actually volunteer not drafted but put all that aside what david brook is missing here is that vianom was a values conflict it was a community conflict between a bench of long haired hippy left wing ju gedo christian values rejecting eletes on college campisis who warn't even serving who objected to the war it was not all the people went to church o objected to the war those all people who dropped out at church and dropdascid who objected to the war that was the actual cultural break down that we now try to rewright into a history of class conflict he said i continues in the ineteen seventies when the authorities inposed bussing on working classaries of boston but not on the upskill communities wellasly where they themselves live that is one hundred per centrue they that part that he is hot the gan that is a communi tye's conflict right the idea here is that a bunch of liberal left wing eleads when lived in super white areas and ten post force bussing on a bunch of poor white people and poor black people that part is trupe that is on again of class conflict that is a community conflict because if those liberals it should believe ther own values they would be imposing it on themselves as well the ideal that were all in this toe other was replaced with the reality that the educated class lives in a world up here tand everybody else is forced into a world down there heis right about this but on a values levels i'll discuss more in just one second first is that darkspot on your face still buggingyu what bout the liverspots on your hands neck and chastwell you can walch those disappear safely and quickly in about three minutes introducing the genusell darspot

slash appueron ore that new dark spot treatmen system to day and get your genusell backs an puffinists im also included for seventy per cent off retail prices o case backso the davebrooks colum he says members of our class are always publicly speaking out for the marginalized but we somehows somehow we always und a building systems that serve ourselves this is again true but the reality is that it is not even tht they build systems that serve themselves it is that the systems that they themselves build are not intended for themselves on a value's levele david brooks has tha thing against the aritocracy and this is where i do not white the conflation between the marksist history of class struggle and the history of community struggle which is not the same it really is not in's i just to take a a quick example john j rockfeller used to go to church on the regular and ye've hungs of charity inside he is own church from the time he was very young it he was more in line with poor members of his church than who was in line with many members of his own social class this this is jst the reality ripping on maritocracy doesn'm solve the problem it is a marks is solution twa spiritual values problem rippit becaus here' ae thing what is the all turnt ive to maritocracy when i sey people both left in right ripping on the maritocracy meaning the people woare most maritorious get the job and right now in an information age that is going to benefit people who have more facility with in formation than other people but it is also turn construction where people who have more facility with machines are going to do better thn people who do not have facility with machines people what facilty with plumming are con do beter in that industry than people who do not hve facility with plumming theot what is they will turnivs no one has ever provided in all turnt ive to maritocracy that makes any sents on the economic leblem this is why i i really object to the crossing streams of promoting the maritocracy with promoting liberal left wing social valiess are not the same thing the best system is is system in which economically speaking maritocracy does obtain but also that is back by judao christian values of community wherein we all care about each other because we share a set of values that is the best form of the system david books however again infused by this sort of thorough going marks ist ideal and again he is not marks is but this is an ideal that is permeated pree much every area of social science the class struggle in all this nonsense he says the maritocracy is the problem he says the most im portant of these systems that the problems the modern maritocracy we built an entire social order that sorts an excludespeople on the basis of the quolity we possess most academic achievement how ly educated parents cots we lead schools marry each other work at highpang professional jobs and por enormous resources in to our children who get into the samee lead schols marry each other and pass their exclusive clat class privileges down from generation to generation he is conflating a bondial stuffiere credentialism is in debad you dofthave to go to college in ordr to make an amazing living in the united states and and lead a business at our business here at daily wire is led by a triumphrate it is me a harverd law school and ouselay grab tis jeremy boring i got who did not graduate from college and is cale robinson a person who did not even go to college that is our triumpherat the thing that we share is wore pretty god o business or all prte smart but a an't thecredential it is the performance when he says that this is a pathway that is unavailable t any one by the way i challenge hims look at the entire agien community in the united states which wildly out performs based on class data where they should be in terms of their kids by the ay how does he think that people become rich in this country he s assuming a self perpetuating a leat but let us be real about this again jerme dhe not gro up wealthy his kidwell caleb did not gro up luffy his kidswell i contrary to public opinion did not grup wealthy my kidswell for the record i grope insl i was leven years old ind a two bedroom eleven hundred squarefoot house in burbank california with six people sharing one bathroom i shure a bedroom with three younger systers until i was eleven yers polt loket has me nofs poore i was solidly meddale class but tht's solidly middle class not solidly upper class the point here is that again he is conflaning class struggle with the actual struggle here and he is missing the pointe here is the here is the part that where he is totally right however he says and when he gets beyond all this quote arms wot all kinds of economic cultural and political power we support policies that hlp ourselves free trade makes the products we buy cheaper an our jobs are unlikely to be moved to china agand he is he is missin up the economic share but here is the partwery gets to the part that actually matters all eleets we use language and morays as tools to recognize one another and exclude others using words problematic sischender latanacs and introsectional is a sure sin yofve got cultural capital coming out of your ears meanwhile members of the less educated classes have to walk on egshells becaue they never know when we have changed the usage rules s that something that was sayable five years going ot get to fired we also change the morl morms and ways that suit ourselves never mind the cost others for example here used to be enorm that discouraged people from having children oushigh mariage but that got washed away during our period of cultural dominants as we are roted norms that seems judge mental or they might inhibit individual freedoms after the social mormas roted if fonnything happened members of our class still overwhelmingly married and had children within wedlock people without our resource is un supported by social marms wer less able to do that as adrian wolridge points out in his magisterial two thousand twenty en book the aristocracy of talent quote sixty percent of births to women with only a high school certificate a cor out of wedlock compared with ten percent to women with the university degree that matters he continues because the rate of single parenting is the most significant predictor of social immobility in the country does this mean i think people in my class are vichious and evil know most of most of us are earnest kind and public spirited but wo take for granted and benefit from systems that have become oppressive yoeu lead institutions had become politically progressive in part because the people in them want to feel good about themselves as they take part in systems that exclude and rejact it is easy to understand why people in less educated classes would conclude they are under economic political cultural and moral assault and why they have ralliyed around trumpetas their best warrior against the educated class again it is not really about the educated class it is about a cultural class that has decided rit large that the morality of the forgotten man the person who actively holds together h community who provides the glue who provides the nationalism patriotism and allegiance to traditional judiocrisian values that undergrird any sense of social solidarity it is those people they are attacking it is that glue that they are disintegrating and those people by the way are living off the fat of the land becaue they are benefiting from all of those things theyare still living inside solid two parent households taking care of their kids and sending them to private schools that is the the the limising liberal the llibisin liberal is not in limiting liberal because he takes a literal limozine he is limiting liberal because he lives a set of values that he then rejacts rit large when you say a your church i want my kid to to get married go to church have children within wedlock and get a job when you say that and then the person who does virtually all of those things in san josey says none an now that is bigotry we ned to set up a system were if you do not get married you have cids out of wedlock you do not go t church in you do not gat jo we pay you then of course people in te middle argon a say what in the hell is going on what is wrong with y people if you do not talk about people there there is that there is phraseology an markses in the talkh about class traters class trators presumably are people in the working class who vote with the eletes people who vote for the maritocracy or who vote for capitalism even though theyre members the lower class this was the basis no the famous but by tomas frank in themiddle of the two thousands call what is the matter with cantas in which said why are there all these poor people in kansas who keep voting republican when they could be voting benefits to themselves and the answer of course was that not voting base on the benefits the're voting base on te values which mattare more to them than the actual government hand outs can but tat's how the left tens to thing the the reality is that we shouldnt be talk about class traters we should be talking about values traters peoplewho live a set of values and then promlgate a completely different set of values to other people who are two stupid and two poor to actually live those values the assumption is that everybody who is not living in san jose everybod hofs not living in upper crossmanhatton all those people are two stupid to actually live values that most of tese people themselves actually live and that is by the way why people who live traditionwhih uit ot cristian vallues they tend to have steriotypical beliefs about people living in sanjose andnew york they think that they are all in polygamis gav relation ships because they believe thet dusts s hat of values being promoted by san jose and man hatton when that actually is not with their actually living out and then people in sanjosan mahanleck wellvit why do they think all the stuff about us well maybe it is because you make the mark of virtue flying the pride progress flag from your house maybe it is that even while you are living in a heerosectual monogamis relationship with three children with the white pick offence maybe it is that thing may be the way that social solidarity was actually created and promulgated in the united states used to be rich people poor people in middle class people all went to church together theyll sen there gets to the same schools they all actually inster acted with one another and had very similar sets of values again johnje rock feller when to the same church as the poor janitor down the street but i've a question where is did youberally believe that is a jack dorsy or susan lash kicki or any of the bank leaders do you think those people are going to church with poor people or dyou think they are hanging out exclusively with people at their country club who are members of the same sosio economic liberal e leat the answer is the latter and that means tht they have cut themselves off from the same valusis an the used to actually create social solidarity o kand that is now being telescoped all that is being telescoped in trump because again the way that that virtually all poltics works is that even un consciously we all just look for symbols and the simbole right now of resistance to these liberal eleates wi've decided to make virtues signalling the most important thing among themselves tht is the thing the matters morn anything theyre two symbols to day that this happeningin it is a mazing to watch it happen one is resistance to trump therea the resistance trumps if astious that means everybody on the ricloss youknow it middle finger trump if that is want that is one reason for trumster ability another issuery can se thats absolutely clearly is not support for the warning crane the beginning of the warning crane heavy by partisan support for the warning crane heavy i mean look at the polling data republicans democrats an penes everybody supported the idea that you crane should be able to fend off russian invasion and then the minute that the left transmuted that into a values conflict about upholding quon quote liberal democrasy with pride progress flags in enormous number of people on the right went oh now we s what youre doing it is that all you the mini the minute that a conflict that was not actually a cultural values conflict was transmuted into a cultural values conflicts in which the same liberal elete who hate your church suddenly love you crane a bunch be wont note not interested it is that reactionary an understandable reactionary politics that is driving everythng right now the answer to all this would be a reengagement in social solidarity by the liberal elete but that ould require them to understand that they are quonnquot pursuit of justice for the marginalized is not about pursuit of justis from marghlize any more n has not been for ver ry very long tom what it is really about is a is a transgressive notion that if you destroy the center youave made the world th better place ilol get that the s cultural wore was not started by the right it was not even re motely started by the right you nowhow because the battlefield if the cultuor been started by the right would we be talk mbut wether boys can become girls and girls can become boys of course not that was not even considered a battle five years ago now to mass a battle when thits this true for every victory gained on the liberal lea battlefield and now it is all being as i sate telescoped into trump and if trump is the symbol of resistance then attacks on trump our seen as symbols of the regine tearing down trump which brings us to donal trump showing up in washington be s yesterday will get to that in

white all supporting tonnal trump tow'd be the reason in any case donal trump pled not guilty yesterday in a washington c court room i he he a pured in federal court there is no mug shot you every still assuming ther ill at some poin pea mong shot of trump in cort that probably will probablyes can t happen whn ye gets o rested in this george i case surrounding january six the cases i've ben describing is really really spurius politico describes what it was inside the courtroom i said if you blink you miss it for fleeting moment thursday donal trumpen special council jacksmith appeared to make i contact as the former presene on pre paredto fin of chargers that he sought subvert american democracy itself that shur grants crystallized that his storic waight of thurstdays arrainment the third an recent months for the form president whos fighting federal and local prosecutors even as he appears to be costing to the twenty twenty four g o p presidential nomination smith said nothing audible during his hour in the room but re peatedly shot plants to trump wl cantionally shot them back until their eyes briefly met teven before donal trump entered a federal courtmen to cleard himself not guilty the waght of history was evident in washington deceased federal court house minutes before trump entered the silent room several federal judge as files ins the public cavalry turning himselfes in to spectators in a building they typically rule after a day of anticipation the atmosphered darkin the moment smith strode into the wood panels shandaleer court room from a near by antechamber smith was flanked by assistant special councillor ray hulser and several f b i case agents as he made his way to the back of the courtrooms well moments later there was trump seated at a table at has not recent monts been occupied by some of the very people who storm the capital and are now paying a legal prise all that drahma ow the magical drawn at wup donal trump came out and 'm was yont combination of i would say stoic a blaza and i'm a little bit i would say puckish donal trump i actually post of this onstrue social considering the fact i had to flight to a filthy dirty falling a part an very unsafe washington to see today and that i was then arrested by my political opponent who is losing badly to me in the poles crooked jobidon it was a very good day i the honestly i why people lov him jin mittale finger pall sitting ti mital finger all the time it al finger all the time again donal trump twenty twenty four because fall you i here is a irizonal trump's actual verbal response thi gover mig iiai ery san ta ro a a a at e ooery san iin o isi tintia in ti e a ty te cay at loe e oi i tinie olete e ati tii at te pa ti la tee er an tin e s o li o ece haini tiii ereisi oe te e oi ti eaeopo hapin in o aii ti ee ii teperetaleatin bi re ano o e ene e poe i iery an latin bi by a lot oe an eate i ee i o ori ae i oe ca te is hapin in a thak of er ot i mean itit to be fair he is not in the poles leading jobidon by lot the last poles have them basidly deat even i'm but the point is taken it is obviously true that he is in fact being hit with a variety of chargers that no one in the democratic party would ever be hit with without a doubt i he at then added later on another show they' be very dangerous if he were jailed which of course is also true we have not seen in the united states a former presidents of the united states throne in jail is it is something that concerns you oof of the people making sure that they do not go out of they are right mind if something that happens because i know what i'm think he have could happen if that for example they do say jacksmas says o cay i'm going to put down trumpet jail thing is a very dangerous thing to even tuck about eae because we do have out tremendously e passionate group of tonters and i mean maybe maybe a hundred a hundred and fifty have never seen athing i can much more passion than they had in twenty twenty much more passion than they had in twenty sixteen may of course t left is taking this as the threat of violence trump himself is dowing revenge if he takes office in twenty twenty four he posted on truth social to that a facts ad look done my fault my political opponent in the democratic party crooked jrobidon has told is attorny general to charge the leading re publican nominy and from a president of te united states me with as many crimes as can be concocted said he his force to spend large amounts of time and money to defend himself the dems do not want a run against me or they would not be doing this on precident an weaponization of quoniqual justice but soon in twenty twenty four it will be our turn mago i'm now that is what this battle is going to come down nd of course a this is the language that is being spoken by a lot of the republican primary electorit because that has always been the language spoken by the republican primary elector the problem of course t at independence do not actually hear this call and is is the thing that i'm warning a lot of republicans lot conservatives lot of voters in tese primaries just because you feel and believe the thing does not mean that political in dependence and swing voters are going to feel the thing it does not youn get we if to get out of our own heads little bit i understand the thing i feel the thing myself i also understand that i'm not the only voter in the twenty twenty four election the donald trump cashere is is going to come down to in the end basically one issue with regard to this legal case the issue is going to be whether downal from actually believed that you lost the election if they can prove the donals from believed that he lost the election it will be fairly easy for them to convins a decy jury that donald trump was lying that was fraugell and all his now i do not think that the elements this crime are tit oure tailor made for this i think it is very difficult to see how this fits into a civil rightes violation or how thit fits into a fraud case ore yve ot fits into an obstruction case but at the very leaster can have to prove that he knowingly did all these things knowingly gets intwo donald fom's hat that is really what this is all about and this is what donnal frum's lawyer was saying yesterday hone of donalds from's lawyers her name was lena haba she said just because he was told thou lost the election does not mean that he believed you lost the election here sho was yesterday ther number a there is testimony of tere's a number of age toad have said that the presidnt was made aware that he lost the election and yet continued to the argue that that there was stolen from them how il you reconcile goes to thangs i think that everybodywo asn't made aware that he lost the election ta tat does not men that that was the only advice to is givet is that anybody understands what happens in the obal office there are numerous an nout of advicers than politicians tan lawyers not just one our too that our giving you advice an telling you what they beli e it is true he may not agree with mik penth he may not agree with one of his lawyers that that does not mean that there ware an other people advising him exactly the opposite case again thid there tanger out of contacts an ther suggesting that yea e he was told he was told we knew he was told that s a mean believed a thing that is very common phernonaltrump he is told los of things that he does not believe that meanwhile tycob who is a former trumpler he says that well if the actaly pursue to conspiracy knowingly then that is violation of law that is not free speech again they told him to come down to knowingly hereis hereis tycob he is been out insisting that their criminalizing speech a we are the simple counter that is a you you actually hin solitated further crime trou speech and be prosecuted for it just the son example a in the some of the reporting to day where yis tunty cre prano tells one of his ghas o wackl witness well that speech but that is a crime catewell that is true but you actuallywould have to have him do that which is not exactly what happene in this particular case what is can it happenin to see whell i mean it is at easy jury a pribe can be very bad for it for present in trump the real question is what that means for the twenty twenty four election and again ir mind everybody two things can be tru once to cmean unjust invictment they can' be going after trump unfairly and also trump may not be the best person to run for the republican party while facing invictments every other day from now until the election well independence look at him and squov already we have reached the end of to days showed back to our money with much more on bench bereau this is the benchbiro show

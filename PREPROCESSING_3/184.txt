a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeaped in todays up ta sort of the show if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our whibslike this american life dot o work kits con be confident abut what they know what they thnk they can do nd then they got tested what are producers on a baker talk somebody whose teste that is girl hethen hi ire a yat the person in the story her name molly and mollie ger up in an apartment complex aut tat a hustin lots of families an and the parents they worked a long hours some multl jobs which meant that this complex was really run by the kids they had total free rain and they did all sorts of things that you could only do if there were no dolts around ot what there is this forelane highway up behind the complex and the kids would go up to the highway and we would play leap frog across the highway this is molle and we would wait until a car came that way would to be kind of scarrier if we could see h headlights coming this is when we are are it nolse the time to leep frog oh mike god i know and then sometimes those lights would be aa police officer they would turn on their lights and turn around rail quick and start speeding toward us and this is when it was fun cause we are we are ditch an the cops right now af we would run and bock in to the complex and just spread out and hide whereever we could under cars in bushids in truck beds and a whatch through the cracks mollie loved hidin to hurner best for and ariel they come up with his reason to hide all the time they decide that they are spy detectives and it is their job to sort of spy on everyone in the complex and at the time their ten eleven and they are tiny too that these tiny girls they can fit everywhere they they would go into the laundery room and hide inside the machines with the door cracked they could eaves drop where they would hide in the laundry room trash cans which is disgusting but we did not care ther hiding in spying people all the tat of ya whit is funny abody is everywhere if you were a kid in this building you you never actually hathyyou think you had a moment of privacy and h you turn and you would hear them giggling yor they were there and there they are did the other kids in the complex lik know that you gas rspies yet yot because they always knew who was stalking them all this is going on for every year and then mollie and aril they leave the apartment complex one night to go to sleep over this is to thouts n five theyre twelve and thirteen and when they get back to the complex the next morning they see thi swarm of cops one of the other apartment kids immediately us rihte as we got out of the car ran up to us an us some one just got murdered and we are what and he was yon the cops ere looking for you because somebody said that you saw it and we are what you mean we just got home we were at sheridon's burthday party and he was the apartment below me somebody stobed somebody else and because the kids ne we knew everything they are yamolli and ariel nol they had to have seen it we did they actually see know they did not but the kids were just confident molling ariel they see everything kids are to scu talk to them thit is what happens and they hear these please are looking for them they ran up to the cop that they know officer cook cout s he lives in the building he was hauv and looking for yo all and we are ok yar friend told us but we just got back from her birthday party we were not even here and i's o cawell a'm youall stay away from the area were ok that is nok an a happon cause they think they can solve this yah if they think they consolt the murder wed howes kidsigan theare twelve and thirteen oke but you do not in order to solve this they are o ka what we need we need to know the facts they go back to the boy who told him about this in the first place and they are what happons and he is o case that thit happened right underneath my window and they are lat's go se we run up to daniel's house and we look down and to the fence bottom floor a partment court yard aria and we just see blood my god this is wel this is not a roomur this is not a joke ats creal there wi's a puddle blood were we have to help the cops obviously we need to be invalved in this because we are spy detectives we run back down to officer cook and we are what happened and et was a this woman stab her boy friend and he die and she throug the weapon and we do not know where it is they hear this and immediately theyr we are ging to find thess murder weapon and it is weird because i mean that is impossible how do you find a murder weapon but we just knew we were going to find us weapon this apartment compluxes our world we know every hiding spot because we have hid stuff there oh it is all coming together ather hided yah they either hidstuff there or they have hidden there themselves and and sa they go sit at the top of the stairs and they just start brain storming the're a right weare could this murder weapon be could it be in the ditge that runs behind the building could it be in the field at bact and then molly has this idea let us look on the carports why well think of it is you have something of your siplings and you are on hide it becaus you do not want them to have it well we woure to throw it up on of the carport because we know we knew there was no way they could get it once at's up there the carports there ten feet high an y part under them e and it is impossible to see the top of them from the ground but you can easily see it if you go to an upstairs apartmen ah an aeriel's apartment overlooks the carports that ar closest to the murder we run up arial stairs and her bedroom window looks to the back of the apartment where the carports are and we are looking on their carport and we see a knife and we are oll my god that is it that is the nife she used to kill er boy frit and when you first saw the knife rwe just shocked yah we were shocked cause we are there is no way we just salt this stuck quickly that is really quick ya quick i mean if you think about it police had been working on this for hours and this is the very first place that they looked we run down the stairs back toofficer cook and we are there is a knife on the carport above ariel's apartment and theyre what we are ya and the officers are okee i we will we will get to that in a minute kids and n y they do they come upstairs and wook at the window and to ther shock they see the murder weapon and then they send an officer out there with the latter to climb the carport and i remember the officer howd one of those thags for evidence and he picked it up and there was blood dried on it and he put it in the bag and they were great job girls and we are thanks ofre here y time ed eed us that is exactly the way the dialogue goes ine disiny d vrsion of the story what you are the girl for them t tis is his huge triumph i mean ever in the whole complex finds out that the girl sofis murderwe were excited we were proud of ourselves cause we did d likely proved we could do it when she got ald our mo wad tell thas story and when she did soo playt for last but then som mieg havpeen racently she was telling it to one of her coworkers also from taxas in their doing this thing re their swopping only in taxas stories and she gets to this one and i think it was more her reaction to it that made me realize oh that is not actually a funny story to tell that is a serious thing that happen to me i'm a child and i just saw a puddle of blood on the ground and found the real nive that killed this real human being it was being able to see that blood on the nice that is what stuck with her the most and also the they they sent people into clean out that puddle of blood with bleech an nothe as she can remember the smell of that and watching that the blood spread on for the pavement and where were my parents did we ever have a conversation about this do they even care how do you jus sove a murderer an there are no adults uround how do you leap frog across the highway i mean it does not it does not mean a hout about childhood but i would never follow any of the rules that they bollowed is parent of nevy tesy chicago its this american li on our glass to day on our programm we have stories of stuff that happens when the grown ups are not around ut they are there but you would not know it they stay fully on the sidelines leaving the kids figure things out on the round sometimes with incredible racilians and inventiveness and good level headed jedgman sometimes not say with us that one magically malicious this all strite pretty small but oa little kids left alone on he class room not even at long before it became a school wide city wide the asgo the the id said to make sense of wie sellivan tells ha story those really vivid early childhood memories the one's were even though they happen long ago you recall them more clearly than you remember most things for david quitos hi's happen when he was seven the second grate back an nineteen ninety three his pe teacher told their class for will not wat to movy to day and she know she rolled the av cart with the chiev in the v ce ar on it she popped in a blockbuster rental or whatever it was she press play she turn off the lights and walked away she made mention of the fact that she needed to go to the teachers lounge to make copies i do not know of what but she was just gone and we were just there ah te movy lapricon maybe are familiar that if you are not lapricon is in nineteen ninety three horror felm starring a young genifor annison srat at our it is about a lapricon who goes on a murderous rampage to try to hunt down his stolen poticals iis ti the ss e go odote n sitting there watching the moving and i remember immediately people being afraid and people being giddy with excitement at the same time we are her wars kids who urchas oh i've seen this my older brothers showed me this and its scary and everyone else is us i do not know about this it os david remembers think king what the hower as happenei ily sa ci oh i hated it it is terrifying i remember people crying and every one had this you halve to staying your seats and were going to obey because in adull polless to hereis en er things that happene in thi mot there seems of the leprichind biting ou her face also anear he snands people in tacous he snappd the neck of a body pelys officery then bik cat officers iye from his corus only co shat sat eye and to his own gown stout eyesocet its stupid aunts carry ti o and also language again these kidsare in second grade exheving yoursult and i remember especially in sceneser the lepicron was a tacking people that they were kids who were holding their eyes to their deskere doing the heads up seven up when you put your head down and they were kids who were had their hands over their earss this is near howorin kids remember the kecher saying you shud tod the moving onds o get every on in the holiday spirit wit is worked for some kids david soys some of them were in and not's whet i got complicated because the kids who were putting their heads down of their desks and covering their ears were were being ridiculed by the bully kids because why are you scared white why you scared of this this is not scarry this is funny su why i guess i should also point out i went to a school i was entirely mexican american as i was the onl reason i say that is because in mexican american culture f there is this culture ol pressure till be tough particularly in his neighbor had david sat sout of that the place he relafts ti pasicwy all nexican a'll wish o lass oll side a reputation for being kind of a tauf parto town and oftentimes insesses were siblings ore helping to raise one another i've seen some things am there was a number of kids in the class whowere walking to school by themselves at six years old or seven years old and we had some rough asked kids and those rough asked kids had way differ perspectives than the kids whose parents tried to ke scary things away from them and half the class was enjoying the horror moving and half the class was terrified and crying at some point the teacher came back into the room saw that people were visibly crying saw the people were crying and were visibly upset and then admonish the kids for crying she said why aull crying this a holiday movy and i was just all right ah beg to differ bt and then wich just yoll yollin to toughan up that kind of thing and then she said ok well if you do not want to watch it i do not want to teach and you can sit outside and sitting out side was not it was sitting on the steps and they were the outside main entrance eps to the school his teacher dinno on it speak to me in thi story david and about half a dozen this class meats walked outside stine we were sitting on the steps and noone lass talking no mo saying anything and yo trying to comfort each other or anything that and we are all suffering independy next to each other wowhen school was finally over david's dant picked him up usual i told it te the thing happened at school ye saw something she was concern because i could not even get the words at i was just scared to talk about i guess which was really unlike him david was a totty hype reverbal kid the smart hattin class when he was suddenly unable to talk she and david's mob knew something was wrong but they did not get why he was freeking out bad about some move about lepercons and my older cousins came home i would jus no that is a horror movy noh they they could not have shown that to the kids there is no justification for that david's cousins ike a lot of older cousins for cind of that weird mix between body gards and tormentors this is our nerd no one messes with him but us david's mam hovet that says that after the movy david could not sleep alone for weeks he would not did not want to take a shower behind a close curtain i had to sittin a bat an with him cause he was old enough to shower and by himself but i had to sittin there hade the curtains in my old ben his say im here son go ahead especially when i had to wash his hair in his face when he washed it if he closed his eyes i had to make sure i hailed his hand david felt any time his eyes were close he might open then and findad deamon lep recon attacking him hoby thid told me that after the movy there is a way that fear just kind of wormed its way into the rest of david's life tit oa the grocery store wholl be to tilme he was afraid to go down the hallowing aisle did not seeing the mask s ar anything coss to me hoby tabout im abat man night liy he never been afraid of the dark before a lot of people have a movy this fhen yeur akid the movy you see way too young after which you kind of cannot get your life bat sometimes is the exersister something or i heard from some one who could never recover after seeing a documentary about assid rain and second grat science class for me it was the piano a period drama with holly hunter about frontiers men new zealand and eighteen hundreds strait at ar for moments of quote extremely graphics actuality also a guy chops off his wife's finger with an axe ut i will never not remember saw one was ten i do not know why it idn't turn it off for what is worth i'm also letthing out toughness was a point of bride and my family to but the big difference between david and me is that i saw that movy and it was over it did not talk about it it did everything i could to shut it out that was not possible for david because in david's case over two hundred kids in his school went through this manditory horrid together all at once four teacher is played the movi toa bunch of classes second grater is up through fifth graters parents all star to cally each other about it and calling his school david could not put it away cause it was all anyone would talk about became the thiy that happened that year an iv you think this is the point where a dults commit and make things better it is not because what happened instead was what aven's a lot of the time when you are a kid and a dult swoop in to try to solve something which is they sometimes make it much worse a ce cack we scall er cus an ellement ry school teachers aon your i for showing an aready ovy to stude some one's mam called the news the leopr con

moving in the backgrounds to be voice over over stockfooti ju the lepercom and heart them he does in some rather graphic ways thre now ts david would be at home sitting at the kitchen table sduing his

twenty seven tifen clips i could find with every story he fut isie and they say this would be should not ave been shown at all i be i i'll be do it scramble to coverdavid's eyes in ye but she could not always get there fast enough three hundred and thirty parents signed up the itchen asking at the school fired the teachers for weeks reporters were at the school and the two factions of kids the ones who were terrified by the movy and the one who thought those kids were losers this lanted at making their case on te ve making the divide between the scared kids and the brave kids even wider it and publicin came offearly well ti the brave kids that other children we talk with say was no big deal e boe was to carry odo do we wns o ise to be sing wou be tisin ba no won do not thinks a lot an recuar a sr wutyoubut a few kids did talk about how scared they were the one everyone remembers little chance that he a walkd out of quast during the moving i saw a had te a and and en modin in an that per tin cane nowtin yetlis agly o the movyscared yes chacity was one of the kids on the steps with david that day it was different for her though she told me was t't much the movy itself that she was afraid of it was more scared for my soul i guess this was the height of the satanic panic and my parents were wholy roller people and i had been told as a child my whole life satan could ket to you from things movies or bad books chascity only watched a couple minutes of the movy before she books at out the classroom bless than five she was sure was not enough for satan i mean it i was literally frightened that i had in some way participated enough to where the devil would come in invade my soul not the sort of kid who wants to end up on pv but one afternoon reporters fer in front of the school interviewing her mob who was not just outraged but also the mm talking of the news the most about her outrage chacityes just standing there next to her feeling embarrassed and i felt everybody was looking at me and people were kind of laughing and stuff and i kind of stood out a sor on many ways cause i was the chacity by the way t was theonly white kid in her glass pale with blond hair and blue eye i felt i could not just justappear blondon even if i wanted to but i remember talking to the reporters and i just remember them asking how did it make you feel or how was the movy and i just said it was scary bthe kids a school ran with that she paskids in the hall and they yelt it was scary behind her and chasity had never been one of the choolest kids to begin with i had a lot of friends and most people were nice to me but i also was very insecure at a lot of is she is at home am and then just too physically how different i was and everybody else and than with this whole situation it just brought more attention to me i felt and i felt i was bullied more i cried about it for share sots the little prase that has gone down and infamy i guess she was you was scary yat i'm mgad cause i am thirty five now and i will still when i run in to people from elementary school or some one gets in contact with me on social media they will still say the whole it was scary and it is a kind of fills sometimes if people do not yeven remember the whole situation they remember that it was scarry part and thot was the sound bite i guess cause whenever they ran out of material to kind to make fun of me withot it would rever back to that because of it was scarry and the fact that her mam was vocal on the news chasity says kids and teachers blamed her for squealing to her mam and for bringing all this chaos and negative attention to the school when chasity looks back on all this there is a whold list of a dolts who put her in the situation hermam the teavy reporter who made her the poster child wirh the losers her parents and church who told her the devil would come after her if she saw movy this and of course her teacher who showed her the movy the four teachers whod shown the movy were all removed from the school two were substitutes who had taken off the lists of sabs the school to call the two full time teachers were suspended for ten days and then reassigned to other schools in the district including david and chastityes teacher the teachers apologized david an chasity's teachers thaid she owned the movy but did not know what was on it that is the closest thing i found to an explanation for all this there was one thing the adoltsa school did to try to more directly help the kids uch also what a little weird david remembers a woman coming to his class she told them she was a grief counsillor tat's an introduction it sedlic hy you are to talk about things if you have any fears to concerns that is exactly what i'm here for bus david thought that sounds o quet do have fears and concerns but when she started the session he did not how she started a if anyone would to talk about what they saw n leprichon please come to the nurses office now whatever office they hadisin and you had to raise your hand after they asked basically they were just is anyone here sillafra t ta leprichon thing raise your hand if whatdid you do to raise your hand or lake did you o yes littlly stood up and walk to the nurses offas as a group a group of sad kids and all the ashholl kids were just making fun of everyone who stood up or rase her handlik you are less you wet the bed you have bad dreams ak you sack that credithing let me just p ov the structral flow at this plan bat us the kids who are already bein teas tis elf identify as wenees in front of their peers and get marched aways a group anyway the grief councillor sat the side kids down ther sid little group she starts asking us questions and the questions are presumably basit grief counciler questions what is your name do you feel safe at home what is your home life questons a propriate for kids wher experience ind loss or abuse are neglect not does tes sarily leopercons pecific and then time ran out knows it wis devinally wasn'n worth the public shaming en she canes ta cross the next time lot of the kidswho come to the first session and dropped out david for whatever raison one again and the grief councillor again she starts asking basit questions about who you are and if you feel safe and i remember raising my hand being are we goingto talk about the leopercon are we going to talk about how to kill this thing because in my mind it was a real fear the six year old mes this is bulshit this this councer is not worth the dam she is not giving us practical advice why we wasting time talking about this we need to focus on killing the feucking leopercon whetand i remember asking the grief councillor if the leopercon coms she we just be carrying change with us you i need o carri gold to exchange my life because think there is a scene in the mov where they distract the leopercon by throwing coins in the air i guess the the idea was that if they salk coins they had to count them or pick them of for something and they were throwing shoes because the leopercon was a cobbler and an to clean shoes but it was those types of questions do i do i need holy water for real i need somebody whas educated in this who seen the movy and can tell me the actual practical recipe to killing a leopercon what dis she say i remember her being kind of taken aback by the questions and and just giving the same kind of stock answer f this is not real this is not something you should have to worry about u which is not helpful it filled more a thecenter of the poor brown school and make sure the kids are all right david just remember s feeling the message who is getting from a dults cept being the problemis in the movy the problem is your reaction there is no reason to be scared david did not agreet again he was a really bright cet in a class with other brightceats and people were more able to express you i do not have anything at home that i'm really worried about i'm is realy worred about the leopercon or i'm afraid of the darkcor one girl wet the bed as a result of that pushes sad and true how do that cause we had to disclose these things in this flucking group session to this gotdamn grief councillor the grief councillor was cousiny one in here what the bed and some one had to raise their hand oh yes somebody had to oppt into that and it was a little girl in my class your ver name lopaz please pleep that i'l ly bit i'll blief it oh david considerit all these years later was not discreet low pas's marm stolbe is jas yern ity an ha

round there that is in a minute fom scagaboblegridio when our programme continues tosmari life from our glass today's programme the kids table stories of what happenes when the kids are on the wram the grunubs have left the room and the kids had to figure things out by themselves we arrived at at two of our programme ac to classified that the stories about what happens wen on a door really is never around at all for a long time and the strange consequences and desires that can come out of that cristpendera explained in twenty eighteen georgiy cad was on a cruis with her mam in the day this all started was not as fun as she would imagined their ship had been scuttered a dark at the picturesque shetland islands off the northern coast of scotland but instead because of bed weather the boat had docked in an unremarkable industrial scottish town we were rereated to a port called in for gordon which possibly has a lock going for it i'd imagined that we would be in shetland having this wonderful time looking at tiny horses cas shetland ponies and insaid we went to a very dreary museum looking at a reproductions teff escape from nineteen sixty five and then an peter our friend peter popped up peter was a seventy yer old man from wales who georgian remamad met in the cruship's dining hall a few days earlier he told them corny jokes and a lot stories from his days as a fire fighter they liked him dnow in the museum he invited the two of them to go get coffee we found this community cafe and the three of us sat down on a table which hat and empty seat and abow two three minutes later a woman came up he none of us had met before but was also on the creisship and she asked us could she sit and join us on the table and without skipping a beat peter said oh iwas just telling my wife and daught it be lovely to have some company and she sat down none the wiser my mum i think grond possibly rolled her eyes and then he spotted my mum's reaction to what he would said and he an he corrected himself oh ex wife ex wife we likewe to go on holiday still for georgina an to kee the family to gether georgie's man mostly set out this practical cho georgi meanwhile pridto gage whether peter was really ging to keep the sur he wonce he was saying things oh georgina's fery clever she is a riter she is published a book a she did really well at school all true by the way georgie decided to playlong or popsworks in the fire service he is a retired fire fighter he is to go up and down the town and wonsy asking the ladies to go on his fire truck and i've no doubt the woman thought we were very strange family but she seemed to believe that we were a family eventually peter georgin remam said good bye to the woman and laft out in the street they laughed proud of pulling off thi stupid little caper as they walked back to the ship peter mentioned a georgiy i always wondered what it wud be to have a daughter and i thought immediately wel i've always wantered what itwoud be to have a dat o georgie's dad was not with her on thi crews becaus hit was not in her life never had been left before georgie was even born an she was twenty five she found out where he lived and arranged a visit she packed her bags and was on her way to the station when she got a call from her uncle telling her that her dad had died hi't had health issues ecloser she got to him was at the funeral she would never had a father figure in her life until in really small silly way tas fifteen minutes in the cafe with peter it been such an odd thing but it felt good and unusual an she just wanted to see could that be a relationship that she would have in her life an older man to give advice and ey dad gos and be proud it is he lit a little spark wit something i felt very elated it seemed a little dorati pen oids i glimpsed something what what would sye say that was i think i think it was a need to feel acceptable and lovable bi bi men with out a hid'n a genta this is sort of a big thing to discover on a sight seen trip to invergorden that she wanted a dad's love but it stuck with her she did not george peter's in provisation but thet was not exactly what she was after then georgie got an idea and you should know georgie's the paper person who gets very creative when she tries to solve a problem she once worked in a funeral parlor to deal with her fear of dath took scubidaving lessons cause she was scared a fish and she made an ad for a dad classified at it said she was looking for some one to act as a father figure nothing sexual she culd be reached at never had a dad eighty seven at semaled outcome georgie figured a lot of the man who could be her father still read actual newspapers in magazines say i started with tha magazine whod new sientist because i thought i'd quite a dad who knows science and i decided tha i'dvit to run just stoff to christmas because all the dad type fikes would have got subscriptions for that christmas presentzay that numbers wuld bat saccessible that is very strateache oh i was yet very strtecic fery ster taci she might expect she heard from a lot of creepy older guise but they were not all that many people saw the ad for what it was and seemed genuinely interested she emaled with a bunch of them in particular this one guy clive he was in his sixties had had kids fremultiple marriages was estranged from one of his children something he seemed sad about georgie in clived emaled for weeks then started talking on the phone to i mean the first time on the fine we would both acknowledged the old quickness of it which was a great ice breake an a green flag for me clive stood out from all the other fakedads that she demaled with some of these got as they wule just waxing lerical about life in the unifers in everything but clife was very engaged an remembered details i told him showed a real interest in me an my life an i was interested in him in his life and he was open about struggles that he had with mental health an alco and we would easily be on the fine for ninety minutes two hours i think we cligs which is cligs they talked about kids georgie was wondering if she should have them and they talked politics more than she liked even though the politics were the same rex it rex tit would come up often i guess much a dor to my dey to that dad sis i me can rejust she was ust oo about something else as about something ell deso i have babies or not i i tell me they never met faced toface but they talk on the phone maybe every month or for a year and a half it was getting really well ofter a whild the things shifted a little bit and we had this fame col and towards the end of the call he said that he had been drinking and am he started telling me that he he love me and why would not i call more regularly he would love it if i would just call more regularly and i felt a cornered and it was not anything the tine of conversation wed had for all thase months up to that point and i got scared and i rat rappd it up and i melt him that i did not feel able to be in tha relationshipany more having had what hed said in that cool what did it due to you that eighteen months into what seemed a kind of success ful fak da had situation that that he had actually seen it romantically whatis is interesting that that you say romantic becaus atchally it did not feel he was being romantic it even that e w sang i lovefor you and i i did not fel he wanted to get in bed with me or anything it just felt he craved he was craving the company which is to say she would goten exactly what she would asked for a relationship what a lot of people have with their parents who understandably wont morephone calls in time and attention and i could not be that i could not call i call the time and i bailed i think i got scared and went into hiting i felt i felt i till fil extremely guilty than that about that anit ispeen six months sin shemaled clie which by the way is not his real name she could not bring herself to look in the inbox again till iur interview still has not witten back georgie is still in touch with th guy on the bot the onen gave it the idea in the first place peter the talk now and then a friendly while back he mailed her a box of cakes when she was feeling down and by the wy when she told him about the ad he was horrified worried yourn no get murdered he told her slike

week bucatholicism i could not make any sense of it and i really wanted to this fordy retreat it was run by the youth group at the parish a group of teans for my neighborhood whose mission was to get other teens in bolp wit the church they hiped it up to us and the thing they set about it that really got my attention was at every year during this retreat there was a moment a moment in the catholic school jan basemen where they found jesus felt his unconditional love they described this moment as warm and bright and that it was when they knew they wanted to serve him they called et a new found love a new fon purpose a changing perspective which is what i fell i needed exact i had been waiting around for revelation and a pifpany and thought that this retreat is where i could feel it i signed up the second day of the retreat was good friday and they took us i heard of thirteen to seventeen year old mexican american kids to watched the annual neighborhood reenactment of the crucifixion every year there was a long here jesus this year performed by a former youth leader whose name was in fact jesus well hissus he wore nothing but a thorny crown on his head and a white bed sheet wrapped around his crosch about eight men followed around him dressed in full party city roman soldier costume attire with red capes and plastic helmets and whips they would snap at jesu's feet as he halled a wooden cross three times his size arond my neighborhood a priest followed in the back of a pick up truk with a big loud speaker to read each station of the cross lococartbenders were posted up it look ted old setling corn and braspadols think mexican snowcombs my favor friend from catechism class cristel who had edgy died red hair but was never tol to participate walked with me and got some corn along the way one of the youth leaders hosel and notice that me and the girl beside me did not get one he pointed at us and smiled ou gasdo wat one he asked i got you we shaly declined the tean leaders walked and talked to us asked us what schooy went to which boy to the retreat we thout were cu cristel made fon of our catechism teacher jesse one of the more stricter onces jesse was talking about the ten commandments and got to shawnot kill she said the now raised his hand and was is not your brother in the army the whole class laughed and he got cicked out the tean leaders laughed cristel and i were oh they think were funny and we kept going running through all the other priests in directors soe wene chured their best impressions of father gregg our one white priest whose spanish was terrible he could not roll his ours and said af their mom does not go to the mass any more when he is there because she does not understand him every one laughed he followed the procession all the way to the actual crucifiction at the top of a hill and sank apark and then suddenly the mood shifted the youth leaders seemed to straighten up they got serious stoppe talking to us retreaters and stirred a whispering among themselves we all need to get to the church a sap one of them said they rounded us up once we were out of the park and sarved a head count when we got back to the gim the tean leaders continued to be quiet every one needs to sit down and formal circle around the room a youth leader said now w treators whispered rumours of what could have happened maybe someone was ditching during the walk or they caught some one smoking weed out of an apple from the snack table maudisil though one adult supervising the retreat walk in to the room looking down at the floor with his hands in his pockets he stood in the middle of the circle and took his sweet time to look up at us look at basuaoara look at basafuera foy absolute themen the erispetoso whahappen to day wh happened out there was absolutely disrespectful now saying this and spanish really kick things up anotch the whole retreat was in english up into this point and getting scolden in english was something we got from our teachers at school wut for kits us hearing disappointment in the language your parent scpoke made it all much more intents he paced around the circle he stopped again shook his head at the floor we were participating and the crucifixion of jesus christ our lord and saviour who carried the weight of the cross to which he was destined to be nailed to who took the whippings of the romans and his mother our virgin marry washed your son suffer for what for all you to take a joyful walk in the neighbourhood to buy your raspa those a met your ilol tis and talk and laugh his voice trembled and he started to cheer up he had one hand over his eyes he walked to the potium and grabbed a heavy crucifix got o one ot those ti this tivi the simpuse abitgon sado every single one of you should feel ashamed he shouted how could you call yourself a child of god you cannot stand there with him when he sacrifices for you when he has suffering he hald the crucifixd tight to his chest and continued to cri it was my first time seeing a grown man crying real life he was out of breath that times and between the yelling and the crying the room stayed still and no one was making eye contact with each other i quickly tried to recall the whole walk in my head and what i was doing thinking oh shit i was talking was i talking loud did i laugh damn i did laugh panic i looked at cristel to see how she was taking it and i notice tears werestreaming down her face she was still loocely holding the corn on the cop she bought she got up throug it out and a bunch of retreaters being in to do the same you see this he held out the large crucifix and quickly walked towards the centere of the circle this this is what you did to day he yelled he slammed the crucifixd at the centere of the circle i closed my eyes a sramic at the floor it shattered scattering pieces all over there was a collective flinch and gasp maudiy walked out it was watching some one spit out the way for you get at communion back into the priest's hands i looked around to see a lot of retreater's headsownd hearing distrupted breaths from crying this girl carla who went to the same middle school as me and was known to be someone of a trouble maker was sitting ripe behind me she took a deep sigh and with the exhall let out o what the fock which in away was exactly what i was thinking dude be folking respectful said the boy sitting behind her dude do not say focking we at church said another whisper behind him you just set it carlote quickly snapped a collective sh followed i turned and looked tat carla she leaned in smacked her lips and whispered man de do this every year ar a said he told me i could not even process it sold this is an act that they put on every year to make us feel bad that seemed really unhinged wlike every year maudiso cra ise yels and breaks the crucifix as i was tring to make sense of it my neighbor sophia wo happened to be one of the youth leaders walked to the senture of the circle microphone in hand still crying the other youth leaders took turns hugging her finally she wiped away her tears ton't worry you guies she said she raised one of her arms up into the air closed your eyes spanish gospel music began to crecendo in the background a movi i look over at the speaker to see a youth leader slowly turning up the volume not the rest of the youth leaders followed sophia and closing their eyes too slowly the crowd of retreat kids still sitting on the floor did the same sophiot opened her eyes and looked up at the ceiling if we repent he will for give us i looked up along with everyone else pressed against the ceiling i could see socker balls had been kickd too high and got in stuck i glanced around the room and at cristel whose wri next to me she was completely moved listening and crying transfixed was this the moment was this what they were talking about and was this what i came for we on the walk home i told my mon the whole story she was surprised and thought the breaking of the crucifix was more disrespectful to god then the eating and talking during the reenactment the part my dad could not get over throwing away perfectly good food he said that was the real son guiltin kids into that it did not fully set intill that night the lank they had gone to to play with our feelings that a grown man dot would be appropriate to pretend to be angry that the tean leaders chetted us up try to be coo with us only to throw it on our faces and use it against us i wondered how many times wit could have possibly done this and how many kids never learned that it was scripted or i guess eventually did when they became the ones who tried to pull this on others i almost sit and go back the next day but i for a real did think i might get my apiphany i might get closer to got i just needed to trust it more and at the same time a small part of me thougt this was just it too how far i te veni tate this what other spectacles we have planned i did not want i mi said ki was not disappointed they three was even weirder when we all arrived at the gim there is these tall wooden crate in the middle behind them hung a large white tarp no one explain it to us instead the youth leaders asked us about the times we felt our parents misunderstood or neglected us lots of kids stood up and it got very real one girl talked about how much her mam expected her take care of her siblings they were her kids some one shared that he was gay and he knew his parents would never axcepted it got to me it got to all of us then one youth leader pulled out a bucket of water balloons there filled with paint she said throw them at the crates let out your anger and fastration at your parents people hurled them hard paint was everywhere when they finished the youth leaders went to the back of the crates and opened them up several parents stepped out covered ind pain no one saw this coming see see what anger toward your parents does this is what it dus look at what yall did the room got quiet the pearante look somber some of them kept their heads down their kids run up to them sobbed in their arms and asked them for forgiveness weders told other kits to join them and they did and just stood there i looked at the crates and i could tell that the paint could not really seep through the small openings they painted the parents before the eveng when inside it was gesterdoy was just a warm up there was a pattern a formula they use they invited us to be ourselves again but this time more fully tpeople were being vulnerable and they used it against them it felt cruel and dishonest and gross in a way could not describe why did they set it up said wed end o feeling we had to beg for forgiveness tit was the only way they knew to bring us closer to god was to trick us a parton me was waiting for my pifiny but now i was sure they would not get me there and have to get there on my own machan ofar is one ofte producers on our

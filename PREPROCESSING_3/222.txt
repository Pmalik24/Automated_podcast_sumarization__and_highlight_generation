me am that cras he that each it is hard to think of a less comfortable place to read a book than flat on a blanket under te scorching sun going in the waves wholly fun for a little bit but all day and many people of a forty i have no desire to ever be seen in the bathing suit by any one ever for the rest of my life but now many times have been to the beach this summer i cane there were two quicky da trips and he seven da beach vacation i don the beach but because we live in a world with no movies or plays or music or family get togethers i think may be cshome distans beach going has been my

day how many ways iter to do that anyway and some people really love it much a while back here in a readier show we allso this article about somebody that at the time he was a sixty six year old life guard who was suing new york state for age discrimination and i just when puzzle that for a second a sixty six year old life guard alvers here on our steff we had no idea that could even exist we ale thught life guarding is something you do when ou're in high school may be cble yours after in your twentyis who still lifeguarding at sixty six and then it was even more of a question when we realize of the lifeguard in the story he has another job he is a lawyer he is a working lawyer the name is roy lecster he is a bankruptcy attorney sat is own firming ong island and then he life guards every wee an in the summer and cannot you say to day on our program we have stories about people him people who love the beach not people ma tev be beasy chicago isamerican life a mira glass we prepared today a programme to listen to with the son beating down on you the committety through the roof a show of hpeople embracing the beach people who are sns of the beach and let jus get right to it thact one one the grapes of rhat ' one of our producers jandachieve as she went out along island and met that guy roy lester the sixty six year old attorney life guard who was suing new york state basily the deal is that they tried to make him wor a speed out he refused he lost his job he stanna if ye ask fora whye is to life guarding at sixty six he barely understands the question it is a self evident to him it is been his life since he was sixtee he in his buddyes were kings of the beach he lived with other lifeguard his best man and his wedding was a life guard tet kins go playing together on the beach while they ware on ded he never wanted to leach this shob heven when he went ta lostflin calfor yet he came back to life guard every summer in lost blon as t have an an turn ship in a lost ar or something that i yescoster did you not do that i did that do te i i never took it quite that serious sly did ot the idea giving up the summer with something i jus could not do he is not alone it jones beach where he worked for forty years there are dozens of guys teachers fireman police he sayed with it into ther sixties life grerding at ye ones beech is such a thing tht a former life guard ma to film about it it is called jones beech boys royan sisted i watch it i did it was alsom here is my favourite song from it glon the wen diss t ten ze we are going for the rescue and getting to the victim it never really appreciated how thrilling life guarding is until roy talked about rescues we were sitting in his law office the exileration of the good rescue is unlike anything you have ever head and you do not get that i sit here and i shelful papish i wouldn cold excitin i wouln cold rewarding but this is you actually accomplishing something youre hup thern all the shun you going out the water and the resty world is beyond is nesting yelse except between you getting from your stand to that fictom that is the only thing and it is it is it is great it is a great fue o apeny people vi you rescatin ar craer overt tat hows in yet o you have ton nember thet would times we would have forty rescution an hour what is whay what why because you have people that come down to jones beach wou really do not know aboutswomen thes youespecially when you have a current and you you can get a very strong currents at jonspeech a thousand rescues that is way more rescues than david hosselhofted on bay watch figure two rescues per apisod ten years on the eir roy would still beat im by five hundred and sixty rescuees which is to say roy is one of the life guardiest life guards there is he had two winds at the national lie guard competition he served as an expert life guard witness in court cases and all was well in his happy life guarding world until thi speedof mischar gospygan in two thousand seven here is what happened hif youre life guardted tones bu you have to tok to physical thitness test every year to prove that you are still able to do the job it includes this spee test an a porr you have to swim a hundred yards in a minute twenty which is actualy pretty fast et of these guys train all year for it for fifteen years roy took the swin test in his preferred swin say a pair of jammers they look bike shorts without the but cushion if youre watching the olympics right now all the malswimmers a rang em er tight and they go down to just above the na ut when roy showd up for the test an two thousand seven he was told no jammers his bossis at the office of parks in recreation said you can only do the test in one of the official jones beach life guard swims sues which means you have three choices bord chorts trunks or speedou bor chorts and trunks are loose nobody rally takes a swin test in them because they create more drag and you down an effect state officials were saying to rooy you have to take the test in a speedo roy said no way i will not do it and he has not been a lifeguarded jones beech since it was one of those feelings am i making the rike decision i'm trowing away of forty year career over principal it was a difficult decision a very difficult decision howlong did it take ou to deside a secon ioly need to point out he would only iae to where the beeto for the test which last a minute in twenty seconds on the job hed where bord shorts most of the life guards do young andor why not just put it ot for the test o why did not mo o pot jus go to the back at the buss they will plenty of shet of course what roy was fighting for is quite different from what rosaparks was fighting for but to roy is the principle of the thig standing up to age disrimination when i read about all this in the new york times i really did not understand what is the connection between a spedo and age discrimination iv certainly seen older dudes and speedos i went out met roy on a beach not far from his house in long island it was six forty five in the morning he was about to go for a mile swm before work roy can you can you describe what you warin ray now well it' wet shu it she shut sly let shu and i migjammis on under beet roy brought one of his official jone's peech speedos to the beach to show me just describe it for me it is an i in exaggurated song te let us o thettl workad but it is full coverage in the back it is not quite a thong ay on not quite a fine right but to roy lots of guise it might as well be a thong which is why the speedo as earnd to stable of nicknames the weeny bekeeny the dangling slang the speed do not the benanahammock the grape smuggler the myamy meet tent the san tropet truffled nuffle the scroat toat the rees in the jammer is preferred by older life guards is it your saying it is mor discreet modest more modest yes than the speed out yes caus it covers your sizes i i i do not want to get corresfit but youre the wod begins with be is it btha sicll yo hangin outr with the with the speedo i get it now i think you will really itwit the jammag sit is not that is a little bit more of a roof over your a house yes yes this is the nut of his argument royc says once he passed fifty he felt self conscious in a spedout and nobody should have to feel self conscious to get a job roy refuses to put on the grape smuggler to take the swim test a few weeks later there is another chance to take the test he shows up and this time he is wearing the official speedout he just got it on over his jammers he showed me a vidio of a conversation he recorded on the pool that that day h's a little windy the sound is ae grat but he standing in front of su julioni who was the director of jones beech state park at the time and there he is in his sjammers pluspedo outfet challenging her to turn him away i no o a o one o n be o n on no i o a aa ao a a an an e i o a o a o o wa n o o a o oi o o rein

and i i you kno much dive e body take the test an tem were there other people taking t testan jammers nonow nobody wish allowed to take the test in gems shoy everybody else see the punon speedl punon the bod shot something that a royce sas he could have worn bord short or trunks and still pass the test he says he could have worned dungarees an past the guys in ridiculous shape he does travel ons now such as the swimty in twenty twelve he hat a hipperplace and seven weeks later he came in first in his age groep and perme to round the sound swim ras i one point two mile or wen water swim she was still using a keen to w alk the easy thing for roy to do would be just take the test an board shorts are speedo and keep the job he loved let bureaucrats be buarcrats just get on with it that is not roy roy does not back down from a fight he suid he suid the new york state office of parks re creation and historic preservation for five million dollars now the easy thing for the state would have been to just let jones beach life guards wear jammers presumably if they are good enough for the olympic swim team they are good enough for new york's life guards but that is not new york state it decided to fighte the lost suit has worked its way through the lower court which dismissed it to the pellet court which ruled an may that it should go to trial this has been going on for seven years seven years roy sent me a p dy ef of his exhibits in the case it was thirteen hundred pages long and the thing i really one to now because i live in new york o pay taxes in new york is wy's the state us in tactfar dollars to fight the speed of suit just could all have been resolve very easily years ago if they jus change the rule allowed the jammers whyare roy in the state fighting each other when they should unite against the real enemy jelly fish officials from the state of new york would not talk to me for the story the attorney general's office would not talk neither would parkson rack but they did send me the offidavit of a guy named george gorman he oversees all the parks along island and it leavs out their side of the story around two thousand six some of the jones beach life guards started taking the swim test in full body swim suits management became concerned that those guys were only passing because they were wearing the full body swim suits they decided to change the rules starting in two thousand seven life gards could only take the test in one of the three official jones beach uniform swim suits no more ful body suits and also no jammers because jammers are part of the uniform in his deposition george gorman said quote we determined it was best that the life guards wear the uniforms that the're are signed to wear while they are on duty seems reasonable roy not of your roy he points out if jammers really our significantly faster would not you want your life guards to wear a faster suit get them out to drowning victim sooner and as it happens new york parks and reck alow's life guards to take their qualifying test in jammers in the rest of the state up state i went up state to take the test and i won my jammers you knot you took the test up state yes and i won my jammers and people wad the jammage and i have pictures of that and i that is porded the exhibit obgige taking the test in the jammes up state yes this shame employer new york state department of recreation the shame employer a lase the jammers it your seary about this is that theare targetting long island because why because nine deep percent of the older the old the fifty life gods work on long island it is the biggist group of oldde life gods anyway for what its worth the state told me that the rules are different on long island because it is a more strenuous job life garding on the oceanlwil way up state it is all leakes an pools why do you think it is that they do not want older life guards well i i think they do not the fact that ld de life gods you have t influence of at the younk oguge and when you are a member of management you do not want anybody having influence of the your employs except you and when you have to deal with the union and you have to deal with the ofthises of the uniins who o all olld deguige and they know the beach you do not want that yep there is a lifeguard union roy was the president of the union for years and at that point in two thou s in seven when he refused to where the speedo he was the union's chief negotiator when sudualli on he tells him to follow the rules aa a she knows him he is the guy the union sends to argue it side and these guys telling him we cannot wear is jammers they are management is this the cantal he cloud labor dispeut i asked some other older life guards about this and three out of the four of them agreed this is about the union which actually has a history of fighting each discrimination in nineteen sixty six they went on strike because the state trade to impose in age lomen of thirty five for jonespeech life guards they walked off the beach a week later the state keat knowing this that the suits in the swimsates have a history with each other i hope me understand what roy's fight was rearly about roy told me one reason he took us stand was the management was supposed to tell the union if they wanted to change rule this and this time they den roys goto we ganjot now at a private beech club but it is not the same i wam warking now i really do but you get one rescue a year if he a lucky and then it is o what is called the puddle jumpa what is a puddle jumber utdll jump for his way you really do not even need to get yu head wit and you yet chone speech in the old days we would have these tremendous rescues just these great rescues his friends from jones beach cheese him that he is in exile now how often d you go visit them that often i keep in touch with them constantly but i do not go down there that often to be honestit it does hurt it hurts to go down there that was my beach it was my home for many years if roy's theory is true then the state is trying to get rid of the older life guards on long island by forcing them into speedos by fthat is true as far as i can tell the only life guard they have managed to get rid of is royne the ntof us is one of the poduces of our programme since the first brodcast this story roy is back at jonespeech after twelve years of fighting him over his right not to wore speed os new york state has granted him an exception bass is tas is back working as a life guard he is seventy years old uum is to each doctor ote ye i'm here now hey alex lo lite bay wy hi other titl but is nex tery takes place in a beach in mexico shaned to bow to to producer out splumberg couple years ago there old friends

friends took a month long vacation and every day they would heat out to the colp california an go see kayaking they really kind of in the middle nowhere the others little on beech communities and and some little touris sennerds but mostly what we were doing was finding deserted open beeches an camping there was nobody round for most of the time wa ses just the es you in theres a commewas at seven there was six or seven and some people might go fishing some people might play cards on some people might snorkcall think we slept outside a lot i felt we were twelve years old pretending to be robin

necklacing af this is somethin this happend to you peretically throug yes this is this happens sixto ig times a year the coment usually last three or four days but no one wants to be stuck on the beach while i'm working out my neck for three or four days we had on runnin to a little ex pak community on on a beach pretty close to where we were camping these folks who had done were living in camperers and had set up little a canteemis which are really just sort of stakes with a tarp over them and they would serve bears or in our case they showed us how to clam and the they they made us a clam feast we went back to the guyd that it has shown us how to do that to his his camper on the beach and i said there is not a there is not any cairo practors anywhere near by and which was just a ridiculous question cause there was nothing year by and he she iman this really this is where it ckind of gets apocraphle but i's actually true cause he gets this sort of wistful looking his eye and he says no there is no cairo practor but there is an amateur ciro practor who help some of the local people and his name is johnny to keela and he lives on a boat to coves over from where youare

woman am she looks american and am blond hair tand deeply it is the tan that goes to your liver it is just tand all the way through really a mustily should her shoulders look she was probably a rafting guide in colorado she is completely naked and completely onface about being completely naked just greets me and talks to me as if she were wearing clothes and she is above me just looking up

course i'll hlp you am follow me to shore he rows and i chicken wing to the shore and we pull our boats up am and then he said am follow me and now we are going i want to say jungle but t what is not

avoiding the beach because of correnivirus fo everybody who needs the beach we take you there with stories about the beach we have arrived it at four act four now we are five i gus of your beach family you go tothe beach every year good years bad years whatever happens in your family that year just what you do david sitar says this story about is family heading to the beach together one year this is first published in nhe new york ar a few years back and hear at our programm we all really loved it hers daven in late may of last year a few weeks shi ever fiftieth birthday my youngest sister tifphany committed suiside she was living in a room an a beat up hou on the hard side if sommerville massachusetts and had been dead the corner guest for at least five days before door was battered down i was given the news over a white courtesy fone ont the dallis ar port then because my plain to bat rose was bording and i was not show what else to do i got on it the following morning i borded another plain this one to it lanta and the day after that i flewd her natural thinking all the while about my ever shrinking family a person expects as parents to die but i siblyn i felt i'd loss the identity i'd enjoyed since nineteen sixty eight when my brother was born six kids people would say how do your poor folks manage there were lot of big families in the neighbourhood i grew up in every other house was a feeftim i never gave it much thought until i became an adult and my friends started having children one or two seemed to reasonable but anything beyond that struck me as outrageous i couple hugh and i knew enormity would occasionally come to dinner with their wrecking crew of three when they leave several hours later every last hart of me would feel violated take those kids double them and subtract the cable tova that is what my parents had to deal with now though there were not six only five you cannot really say that used to be six and told my sisterlesa it just makes people on comfortabi we called a father and san ad met in california few years back other other children there are the man said three who are living and a daughter chloe who died before she was born eighteen years ago that is not fair i remember thinking because i mean what is a person supposed to do with that compared to most forty nine year olds or even most forty nine month olds tifany did not have much she did leave a will though in it she decreed that we her family could not have her body or attend her memorial service put that in your pipe and smoke it er mother would have said a few days after getting the news my sister amy drove to summerville with a friend and collect ted two bockes of things from tiffany's room family photos many of which had been ripped into pieces comment carrved from a neighbourhood grosery store not books were ceids the bed a mattress on the floor had been takgen away and a large an dust rial fan had been set up amy snaps and pictures while she was there an individually end in groups those of us left studied them for clues paper played on a dresser that had several drawers missing a phone number would non a wall a collection of mop handles each one a different color a ranged cat tails in a barrel painted green six months before our sister killed herself i had made plans for us all to gather at a beech house on emeral dial off the coast of north carolina my family used to vacation there every summer but after my mother died we stopped going not because we lost interest but because it was she who always made the arrangements and more importantly paid for it the place i found with the help of my sister in lock cathy had six bedrooms in a small swimming pool our week long rentel period began on saturday june eight and we arrived to find the a livery woman standing in the driveway with seven pounds of seafood a sympathy gift sent by friends thace lawon there too she said handing overal bads in the past when my family rent at a cottage my sisters and i would crowd the door poppies around a food dish our father would unlock it and wed tare through the house claiming rooms i always picke the biggest one facing the ocean just as i'd start onpack my parents would enter and tell me that this was thert i mean just who tha hell do you think you are my father would ask he had my mother would move in and i would get booted to what was called the maids room who was always on the ground level a kind of dank shed next to where the car was car there was never an interior stairway leading to the upper floor instead i had to take the outside steps and more often than not knock on the locked front door a beggar hoping to be invited in what do you want my sisters enask i want to come inside that is funny lesa the eldest would say to the others who were gathered diciples around her did you hear something a whineing sound what is it that makes an noises that a hermit cram a little sea slug normally there was a social divide between the three oldest and three youngest children on my family lesa grutchen and i treated the others servants and did very well for ourselfs at the beach though a'll betst were off and it was just upstairs against downstairs meaning everyone against me this time because i was paying i got to choose the best room amy moved in next door and my brother paul his wife and the ten year old daughter mattie took the spot next to her that was it for ocean front the others arrived later and had to take the left overs leases wroom faced the street as did my fathers gretchen's faced the street and was intended for someone who was paralysed hanging from the ceiling were electric pullies designed to lift a harnessed body into and out of bed bunlike the cottages of our youth this when did not have a maids room it was too new and fancy for that as were the homes it surrounded it traditionally all the island houses were on stilts but more and more often now the ground floors are filled in they 'll have beechy names an our pain to beechy colors bhe most of those built after her cane fran hit the coast in nineteen ninety six our three stories tall and look almost suburban this place was vast and airi kitchen table sat twelve and ite was not one but two gishwashers all the pictures were ocean related seascapes and lighthouses all with the earborn vs hat our shorthand for seacon the sampler on the living room wall red old shellers never die they simply conk out on the round clock beside it the numbers lay in an indecipherable heap as if they had come on glued just above them were printed the words who cares this was what we found ourselves saying whenever anyone aske d the time who here d the day before we arrived at th tees tifany's habituary randon the rawly news and observer it was admitted by gretchen who stated that our sister had passed away peacefully at her home this made it sound as if she were very old and had a house but what else could you do people were leaving responses on the papers webside and one fellow wrote that tipanyves to come into the vidio store wher he worked in summerville when his glasses broke she offered him a pair she had found while forging for art supplies in somebody is trashcam he said she also gave him a playboy magazine from the nineteen sixties that included a photo spread titled the ass managerie this was fascinating as we did not really know our sister very welle each of us had pulled away from the family at some point in our lives we would had to in order to forge our own identities to go from being a sid airs to our own specific saderis tifany though stayed away she might promise to come home for christmas but at the last minute that always be some excuse she mis ter playing she had to work the same would happen with our summer vacations the rest of us managed to mak it ons aware of how old and guilt tripyi sounded all of us would be disappointed by her absence though for different reasons even if ye were not getting along with tifpany at the time tyeu could not deny the show she put on the dramatic entrances the non stok professional grane insults the chaos she would inevitably leave in her wake one day shed throw a dish at you and the next she would created mosaic made of the shards when allegianceis with one brother or sister flamed out she would take up with some one else the no time did she get along with everybody there was always some one she was an concact win toward the end it was lesa but before that we would all had our turn the last time she joined us on emerald ile was nineteen eighty six and even thend she left after three days gretchen reminded us it is kids we spent our beachtime swimmin then we became teen agers and devoted ourselves to tanning there is a certain kind of talk that takes place when youre lying daysd in the sun and i've always been partial to it on he first afternoon if our most recent trip we laid out one of the bedspreads we had his children i'd arranged ourselves side by side on it trading stories about tiffany what about the holloween she spent on that army base and the time she shot up at dads birthday party with a black eye i remember this girls she met years ago at a party i began when my turn came she ben talking about facial scars and how terrible it would be to have one tiffny said i ave a little scar on my face and onthink it awful well the girl said you would if you were pretty amy laughed and rolled over on to her stomach oh that is a lit lo i rearranged the towel i was using as a hellow idn't it the coming from someone else the story might have been upsetting but not being pretty whos never on tiffany's problem especially when she was in her twenties and thirties and men tumbled helpless before her funny i said but i do not remember a scar on her face i stayed in the sun too long that day and got a burn on my forehead that was basically it for me in the beech blanket i made brief appearances for the rest of the week stopping to dry off after a swhim but mainly i spent my days on a bike sikling up and down the coast and thinking about what it happ ent whele the rest of a scene to get along effortlessly wit tiffany it always felt that work she and i usually made up after arguing but our last fight took it out of me nat the time of her death we had not spoken in eight years during that period i regularly found myself near sumerville ad though i'd always toy with the idea of contacting her i never did despite my father's encouragement meanwhile i'd get we ports from him in leesa tiffany had lost her a partment had gone on disability had moved into a room found for her by a social service agency perhaps she was more forth coming with her friends but her family got things only in bits in pieces she did not talk with us much as at us great blocks of speech thit were in turns funny a stute and contradictory it was hard to connect the sentence you were hearing to the one that preceded it before we stopped speaking i can always tell when she was on the phone i'd walking to the house an hear hugh say in addition to the two boxes that amy had filled in sumerville she also brought down our sisters nineteen seventy eight ninth gread year book among the messages and scried by her classmates was a following written by some one who had drawn a mariwana leaf beside her name tiffany you are one of a kind girl stay that way you unique ass i'm only sorry we could not a partied more together this school sucks to hell stay cool stoned drunk top check your ass later then there is tiffany i'm looking forwr to get in high with you thi summer and tiffany call me sometime this summer and we will go out get blits af she weeks after these messages were written tiffany ran away and was supsequently sent to wai dissiplinary institution in main called a lawn according to what she told us later iwas a horrible place she we turned home and nineteen eighty having spent two years there and from that point on none of us can recall a conversation in which she did not mention it she blamed the family for sending her off but we her siblings had nothing to do with it paul for instance paul was ten when she left i was twenty one for a year i sent her monthly letters then she wrote and told me to stop as for my parents there ere only many times i could apologise we had other kids they said in their defence you think we could let the world stop on account of any one of you t te we were at the beach for three days before lesa and our father who was now ninety joined us being on the island met missing the spinning classes he takes and rawley i found a fitness that er not far from the runtal cottage and every afternoon he and i would spend some time there on dher way over we talked to each other but as soon as we mounted our stationary bikes we would each retreat into our own thoughts it was a small place not very lively a mute tell a vision oversaw the room tune to the weather channel and reminding us that there is always a catastrophe somewhere or other always some one flooded from his home or running for his life from a funnel shaped cloud toward the end of the week i came upon my father and amy's room sifting through the photos at tiffany had destroyed in his hand was the fragment of my mother's head with a patch of blue sky behind her under what circumstances had this spbeen ripped up i wondered it seemed such a melodramatic gesture throwing a glass against a wall something someone in a movy would do just awful my father whispered a person's life reduced to one lousy box i put my hand on his shoulder actually there are two of them he corrected himself two lousy boxes one afternoon on emerald dile we all rod to the food lion for groceries i was in the produce department looking at red onions when my brother sneeped up from behind and let luse with a loud i cho this while whipping a bouquet of wet parsy for the ear i felt the spray on the back of my neck and froze thinking a very sick stranger had ju neezed on it it is any trick but he also dowsety indian woman who was standing to my net she was wearing a blood coloured ausorry got it on her bare arm as well as her neck in the lower part of her back soi man paul said when she turned around or a ogt i just blinde joked on my brother the woman had many thin bracelets on and the jangled as she brushed her hand against the back of her head you called her mamhim i said to him after she woke for weal her amy mimicdim perfectly for weal over the phone my brother me as often mistaken for a woman as we continued chopping he told us that his van had recently broken on and that when he called for a to trock the dispatcher said well we rought out sweedy he lowered a water mellin to the card and turned to his daughter manny's got a dandy do not the lady u she do not care te she giggling she bunched him in his stomach and i was struck by how comfortable the two of the ar with each other our father was he figure of authority our fathers more wa claiming and we went to the beeches children on er about the fourth day our father would say would not it be mice to buy a cottage down here we would get our hopes up and then he would bring practical concerns into it there were not petty buying a house that will eventually get blown away by a hurricane probably is not the best way to spend your money but still we wanted one desperately i told myself when i was young that one day i would buy a beach house and then it would be every ones as long as i followed my draconian grules and never stop thanking me for it thus it was n wednesday morning midway through a vacation heu and i contactat a real estate agent named phillis who took us around to look at available properties i friday afternoon we made an offer on an ocean front cottage not far from the one we were renting before sunset our bid was excepted i made the announcement at the dinner table and got the reaction i had expected now wet a minute my father said you need to think clearly here ilready have i told him ocay then how old is the roof how many times is it been we place on the passten years when can we move in bechonased leas to ban to now if she could bring her dogs and amy asked what the house was named right now it is called fantastic place i told her but were going a changeit i used to think the ideal name for a beech house was the ship shape now though i had a better idea we are going to call it the sea secshion my father put down his hamber girl now you are not but it is perfect i argued the names supbost to be beeche and if it is a pon all the better i brought up a cottage we would seen earlier in the day called dune or thang andmy father winced what about naming it tiffany he said our silent's transetated to wus preten we did not hear that he picked his hamburker back up i think it is a great idpea the perfect way to pay our respecks but that is the case we could name in after mom i told him or half after mom and half after tiveny but it is a house not a tumestone and it would not fitting with he names to the other house is all ball loany my father said fitting and that is not who we are that is not what we are about paul into rupt id to nominate the conksucker amy's suggestion had the word seemin in it and gretchans was even dirtier bat's wrong with the name it already hasles i asked no no no my father said forgetting i think othis was not his decision a few days later after the buyer's remorse to kicdin i'd wonder if i had not bought the house is a way of saying seen it is just that easy no hemming and hauling no asking to look at the septictank rather you make your family happy and iron out the details lter the cottage we bought is two stories tall and was built in nineteen seventy eight it is on propers stilts and has two rear decks one above the other overlooking the otion it was rento to vacationers until late september but philis allowed us to drop by and show it o the family the following morning after we checked out of the house we would been stangin a place always looks different worse most often after you have made the commitment to buy it all the others raced up and down the stairs claiming their future bedroome i held my nose to event and caught a whiff of mildo the sail included the furniture i also made an infantory of the barkaloungers and massive t ves i would eventually be getting rid of along with the shell pattern bedspreads and cushions with anchers on them for our beech house i want to have a traine theme i announced trains on the curtains trains on the towse we are oing to go all out oh or rather my father moand wo we sketch to plan to return for thanksgiving and after saying good by to one another my family splintered into groups and had it off to our respective homes there would been a breeze at the beech house but once we left the island the air grew still as the heat intensified to the general feeling of depression throughouft the sixties and seventies the road back to rawley took is passsmithfield and a bill board on the outskirts of town that red welcome to clan country this time we took a different rout won my brother recommend it hugh drove and my father sat beside him i slepped down in the back seat next to amy and every time i raised my head i'd see the same swey bean field or low slung sinder block building we seemingly pass twenty minutes earlier we been on the road for a little more than an hour when we stopped at a farmers market inside and open air pavilion a woman offered complimenktary plates of homes served with the corn and black bean salid we each accept ed one and took seats on a bench twenty years earlier the most h place this might have offered was fried okra now there was organic coffee and our teasonal goat cheese above our heads hung a side that red whispering dog ranch it just as i thought that we might be anywhere i noticed that the music quipe ton the speakers was christian the new coming which says that jesus is also hugh brought my father a blastic cop of water yoocala fy my father answered why do you think she did it i asked as we stepped back into the sunlight for that is all any of us were thinking had beenk thinking since we got the news masn't tiphny of hope that would ever pills she taken would not be strong enough and that her failed attempt would lead her back into our fold how could anyone purposely leave us us of all people this is how i thought of it for though i've often lost faith in myself i've never lost faith in my family in my certainty that we are fundamentally better than everyone else it is an arcaic belief one i have not seriously we considered since my late teens but still i hold it ours is the only club i'd ever wanted to be a member of i could not imagin quitting backing off for a year or two was understandable but to want out badly that you would take your own life i do not know that it had anything to do with us my father said but how could it have nougt does not the blood of every suicide splashed back on our faces at the far end of the parking rot was a standselling wreptoels in giant tanks wit two pythons each is big around as a firehouse the heat seemed to suit them and i watched as they raised their heads testing the screen ceilings beside the snaks was a low pen crrowling an alligator with its mouth bandage shut it was not full grown but perhaps an adolescen around three feet long and grumpy looking a girl had stucker on through the wire and we sthrokeing wit things back while it glared seething i'd to buy everything here just i could kill it i said my father mopped his forehead with cleanings i'm with yec brother when we were yong and wed set off for the beach i look out the window at all the landmarks we drove by the purina silow on the southside of rawley but clan bill board knowing that when we passed thim wek later i'd be miserable our vacation over now there would be nothing to live for until christmas my life is much fuller than it was backteand yet this return felt no different what time is it i asked amy in instead of saying who care she said you tell me here the wom with ta watch on at the air port a few hours later i pick sand from my pockets thought of our final moments at the beach house i bought i was on the front porch with phillis who would just lockd the door an we turned to see the oters in the drawn wayears is that one of your sisters she ask pointing ou gretion it is i said and are the two women standing on either side of her then you have got your brother she observed that makes five well now that some big family i looked at the sun baked cars who would soon be gawning into furnaces every one of them i

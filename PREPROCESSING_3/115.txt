commercial real estate prices tank as banks struggles to stay afloat jo biton cuts american drilling as sout ty arabia cuts the oil supply and david whites seeks a gran jery intipemen against hunter bidon at last for a gun crime and bentunr of this is the bench verosho the shows ponser by express vepians time to stands up against bigtut protector data express vu pans i coum fleshben we keep hering over and over that the economy is on soft footing that that inalall be fine we an to have a soft landing here the economy continues to be very strong because ponomer san and all the rest of thits here is only one problem every couple of days there is a story that comes out theyreminds us how fraual the economy actually is and thet it would not take a lot to tip the economy over the edge here is the thing about economic crash is or or economic spirals everybody knows they are coming ets just o question of wen if you are a trader in te stock market one of the hard things about being a trader in the stock market for example is knowing wen too short a stock when i say wen to short stock onomy that that the stock is gettn go down probably the stockskin go down the problemis what is the time line you short it for a week for a month for a year how longed you short the stockloat if you are looking at the stock of the american conomy as a whole it seems you want a short o but you do not shurt exactly wen because the tfact is that the american economy is not in fact on softer or even solid footing it iis itis in fact resting on a precipice and which sdo not know what sort of wind is going to blow that knocks it over the edd to day's story comes curtesy of the wall street journal bank oz k had two branches and rural ark insall when shiefe executive george gleese and blought it in nineteen seventy nine the little rock lender to day has buillions of dollars in ommercial real estate loans including for properties in myamy and manhatton where its helping fun the construction of one thousand foot tall office and luxury residential tower n fifth avenue wregural banks across the country followed o sim lar playbook gorging on commercial real estate loans an relating investments in big cities over the past eccade but the commercial real estate market now and melt down those trullians of dollars and loans and investments are looming thrat for the banking industry and potentially the broader economy banks exposure is even bigger than connomly reported the banks are in danger f setting off a dooma loupsinareo it is always good stuff that that is hat you look foreigneur morning papers the doom loupsinaria they are in danger of settng ff a doom loopsinareo where loss is on the loans trigger banks to cut londing which leads you further drops an property prices and yet more losses and the problem of course is that you mand up with a four closer spiral kind of lake you saw in two thousand seventy thousand ight tdous in the residential real istate market because basically people could not pay back theyr're some prime loans but what happens when you are talking about large commercial entities that simply stop paying the're they are loans when they are building a building whenthe'r doing at development sond these things come on the market but nobody wants to buy them because we thnk they are going to get cheaper for example bankos k is not pull back from lending but has started see some times of market trouble in january a develop or defaults an on a roughly sixty million dollar loan from bankos decay after construction costs escolated the banks that is another protm in flation has driven up the costs of construction wildly everybody's budget from january no longer applies if you got some sort of speck budget from even somebody who is working on your home back in january this his ectury hapen t us and then you say what we want you to do the construction but it is now september will you give us that same pricethe'l tell thet' sor the price is significantly higher tbecause of the prices of the materials and the prices of the labor the loan was con siderd relatively safe because it was far below the building sites value of a hundred thirty nine million in twenty twenty one but in december a new aprasel put the properties value at a hundred million dollars the bank is not effectively stuck with the property to days trouble market feel by rising interestraces and high vacancies follows years of boom times thanks roughly doubled their lending to landlords from fwenty fifteen to twenty twenty to to two point to trillion dollars also banks increased their exposure t ommercial real estate and ways that are not usually counted in their tallies they lent to financial companies thet make loans to seme the same landlords thet basiclly using it as a pass throug they bought bonds back by the same types of properties in the same way that bad real estate loans endid up being sliced an vaced a thousand different ways through credit instruments backin in two thousand seven two thousand eight yet what basically they took a munch of bad sup pramalons in they stack them up with good loans than they called it a level loans and they sold that thoughut the broader economy and that is why once the infections set in it infected every part the boader economy the same thing has happened with commercial real estate because you have people are basically slacing invicing these loans or their bang bonds that are back by the loans the indirect lending along with four close properties trading portfoloes another assets link to commercial properties brings banks total exposure to commercial real estate two three pointsix trillion dollars equivalent to twenty per cents of their deposits by by the wy you can see this in real time again i know lot of people whoare in the real estate nvestmen industry and when it comes to ommercial real estate that is not in industry that you want to be in right up but they are a lot of banks thatare alions on commercial companies comercial real stay companyes paying back they are loans meanwhile also according tothe walstr journal in flation and interestr worides continued to drag stocks downward stock slumped on lenesday after investers received a fresh sign the ose economy could be reving up fanding those in flation tures in flations not going away becs again it is not just the product of last years of spending itis the product of twenty years basically of incredibly loose spending by the federal reserve and by the treasury department of the united states quantitative easing became the order of the day back in two thousand seven two thousan a but easy money prevailed up un til two thousand seven two thousand eight if you go ack and lok at the mortgage rades in theyoure two thousand mortgay's rates in the ir two thousimor five six seven per cent but for most of the following two decates the mortgage rates were in the twothere four per cent range and that is because of easy money well the problem with easy money is that makes people make loose decisions raisin the in your own life the general acconomy runs kind of laker household in this way if you have a lot of money lying around you do not think that much about o cave fine i wasted little money on a dinner or i wasted little money on on a particular event whon the great event but we have the money who cared the same thing is true when it comes to investors when investers have a lot of money in their pocket the get very breezy about giving that money away and then when th money tightens up suddenly they over compencate is a freated out and way i do not want to spend that money ever ever ever again and that is when the economy searchd to grind to a screeching hall that is what you are seeing right now thugh the problem is that the amount of money that isben in fleeted into the currencyt means the people still have a lot of money in their poket in s protur particularly tru in consumer arcets consumer markets tento reacts after business people business people the ones i know theyare ready starning pullback they are ready starting to realize that the economy is is getting worse but the everyday consumer has seen a tun of money blown in their pocket over the course of last couple of decates which is why prices are really high and then they still have to spend on necessities that is not going awy but the consumer pull back has yet to really take a fact because its non the interest of the federal government o many stake governments to allow the economy to go back to it is resting normal this is one of the huge probis of the easy money policies eating money policies make people the elece to good times areging to go on forever anstit actually exascerbates the called boombuss cycle if youshave a stable monitary supply well heueneeg at booms in enea bus but you are also going to get real grow when you have inflecian fueld growth what you get as a lot of speculation and the specuulation leads to thes really dramatic down turns and he people usually and op getting hit are the people who are not these sophisticated players in the market s that is as happening in jo bidon's economy hes now exascerbating that through foolish environmental policy w'll get to that momentarily first fladmer pudin has called the stollars drop in tominant's objective in

eight ninetyeight to get started to day o can meanwhile you would think that one of the things you do not want is a reinflation of of oil prices and yet that is exactly what jobidon is now pursuing it reallyes mans there is a lot of focas that is being put on the fact that the souties our cutting oial production until the end of twenty twenty three according to axios this is because the souties are deeply un happywith the by nad inistration and they wish to se the by naministration golay they wanto see donal trump or some othe re publican elected will be friendlier toward saty arabido that would not be a shop sadyorabia has its own international interest and to be frank the bidyd ministrations position on sadyarabia is utterly ontentable and foolish which is why jobidon before he took office was ripping on the souties in thir human rigts fiolations meanwhile he is making nice to the aroneans wo ar way worst human rize violators than the souties bite by leagues and scorse and then he ended up having to go on bended nee before the midtrom elections to the souties and beg them to ais the oil production the souties our saying no we are not real fond of you we see that you you kind of want to under cot what we are trying to do here to the souties are are jacking up the oil prices you us gass prices acording to axios are closely teothere to global oil prices meanwhile presidential campagn season is heating up if sustain crue price strength could way on presidentiobine's re election bid acoring to clear view energy partners the kingdom said tuesday morning it is keeping the cur reduction of a million barrels day in place for another three months subject to monthly review rosho is also combining to do this the're also cutting their international oil supply again in attempt to drive down people fighting them in the crane war tuesdays news halt push prent crewd prices above it ninety dollars perbarel that is the highest since november of two thousand and twenty two officials are holding the fire for now because it is sti far from the election the hoping may be the souty's back off it this but what is amazing about this is that there is a way for jobine to take advantage of this and hou be theway the donal trump took advantage of this when i turned out that oil prices were were petty high at the beginning of the trumpadministration donal trum focist on increasing american domestic oil production which is why we had an oil surplus by the time that that donal trump left office jobi hes been precisely the opposite in te middle of a time when americans are goting going to be payng mar t pump jobine is beholdin to his left wing bays which means that he is now working to pro hibit drilling in the national patroleum reserve at the arctic natural wila refuge no the anouir has been a point of contention since i was in college intucking twenty five years that is been a point of contention the basic argument thats made by vir mentalus as yo cannot drill in this pristine natural habitat and the argument made by people who are drilling for oil is it is a pretty small foot print in a very very large area it is not actually killing the wild life in fact to turns out that the caraboo kina likeit being warm inso the tend to hang out around the oil pie blinds in the mate i'm but bottom line is this in the middle of an economic down turn or potentially conomic down turn cutting off your own access to oil is an idiot move and this alwaysbee the problem with jobidon in reference to the oil industry at the same time he wants to claim tht he is helping every day americans to by the way don all own testalas at the same time he saying that he is simultaneously taking every policy he can mangion in order cut off domestic oil supplies me he is set that he wants to cut off the ability to drill off shore in in large suaves of of american costal waters he is now saying he does not wanto be able to drill in the anoar what exactly is the plan for oil in dependence for example wmost y real about thi fossil fuel production is going to be crucial to the american economy for decades to come not fre years to come for decades to come this bazar notion that even the electrical grid it is powerable without carbon base fossil fuels or massive building of nuclar power plants is idiotic it an't can be done on windmills an electricity does not come from itself thid there seems to be a theory when it comes to energy production on the left the basicaly the way you create energy is that famous meam of plugging a plug into itself the electricity comes from electricity no it does not the electricity that is in the power grid generally comes from fossil fuel production that is where it is coming from or fossilfu l use and yet jobidon is cutting off all of that and then simultaneously tellingyou that he standing for th little got let me tsomling your people who are rich we can afford higrer energy prices we can afford to keep our ar ar a c on sixty eight all a year but let me tell you en when we wort rich when i a when i was growing up we kept our a c a much higher temperature because the power bills actually matter to lotmor when you are talking a better egressive income tax in creasing the priceofenergy is a dramatically regressive income tax on people who are poor on people wor middle class and yit the bit administration is behold into its radical invironmental bays and the do not care about the the average ordinary american what you have to pay at the pump whor what left to payingyor indirect energy bills the new regulations would ensure what the administration called maximum protections from nearly half the patrolion reserve it would not stop the enormous eight buillingdollar willow oils rolling project in the same

have lived on these lands since time immemorial om again in varmont until mon provats got matded him over the willow projects o he is trying to back fill that right now which just goes to show he is an eminently political animal but is politics are always about pleasing whatever is the constituency wregh in front of him it is why he is a union boy ndwhen when it comes to doing the unions bidding toobidaneis their man when it comes to the in mire mentalist he is their man he responds directly to to incensive pressure from the people he considers to be his most base supporters meanwhile by the way his healt coutr cost are continuing to rise according to axios while corks in how halthin truns prices our measured exist and how medical provider set prices and hey've led to a downtern an inflation a reson on that trend is now likely to reverse medical service as are six point four percents abover all inflation but twenty seven percents of course service is ex housing excluding housing to health insurance is rising fairly dramatically agant a lot of that has to do wit the inflationary policies that a pursued by gobidon the price medical services is up the price being treated has being brought has been rising slowly according to the consumer price index data a what is going what what went up i keep sangit over nor it wi'll come down and i am not paying ittension on a personal level to the happy talk that suggest that we are all going to escape the the do move that we have created for ourselves economically yet easily or or quickly and just one second we will get to the

biggest news yesterday apparently special council david wise says that he intends to seek an indictement against hunter bidon in the gun charge case now you remember the histery here basically davidwise was appointed by the deoga he was not given special council status that he could not independently going check into hunter bi in's various financial crimes which is the stuff we astually care about right the gun charge stuff is selatious and goes to the fact that hunter bidin isof garbage bag of a human being who was simultaneously having aa a an affair with his a brothers wife his his brother did n he was having a fair with his wife meanwhile who is a mass of drug abuzer who is buying guns falsely and then tassing them in in then his brothers wife tossman trash can near a school an al the restuss all that is very selatious stuff that is not the real problen hunterbidon m pembing a drug at ic durelict yah but the big proban hunter biden is that he was a bagman for his ad an every one knows this in cluding hunter bidon who literally tecat his own daughter that he pays half of dad's bills in a in a in a quote that apparently is utterly unseeable to the manstremedia including people at the washington posts philip bum in any case what happened here is that as the investigation ins the gun charge began and as the investigation into hunter bidins tax failures began because hunter bidn failed t pays taxes for years on end while earning tens of millions of dollars for friends an family and himself well all that was happening nobody was checking into the deeper question as to where was this money going was influence being petalled wi for example is hunter biy nopping charge woth violation of the forign agient's registration act he clearly was a foregnagien hofs operating on behalf of a foreign of a foreign company that was clearly related to american to mestic concerns i min berismi is it is hard to see a better case of a foreign agens than hunter bidin acting as a go between between ucranian company berisma and the american government and hofs pretty obvious stuff you have to re gisters foranantion hedn't do thats that cang prosecutor for that the question became why was not a getting prosecutor for that the original theory was that david wice even if he had wanted twho could not because the do ja under jobidon did not give him special council statustactally pursue that and now is the case thot was being made by irus whistle blowers evry schaply who as sang a yad dey ould wis told us he could not ask about jo every avenue into investigation regarding the hunter joe connection was shut down by david wice and by his team at the do jay and then they tried to bring in front of a jodge a sweetheart deal for hunter bidon just to recap the history here the sweethart deal was that he would plead guilty on some tax charge as you get no jail time and on the gun charge he would be given a diversion instead of inactual conviction on his record but buried in the gun charge was immunity for all further prosecution on things for an acent's registration act violations hat was buriedin the gun charge the judge look to the i've never seen a deal remotely this why are you immunizing him from further prosecution or investigation on financial crimes in the gun charge you are doing this to hide the fact that you are doing this and then shed blewed up an open court and the deoja denied that was go what was going on and hunter bins letters wele that was exactly what was oing on we do not have a deal after that the bite administration knew that what it had on hits hands was a pretty obvious candal in which the deoja had essentially massage this entire process s that hunter bitdin would never be investigated for his involvement with his dad and that is when mericarling cam ount n said o kan'tyou know what woregan to make givid west special councils they did it too late they give him special council stats nown that allso came just in time for david wice do not testifin from congress about all this tbecause once who is given special council status then how can he be asked about failure to be given special council status agan simply silizen there is an on going investigation i cannot comment and on going investigations or negotiations who is all very convenient it ws all very obviously a cover up and now he come to the final part of what is the cover up you omagion and that is david wise seeking charge is on the gun charges by the end of month acgording the seannen hunter biton had previously reach to deal involving a fellony gun possession charge that would have allowed him to avoid prosecution if he ment certain conditions over a twenty four month perion according to th special council's office the speedy trial act requires the overment obtain the the return of an indigtmen by granjery by friday soptember twenty ninth twenty twenty three at the earliest prosecutors did not say how many charges would actually be brought again there is federal crime related to the gun stuff here but that is not really what this about the real question is is this deal now is this gun charge now going to includ a plead deal than imunize him from further investigation or is david wi dis can say heyware dun here and move on and there will not be any investigation ins the finances of joe and hunter bidon weget him more on this momentarily first my team is constantly talkingabout delicious all american met youknow why becausis amazing you kowhin they that even more when that american meet is free which is why we love goodranchers thes sorce the vest meet in america they deliver ite to your door even better right now they are offering two years of free ground beef to any one who subscribes that is a four hundred

today yuse code ben for twenty fivebux off and free ground bee for two years remember subscribed to any box to lock in your price right now on america's best meat for two hull years that is good mancher's dock comptany used my could ben frover five hundred bucx an savings subscribe to good ranchers american meats to liver okas up what is this mean for the future of the hunter bidin investigation apparently wisistil weighing whether to charge hunter bidin with tax crimes he said in a quort figding last month that trial is now an order on the taxoffences and you might bring it titional tax charges in california or washington d c but all of that is arrelevant to the broughter question of f ou'recarging with tax crimes maybe ou ought to investigate fully where te money was coming foming where the money was going li this is very very basic stuff here an if they do not pursue that it is prety ovious why they are not pursuing that and simply saying tht he charging with the gun crime in order to presumably cover for not investigating the thingthat everyone cares about it that sort of if they decided to prosecute alcopone on the tax crime not because they wanted to put him in jail but to immunize him from further prosecution on you kno murder that is it that is ssentially aly will gev you slap on the rist on this little crime over here not becaus we actually want to get you on everything else vope one o thit' the alcopone taxivation charging is tat twas an easy charge that put himan jail the rest of his lifethat is howha they want for hunter but they want for hunter it is some sort of slap on the ras that basically alows him out of jail and if you do wit the grand jury proceeding or hunter bidin get's probation from a judge or somthing andyou ent up in the same place that you would have with the swede harteal n han e descrop thrust the investigation then i was pretty obvious the special council stuff was a ruse is what house re publicans have been saying it sent a letter two hunter bidon's lawyer saying should you refuse to probide the ommitte with requested information becaue of any proported privilege the committe made ned to see testimony from you and or hunter by n re garding the disclosure of dockumens and communications they are looking for all sorts of documents related to the defunct ple agree men they will not know whats for swete har deal went on behind close doors in fact james comer the republican wwho is the head of the house oversiecommtte of kentucky he he says that theyreare emals showing hunter's legal team telling joe how to spin his corruption thoughout this entire process wit jo by alwy thad o the mantry mediou i got log with is it well ther wit ewhyr you gin whye you bet t getting oter bid he was not a part of the gotment they at jo by ot a firwhil but twing the govermentin a ti sed that is not true and we tree with that the lack tro we there e mails that wit backin fort wer hunder legal ta wit tellin jo by nowi the ner about the corruction he got cotin there was copys wher copied about you cran for policy and we believe ther medibory bout the baaro titygo gap and thend those are not being released creenshom pieberall's worst prassecrutaries yes yesterday the present in theunited states he touk about transparency lot he could just wrelease from the national arcives all of his v p documents involving his fake his fig names the sued hims who is using he could release all his demales with hunter bidan's waferm and all those communications why is not he doing that cree jon heres a low because because becus matter he narhwor e o i'm just in a let i know the white houe mi mi cam a the way o couo oeh responded ce i i ecn mi tam deo wi that that information i jdon a m wor there she never has more to say on that am it is very obvious question why do not ujust release it you say there is nothing wrong oflk athen let let' see it well wa what is the problem exactly it is truly incredible how what is very obvious to everyone which is the jobidon has bee a corrupt politician literally since the day that he was elected to te united states senete that the thacki were suppose to pretnd as clean as the driven stone not only that it is perfectly legitimate for him to hide a bunch f females where he was using a suting him to cordinate with his son whos corruptly picking up cash in for contryes and we robs can pretend that that is totally nornal but that is what we do when he come to the legacy media when it comes t the legacy media this is what they do they simply decide through selection by us what is to cover and what not'sto cover what is a story and what is not a story big hubub on ax formerly non ace twitter last night becaus tucker carlson interviewed a man named larry sin clare larryson clare for those of you who have you now been on the intrinete any time in the last fifteen or twenty years larryson claire is a a man who allege is that at he had a cocane fueld sex binge with brokobama back in brokobamas state house days in illinois now that is not uncredible it is not brokobont in his own memoirs talks about how he the blo clearly the gotsfamiliar drugs brokobama wrote to a girl friend we now know that he regularly every day had fancies about having sex of men if that is not conjecture that is something the brokobama wrote in his own hand to a groll friend which by the wys a weird thing to sad your grofan any case it is not a noncredible story the media at the time when after larris an clare they pointed out that he had a history of criminality back in the nineteen eighties and the they just ignored the story now letme point out that if barokobam had ben republican candidate for office this would have been from page story all the time there is no question his personwoulav ben on every he tesho there is no question this person woul hav bee on meet the press there is no question that this is person wouldhav been treated as a fully legitimate possible new source this is no question here was larisin clarho admittedly is a wild dued anmn it turns out the people who engage in a cokine feeld sex orgies ar typically kind of while but here is here is larris in clar talking about his encounts with barokobmama and i'm swondering why is this what what makes him specifically noncredible noncredible that no one will cover him except for if he goes on tucker i got dop off they laft the next day was somewhat interesting because he ens up shaing up at my hotora which i thought was somewhat weird but he wanted some wore when you think he showed up het he showed a iman i had no waning i was e tron there is a nock on the door i open the door and he standing that anh standing there was mare co any comes and and it was just a quick reho sha re ron from the night befor exact ing programm exact tint programs he smoking again brokabon the smokes crack and then you performed the elt sects on him igat here is the question the question is why precisely is leris an clar significantly less credible then say eaching carol real question why is it that every time somebody makes an accusation against a democran of of behaviour this suddenly the media go completely radio silent when n makes an alligation about jobidon that tourbin pushed her against a wall and thrust his fingers into her that is treated as absolutely non credible we will will pay little bit of attention just for cend of the sake of saying that we did by what were not going do i take that superseriously but but if anybody accused nonal trump of a thing then obviously we have to take that superduperjuperseriously i that that that is very important here is the thing again there isin claris alligation which istht he was in chicago to particular time you should be able to check the records is to whether he was in chicago at a particular time a journalist should beable to ask larisin clarer there any distinguishing features about barokobama that would confirm your story one o the thingsthat larisn clar says in this interview with tucker carlsin is that barokobona had told him at the time is ninety nine that he was having trouble in is marriage and when leris in clar riginally said that there r lot of peoplelin no that is a wy what how dare you they have a perfect what et came out in michel ubon his memoir that yathey were actually having some pre significant marital troubles at that time the time line lines up with all this and again it is not a wild alligation to suggest the barokobama ma've engaged in homosecual behavior considering he literally wrote in a letter that he fancisized about doing it is not a wild aligation is suggest te brokabam may been doing coke in the late nineties considering that he literally wrotein his memoirsabout doing cot and this is not somebody who has maintained in his own hand that he is straight as the as as straight can be when it comes to his sexual proclivities and no drug use lignit against that mea that what lary saint clara saying is absolute true i have no idea yourn't have an idea but agan were asked to make these decisions all the time in the uorter public opinion about who is quoticua credible and who is not credible remember we were told by the entirer mainstremedia that christine blazy ford who accused just as bradchavina of having gang raped her back in their tean age days she was brought before congress comella harris asked her questions she is on the cover of time magazine she became the leading face of me too and her allegations are significantly less credible than latris and clars her allegations had no confirming details they did not match withthe behavior that we have known about from brad cavinot in terms of his sexual life style they are no confirmatory sort of details none place time anyone else who can remember this vent liket and and yet that was treated as as perfect evidence that breckcavinal should not sit on the bench and in fact if you confirmed him to sit on the supreme quort of the united states this meant tht you were fine with going ahead with with with rape the fact that that again leryson clair has been round for a while these allegations were being traffics back in two thousand savein two thousand eight as early as thad and they'e been widespread allegations about berockumoma sexual behavior back in hin chicago days for a very very long time i do not know if their true i do not you do not knott their true but the point is that the media have a have a certain standard as to what is a credible alligation andther standard always seems to be you are making it against herepublican that seems to be the standard if you are making an allegation against her publicanted his immediately deems credible which is presumably why werstill tike out egng caroll remmer egin carroll is im has been held two to ha i she sued donal trump in federal court for defamation and she an ay judgment from him because he said that she is a crazy personan he did not rape her remember her alligation is that donald trump raped her an a manhadnt department store room at the indressing wom at burg dwarf goodmen in the middle of the day and she is and she she is written about it publicly saying that she did not considered ar rape at the time and only later did she sart to thing maybe it was bad la it is her i got as a her allegations i do not you by their wildly more credible than latris an claris alligations why well now it turns out that a federal judge his rule the donal trump is lible a second time for to faming her this time over to sparigeon comment he made in twenty nineteen after she accused him of sexually assaulting her an tae man han n department store yous district jodge at louis caplin in new york sait a coming trial would be limited to determining how much trump must pain indamages to carroll who brought two lossets against him in the spring they gave caroll five million dollars an damagents after finding trumpet lible for sexually abusig her and lader to faming her and a social media posts in october of twenty twenty two the earlier jury by the way did not find that he comitted rape but found more likely than that that he sexually abused her n addressing him of burgdorf good and based on nothing again she she sshe cannot describe details about the burgdorf she cannot describe it what what day it was she gets cre wat season it was that they are all sorts of pretty avios tolds in her story holds that i do not se anybody trying toache poke and larrisin clip but bethelwey has brought cloma ever been asked publicly by a reporter about the larisin quarstuff i'm not a were that he has which is an amazing thing again every politicion if there is an alligation made against you youre you will be asksed about that allegation unless your brokoboma in which case the pretorian guard snaps into place and you will not even be asked a simple question have your mout lettisin clair do you kno lettisin clair have you ever had homosecxual experience is with men in chicago i gus the apretilic obvious questions it are they matters of public interest i mean the guide was the president of the united states and rotines in in an mense appeal in american public life to pretend that that is not relevan at all the silly an me we know for a fact that if your republican they be ripping this up pan now there just no question if you if you ere a re publican congress person forgetbout the former president by the way can you imagine if a mail f a mail came out now and said donald trump and i had have copcane fueled sex binge in nineteen ninety nine i can show you that i was in town the same time he was do thing the media would totally ignore that they could notven nor the stealdocie which was sheer conjecture and complic not only conjecture i g baseless in baseless statemens about him being peed on by prostitutes and they traffic to that the disparity is obviously incredibly telling but must protect the precious at all cost must protect that that that ishow weu decide what is credibleon what is not not based on the credibility of the witness is wor t people involved we do it simply based on who they are making the alligations about and just one secon we will get to jobine who continues to stumble around como harris is now being

bound to happen we will see you there meanwhile jobidon continues to be absolutely feeble yesterday he did an event at which he am he explained that while jol had covet he was sometimes wearin a mas sometimes that werestill doing mask theatr here he was yesterday doing it o t pres i e cec ce ganto day ad clear cross e board i cen keep con we be ca e ca to be ken days i onen i yo keep wy e con't col my din't havin on nit wanan again the mass theatere is just ridiculous for saut no one cares old man im in at this point everybody in the arisis sad coveat eighty three times the fact that werestill playing at this is ridiculous in the fact hes still feel the needs wo make excuse t everybody byt masking not masking his even more diculus the truth is he is going to use the the covid threat is now in excuse to just avoid events that is what actually happened yesterday there is a medal of honor ceremony and tim and jobidon just left in the middle of the medal of honor seremonies really weird n os is walkin out every's clapping and shuring frthemin jobin ivere the metal honor weners are il where did not he go by the wy theire older he is an thou a i could hold it did iwe we do not know where jobion wends what was there excuse creen johmp her was asked about this and again being wildly on talensage says it was all part of the plan part of the planers for job idan just wander out of the room solid stuff here from mut cringshup here and he left a planned as it was planned he left wen day was a pause in the program in order to minhimive to min imie his close contact with a tentis who ere whoere about to participate in a reception and he al reported that notive that he left won day was a pause in a program becausigat he wanted to min im i i certainly he is impact on folks who were there oh that is what it was he left when the midle oks o first of alt he is standing afoot from a guy he is giving a metal of honor who is significantly oldern he is which does not he that is covid pro to calla for ashalign in do this dum crap again and then he is cut a ead down the middle a does a very crowded rom he is walking right through the crowded room indoors past all these people in i be safer from to stay up there far away from people but i kno no that my my going thory remains the metamusul theory the met amusal conspiracy theory here is that ha dute had to dute had to hit the head im but no again this this continues to be a running theme in the biding campaign which that heis too old to be president t everyone knows it is not eve that he is too old it is that he he does not have it he does not have at i know guyse whoare his age wuar really with it or on top of things were still running their business is with yo great acumen that is not jobidon jobidon is barely there which is why comell harris is now going to become a campaign issue soi she was a she as asked yesterday about jobidon's age and she is acknowleus he 's doing amazing he is doing a it which she has to say every picture of jobidon standing of comell harris standing behind jobidon seems on ai missing photo of stolen standing directly behind london is london climbs down some stairs wik ga sshe is waiting man she is just waiting here we go seventy seven per set of american setathy's too old i serve of second tur itotways in one reson pole the bice present comella harris is now to smithting any uneasyness coters may hab over age first of all i mi ta that our present has been an extraordinary wyr a subsanchlan on a time we spend together is an the ovel office where i thi how his ability to understand issues and we through complex ihes in away that no one else tand to mexsmart an important dicison noi love the inflection of th en of everysends they have to go up at the end of every sentence no cause we issyou do not know or talking about ts very soud stffe there from from comela haris i shofs asked by a reporter from theassocied pressife she is ready to assime the presideenc he which is a really dumb question i got a say not every question is done but tommer is a very stupid question literally her entire jobis to stand there a a vaz until the point at which the president ies that is the job of the vice president the vice president stands there in every administration as the break glassing case emergency in some cases that is more likely in some cases that is less likely but in this particular case comell harris is standing tere the wicked which of the west with the with the hour glass and shust waiting for that time to wroh the sul that is happening and thi's administration by the way she has a rather large stake in that because if it turns out that god forbid something happens to the president of the united states and it happens too far from the election well then she isgittoget a challenger and she does not want that it isit is a bedding game not to be dark about this but there is a lot of tis a american politics let ust be real about thus when we look at the supreme court constituency its to ghoolish death watch that is what it is regdy if you are a member of the opposing party ran out your democrat ere's waiting intil the re publican die the republican appoint he dies on the quort tit is that it is how this works it is it is you not insane but tht's helt works this happens to be true for commall harris who is filled upward into every jop she is ov her held but here she was explaining she is absolutely ready to assume the presidency where shell alight from an electric school buss riting a unicorn questio or the present ageo often go hand and have questions about hi resteppin a rall a necessary your peel prepare for that possibility ah at's her res pes present prepared you for for that shov yes a ihow you you describe that that process bit myar ye be rey ol cresent of al a let us th that answering your hypothatical a but do its con o be fine te that is not cin ta comto fesent but let us thouts to understand oat any ri re ha thoin every pice present understands that when they take the olthat they must be very clear about the responsibility they may have to take over the top ot bing president im no different i do not believe you i do not believe you and that that is the i'm going problem for the byde administration again they are and eg shall skull party said befor is that there is a theory in tort law call the egg shell skull theory it is ot really a theory that the basic idea is that in tort lawich all about damages a heat with my car who pays an and all that eggshell skull theories that there are certain people who have an eggshell skull and to unforeseen damages occur if you hit them that is the democratic party writ now jobidin's the eggshell skull and if that that eg shell cracks they have a roiling mass on their hands and they know it and that is all because they decided to select shim to the comall harris as their number to meanwhile in terms of sort of how will see craziness of the day military leaders i have sae the weaponisation of the military ond behalf of the left is totally insan to me it is totally crazy the fact that the upper ashlons of military have decided they are going to echo every nostrum of the left is the dumbest thing in the world you on't talk about things thet're driving away recruits how about the real ornientation of the military away from brak things kill people win wars tord find your individual self expression here in the military that is that such a weird move it is weird and th democrets are clearly using the military for these purposes which is presumably why they are insistent they are all fired insistent that the military is going to pay the bills of people who wish to leave in anti abortion state to go to a pro abortion state to have theirabortions a t th that is the that is the current policy statement of the united states militares whut democrats want to do there 's a stand off right now between tommy tubberville whos senator from alabama heu opposes the pens guns curan policy of reimbursing service members in their families who have to travel to receive abortion in the senate one senator can hold up nominations or a legislation accgoring to se an end tuberville stands has left three military services to operat without a senate control leader sent at con firm leader for the first time in history now here is the thing if they want these leaders confirmed all democrats have to dos bing them up one by one that is all they have to do right that if they bring un one by ones who give us an upright downbver on this nominy tubervilte is not holding up the nominye he is holding up the unanimous consent yourn't have to have unanimous consent democrats control the senate pluss hafe the republicans ore gen avote for tese people but senant democrats keep saying tht it will take up valuable flor time which they li what valuable flort what e gates doing for a livingyet of five week recess in august the what are you talking about it is obviously then trying to turn abortion into a political issue view the military an the military will pay for you to go get your abortion in california if you are if you are in taxas and tubbervilles no i'm puttng a blank get hold on unanimous i'm not doing your unanimous consent crapinsly trip that taxpars should not be paying for american abortions that is tate's not at something you on pay for yourself that is your problem there is no reason why taxbars should be paying for your time off while you go get n abortion and the democrats alike well then we will just not have leaders for u military and then they blame tubberville for it and they militorize the military leadership to do the same thing the acting secretary of the navy carlostall tro is now accusing republicans of eating and a bedding our enemies by not simply blanket confirming a bunch of people wile allowing the ilitary to pay for abortions i take soir confrgi on iin coni country ave nevertact in thactry one round senators we'ld actually be aiting in a bedding commines and o their autocratic regines around the world this is having a real negative inpact and will continue to have real negative inpact on our combat redness that is what the american people truly need to understand and and esenator tubberville re least the statement that sentin part this is two weeks ago i will continue this process of oversight and i will announce my opposition to specific notmanese ween this is this is absurd is absurd amiy using the secretary of the navy is a stand in for abortion and then again you wonder why people ogat fact a dist proportionate umber of recruits in th military come from the south fact it dust proportionate nembers number of members the military are conservative fact it dust proportionate number of members the military are children of military numbers or relitives of military members you want to go directly at those people by turning the the military into the leading point of the speure one it comes to abortion polic absolute nuttiness but again its social policy uber alice for this s ad ministration they do not care about military readiness and then trying to clam republicanso clar care about milter rednes when they can simply just bring these people up individually for a vote is totally insane it is totally totally crazy it is in in by the way terrible fore the cuntry okin time for a thing that i as convicting a murder which is candis owns is new series about the sevin every case that is going to be available to mo the first t episode will be coming out tomorrow for every one and then you will hav to to dailywhere plus os subscribed for the rest but if you subscribe rit now for a daily wore plas then youw'll also be able to accus the first three episodes right now before any one elsely today well we did not interview with candiso bit earlier this week i'm convicting murderiturs wot sounded joining us on line is th personwho needs no introduction tht a course is candas owens t'l give fer an introduction anywations in your times best selling author the founder of bluxsit and the host of candistons over on daily whare pluson nowshas of fascinating new dockyou series that is out it is called convicting a murderer and it takes on the nonsense that was presented by natflices making a murderer which was basicallyes suggestion that a person convicted of murder riginally did notcommit the murder atually he was innocent 'lthey left out a lot of evidence ind candis on covers all of the candas thanks re droying chow congratulations on the series thank you it is gono bi think our first doc you series the daily wire which is pretty exciting right ten apisesan ths for somming done that that is right in it looks fan tastic why do not you talk about first of all what led you to want to you hone in on this story yget a lot stories tot come across your dusk but this is the one that really drove you enough to one to make a full on tocku series about it yi ganow i think i ie demonstrated jus in general interest and media per ception and i think it is fastinting its a study in human psychology and we can operaten were abov it but we have all been subjected to brain wash in the future were all going to to pasin become bic to mise by media propaganda and brain wash in te future none of us agan are above it and im you go from greatest lie of oer sole focussing on ma george flod story which really was a psychological phenomenon everyone genuinely believed this man was innocent it was killed with the hans of police and it is it is really an not exact same vain except with george flood you had black lives mater which steven avery ou sort of hof white live's matter where there was just really this anty police santomen which i think the media was seizing upon and napflic just rigpt place right time racing nized a story that was in fact interesting you had a man sepen avery who was put in prison wrongfully convicted the first time put into prison for eighteen years for a crime he did not commit a which was a the rape and attempted murder of another woman who wrongly pointed him out in a line up and i think people wanted to believe that will ma me th the just isten got at wrong twice and tat when he was walking free and got con got accuse of another murder they needed to believe that this is just completely wrong miss mannis in o send even in the face of overwhelming evidence and than you had two documentary makers to a liberal women lesbeens from new york who went down there in to sited this is it for gen to bring this to napluxs to superinterestin ng story and what we are going to do is omit details very necessary details whom similar to george floid haad three times level of fentional in a sistem that could a possibly killed a horse may be relovin but let us not talk about that because we are insisting on a different narrative very similar aspects and that is definitely what drew me to this particular story a ton of people watch to make a murder was cen om oa phenomenon when it first came out but for those who who did not watch it can given sort of bare bones outline of what exactly happened that led to the the original conviction of stephen avory you mention he had one casion an who is released after that caseon tha what actually happened in the teresa hallback murder it instantly became o cult of making a murderer of the the first episode kind of opens up and you see this guy and he seems loving he seems sfamily oriented he is being released from prison i mean all of us are drawn to a story of a wrongful conviction that concept of being put away in prisone ting tht you did not do it is eou'r instantly going all my oches is fascinating and then at the end of the episode after they make you think this is is loving family man and he is also incredibly forgiving he is wrong place wrong time the reason why he got wrongfully convicted was because the woman genuinely and she was totally beat up about it genuinely thought that she recognized this person that had rape tern left her for dead and this was before we had tean a evidence right and they they set this up perfectly and that the end they drop a bob on you y the first episone n they let a actually he is been arrested again and he is being accused of another murder ar dun't undone and this is kind of what drew everybody and that is the initial stephen abery story and thend they went through an unpacked and very heavily suggested in my opinion a that stephen avery was innocent and then of course you had thand the chorus of celebrities for whatever reason alic baldwin is always right in the thick of it elic this is an unjust tis this is completely wrong this man jus cannot stay out of it you had celebrities that were tweting about thi series it when absolutely viral and again it was just sort of this cultural momen where people we are developing this antye police sentiment in your series convicting a murder which again is fastam ni can ask you to give way all the details o in a wat there is a wat in there that the people just t do not know that was directly overlooked or or actually doctor by the original makin a murder documentarians can give us just a taste of sort of the the suffit ither was not presented to the public in making a murder or was actively change i meyou make him accusations in convicting a murder that that iare not accusations meen there just realities th the for example kee facts word deliberately omitted cut around that sort of thin i think one of the things that they were really really and ot these to documentary makers was deceptive editing i think would be the right term which is to say that even if they are showing you port parts of the cort testimony you are thinking that youre watching a person were spond there is a momen whether there is there sitting in the cort room and the police opstigetes asked to question and they show you that he gets sort of tite it looks his lying rights you have always come tors what't you seo see is reaction was asked that question well reality that was not even that his response o that particular question they just see you whose him sitting up at a different moment and put it next to a question that he was aske at a different time is a sort of these deceptive aditing tricks to heavily suggest that people were either innocent or people were guilty and a i think probably what people are most interested and back at home and still to this day is people who say i do think see navy was guilty but i believe that his nephew was somewhat manipulated i think that will probably be the most fascinating element for people that are willing to have the humility to explore how perhaps they were dupes i said we we have all been therebefore if you found me ten years ago i was a left leaning a a o young woman who thought that abortion was aright we we change and if you are willing to go through that you will learn that even with bredandacy people we are led to believe that he was innocent elegibly that he was stupidleto bely that he was manipulated and i believe that he was manipulated but it was not from the people that are heavily suggested by making a murderer he was not manipulated a by anybody for in my opinion other than the documentary makers and his own uncle cand is what you for see as the reaction to your knew series do you do you think that ng any response from the avery family from the original documenterians what you foresee er well we have a bery's family in the document ar a thats really incredible to actually here from his brother to be able to ask them those pointed questions do you actually think he was guilty which is interesting because the public perception is that the entire avoryclan is behind him the entire ary clan loves him and i think that we will expose those elements as being false but i can tell you what the orly reception has been people just knowing that we are doing this in seeing the trailer i've had many s that ere angry i say cant is just say out of this when i love you much but you do not know all the facts we have been researching for years were on rudan thread and i love that i loved the opportunity to change people's minds and i think that afterward again if you are a person that is willing to exercise that humility or just can a go wow it is incredible and you will probably not doubt yourself but you' wou'll grow from the experience none of us always get it right certainly not me well that is candi to owen's go check out her brand new doc you serioes convicting a murder available only at daily wireplusko checken outright now it is really a fantasic piece for canis congratulations again ra syou thank you much bet allready go checkit out convicting a murder over at daily wireplus it is a really good piece of work o ka time for a a quick thing that i hate things that i hate it there is a tendency and i think it is really bad on the part of both parties to suggest it this next selection is the only election that is ever mander in the country is over if we knon't one i do not to sandito i think t is deary very bad of the country thing's bad for an ny viable democracy if you truly believe that the next election is the last election that justifies pretty much anything it is it is it is it is a disaster in waiting because what is the alternative when you say this the last electin what you really mean is o ka organili grab weapons and go at each other i only americans are preparedto do that orsouled they be prepared to do that because as much as i made dis agree with my fellow americans from new york and california as much as i do not wish their principles to govern me and i wish they would leave me alone i have not given up hope that number one the lose future elections if they push to hard because the vast bulk ofthe american population is not radical left n and number two i nobody wants you have a shooting war with their fellow americans everybody seems weigh to casual about this kennitalk ofn both the right and he left on the left if people jonathan lliar who keep saying this the most important election of our elifetime it the truth is it is not it is not i mean technically speaking every electionthats happening right now is the most im portant election f your lifetime cas it has not been decided yet but let us be real elect in eighteen fifty six the election of james bou can ond was the most important election of your lifetime in eighteen fifty two the election of franklin peers was he most important election of your lifetime but in the grand scheme of american history to that and of being the most important election of anybody's lifetime the answers now is the eihteen sixty election that was te most importan election of everbody's lifetime andyou can only see that in historical retrospect but youwhat when left says this again what they mean is if this is the most important election of your lifetime because it is a battle between democracy and fashism this justifies any level of cheating and that of course drives republicans say well you gots have the motive to cheat why would assumeyou are not going to cheats here is jonathan lamire doing thisretine yesterday weve got a question an mitial asomtions we have got to challenge ourselvs and weve got a fight back with the trut because more than at aelection is on te line and twenty twenty four o neric and de moc resee is ine the line and we have got a get it right jother's no castionof of that i man we hear every four years this is the most important election of our lifetime this thought actually is i think by most by most measures when they tay democracy itselfs on the balle what is the alterntive that mean tht if don trumplins what fations im his arrivein you have to start the french resistance what is that clare you talking about right here a's not just on the left you will suce it on the right son't make huckaby he saying the same thing if the democrat wind the country is basically finished again i do not believe that is the case because i've i believe that the institutions of the united states as as weak as they have been introms o public opinion our lot stronger than people give them credit for i think that the people of the united states are a lot better the me i think the least of th united states sock i think they are terrible but i think t at h generalized american public is not nearly is terrible as our leadst ten to think that they are ere's my cuckaby who is a iu kn a sort of giving the rightwing version of the argme just heard from joscarborough and a jonathan alir do how political opponents to those in power or dout with an third world ictator ships the nat ar opublics in communest regines well it is simple the people in power use their police agencies to arrest theire opponents for made up crimes in an attempt to discredit them bankrupt them imprison them exile then are all of the above and if yeu're not paying attention you may not realize that jobigon is using exactly those tactics to make sure the donal trup tis not his opponent in twenty twenty four here is a problem if these tactics and the working to keep trump from wenning or even running in twenty twenty four it is going to be the last american election that will be decided by ballets rather than bullets o ge i mean is that last line i agreeve the lot of what yeu sangurate there is just the last line that you start to say guis dugin d'you because this is a selfo fil in profcy on both sides if both sides basially decide that this is the last election than it is the last election and i do not think it iswhere theamerican eople are t lomething that is whorthe american people should be i think it is why we have a federal i structure or states and localities actually matter is not being sanguine about american politics i think the stuff that we talk about everydaw tha shot is deeply deeply important but it i think is just as important that we recognize that the best way out of this position is not to declare that the next selection is the last one and that if we fail than its times to grab a tank and that that sort of stuff leads to some pretty bad behavior and sent in any selfa filling prophecy where people really feel they have no alterntive but to do the bad thing that exascerates the prob in the first place already guise the rest of the sho continues right now you are not con one of uss it we den my father jasen cherin if you

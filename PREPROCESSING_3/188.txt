a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in today's epi sode of the show if ye prefer a beep version you can find that at our wibsite this american life doto work from w b easy chicago it is this american life i'm shon coal sitting in for my reglass this is not a story about bicicle theft it is a story about a counterintuitive impulse exhibited by the human species in which a lot of bicicles happend get stolen the first bike belonged to a physical therapist named carry helming her is was in seatle back in two thousand fifteen she wrote her bike to work always locked it up securely always and wen she came down to get it at the end of the day it was gone she felt about this how you might imagin mad ike wi you on my bikin know how mi gen to get home and it is laid and im tired and just frustrit it estan all that the cops were remarkably responsive came right away they were all deeply pessimistic said all the usual things you are not likely to get it back we get reports this all the time usually nothing we can do unless something happens carry was not sure with that man until something did happen she was at work the next day tending to her physical therapy patients only checking her phone now and then between appointments and i remember thing the stacks from the number that i did not know that just said something i may have found your bite an qit whut do i do with that i do not know who you are is the joke is this i tgown mt was the thing tha i crossing my mind a lot is as the somewe cam would were you trying to mathematically figure in your head how the scam might have worked if it was the scam and then i doft know how they would know it with me this is the thing that i kept find of figure out woul they steal my bike an the know it me and then ask me for money and then they moniana and they give me my bike back and they tat no hundred dollars mare something which carry says that wouldha been find with hers better than having no bike anyway know how to respond put the phone down examined more hips and shoulders and knees came back to another text that was your bi stolen i think i may have found that y writ la and son lie ca es is is the same guid ou mor questions and omethike yas it was stolen who are you and then i think that point he probably responded and tad i was looking for a bike fror my wife i was looking for bike for my wife and the sad came up on credulist real questionable this is the guy who was texting dirk ta grout works in marine construction excicelist himself by questionable he means the ad was poorly written listed the bike for way less than it should have cost a couple of blori pictures taken at night nothing whothe hell tikes pictures at night i did atlook in som grougling i found bikan bex it is a sihte where people can register their bikes and report them stolen as carrey had done he said i saw that you posted on bikin that and omthi cody now this is starting to sound a little but morlan jeds but i thought no idea who he is an i think we bot probably around my lunch rate ands he tolds me that he was mad begin to go get the bite and as i witing was i and i remember him they n mi te yan kind of yast about that am getting a little a denal and i an tattinan l pard of me as grats that is all that proble somebody f ye wants to do that by lik ar you not i why d youwhy dy want a do that and be careful lie i that would be the scaries thing mit is noway i woul ever you that dirk did do it arranged to meet the guy selling the bike except when he got to the appointed spot unexpectedly it was three guys to more than him he gives the biker once over careful tho check out the serial number when she got from carry and sure enough it is hers is when i had no idea what i was doing o i a ca have let is piece of paper in my hand with the sereal number and a lookig t these three gs in him hold an allan key in wiy he takes out his phone and subtily dials nine one one and the call ont go through no signal i i lie knows i eh that was the cob's gus they are on their way and as if there were evere any doubt as to the providence of the by one of the guys at the very mention of the police just takes off running hedsgoots off andthere is two guys they are both sitn there a little agitated they do not know fi'm lying and amidst settles pretty steep som think you kdot maybe i could sparto kick one of these guys down the hill sparta kick as hie got on o whn him to do wit the other one but this i i'm tall but i'vehad my askict many times at my friend will tel him not a very good fite and then after several long moments with the three of them just kind of staring at each other as though bidding farewell to a couple of drinking budies for the evening dirk says well guys you knower and count of a stale made which s can it take it through the bike in the back of my tra and than e now calls it is your by have i where should i meet you o i wa i just bethougit i that he palls up then calld my by o an i hi geny the curry go te c pa oa yo von i do not y the pay meet wy i nits ast ss really crazy to me that li the night before my harbroken my bicastol and and the next night bike can mi my byk home already it just ot we arried which brings me to wet the stories about the fact that dirks t actions well seeming to come totally natural to him made no sense from the outside eveng to the person who directly benefited from those actions carry's brain could not stop trying to make sense of it even as she wrode away that night you you just ad this huge an mazing thing for me that was incredibly kind and i'm very youi doi ma let bemore of me and a coss ith me sii do not know or ther's words be wated how how just unusual it is yes would somebody really do this but they goes t be on my byk back for me and then bring it the me why would somebody do this why there is got to be a catch some i catch ba o a but there was not dirk just does telf this if he is driving and he sees a cyclist with the flat tire the idiot that stops on the side of the road wi dou mee help ting as i fuck off no we know oke e me know he likes helping people he can still picture how happy carry looks when he drop the bigoff she was jest tocking i mean stokd absolutely ilated and i seeing all this emotion on her face i i'm not a very e motional ti i but i amy i felt it just a deep sense of accomplishment and it felt o just good that was taid a very specific feeling it is it is the same feeling i now get when i come home from being gone for work for week and my son jumps down the stairs to og me it is al os is grat i have the much itsounds yer describing appreciation yah ye y eye i gus said that very well could be you now just feeling appreciated might have been the trigger the trigget to make you one a keeped in yeyead the trigger to make me one keep doing that and he did keep doling it the fore too long he recovered a bike for a gye from colorado who had just moved o town carry the guy was very grateful to have his bikeback then there was the college student who but dirk a six pack ovike pier after he rescued her bike for her dirk does not really drink dear though the systems ad ministrator who mailed him an envelope of cash which was not even the nicest part of it for dirk i had his thank you ca him a walf for in my office for a long time his methods were pretty consistent always started with obsessively scrolling sites crikes lest and offer up to see what bikes were for sale and then cross referencing those against the stolen bikes on bike indects then he would message the person selling the stolen by and says interested in bying it sometimes he would give the cops oheads oup have them waiting near by to swoop in at just the right moment other times he just confidently and with an almost eary calm say something he i'm not accusing you stealing thes bike i just know it stolen you may have stolen do not care and they would dipicly skudofv took him ten recoveries before he really felt he knew what he was doing after the twentieth one a seatle police detective who specialized and croperty crime gave dirk his direcked line told him to always call and arrange for backe up ahead of time that sting thetwentieth one was significant in a lot of ways actually was not just a bike thav was a home invasion the thieves grabbed everything they could get their hands on dirk is sentially cracked to that case one of the officers on duty that night looked at dirk and asked him the perennial question w wheld you doing this sa gi just feels really good no to help these people has a cot interesting youre robin hood is now robin hood robs from the rich and gives to the poor i guess you are that man and that was tat me that was it i il bike that man wti m hohe it was sticky enough tot i stark people calling him theatal bike bat man bike the reold bat man on roll against thieves it is a they call him teoa the bike bat mabike bat man you are int yattle anda i think bryne and the shattle times broke the story followed by local tevian radio outlets ow the newspapers ind magazines an all of the accounts dirk stayed anonymous he only decided do unmask himself for this story cause he is not doing it any more he says he just has not had time for anything since his kits came along but the news worthiness of it was that some one would go very far out of his way to retrieve property that was not his for people he did not know heas the whole world had the same reaction is carry helming her the first person dirk helped who was mentioned in one of the magazine pieces how te lach is in the article he ri i think she thought i was a weird on a i e dely bikeof course the whole thing seems a lot less weird if you are dirk to groot from his perspective he figured out how to solve this problem and once he figured it out he could not not solve it because no one else was doing it he was somebody is got to do it a kind of knew what to do and it was hard for people to people just did not know i go i do what to do if you find our bik stolen on crexist actually cannot think of a better way to spend your time on this planet and to identify something that is vexing someone else or lot of some one else's and to put yourself into that gap between them and the solution to danarsho and ti tell yo about some remarkable people who do that and why they do it and how it goes or dosn gdo for them stay with us there is the same ich that really stuc of a lot of a sere f to show he might have seen it it is the poto of strollers baby strollers at a train station in poland in short these plish moms anticipating a problem that you cranin refugee mothers might have when they crossed the border clutching their little kids started leaving strollers for them at different points of entry in the fodo they are all lined up on the train platform some fancy some not some knew some with warn tires each one a polish family thinking about what could possibly be helpful when everything else is falling apart and providing it another problem that war has yielded you have proably heard is the lack of access an russia to real accurate information about what is going on brutality of the war essentially the russian propagan to bubble tamping down on public opposition which is what act one of to days shoas about and it is about some one on a personal mission to solve that problem recalling the sact cold coll to action its from preduce rely speagle poliso notas spent the first thirteen years of his life in the eueses are he knows how complicated i can be to live in a world with limited information this was lithaenia in the adies and what polis remembers about living in that world is the distrust and the haziness you had your suspicions a creeping sense that there was something off about the news you were hearing but there was no way to know for sire and no one around you knew either after puten invaded you crane polis reached out to friends in russia to talk about the war these were educated people well red people but the russian version of what was happening made his blood run cold the story they would heard was that russia was just trying to help with the geneside there was gen aside tho russian people going on all the tine and we need to take out their goment i we eopwe will not you tat thegon go on killing russian people in ther we have this need tiny operation military upration going on thet we just taking off the gon in the world russians knew there were no pregnant mothers dying on gernees no levelled cities no did civilians at all some of them told tell me stoies about russians bringing in food in inclosing fo oucranias it was a whole paralel universe of information constructed and policed by puten polis believes the foundations of that universe are more fragile than they look that if the rusian people could really see no what was happening in their name puten's patemptan village bmight crumble some one needed to do something russians could understand the real horror of the war they were fighting and then one day plis was sitting in a meeting and his fun began tobus it was a friend calling to say that he had an idea about how they might solve this russians do not know about the war problem since potis what is funny about russia say i donnot there is nothing funny about russia to me is i they got the sen nembus public you just go on line and you cannot get the hold t at thos nembers we can call them as they talked the two began to piece together a plan what if they built a web sight where you pushed a button and got the name and telephone number of some one somewhere in russia russian speakers from outside puten cealed universe could call in tell russian people one by one person to person all about what was going on polis works an advertising he spent his life trying to convince people to do something they do not currently feel a need to do he knew that hearing and authentic human voice making a passionate days can be a very powerful way to alter some one's behavior you men wat ten ticity has a lot of pown itso jo the way this hearing it tha prom pason whose genin is much more persuasive than reading it on the besin ese i's much more likely to to to to get through still polys was not sure that this was a good idea many russian speakers outside the country were really angry he worried in just pe creating a tool for people to shout at each other polys himself was struggling with his feelings about the russian people do you see them as victims or do you see them as complicit i difficult to distinguish those two things it difficult to distinguish those these things ami'm i'm trying to to put all the sympathy i have into this is it coming from the fact that i thing thas gunna crat e bridge and i'm synical i ot do i truly have sympathy polys did not have a clear answer what he knew was that the scheme had at least the potensial to help shift the tide he put ist outs aside and decided to go forward the polas you can come up with all problems you want you can make a problem that do not exist but if you do not do anything ththing will happen ply sys that he and his colleagues werked around the clock for five days until the webside call russia went live about a weak and a half into the war the landing page featured a large yellow button which random ly generated russian telephone numbers and the side was an immediate hit polys says he long to thirty two thousand calls in the first two days still it was not until wate on launch day that polys himself was aple to sit down and try out this idea he pressed the yellow button then called the number tht appeared on his screen the phone was answered by a ma i told them who i am and and a a a and he stot shouting immediate and i i said i do not wish and anything wrong andjust an ordinary peson trying to connectto people in russia and i said do what is happening there and he shouted at me they a i remember that ther a vilitly he shouted me they are killing ust there and wi trying to save them and he said he cased me any hang up the fence that was my fase conversation a few calls later polys heard the voice of a woman what i finon couls most of women wi wwill a will told humanly to me but that ladte she was sam tht lady yelled at mei i do not know probably seven minutes and she was saying do who i am i sin of course i do not i do not how it lo i do not know which which sedam olin goody tell me please and and she was a i'm the yoter of putin and now i'm in viting my father to take ye of you now i know she is not welli guess she is not a tot of fotin o gay yo cannot be that coincidence or i it gont it but she started play her jokara is tad the thisli t an h who was yo find the baut the waer in was saing madam why are you doing that i truly geneinly won i talk with e about what is a happening in n in ou grane ant cannot can you tell me what about she was that pauli says that many of the calls have been those unreceptive hostile but then every once in a while there is a different kind of call but the man who answered the pone and at first seemed quite friendly sop spoken a polite and wen ive just introduced myself i told iam doing and that why one talk about and and a e kept going with me nicely but at the moment he understood what is about she he shed up but i could feel he is there paulis went forward told the man about the war all the terrors that pulis had seen on teethe poured out of him she he did not pik i was saying those things for probably four or five minutes he was not talking of words and when i finish interestingly he said good by you knont itt touche me he felt he ese me to say good by sa yo dont a which is such a pol i things to do self a knou you heard in his silence what ye e e hip it person breathing but most probably something tha hear very clearly is a fer how i was shocks tat fer has a sound a conte i con tely he what the sound o say but cant hear that e mi busy the day we spoke i watched palus make a bunch of calls to strangers in different parts of fresh e what struck me was the tedium it felt very fazar geala littlecall tell a marketing a marun number there were lot of dead ands ch woice male but every once in a while palla scapthro at the breing that menese wit paules yesam le thois ya woln't your program it was when youre se and we

a good coll palis makes calls these several times a week he spends hours on the found sometimes he gets people the quiet man listeners who connact but mostly paula says people are screaming and oddly he thinks that those calls prea the best to me screaming people iavsonly the once thif we needs to talks when he mean cor te these cas these ar the suporters of what is going on a i in e it it is is ispleasing and and in and nis for me to have that nose con vhe sation was as a pacion that i had the settle of people he noice to have the conversation wit those people bat is the go is not about having in u s is a ba some ote people that apaswayte at that they di a goo thing in t in eucrane to and a stand that they not dong the thingin ra polis is realistic about what this approach will are conflesh he says about seventy five per cent of the russian populations up ports prudent and those people are not in a suddenly take to the streets but he figures he might nedge them a little that when they see their neighbors protesting instead of reaching out to the police to let them know they might paus ask themselves if that is really the best thing to do that is why even when some one is yelling plis tries persevere emotionally how hard is it for you to withstand the screaming at i subon is is very had is is a amogashas i donknow how to i e i a you read a travel somewhere ye in i it

people kill to day ther pred li stady the bet li how i gather to a cols yepolis told me he would never nowfer sure whether anything he was doing made even a wit of difference but even if these calls were a drop of water for a forest fire poulis still thought it was important to try most of the things people a dee most probably will have thery little or no empiti all that the day was doing flows together mi pa a flows togther with ecran an children the there is doing flowers was ucranan children will stop the wid russh in in crate i most probably not but that sends of people coming together in explicitly trying to do something even if that' futilge makes us all of a trong pouli says since the websid launched they have been tracking the country is where people were calling from he told me that at first calls fror mostly from where he was with a wania but soon he and is collegues noticed it was spreading the idea hopping from one country to the next until they saw that russian speakers from all over the world we are reaching out to the people inside prudence bubble they would seen the same problem polisted and they were all trying their best toes all that with him a le speagle as one of the producers of orsha a to zo unto others on the first day of the war there were thirty visitors to the zuand kevy crane on the ninth day of the war there were none no paying visitors that was the day washington post reporter chavon o grady an a couple of her colleagues went there to meet the zukeepers chavant had been wondering about the people in eucrane who were still working while the country had been under se ege not just military but everye day workers pharmisists grocerystore employs it is the same thought a lot of us have had about essential workers during the pandemac except in this case theye wre literally bombs going off around them che wanted to know what it was to do their jobs now under what ar probably the most extreme circumstances possible they went to the zoo in the afternoon for a few rushed hours before curfew chvant said was earie the giant colorful jeraff stafctue at the entrance after they had just passed through several check points to get there the winding paths were vertually empty the zoo keepers were keeping the animals inside hardly because of the cold and also because the animals could be killed if they came out for some exercise the wrong moment the zoo is right near a military facility that might be targeted by russian forces they were worried about arrant missiles and tod about fifty staffers out of the usual three hundred seventy five had stayed behind to look after the animals as chavan what was behind their decision to stick it out the ones i spoke to did not make it sound a decision it was not an option the staff members really felt to responsibility to stay that that would be the way that they would spend the war cause there is no one else right right if they left what do you think would happen would there be anybody that would leap over the zoo wallzo no the animals would die four thousand animals be locked away in their pens an enclosures slowly starving to death if the hydration did not get them first and not just anyone can do this job in take special skill in knowledge the different animals dietary needs some of the animals need to live at different temperatures than others it is a hefty enough task during peace time and of course lots of aspects of te jobb ar different in a wars own first of all the zoo keepers are mainly living at the zoo which they normally would not appi to i an the staff move some of their family is ten and the head of the zoo curillo chanton moved his elderly mother into the zoo with him to in order to care for her and the animals is it that they cannot live at home or they just thought it was safer at the zo it is both in some cases may be they live in a part of town that could eventually be cut off ore mad very difficult to get between the zoo and home in which case they would be separated from each other and it is also that some of them live in neighborhoods that have already been targeted by strikes are they sleeping with the animals every night as staff member has been sleeping with the elephant horace the elephanatoo comfort him because elephants are really sensitive in general they also have enormous ears and really good hearing the booms and the sirens have been especially upsetting to him to the point that he is been put on setatives and at night he was apparently waking op walking around exivitting signs of etreme stress and they were worried about him that one of the staff members has volunteered to just stay in there with him and when he get stressed at night they speak to him an a kind of calming voics they feed him his favorite snacks of apples and things that and just kind ofe talk him down after any booms until he can go back to sleep some of the staffers in their families occasionally sleep in an acquarium that still under construction underground bunker link chavant told me you could zee were one day hopefully will be glass in fit c bould right now there all kinds of cots with pillows and sleeping bags on them chavan imagine how nice and cool it will be to hang out down there during the summer months if an when they can finish building it during thei towr the zoo the zoo keepers hand a hvan an apple and showeder had a feet horas we elephant with sle trouble they visited tony the gorilla as also been agitated not because of the explosions necessarily hes haid no interaction with guests and apparently misses at lot at visibly excited when his hamler finally showed up also spat out his lunch all over one of chivan's collegues for some reason iththe n in the administration building one of the animal hanmlers was feeding a brand new baby leamer his incredibly small soft delicate thing specially compared to the chaos hit was born into they named him by roc tar hich as a kind of turkish drone the granians are deflying against the russians ther're thinking naming his sibling javelin chivan asked the zupkeepers which of the animals were the least concern about all the explosions and sirens the crocodiles they said and the alligator all they cure about his eating but as interesting as you found the animals it was really the people she was there to learn about one of the zupkeepers who interested her most was ivan ribchanko whostill com meds to the zou from home on his bike and i was interested when i saw him because he was feeding a banana to it draf and the arrad sirons had just gone off we coud hear booms in the background and both he and the draghts just did not react at all they just continued with the feeding and he was just being really gentle and sweet with the dragh and we were all kind of looking round should we take cover do you think it' ka and they were were jusgin to keep eeting this banana and i asked him why are you still here hes a young man of fighting age heis thirty three most guis his age have probably volunteered for the forsays are doing something were directly ofrelyded two the war effort but he did not see it that way at all i mean he said that his responsibility is the dragts the deer and horses at the zoo and his job is a public service and that is his contribution to the to the fight to the war effert ye he really saw i he did which is something chivanis seen a lot of she says thi people whove chosen to stay and continued doing their jobs an in the fighting all of them see what they are doing as ther roll in the defending of eu crane after all along with staving off the day to day attacks they also need to preserve any pockets of normal see they can the things they had before the invasion and that will means still having is zo when the war ends one day you can rea chivan's article for the washington post about that keep zoo at washington postat com coming up being a voice for the voiceless inpossibly the most mccob and yet literal meaning of that phrase that is in a minute from chicago public radio wone our programme continues it is this american life i'm schon coal an frier glass today's programm will some one had to do something stories about some one's stepping up taking it upon themselves to tackle some problem larger small for the greater good or just for a discreet few cass who else is going to we have reached dack three of our show act three one last thing after i go all the people tackling problems in the show up to this point identified themselves what needed to be done in this next story the

cornfell one of the producers of ourshel acke for a funny thing happened when we were already at the theatre this last story's a counter example of sorts were ofd be forgiven for thinking did somebony has to do something ere anyway thas what a lot of people thought in this case hollagoffy wall has the story here is what happened a group of people went to a movy theatre near loss angelis to see the lost city it was a seven piam showing but the projector was broken every one in the audience was stuck waiting ten minutes twenty and then a woman from the audience walked down to the front of the theatre in front of everyone anstarted doing stand up wo mi hanpeopleoinin any single moms in the house she says there is short clips of this on line she is in a bees dress long straight hair weaving her arms all over the place trying to project her voice to the back of the theatr the act is chaatic and hard to follow she is pretty all over the place ona shee marry she does voices pshe chance maer san on yo ai ungl bullyi and she sings no the is er people who showed up to see sandra bullock and channing teedan roam around in the jungle insteid they got this i hants her maudiance members who are not happy about that switch one of them says a woman has decided to try her stand up out on us it is not good another one says i want a crawl out of my skin and die in one of the vidios posted on line you can hear some one in the audience actually interrupt her act to yell put us out of our misery sh ot herr i nothe woman's response this is what got me she says you wandown here en ete do you want to come down here try to entertain people as if entertaining everyone in the theatre was a job some one obviously hav to do whis to walcomy through the thinking of nominating yourself to be the one to do that i'm very alfoken i have calpin calking to people ie olt et ner abat a crowd o i ut nobody alwul going i on my agold creadit can gate everyone the woman's name is tiffany king she is forty two years old letina lives in less angelis she is one eight year old daughter she does many things waitresses sings she does college on line ansometimes to stand up and the way tifany king anded up performing unsolicited comedy that night there is the story on the in her net and then there is her story which is different shifany says she took her daughter to the movies that night o mor woenbe onin darty and i wunn only a wi im mig bega my go her ha wen a gan o lik a pi on will bein part every one was just sitting around tifany says waiting she turns to her daughter and says wouldn it be funny if i go introduce the movy i'm with the theatere do it her daughter says tifany gets up in front of everyon hello welcome to the theatere we are glad to have you the show will be starting shortly and then she sas just getting i'm a camedian but i do hope you all have good night and she sits down but then there is still waiting and waiting and nobody's doing anything si tiffany gets up again desids i'm mi will find out was going on she goes down to the labby a guy tells her the projector's brok in they are working on it she told them we are sweating crazy in there the gui says they would work on the a c then tiffany says she went back to the theatre and walked up front shust to tell everyone what was going on she said the projector's broke in they are working on it they know or hoton her t they will try to gat the a c back an won wor laking o cuple of e fine any ga o i han'te your commetin can celp can gonol sure an i dot idonly we weter hasitating becaus i to help wi we can happen to be people happy wo the co cang and what did it feel when you started telling jokes ahe wy i would a py randon queen yo ii would as try to tring to gether on queng oit would not be a popi for my daughter she went with a truly random collection of jokes and from tifany's perspective it was going fine people were laughing claughing everything a going everything co great an help egil hel haple me i y we no put a cot of her memory it was only the next day that tifany learned some of her audience had not appreciated being subjected to an unwanted comedy show but for me knowing that tifany started as a person who as trying to deliver information about the movy does tot change things she was the one person trying to get answers to a problem that a whole room full of people shared she was trying to pass on information and it turned in to this because this is tifany i there is what i was thinking when tifany recounted this experience to me i was thinking about when i was at the air port and i was instructed to stand in a line for a desk that had no person at it i stood there anyway a long line of other people said there any way too quietly except for one woman who could not bear it who was actively loudly shouting to every one and no one walking by that we needed help i kept looking down i'm not with her but i was also glad for her because ultimately she got some one to help us to tell us that we actually needed to go to a different desk where there was a person where the prin ter was working and the yelling woman she led the way we all followed her my point is the person who takes it upon themselves to do something they do not always do it in the way you would they are not perfect but neither are we waiting in mine for the desk with no persong or for the movy that is not starting l when you are sitting in a theatrfule of people who are not doing anything does it is it as mystifying to you that people would not want to do something as it is to some one me that you would want to do something we all ta happened i flashed back in my lind her moment an hiful when i think it wa five clot but we had te going aanother room toalkin o the clot nmi thing i iing

o popem it we ca all the problem aand be helpful in a moment i asked did she consider that this was as situation where maybe no one needed help nobody needed to do anything tiffany said no the thought never crossed her mind which i think is probably an important part of being a person who rushes to be helpful e person who ats you cannot ask yourself that question ntoton toti too a jofolt is one of

it are show we fon we were not seeing many stories whe we got to know anybody very well we they were what exac could they expect it was going to come out of the protest given chinas an chansgense three of us arrived in hong kong in in september me an amanual an o co work or dian wirl ave to say one of things that was fascinating giving the ugly state of democracy hering the united states lately was to be among many young people who believe intensily in democratic ideals and yearned deeply for the basics bike normal elections free speech and free assembly though just in he last tfree weeks since we got to hong kong we have watch tha situation changed dramatically it is gotten much more violent harshneou measures by the government this hour we have the story of the change that we witness what we think it might mean if you have not been following the story at all may be been setting this one out work in a catch you up on what you need to know we have all sorts of people from all sides of this that we want you to meet e b easy chicago it is this american life this wee over sees with a lot of people who have some very american values stay with us a gon the curse generation a case o what politicized thousands thousands people this much that the have dropped their normal lives and the coming out every single week in to protest it is now been eighteen straight weeks take genifer for instance she somebody worked at abercronbian fitch during college show me in the bust of protest that is why r enguish is good somebody wanted to be a singer i shuld got a chance to go pro

parent mi ta said the same exact thing i thougt a macken drate statby tril sa i is a watch lee e s i hadof this le watching internette savy college grad in er first office jot how did she and up protesting in the street every week and with tens or ani may be its hundreds of thousands of years o for starters genivers twenty two which means she is part of a special generation and hong ng an bor i hong conny mac sata rit be for hand ofer and here is a protestor were calling alice and im fine an nineteen ninety seven here is her friend to a con tiffany im also boy nine yinety seven you cadnt coll me you and i'm born a noneteen noty seven sin ninety ninety seveny sa year when hoon was headed over ba china fr the pritish te galis jus pause on these twenty two yearolds for a minute for some quick history as you may or may not know hon cong sits on the edge o main land china ra and was a british colony for a really long time starting in the ninetenth century and the finally nineteen ninety seven the british got out i handed it over to china and the idea was thes can be a fifty year transition period after fifty years china wil fully be in charge but during that fifty years hong cong would be a democracy now o colly people a to run hoy call that is the last british governor of hn kong during the hand over ceremony ind nineteen ninety seven that is the promis a that i's the unshakable destiny and to be queer hongkong had not been a democracy undo britain but the were gin t transition towards it of er bunch of years and the hope was after fifty years in twenty forty seven he chinese government let them stay a democracy which it th time did not seem a crazy idea chin was opening up in all kinds of ways though was not quare how this was going to play out and at the end of the day after fifty years and the yoar twenty forty seven china was goin to be able to do whatever it wanted in hon kong these are the children born the year that cock started ticking andif you heard of the phrase curse generation yes sir it whats this jok o morude tin teen oi te savenu people it was he was pretty much a jok o pretty much a funny thing to us as we we firs jok about it ats frairly pi ra schools but at hesttaagon yous just foiing joking ou on for all those years eriginary the joke had to do with the coincidence there were curse cause of some weird bad lock during some big childhood milstones say al went though together the year of their kindogarden graduation the sars virus had hong kong and city shut down graduations were cancild six years later when they shuldhave had their elementary school graduation same thiyg happen again but a swine flew an genian remembers that a friend stoke that wen they graduated high school it was going to be a bola and that is when they started using the word curse i think that was the time arou the time the jaca ralin rot hareporte and te curst child ye many of us older the curseca always say that we ar the chosen whe cis hireporta was to chos that all of us lof hirimoder we always ta owere the chosen when we have to face something sbeshoin her life or we are the curst to on we have to facibly bat or face something significant genifor says i chosen one side of things didn really kickin to their senior year of high school thas twenty fourteen they were seventeen the seventeenth years since the hand over and that your people in hon congre still expecting that mangland china was going to let them start holding full on elections with they could choose theirown waters as promised back in nineteen ninety seven nd that year china announced it was not goin a happa sled to a movement called the umbrella movement headed by young peopleteen agr we worned to politics in this public school classes that all these twenty twee year olds talk about is being instrumental in ther thinkin classes the began as part ofthe hand oer called liberal studies classes ut explained among other things promises of nineteen ninety seven n the rites as hon cong citi zens e te stre mostom for the first time demanding the boat carring umbrellas thousands of people in a vast procession down the streets and pro testmovement that was almost entirely peaceol and they lost did not get the boat after three months the protest ended alice works for amoti national company in netry lof a job bout a college she is management trainase shsays she went to some protest back then out of salidarity with her peers i was just amazed by the other tudis but she dim get all the politics that changed in june twenty nineteen when honcon introduced the bill that would allow mangland china to extra dit people from hong kong to be tried and punished in china under chinese law this was sene is a new and very menacing and croachmen on the rights of hong kong citizens since nineteen ninety seven they would been ruled by hong kongas and hong kong courts everybody as presumed innocent with the rights we knowin most democratic countries now anybody could get thrown into the prisons and courts of comminis china i say that that that was the time when i first feel awaken when i'm truly understanding wa happening when i first go t the macho the no extradition bill and on i was very very amotiona at that time becaus there is only around seven million people an hong kong that one million voncon the street with the same de mont with the same wish of hoping hon con to remain its current day whenting honcon to stay lik it is with its own laws seperate from china a week later too many people came out at the time i was diling fery only o this is touching wise feevl united and then the next second the gofr men just declares that oh we heard your foice that were we will be continuin on the bill on tisday that was a really big contrast and in the morning you see how peaceful things wer that at nih you see t polise coming out and stoppe brutally hitting people i was it was really unforgetabl to me because that was the first time when i witness with my real hi that the polis is chasing people they are chasing students who did not do anything and stop to bid the and arrest them other twenty to yoar olds also ton us how radicalizing its ben to see plest ter gassing and beating peaceful protestors and this point i understand this before we got to hon on a lot of the emotion driving the protest it is just about the police because the government is separting them to do such things and there is no panalty for them even if they are doing things that are completely and esceptible to every one bee corst nobody knows wher this is gong to we by twenty forty seven we china fully takes of her hn con but fe ganifering lots of other people her age things were starting to feel pretty ominus was ont con going to become just any other chinese city round by the communus when your fifty what do you pictyure life here will be i can pak cha that am i wild be super depress cas i superlite commen on politicothine i

over the city with open arms and i want of them gaine to feel that way that is an a minute cicago bo bagredio wen our programm continues tis meri can life from our glass to day we are returning to a program that we first broad cast this past fall about the protests and hong kong i travelled hongkong with my coworkers dian wo and a manuel barry under the new national scirtigall the china put into affect t couple weeks ago an hong kong many of the things that these protestr said to as bact tan that you are hearing the sower could the eredically be prosecuted we have changed nearg everybody's name we will ind the show today with an interview that i did this month about that law with janifer who heard the first after the show for now we have arrived at at three of our programme ac three good cop dad cop 's an american visiting hong cong for the first time one of the things ta kind of kulled me was hearing that before the last few years of pro test people were really into the police they were trusted they were respected and it was only the last few years especiallythe less you months of protest that changed ou that at a rally act she saw people chanting at a row of capts that they hoped that they and their families would die and feelings abat who decide with the police of the protesters theyve got in intense it is taring families a paret on the telegram ap there is a whole channel for protestors who get kicked out by their parents and need a place to live all new grew up in honcong he knows a family that is very far part on this the son is a protester the dad is a re tired police officer and ont had thim sit down and do what nobody in honongis doing talk to each other there is really no dialogued between police and protesters anywhere in honcong as far as we could tell and can i say listening to thes story to day nine months after we firs broadtested after weeks of protest against police violence acrossin tated states i really do wonder how common this kind of experience is in our country anyway here is out i've known this family since i was sixs i knew them because of my friend jonathan i wrote the schoolbus with him everydan his father petear was the first policeman i knew in real life i was excited to talk to him because you never hear what the police think about the protests police here are not really allowed to halk to the press peters retired but still very connected to the forse before the family all sat down together i asked pece has to get together with me and my producer emanuel i had not seen him since i was twelve bact then people call me you reton which means fishboll because the cantinyse for fish sounds myster na you and because i was fact i will not recognize you on the stret i will not i will not ale sir canters o e all rit i i guess as a compliment that hese we recu e have is were fat as a kid i liked peter he take time off work to stop y during recess and by us chips and other snacks my frend jonathan would half his birthy parties at the police station which we loved big barbicus ar the policeman around peter was the cool tad people in honcon trusted even reve the police fact then one of the most popular to he shos was a cop show tauten seter were the police wer heroes ter peter's har is gray now he is tall athletic he placed tennis by my manicnam in tennis do not know why my nanamen tennis is a federa better fetter i teter rogen radan i do not know why may be my skill ananotheher won hestol likes is that jokes i cannot imagine petare ever doing what i've been seeing in these vidios beating up unarmed protesters kicking people on the ground i thought surely he would object to some of those things and that his fiews would be complicated from what you have seen in recen months has pn anything that the police has on that you think you would disagree with nothing is perfect by s as a hole in general i seen the putis tat doing doingthe pretty good jo if it is in ot the police force in or the countries i just look at the carssuties look look just lo at the collim of fatal eo numbers it will not i will not be zero i asked him about different situations te police having criticise as git i even show him vitios off police brutally arresting people things i think are clearly wrong but h e always seems to have a justification for the way police behve he says your judging the police pas on what you see in these clips that is not fair you do not know what the officer was facings the sosio media only show the part the police hiting people but one minute a go they bee aceck by loss of people one minute later te reet to to the to the mop o attacking them hat you can see is one minute after but yeu deed not see the full picture he is not conflitset about police and he isnhe very sympathetic sof protestors he thinks the protest out the strying hon hong the expedition of this oke he does not think china wo and free sweecian hong hon and protestes fear of china is way overblown and i eve hong con bes par of china come on wick up people wick up disis te f where the china is good or bet hong con is parof china if you do not it those people waving the nesdes fag waving the youdin jeck fat if engnand tiks to ouven go t youin good england y you go to forrther god california ye go go if trom tics to ye go i'd already been worried how this family conversation was going to go hearing what peter believed did not help peter told me he understands bhat jonathan goes the protest but does not ask him aboutted because he does not want any details jonathan said he does not ask istand what he thinks of the way police beet and to gas protestors for the same reason it is if he says something he ily something thatis complety does mexsens to me brings him down is as a preson i jus i would fee tit ustes yead not not who i thoutt he wos in etle ecasyou think that can be ye fo coe this family does not talk about the protest at all tenas yes sarcer yes pat great but no politics til to night thif agreed it to have the conversation they have een avoiding after thens jonathan sman tousof washess tadicies wat e i recognize the song writes away i'm surprised she is hmming in front of peter is the protestors new anthem glory to hong ongs althar is s on jonathan side was yeshe works with lawyers including som in the prodemocracy camp i i ask if peter knows what that song is she says maybe in gon othat is kind of how it is been going between her and her husband no real discussion but the occasional pass ove the gressof comment while the watching the news always some passiv e gressof coming during dishes this is another reason jonathan avoids bringing up the protests he does not want to start oe fight between his parents al wer the worse senaryo be somei moving out i guess yo because te cannot stend it any more ye i igess living apart would be the worse case arie i believe gus that by sort of and officially means then you no longer to get iso y that could be his man or his tad or him we all set at dinner table i do not know why they agre to talk about this maybe just because i've known them for long an i assir wi or i hope maybe part of tam wanted to talk and i was just a good excuse you peters facing me and jonathan and alvha are next to meyou go jonahan has their dalk loky nam not to the arfol character on his landi aga sam porin to the conversations tores with all of them saying in different ways it is fine that we do not talk about this we all have mutual respect in wen ta muta respect teatiaevor instead of talking to each other or looking at each other the talking to me or looking at the dag it fews all very careful proper and calm o this continues for half an hour then everything changes when peter uses the word on compromise te compromiser tall he i compromise tit is bacically the government line ings that is what honcos chief execudtove carry lamp says that the protestors should stalp protesthing and after that the two sides can talk mi althan an jonathan hear that is meaning the protestors should back dour they both lay in sir peter te le wais your your mangem com ten ta ams im toma it a aand that a al aica johnte incin do on alvhar says the police arether once who need to change they have to calm the situation peter says the police are doing their charbi do not know why when the police arres people for fighting or breaking stuff its treat us merd it is a legal sol arrested no prive tat the po aa a nibodygover go coba avacomalilf ftolete me jonathan says ok yes arrestem tut how much forced us the police need to use sometimes the person just asks the police a question and they still get arrested or eaten wo people who are already on the ground neiton subdued they still get beten wi adan peter does not respond t hegabos then they argue openly argue for the first time about one of the protestors main the mands ssomething the government refused to butch onerto start an independent investigation into police behavior considy a but but toga ivated e ade peter keeps repeating the same thing over and over lik hesmen back into a corner that there is no need for independent investigation ow wes on the right time mi yol tho les ayosi saalas the oga the sheted already has a system in place or to investigate complaints about the police coming which yiu on your gum mi yow tat to d they talk a little longer but it does not go anywhere alvar tells me later she had other things she could have brought up but decided against it she did not want her husbands a few traps the word she used was say calk which translates as that corner no place to go preserving the family was more importante to her than trying to win an arguments later jonathan told me he still loves his thad but he is given up hope that his father could be a reasonable human being at least when it comes to the police when i starathan this i was kind of ni e i thought maybe jonathan and his mother and father people who actually want to understand each othe ce talk about this in a productive manner and that if they could maybe they was hoped that the rest of us could but now i do not have lot of hor ao new hese nermanly reportov o bewage wy wie sho pulse chinnistan is bry the cress and alba and out in seriously about leaving concon petersict for slowboat to china s what about all the people living in concon who have no problem with china who china this lot of them and they hold their own demonstrations which are pretty small flake parties wee flash mobs show up mals wave chinese flags and seeing the chinese national an them and the bigit to celebrat china normally would be october first national day the anniversary if the communest party founding them modern chinese state and the sheres con be big one it was the seventyith anniversary and the people who support manland china were kind of resentful cause this day was must to be the shuge holiday for them but anticipating massive protest the city shut down fi worshrecancel trains were not running almost all the malls were going to be closed the protesters had ruined the day again on defiance the pro china people organized an anthem singing party for the morning of the first our coworker dian wo went the party took place at eight thirty in the morning on a boat not just any boat on the star farry thi iconic concon commeter lash sight seeing boat on the harbor the fairies are these beautiful old boats from colonial times with names silver star northern star twinkling star and today one of the is gittito get completely covered with bright bright chinese flags a couple dozen people are gathering at the fairy termanal there mostly strangers now each other wastey from previous lashmops and get togethers a oga i live china they shap tesetins a support the polite fina fining liny thing about it all these people up early on their day off on getting on a boat to sing the nashioni ant them together it is also a little dark because there is a real thret of violence against people who do not support the protest one of these flag parties two weeks ago at amall devolved into a brawl and protesters showed up bpeople on boath sides got beet up and going out on a fairy to shout prochina sugans is stre teacheck once here on the boat out at sea you ought to be safe from an conter protest as one guy put it all would be livin in tero for the last we muss be o sid the people on the otherside the the riders there the really you that the ter rusnttats ers they mak you fe that you should be afraid of speaking up ay secing all what gains som because the organizet in the termanal every one gathers in a semy circle holding special holiday issues of the china daily and singing the chinese nashial ant them togeter tho see l ee i t's a little shaky the guy leading et told me he just learned the words a couple weeks ago most of the people here best as i can tell are not mainlander s who grew up with the andthem ones they talked to were all from hon cong being this into china is new for them something that only happened when the protest got bad enaug that they found themselves rallying around this new flag and it is not always comfortable i'm getting on the boat with daniel the guy who was graping about being tarrize when some one puts a heart sheepstatanaa the sais at a chiny i ias a inia es rus a feelli printen about this ot why i los i co out ret compens ol ot people ye on lot te most re t red in the cray on box of the honcon crotest preferst to being pro china firsis blew for the government and yellow for the protusters daniel almost did not come this morning actually it is not really hi scen he sees being this patriatic about china is kind of dorkey moreover i always my friend si woul never one a live in china becaurs at thereis a low things in china that a i can a sat if i were to before to live in china the two things he canicat that we and of talking about are the lack of free fpeech and sensord access to the inner nat ona but the truth ist i liven honkon and i get to retain my almost un check freedom for twenty more years and is such a sweet hatyou for honon people and we ded od to him that after twenty eight years its very possible tis freedoms wul disappear us freedom when he had the same response that i heard from other people who do not the her testus rus he was well sure i maybe well i yess i you talking me to a precare the youne mus prospect ivs but a ha but in a change for the freedom that the fie for the recan have i and there destroying long order and a an the balance o rtit ea if i wilh a huse between this if chance i e no to ave on order i will need to sacrifice to freedom the say much hance we would have in hon con i wul us up tat that this is unasceptible the whole a mogin iyes taas revolution an the have the the on o cones complete unasceptible i will give up the freedom the the way they do in china to satisn n it is a big jon fram i could never live in china too i would sagrifices my freedom dust toget tus to sto but the intensity of the protests and his frostration was whet hes experienceing in the city ave driven him to at least trina on this extrem idea daniels farty morks in finians he lived in the ouast for twelve years he is of a buffian reads for the cicago bears as he likes te tonatials nefens he says he was 'n poltically in vovede for oul best wen to one of the big people prosust last raingmarta watch then to pritois it paon but that change one may when he was lac ing a live stream of the young protestors storming the ledgesplat of coms uncles he was surprised how ferocious they semed isow even the police officers looked a little scarin that at that moment i sometly realiss a we a tu their close to the revolution the could happen just never occur to me that hon con witd go through that this both stun and ansiety about unknown an sid witho thinks things can change abruptly if there resent a revolution is can force te hand of the chinese government to crack down on it violently an and that t anything can happen but gi i could lose all the privilege i have i hon con to thisn protection of commolaw freedom of speech but also feed must speech protecte by common law tand tot not nobody chant enjoy these freedom but if the guess too ey a if it ges tu to in pointant we can lose on of these privileges which i treasure he woke up the next morning to see that the covridge was wall to wall about police brutality to daniel it seemed every one was leaving out the fact that the protesters had started at which seemed deeply on just to the police and ta thats when i stot at the turning blue bwhen ta when i felt that tha police wors me unfairly i to my sid i chose to be on the police ide other people sited against the protest for different reasons ae big one i heard was the distruption te caust the security guard told me he had to transfer four times toget home one night because of some washon downs a women tring to get cast out of an etiam that had been destroyed by protessters said if you roud of the government take it out on the government ther only hearding people me a man said to me sadly honcong is our hom why are they destroyina the crowd on the bout finishes elting out the national anthom the second time when suddenly everyone rushes to the ralime ii a a a a a a a everyone cramd together on one side in a position that is a little precarious thas kind of daniels wore ald right now he felt plesed to choose a team it are not these are his new people he does not think them exactly but he feels more alined with these chinese nationalists on this boat waving at the police than with the angry protester is gaing up on them even if those cartesters ultimately on the samething he does to preserve their freedoms in hoho e als itting on the ever deck of the sa hide this was actually the first time daniel had ever sung the national anthem in public he told me late ar home as he sang he was surprised to find that he felt something dianwu shodruck thed daniel last week with h passing of the national scurity law he blames the protesters for killing the hong cong than he cherished bus as he acceptsed as the only biable future one of the first things by the way that he did when he found out about the law passing was changed his facebook profile back to his

do you feel any relief from that no it will not be i cannot be a relief cas we are bein su pess that we cannot speak tit that can not be in relief that is something that is more a suppression epen

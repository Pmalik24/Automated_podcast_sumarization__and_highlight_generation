to me again the perfecx sound track to my american summer americais real american is ilwas thet on my god iamerican things are happening to me i ges yot i said i the beginning i shurdit a is that delihe it was doing that summer bim says because was full of moments of delight she struged to really take notice of that feeling i thing of it as a thing a thing that you it was just enjoyable she thought tha feeling seemed important somehow and i thought hcae this feeling is something worse repeating and the idea that you can go and look for delight and you might find it was i think fully plantit that summer ou know in me ye lik if i actively sort out delight i might be able to find it and replicate it for ever i thought t cae will just keep doing that that was kind of a way of organizing my life by the way very unbritish way to rn ie her imself to embrace te light hartily and unself consciously fundamentally i'm fighting against every urging me which is kind of do not do not do that because i'm i'm still british i cannot help that i'm always just thinking to myself just a a was that too much i feel by feel very much somebody is disapproving nan yet stop that that is too much omission there is a reason why our national sound is a tut stopsthaits an admonishment is ike stop it they used to be a talk show and the the theme song was a little chald singing this very sing songyour voice it will never wa itll nevawim thaho i tie weis thing i that would never be aser i just at this sole voice and an all the other tae corus of voices jois it i'll ne mti t is ma eery o mice i don a har that is the spirit of prison thes is poet that i dis covered and a couple of years ago is called rosgay and he is written a book where he basically keeps track of the things that delight him and that is things that is people thats moment whatever and the word he used was negligence he said it is a negligence if people doen't take the time to honor the things that they take delight in the more importantly that they share the things that they take delight in and if you do not do that there is there is a loss ther you have to do it to achieve humanity you have to share delight and that is what we can be doing today rit yes that is exactly what was oto bedoing to day we gan a think about what delights us hyit delights ats whites importance to cultivate delight and with that on me just hand over t showed you your hos te show from here i ceen to py we sitin to be the asy chicago i readit i can hid it is it d b easy hed sure o cet from doubl b eas at chicago it is this american light an they mighy one me say with us at one the job of delight it is one thing to be a tuned to delight but i's quite another to scrape off e sample stick it on a slight and place it onder a microscop enter rosgay the paret i was talking about a moment ago ros is an english professor at indiana university and a couple of years ago he embarked on a specific mission to think about delight he made it a practice in fact for one calender year ros would ask himself what delights me and then he would write it down he set rules he would do it every day he would drop them quickly and every single delight would be written my hand he called them essay its some of these i say its eventually became a book the book of delight hee's ros reading an except of delight number eighty from the book to moto on board in his living room in bloomington would you do not know until you carry a tomato seedling through the ar port non to a plain is it carrying a tomato seedling throug the ir port non to a plain will make people smile at you almost your carrying a baby i did not know this until today carrying my little tomato about three or four inches high in its four inch plastic startapat which my friend michael gave to me smirking about how i was going to get at home something about this at first felt noddy that comparing at tomate a to a baby but carring the tomate on to the plain and i slit the thing into my bag whod going through security which made then pull the bag for inspection when the security gui sawhit wath a tomato smiled and said i donnow how to check that have a good day but i quickly realized o one of its tems which i almost wrote his arms whit is broke in from the jasling and it only had four of them i decided i'd better just carry it out in the open and the shower of lave began before boarding the final leg of my flight one of the workers sayd ice tomato which i do not think was a comelen and the flight at tendent asked about the tomato at least five times not in exaggeration every time calling it my tomato where is my tomado how is my tomado he did not lose my tomato did you she even't directed me to an open seat in the eg xit ro i you gas go sit there and stretch out i gathered my things and set the lo guy in the window seats a she could look out when i got my water i poured some into the logi soil when we got bumpy i put my hand on the lowguis container careful not to snap another armor and when we landed an the pilot put the breaks on hard my arm reflectsively when across the sea holding the logian place the way my dads arm would when he had to break in that car without seetbouts to speak ou in one of my very favorite gestures in the encyclopedia a human gestures the book of delights is a series of daily snap shots into one man's habits and pleasures if you ever wanted an essay about the specific sensation of a plying cokenon oil to a shower damp body that would be delight number oneon one eports an the people ross encounters in them come ap potedit his garden will be spent a very delightful afternoon tooking about bumble bees and potatoes is the location of many a delight some of the delights in the book were things that surprised him while others were looking back in time memories of people no longer here a lot of them featured familiar faces ind familiar places ross was getting to reassess his environment and consider it throuh renew lends a delightful lins i was learning as i's going and frankly s pri learning how my sob these things delighted me the question is always wise i delightly what does it do to a person to study delight or as it inmurges to study joy every single day for a year what do you discover one of the things he discovered is the mechanics of how to fined delight every day as a discipline because delight does not just arive you needs to actively good looking for it beit it in a state ov ah thi try to train your curiosity e try to train the sense of that knoing delight curiosity a really tied out you have to be o kay with that knowing things you have to be actually invested and happy about nat knowing things the book of delights is a peculiar thing an undertaking of serious ecademic rigur at also makes you feel good those things ot meant to go together the book offers up many sorts on what delightes or what it could be but it never definds it explicitly the take away is that delight while importante is hard to pin down reading the book and toking to ross about this make me feel i was floating on a chemically enhanced but perfectly legal in eleven states cloud i began to think of him as a sort of personal delight to and my questions for him began to take on the strong wift of a petuli justing did you end up with a grand unifying theory on what delight is no a no but i did and that whih what feels a kind of beginning in theory of what joys and li i dust attiv and delight is their butterflies flied around and landing on the thing that is jo right see petulin to ross an important part of delight is that it is an invitation by loving something we allow other people an opportunity to love it too sharing tapping some one on the shoulder to say hey look often i feel i've had the experience of walking through the world and that saying ything in that somwars did you see how that you kno you do not see it util you see it that

show the show of delights stories about how we go about making and feeling and actively seeking out delights which is all around us by the way the poet rosgay ambassadif a deli t rites about a time he was in new yok and a man feeding a pigeon touched on his shoulder he looks closer and sees the bird dipping its head in the hand the mand must have been holding very near to his own face that the feeding was not only cauntofromantic but aluited to that original feetding the bird expirits amother dropping masticated viddles and the tiny chirpers caped amout which is after all the first romans it sounds something out of a children's picture book does not it feeding carrying being companions to our animals and with that we have arrived at act fool the elephants in the bedroom desescaff has a

e what is charming about animals going to sleep is it that were seen creatures that are different from us doing something familiar reminding us of a commonality that we all have to do this one thing to survive what who cares here is a baby flemanga who ought to toleave him alone he can get some shut i y de sa has the easy going and gentle demeanor of some one who legitimately loves her job te job we all said we wanted as kids alon fire fighter an asonot and unlike the rest of us civilians at the zu she gets to have direct contact with the animals take care of them which she loves we keep an

this in for a fe monus i moved here from izuand minnisoda and august he still getting used to it a few days ago something spooked him at he retreated to the yard and climbed o a tree do you worry about him in the colt whet y elwearry about him yah am from the records to day it looks ike the keeper took some binoculars and trid to look at his fingers an tose to see if they are any signs of frost bit m an is and theyare really bright red well just am check on him throughout the night i guess one of the complicated things about delight is that it can exist a colonel at the center of misfortun sometimes delight is found in the ability to take care of another living thing that needs you it is nice tod be needed on she have a favored animal am my favorede animalis rudy the righ know why cas he is the best why she the best he is a puppy he is really gantle and nice and mostly i think i love rudy becas am most of the animals that i have bill a kind of relationship with because i see him all the time is usually cause i coan give them food rudy i do not give him food but he come to me when i call him i he is outside and i need him to come in sace as is too cold i call him and he will come over yes he ly responds to me an onoys my best friend this thing about ready in what a nice guide is what if the joy we get from interacting with animals the idea that we can have relation cheps of mutual affection is a total illusion what if the trace is that for these animals anyway our relationships are mostly transactional does the delight then disappear ire may be that is the transaction we give them food and they give us delight dis ghat a tex n ma forige there is one last moment i want to tell you about o one evr whoof sta keepers mag is asking be can check aun

was also george g money spencer it was the firs hit was the first persef to end every sentence with it is what it isn yer a a the patron saing a reality showa say ther are thet ta ae get the endef a day yer is what it is another great one which i see and i of friends now but i was a fan first a big fan what makes her comedy good it' her incredible observation skills she works frm a position of what the southern writer gesa laman calls black abundance her reference has come from her own black american experience growing up in lewerville kentucky as well as wider culture she marries high concept to the very silly and little nane black hishry facts wich just one of the many things she created trace is a one woman production line of golden intonet conten that gifted brain of her spots delight and amplifies it in fact it felt tracy's entire life was about cultivating glee and then seemingly at the height of her powers she just stopped making stuff she lost her ability to feel delight i felt i was laying on the batam of the ocean floor ind looking at in i could see the thurn in people on a beach somehow but i'm dislike maws and maws and leagues and leagues away from it things got really bad for tracy and for her that was extreme because delight was not just a job it was also her identity this is a story of what happened when things went dark for tracy how she made it back to a place of delights man in twenty fifteen tracy and her friend heaven la gar to began making a weekly potcast with busfeed called another round hi every mane rom heaven am tracy and walkimg to another round with heaven entracy a no there was nothing else it at the time i two black women trading witty banter and talking about the stuff that was importance of them feeled by their naturale chemistry and of course given the name of the show a good amount of boose another ound ded much well interviews with academics comedians and ma cartha geniuses linmanwell moranda and they callhana jones they even interviewed then presidential candidate hillary clinson but that was only part of it they show was funny untilectual thoughtful and also deepat brilliantly silly fillyan loved their crises one of heaven's master pieces was a multiple choice queers an fakneans all we as she id it is this sir a white man's name ore just se syllables i matched together british adition he britishlybliready hav superbaname w he most already any wa in this quis an tracy had to guess which of the names heaven was reading belonged to an actual real at hersan it i frin frim fidlswor prinrim williaclit jus tram hint grimriam penelton emgin a say is one in the last to i vote for tis traam yanother round was a hit adows they were doing life shows selling oup venues across the country and abroad they wont awards they saw merchandise heaven and tracy were being reconised by fans in the street as it grew the thay was getting more demanding to make it needed more money more starf more time nd they wornt getting any of thatthen heaven left busby she took a jow by the late show with stepen clber and came back to record new officers when she could but things went the same tracy understood but it was still hard on both of them we did not have a go way to manage that transatioin and i think that since i was the only one an in the building who was accessible all the time a lot of the work fell on me in my sholder im which i'm happin to do the work but i got tired i did not know it unum i would wake up o my gide again i cannot do this whet i'm doing it anyway i was working at bostfy during this time and entered up cohosting three episode sitting in for a the tracy or heaven this one i pisoed in particular that really stacks in my mind every one heavin since all if i love for very very very tip ind boutom of er heart she is bax soon she still busy making magic in stelf with mister cold bear im but in the mean time an in between time we gat a bem in the duty o be shoulders work hid would sho e e e e iiit was a ridiculous ton it it was the funnest uffacer and i think off teowards i was trying to union was i look care whale we finishd that up we newdunrecording ind iwas i was i swar you up to for the rest of the day and you ead tat to bed for a depressiin that the minut the mikeint ow if you were just cout of ar i a yer vex in my real life thit is very true you remember that is all no not that i mean remember that episode that is that but i do not remember the depression napstuff and i think that is because i was depressed an your memory just doesnit it is not there also when everyday feels another day in another day just i could not even tell you what year that happened madam iit it sounds sounds at out right i feelike best the thing for a pretty long period of my life listening back to the episodes of the shar that ed during this dalk period it is hald to discern that anything was amiss an that is because tracy proved to be adept i'd employing that ag old shabis trick she faked it having too fake the funk as it were was driven mostly by i cannot let other people down and it was also a sort ef mussle memory i guess i'm really really really good at small talk when you all faking delight do you feel delight tos it bleet into it yet i i would kind of it lost in cano caught up in the conversation i did have chances to get kind of carried away the effects were not long time but it did get me a nice little little bright little pockets of o kayness here and there but i tell you let as soon as the interviewsminself for over stepin out of at a stepin out the stued it was just i had gone twelve rounds with tison the sherby ventually went on hiatus tracy went on disability it first it was a relief to just stay hom leaving the house would have ment deading with new york the noise the people the subway but then tracy realized she was staying in because she was afraid to leave her apaltment this one time i was supposed to go somewhere i was all dressed somehow by the grace o guide and whoever else as watching i was dressed iv looked de sant i did not look depressed coton quote and i got to the door of my apartment i thought about the treck on the subway an house i i can' and i decidid not go out i put myself through all of that gettin dresse and it d takin hours for this that happent and i fight when myself be kind to yourself i sel kay if your eyebrows i'll mat is o cath is taking you for hours to get ready just do it and then by the time i got to the door i was islike i expended much energy getting myself together i cannot also expend energy tr id to make my brin folkis on which stop do i get off o she did less i'm less an the fact that she was doing less made ho feel even was she turned her quick talent ed mind inwards turned her self into a tolkes an was relentless at attacking herself she could not turn it all tracy slep cleaning her aportents benny changed closs i just rememberd being in my room on my bid the entire places a miss and i was just lain and i was thinking about how nobody knows the right now this is where i am and i remember gettin my pone to text my friend teddy who wisn'n lovel and i was jus i'm havin a tough time and i just need somebody to know it and he was very gracious you ni'm glad that se reached out and i know it now im but i do not kow there was something about something about just lorning somebody to know that jus sad that i was while i'm really sad after almost a year of feeling truly terrible tracy had something that felt a break through it stalted with a ritual she would been doing every night for months oh there wis as moment when i realize that i'm odes reddings sid nown thet ick of the bay is about depression no was all my gashis entire time or you giv me i thought it would a some old man song about fishent cause i only knew the chorus i but the words o my gu sittin on the dock of the bay watchin the time or the tide i rro away yet jst waste in time just nothing else to don or else the go tracy had to playliss of sad songs including sitting on the dok of the bay and every night around nine p m she stuned out the window of her apartment smoking and drinking and looking down at the street feeding a caricature of te sad gir and this one night after hower many months of this ritual i'm i just started to dance first it was a little swayes whatever song was playin it may have been th odes redding son because i ma knos go a little sidnow i her vers and h go a you csust a ba littl e bit to it and after that i was maybe a what i was into other things to dance to and is wish to a different playlass could not tell you at it was and i think i danced for an hour danced and smoked into straint and i felt good and i was smiling and i was confuse but i was do not pick it apart just and i also i could feel how ridiculous i probably lookd because i mean is not i was too seven the whole time riht it was just some weird interpretiv in this muscle still move and i sto do a bagbid i cannot i learned it but i'm it felt i know it almost felt my body was trying to reach my brain somehow because it wasnit my brain that told my body to sard dancing pretty sure i think my body was lie what i have not toup in a long time the brain let me takein with the brain and see how things agoing oh terribly well is dance a little itduring these months she also looked o professionals she chose a couple who looked her undhe stood er theyre all an when i say i mean both ma thereface in my sychiatris do not know how it happened but therare both black women and they will both do i am i interview sessions on mine i hade to move leave my house when i could not an act put on pance when i could not one day i got emotional because

in cay ou wer wen to is soleventually sometime last year tracy found herself asking variations of the same question she thinks heaven might have mentioned it it was this is there anything good that your depression has given you it sounded perverse she could not stop thinking about it could not stop mudling the question she found thot thinking about the answers made her feel good when she mentioned it to her therapis she told tracy that finding something good in a bad situation could be a good sign to feelig and i as sounds fake but what he mean an she was an she said ha thing were let e helps you connect with your emotions butte i dot noat that means i dn't kno what means a connect with an emotion i feel it and i recognize it i want it i do not it i'm ignoring it i guess that is what she meani doi thin you as ii take that aff mat to do lis with ha question in mind trcy started rising in a grand new journal not on rossgaze book of delights she calls it a gratitude journal which sounds earnest and yes she is away not very cool it is a simple practis a couple of times a week she writes down what she is grateful for when she started she did not have much face a few months ago ihade been this is just the most ridiculous it isn'tnot going awar ist likeing of people get op an walk around the black and you wont be depressed yes i will an eventually this gratitude journals

suicide is immoral it seems strange you have to say that but there seem to be a lot of people in the west these days who believe that suicide is somehow morally obligatory according to these moral geniusis when a man comes into your house rapes your wife urr some of your children and obduck t others you have somes are of moral obligation to leave him be long as he hides behind his own family members after all you are morally superior to that man and thats what matters you'r feeling that you are not him never mind tht you are not him you did not invade his house or kill him or rapeen murder his wife and some of his kids and kidnap others never mind that you are trying to stop him from doing the same thing again and trying to prevent others from following in his footsteps if you hurt any one he puts in harm's way while you are attempting to stop him you are him never mind that he will repeat his actions if he is alad to escape never mind he is vowed to repeat his actions until you andyour family are exterminated never mind that kindness to the cruel is cruelty to the kind that if you let this guy go others will follow his example and more inocent people will die you must insure that he has acess to electricity an water you must protect his life in order to prevent harm to the family he uses is human chield you must give him every advantage because he is evil in fact work he less evil were he not to hide behind his own family members for example then you would have free ran to kill him but since he is evil well then the only thing to do is throw up your hands and walk away insentivizing those him to pursue his insamely evil tactics now if the sound idiotic that is because it is it is moral idiocy of the highest order it incentivize his evil it creates evil it means that the most evil pevil will pursu te most evil tactics all in order to prevent you from protecting yourself and yet there are those who proclaim it from our nations most sophisticated ivory towers they would never live by such rules they live ingated communities far from the consequences of their own foolishness they never feel the consequences of the perverse morality they promote these are the same people who promote definding the police and open borders while living in gated communities but of course they are calling for their own suicie they are calling for yours you are supposed to let in millions of refugees most of whom are likely to hate american values you are supposed to leave them in power to pursue thir next totrocities where they rule after all those people are members of their coalition of the supposedly de colonized dispossessed they are evil is merely a symptom of your evil what they believe and what they do that is your fault the only solution is for you to commit suicide if you refuse you are just as bad as they are and if you do not you are dead you are choice or at least that is the choice they would you to make but there is in fact another choice to reject that discusting construct wholesale to point out that genicidal murderers do not get a free hand just because they hide behind members of their own family to stand strong in the face of calls to honey comb our own society with pro genicied members or theire unvended compatriots yes of course those of moral bent ought to work tomin amy civilian casualties yes of course those of moral bent ought to work to find a place for civilians to escape from the line of fire but neither of those rules can be prioritized above the first rule of war winning war is ugly by nature nearly the ugliest thing as it turns out there is only one thing uglier loosing to those who do not care about morality or decency at all those who use morality and decency against those who are actually moral and decent an who care about things civillian casualties anybody who advocates four such defeat those who encourage suicide in the facesof evil is complicit in that evile we know who does understand this americans americans by nature understand this because they understand what it s to face down evil done up before here in the united states and what we understand is that the group that murdered thirteen hundred people and tht is now taken two hundred hostages their a hundred ninety nine families they been notified that they have om hostages remembers their family whoave ben kidnappd in gosip the american people overwhelmingly across all political parties believe that israel's military response is justified seventy one per cents of americans believe that it is justified only eight per cends say it is not justified twenty one per cent say not sure and that holds true across virtually every demographic it is it is least true among people eighteen to thirty four ar of course overwhelmingly on the left an who have some sert to have surious promis of moral reltivism fifty seven per cents of those eighteen to thirty four in the united states believe that israel is justified in its actions fourteen per cent believe not at all justified some twenty nine per cent say they are not sure and the older you get effectively speaking the more people actually have some moral clarity on this particular issue but as far as political briak down sixty nine percent of democrats say that israels action is fully justified seventy seven per cents of republican say that it is fully justified in fact the the group that is least likely to think that that things are justified are independence and even they by a two thirds majority believe that it is justified only ten per cent say it is not at all justified a lot people are saying they are not sure because the easiest way to get off easy in any moral convercation is to pertend that you do not know the answer to the question when everybody knows the answer to the question which of course is that you have to try to minaimize civilian casualties if you are israel yeef to try to make sure that as few innocent people die as possible and also that every ounce of blood that is being sbuilding goza right now is not on israel's hands it is on commasses hands every one understands that is except for the elete except for the iletan our society they lleten our society media elete professors on campasses our intellectual luminaries some of our congress people they refuse to understand this sort of thing they are the advocates for cultural suicide they'are the advocates for the west to simply shoot itself in the head in order to avoid the natural consequences of ugly war agan remember the entire rules of war were britten in order to disincentifies the kind of activity the commosses currently engaging in the entire purpose of having laws of war is to prevent commoss from hiding behind villions and yet the same people hare now claimin tat israelis violating international law by targon and commoss are actually incentivies ind commoss to put kids in front of their guns that is the that is the actual effect if you say to people that murdered juws in south israel plus hide behind your own kids means you get off's got free what are you incentivizing people to do hide behind their kids if anything the world should be incentivizing the hunting down of comass specivically because they hide behind their own kids because otherwise every ones gon to hide behind their own kids that toln cens of structure's work and just one second we will get to the eleat who seem completely unable they are paralyzed by their own moral relatives we will getst that momentarily first last week pure talk announce they are going to alleviate ten million dollars in veterans dat by veteran's day and they will get there by giving a portion of every new order to this cause because of your support they are already twenty seven per cent to their goll with three weeks to go oure veterans gave everything to protect the nation pure tak understands the sacrifices that they have made whenyou switch to pure tocks lightening fast fie tou network the will do noting a portion of every new order to this noble cause youcan make a real difference just by choosing superior self on service pure talk's plan started just twenty bucks amonth offering a limited talk text more data andimoble hospo jus go to pure talktot cm slash appero and make the switch over what is nice is the can also be helping veterans while you get better phone coverage ivesy i use pure talk for all of my phone calls you should do the same and when you do you are hlping out veterans let us rally together an shawe on wavering support for our veterans is it pure talk dot com slash appuro switch to pure talk to day it is the right move it is the american way again had on over to pure talk dot com slash appuro switch on over to pure talk today they'e lanstart just twenty bucks month offering an limited talk tex more data plus that mobil hospot n im ty teir network is great go check mout right now pure talk dot com slash shipurea ocase as i say oure moral ecemplars oure moral elet they are completely disconnected from the american people and from reality and they break down into basically to categories one are the stupid and to are the are the cynical procomas and they are not the same category i'me not going to suggest for example that pet davidson on essinal is prochomas he is not he is just ta typical hollywit idiot and he is somebody whois reverted to all situations are the same all morality is the same i cannot take sides yeur i cant i cannot now let us be real bythers every one should be morning right now civilians murdered in israel for the crime of being jhues and members of the villing population and gosa we are murdered bycomass o kay it is a comass murder when you hide a child in front of your guns while you shootat other people and the child tizes in th cross fire that is your problem when i say your problam men your moral propits everybody's propet it is your fault cimbit the the goal among our leat againd for for those who are who consider themselves morally sophisticated what is amazing is how unable they are to make actual moral distinctions basic moral distinctions between the murdered and the people woare ttempting to defind themselves lhat'swhat you got on essinal and you saw many many people in the in the twittervers the moral relativus immediately hall is not this nice is not the sinis cause every one is i'll get what let us be real about this youre moral apathy and that' what an amounts to sympathy that is equally distributed betwen comas in israel amounts to a moral apathe is effective for comas at commass would is for you o be morally apathetic about he situation and for you too for you to basely thrup your hands they too complicated do not know gav tits is not paticularly complicated the side that murders babies in teir bads for the crime of being babies that is the bad guis the fact that i sanal has to do this sort of hands off it while comedy will sit again ookabe if if you'r looking thse people for any sort of moral guidance you to are afool here ras pet davidson on assanel both sideing this thing this week we saw the harrible imige is i tory fom israel and gosen and i know wes tiking who better commen omit than pe batits well in a lotaways i am a good person to talk about it becaus when i sevenys o i my da was killed it a terris i a i know something about what that is i saw many terrible pictures is we o o sufferin has rally sotin hows tit sogen when pete davidsons statement on this thing is basically suffering is bad yet we were we are in agreement we are in agreement but suffering is bad has not a moral message and unfortionately thad is the side that is taken up by many of our moral sophisticates we'r seeing that from again pe daviton is not is not a bad person for saying what he is saying i'm not suggesting he is pro comass or anything for somewhan hy saying he is not whet i'm saying is that when the the fokis of what obviously is a moral conflict becomes not the actual moral conflict between one side tha it is evil and once had that wishes to preserve its own citizenry and instead becomes all suffering is is from the same source and thus if we could just make the suffering stop to mor by snapping our fingers leaving commassin place to murder babies thatu be fine that is where this is going and we can all see that it is going in that direction from it from our moral eleates and the youar times is doing the same thing their tempts as af long editorial that really struggles to explain why israel should basically leave commasin place they have an entire article tiled israel can defend itself and uphold it is values it is amazing how that they never suggest that the palsinians ought to uphold basic human values in this particular conflict no it is about it it is about israel obviously and they admit that israel is is working to men my siviling casualties will get to that in a second but instead of just recognizing the reality instead they say the united states his offered firm support for israel in its our of agony but friendship also requires speaking hard truths to israel to israels on t yeu're times if to speak our truths to israel i'm what israel's the country that just got head wit the worst terror attack in the west since nine eleven and proportionately something tht happen much worse the nitaleven but it but you are now saying that american neach you pressure israel why because in counselling restraint united states can point to lessons of it is own reason hastry i love i love the counselling for restraint after am after babies are murdered ind then taken nd and survivors ir are then bust away to gosit to be held in the abjrict terror before ther murdered bacamas that is the yoar times again the moral sophisticates the moralsphistics you say that you now for your own morality you have to basically youeve to ease off yef to ease off obviously that is not moral sophistication its it is moral foolishness and then of cours youhave the most obviously stupid people sonny hoston writes a sunnys sunny hoston of course did the israel is doing war crons routine which is just pathetic an she she is she is a pathetic specimen of o immorality on unvirtually every scale here she is but i do think that what we nan to remember is that there is an internationa human rights body of law and when you look at that law part of it is retally and against in a sent civilians collectively is also terror and is also a war crime and again those are not my words those are the words of the law and the president of the iropain commission are'se not our of londerly and tat just last yere when we were all talking about you crane she sat rushes attacks against tavilian introstructure especially electricity are war crimes cutting off men women children of water electricity and heeting with winter coming these are acts of pur terror and we have to call it at such and what i'm saying is agas i think those that are round the the alar countries is real actually bound the only exit out of palictine to egypt that is not true isral do not become the profa crossing egypt has closed the roff a crossing but sunny hosson is and idiots o she is immediately shifting into israel is the rael problem in the region mode and again i'm n i doft know which category put sonnyhosstonn but the attempt to draw moral parity between the people who kill children and t pople who ae atempting to avoid killing children but cannot avoid killing children if the bag gets are hiding behind children that that is absurd a means ony hosson i'dom put her in the idiot categoy mainly because she also says things comass is just the proud boys which listen i'm not a fan of the proudboys but i notice that the proud boys i're not going around slaughtering babies in their cribs i notice that tha sunny hossin is up again ta the fact that that there is this class of people hare considered i part of the political conversation i it is amazing to me remains to mazing to me to ay ont say somin no i just i i look at this familecal prospective and i think that we all know that hamase tesignated a terorganization just many other teroritions have this designation the proud boys here in the united states amazing amazing a mean she is she is yes the these these plotical geniusis o gae armet that is that is the stupid that is the morally idiot and the moraladiat idiotic and the second wone ging at's he morally centical thet people who full well know the moral calculas here but who are going to use decency and morality in order to preserve commoss thot would involve members of the squadwl gets that momentarily first as a daily whare listener you are not just

by the way who are arguing that israel should basically go hands off with comass because youust to preserve your on falge o the same people would argue the samething about america i'llgive hem that credit those break down in two groups the people who are just morally and bevelants ah or who seek to obscure the moral calculis and then there people who actively side with the terrace and that of course would be people ao c and ilhan omar they spent the wek and distributing actual mis in formation ow one o thethings that isbeen amazing to watch on switter is the creation of false narrative in real time it is been amazing to wach i know because it is happen to me i put out an actual picture of a burn baby from klar aza and it was immediately by advocates forcomass an their idiot allies it was immediately labeled false information and wos sug gested that it was ai generated which it was not and a community note was attached to that tweet which they then promptly grab and then blasted around the inernet to suggest that i was falsifying atrocities meanwhile ao see and illhan omar wor actively promoting false information for example early of this week aos he said the level of mis information in all directions in this conflict is incredibly high especially on this platform if you see a claim photo or v idyo that triggers are strong ind motional reaction take a moment to pause and check for veracity or conformation from multible sources a's the first o all that that is that is fine except for the fact that on the rest of the squad then started posting pictures of prokoms propaganda ihan omar reposted a picture from another blue checked account the blue checks do not mean anything any more and tat that that account claim that there are six hundred fourteen palson an childen murdered by the isralia idea forces and it posted pictures of dead kids the problem is that the image was not from gaza the image was from twenty thirteen of chemical weapons used in serea shofs blasting out false information which of course she does not care about that of course of course meanwhile ao s continues to blast out the idea that if israel does not immediately give in to hamas and simply stop all operations then that means that israel is to blame for all of this she says humans can only survive with thot water for about three days gaza has run dry the blockhead on waterfoot electricities an indiscriminate collective punishment and a crime but can first of all that is not true turning off wate an electricity in military areas is normal state of events that is how things go in a war come oss honeycome to self in the civilian population as will talk about in a secon they are desperately seeking to keep civilians in these areas the reason israel turned off the water in power is to press people down of the south in fact over the week and israel turned on the water and the power down south in gaza why would they do that why the answer is the r trying to draw civilian co the areas where there is water in power by turning off the water and power where they do not want the civilians but according to ao s obviously this is quote cruel and un just to save millions of people in gazan early halve children it must end it now i noticed o that you are very quick on the trigger aose about ending all of this na the minute that is a the minute that hamas seem they were in serious trouble meanwhile ihanomar says presiden by an pressuring israel to turn the water back on as a start now we neen him to push for electricity and food access to be restored and when the rest of theworld an calling for an ends the bombarbment of gaza i that is om there is that again that that is cynical she knws exactly what she is doing right there and the reason to draw the moral equivalent is because you wish to protect comas if you are ilhanomar ohanamars an actual protairer activist i theres there is no bones ofatm i get going all the way back to en choose writing sympathetical letters to icis to to judges on to half vicis regruits a thing she actually did and meanwhile can bing you the latest from on the ground and again for all those people electric careabout villions ar's only one side in this conflict tot cares aboutsvillians only one it is not komas and by the way it is not ihn omater anybody else is pretending to care about civillians while proping u

a ground invasion of the gozsiss trip what theyve been doing up till now is knocking down all the buildings that are on top of the tunnels right now thei're literally hundreds of colometers of of tunnels ther commos is spent twenty years building under the ground all the terracs are living in elet with electricity with water with a see they stole all that stuff by the way even the chocolalout the water that israel is not providing to the gocistrip we should rect we should recognize this point that statistically spegging israel was responsible until this latest war for summortine six and ten per cent of all the water and gaza the water shortages and goza are dull sootbare do solely to the governing powering gaza again that ofud be commoss israel right now is flattening a lot of thse buildings they'r telling civilians to get out meanwhile commoss is literally holding children hostage in these circumstances to over the week en commossrelleast tovidio the sappureis to have been from the day of the actual attack of them carding around jewish babies nay this is what they 're doing es the people israels fighting they on't care abouts villins in fact they took hostages to prevent their own deaths that is the goal the goal is if you do not back off we are going to till your babies literal babies this is vidio the commossrellies t get most of the tuff that i'm releasing on the shut most of the images thaweve been showing for pass couple of lease these ar images that are coming from commass they are not yusually coming from the idea this is images from commss of them literally carrying around other people's children in the this what they do then their goal is to get civilians killed they want dead civilians it is their thing here is commoss again is vidio they released tis sus commoss picking up a chile they is murderd parents got another child on on their lap they have jus murdered ther the kits parents and thes arall babies ewamoen to terrastay carolmaher hearing other people shogry s yuare secuted a gy bet obviously that thebut forget about the jewish babies fo they are keeping in in ahostage situation they are preventing the evacuation of their own people here is a tape of a goza resident can they say palistinean telling an ideaf office sir how cmass is literally stopping people from leaving the most militarily relivant areas an the is a phone call betyun th ideaf in telligence officer from unit five o for and chabalya resident in northern goza and i'm n a read you what they are saying moon gossen says theyare preventing people from leaving the ideafoficers as tell me exactly where it is that they stoppeding gosan says those who are here near the ancient someho they are taking the idea card and the carkies we mean the movement comas he says who stoppino gadif hosas as comass and he god says yes yes mean comases literally stopping people from not only as cmmas stopping people from leaving they are literal aerial photoes of commoss stacking trucks on the highway out of these the areas to brim people from leaving they they actually actively put up a road block to stop this from happening this is an aereal phodo that we are showing on the shoright now of commas putting a road blockin place and a line of cars going back hundreds of of mleaders of of cars just stacked up on the highway behind that trying the held to get out cause zrell told them to a comas blocking it look at look at this they created a trafficem isis right on the coast of gozegan ashule see the mediterranean right there and theyre theyre preventing people from get out and gettng out they are actively stopping people from leaving in fact i they are not just doing that they literally apparently struck a convoy of cevilians they'r own convoy to tempt to stop people from leaving a goring to idea spokes person johnthan conrekas is from the times of israel a strike on a convoy of gossan's fleing to the southern part of the stripe friday appears to hav been a false flag operation carried out by comass he say when your ply lochcan think wofld benefit from those very horrible images of children and cevillians who arevacuating south and then theyare apparently clearly dead who stands the ain from that only one organization comassis medea office claim cars carring fleing svillians were struck in three places but they then release vidioan you cannot see any sort of projectile that is sitting the carthage blow up comass apparently is now blowing up their own cars again the ideafi senting out notices right now on lines to people telling them to get out the is a graphic from the idyaf showing them tellin them to get people out residente of gossa city and northern goza in the pastays we have urged you to relocate to the southern area f your safety we want to inform you the idea will not carry out any operations along this roude from ten ams one pim du'r ng this window please takgethe opportunity move southward from it northern goza your safety in that of your family's matter please follow our instructions an had southward be assured commossleators ofe alredyansured their safety and that of their families that of course is absolutely true meanwhile again thes s being widely reported this is not a a giant mystery everyny knows xacluets going on here is foxner's reporter tra yinks saying thate palsinians are actively being prevented from leaving homas the group in control of gaza it is preventing civilians from leaving their homes after thes realies warned them of an i pending strike i also spoke with a civiliin in gos e city who con firmd the an formation te ci cignifian ico the source indicated comma is threateninpeople and prevenin them from leavin if they try to ge toa cafer location wai trade than all of te palistinian peopl will di why wuld that be hamasas gal the tein mao fin upee thits vsnsn mossn calnly brock last wesand we love down they love the lie o and that is why and when we all know the answer o the ition moss ons people denie specifically because theyare praying on stupid western belief that if civilians die it must be the west fault somehow not the people hiding behind the civilians n or pro tect themselves am you you can see thean cent of structure here the inscensif structure here is to maximi civilin casualty much that in a a darkly hilarious moments in the midle of this conflict the commas propagan the arm released a vidio of a supposed dead person and it was a dall it is ha thing that actually happen in that the first time this happene there is vidio pretty famous vidio onmine the can see of palcinians in pass conflicts carrying around structures with suppose dead bodies on them and then there is an airy turn that goes off in the deadbody gets up in serchs walking again of course they'r tons of peoplewho are being killding gosright ow of course of course of course this not to deny their suffering or to nigt of that is happening but it is also to show that is absolutelyan commases interest to to macimize the depiction of civilian casualties in order to gain world sympathies they can continue to pursue their evil it is there put in the ivilians in harm'sway the cividio ya that the ashaly took this down because they realized too late there was perfectly obvious that one of the figures in the vidio isa actual manican this one ofthe thing that they released is gy running into a hospital and you see the cameras following him and ti that is at all you can see that that is not ea insits not and thet'th actually cut it and they hae removed it later they cut it removed it later because i it was too obviously not real asa agan that is onto nig that the are not dead kids an gos their tons dead kissing gosip that is to point out that it is in the incent of structure for commass to maximize that of course and and of course they want they do not care homoney cviliansti then building tunnels down there for years in fact here is a flashback twenty twenty one ama member of commass speaking to vice and telling them yow we built all the tunnels directly under the civilian in for structure now why woud you do that because you want the civilians to die youare hoping that the west in is owne benigted version of a morality w e'll not strike it you if you hide behind civilians the fact that you'r down her in tunnels thatave been built undesivilan aras loncing rokets fromsivilian arias as well does not not mean that you will endangering palising it the came to be fincing for we are sucrifying ourselves than oher times and and everything we do and od as to in su a better fou sufo children but you also not sacrifiching the teiansta diretibati course we do want then to get killed or to get cudag but this is the old toise we have this about we can do and they are suppoting us you cannot go to the see you can go to the ear an o t anywhere that is why we are building tunes this is the only mean which is busigle for for osempiges i cane now i'v you to knot his statement there they are supporting us they are supporting us this villin population is an ugly truth a huge percentage of the population of gosi supports comas a huge percentage of the palistinian population in judansmaria supports comss that is just a reality i know it is ugly and i know that we again we love to tell ourselves these pretty stories in the west about how whenever there is a in evil regume annu on earth that has no popular support from the population sometimes that is true and a lot of time it really is not true a lot ofthe time at there is widespread support fort terrus i get again that does not mean they deserve to die civilians it does mean that if you are talking about things should a marica take in refugees you might want a consider who it is the youre taking in again the gat beteen the eletes on this particular issue and the people is stunning the vasmajority people in less not interested in taking in vast populations that actively support comas or are sympathetic to homass or or antismetic in the extreme which by every pole the palisingian population patictling the gosistrip is as it again thoesn't mean that we should tet tat the west or israel or mever should not benami feeling catuallies does mean that before you decide who you want living next storty you might one to know wh it is living nextort you meelay of gumal bowmen agan tir's what progressives do yeve gumall bowmen who is now suggesting that perhaps the united states should take in gossin refuge es he said quote fifty per cent ofthe population in goza our children the international community is wells the united states should be prepared to welcome refuge es from palestine while being very careful to that and not allow members of comasa good luck with that good luck with that rondisantus was asked about this over the weeken and and he was ot no which is be correct answer how can you paint with such a broad drosh to say two point three million people ar antismatic wor first of all a mytis is very clear a those gasa refuges calsan ar should go to arab countries the you es should not be absorbing of any of those i think the culture vel lek tha comass let just be clear about that not every one's a member comas most probably art but they did a le toma there is a lot of celebrating of those attacks i'm in the gods of strip a by by byt of those folks who were na o bas but if you look at their education says the this has been an issue for a long time they teach kids to hate jews the tex folks do not have isreal even on the mab i they prepare very young kids a to commit terros the tacks i think its the coxic culture and i think if we were to import large numbers of those to the adited state i think it would increase anti sanitism in this country and i think uld increase anthe american as a manis country by the way that is obviously true wut every word of what he has signers obviously trough in fact i can show you exactly the educational materials that tend to be shown to palisonian kids this for example these are cartons from palistonian telivision and a you may notice the presents of a figure who looks an alfu lolice thinking mouses sho be far ful mouse who is encouraging small palisonian children to murder jews a hereis your some clips from palisonian tety again directed at small children say you wonder how it is that you have a bunch of very young men who are seeking to kill jewish babies no cribs the answerers there en doctrinated from the time that they are babies in this idea because this is a cammas is sick the palcina authority is a sick organization is lomachy hot is sick a here again this is hout education goes in the palistonian areas an these a mouse or its actuagine measing roan i want you to u pastonean when the jews come to take it and throw it there is a cartoon a a a small palisonian child shooting at the a shooting at the jews and a dropping jewish stars on the these are carton characters an dropping jewish stars on these realy soldiers this is another children's carton o i'll support our brothers an gosi and destroy the jews these are all animated shows for obviously small keads and there is a a am there is a devilish character holding anyouish star a hw about this one palisonian children playing a great game o this is this a small child here saying os sons of zying almost evil of creatures on bar baricating your boics a hibro jerusalem rejects you and bomityer filth hese are a qhoir of small children o explosive device of glory with her blood should created freedom ask suside bomifatima all nashar how one should live a life of pride these are these kider fives sex seven years old are singing this is all in palisonian tevy now have youever seen anything lokgot on your teety for your kids the american educational to be for kids garbage but have you ever seen anything that murder your enemies murder the jews an aon is really to the either this is how you also uns up with vidio of alisonian children playingiag ame they to call stab the jew is it this is nice stuff here e a te kid os a coming out of when work and acting that they litten wey are clay actan and theye co from re tending to be jewish and a kid who a comes along that they get themselves som yomicass they can dress that and a kid jumps out and an shout stab the juwis an nice palcinian game for children i they have palsinan terror training camps for for young for young boys here is a here is what they explain about to what they what they teach them at summer camp fan

students from primary school high school and college to perticipe in the camp target practise in valves aca forty sevens intitanic weapons and vidio simulations no ot ta plo themso that in the next fass all are willing these boys will be able to confront i the plundering iney and disfigurates face in the next war hey here children from the palcinian authorty aras and comaseris a bragging about the value of killing jews this kids us yes they teach us af izinus our enemy this e ketting you an our double way school a school run by the in is in east rusalem we must fight them they teach us they jewse are terorists at school they teach us about juns they teach us that they are bad people they killed our young they teach us in school the jews are fickle bad people i am ready two stab oe jew and drive a car over them i will fight these are out these kins i seven aignt nine years ol they will ran a car into them the jews is cits madbe thirteen get the constantly stab them drive over them and shoot them the juns stabbing and runnig over jews brings dignity the palcinians kis maybe twelve thirteen i'm in a run over them and stabing with knives agaithers an east rusalem ey i'm you wonder why ronissants to say maybe should not import lots of these refugies maybe it is cause of bact maybe it is because of that and again it is it is not as though the s un substantiated stuff the the go pros and the phones thay were on the terrists contain footage in from the last attack they contain footage that actually exists from before the actual attack and some of that footicthurs nob in released that foodgin cludes vidios of kids who are training for terror mein see these are kids wearing comas operatives uniforms they yon se inthe background these some of thse kids are what thirteen forteenyers old maybe wearing full on military year carrying aci forty sevens gany ere gettng ready to murder some jews an this kid is maybe nine and he is carrying a gonn pointin int o the cammer lowering military fatigues it went when ronisantis and the american people by the way most people lett ere ought kno we are not interestid in porting a lot of these sorts of folks that is not races that is why would you want people who abjectly identify as people who hate jews an want to kill them in your societies by thewaymn there is there is vidio that is emerged now from again thit is put out by commoss of churing palisinians that at chiefa hospitalis rockets are fired on telof eve n thi shifahasaa comm ass famouslyn hais pland is head quarters underneathshipa hospital that if israel wants to strike at and they has in blolp a hospital is there entire thang they are shouting al thoawire is the missiles as the rocket's fa lyon cly on juws i then there is also vidio that is now merged they have not seenet of front from these attacks the the the herrificterrattack of october seventh from those territax who was not all commosterris there are civilians because these bors are extremely close ther civilians who are literally rushing in to the rect and and charmall house murder houseis of these various kubuzem and communities along the border and stealing things looding it you woud see in the rit in the united states they people taking away tves people taking away bicycles n vis vidio of again these are these are not all commosterris some of these people are just people from gaza whor a riving to steal things from the jews now the juws are dead uou see them walking in not all the people are armed wass you lare unarmed they are walking in and there at seeing if tey can pick themselves up some mon nice some nice stuff obviously deep deep care from the civilians about to the jewish cevillin surgeris murdered in these places man if i lessen if you are near a jewish village that just gow completely ransacks and babes got murdered why would not you steal some some kidsbikes youn see them riding the kidsbikes over there and why why would not you do that why not after all i'm in here is n opportunity get some stuff sure the kid was just murdered it is tine to let us pick up some let us pick up t let us loutsom geare here we need some gear a when ae comes to whether the west ought to open itself up wide two i'm to refuge ese from gaza at the very least you have to con sider may be there might be some culture clash thou migt be a little bit o culture clash in the culture clash ovic te already exsists in the west the mass importation of radical muslin populations has not ben good for europ an gan the reason i'm showing you all this stuff is because when you have westerners oumall bowman saying things we shud just import refuge ese from gaza wech just why not meant again two things kom me fre once one try to min im my civillin casualtyes as best you can an tif face of commass literally hiding behind s villains but to the notion that it is the west job that is america's job to import palistonian refuge eses it is absurd it is absurd is not been going well for the west over the weekan thereis a massive protest in london which has nowt fifteen per cent muslin not all those muslims are radical but there is a big radical mossom population in london without it out this protest ye you did not see this protest against come oss after the murder bunch of jews i noticed you only saw this protest in favor of commass after israel retaliated his fifty thousand people in the center of london that is a lot of commas saporters in the center of london and just in case youare wondering ow what they think one of the o one of the calls in responses was kibr cibro all gehood which for those who do not speak airbek or no about the koran is a reference two the the city of hibar therewas a massacre of jews in the coran it is explicitly discussed the idea that mahammed created treaty with the jews and then the jews refused to convert and he murdered all of them and the the kaibr cabralyahood is a is a call for masstuextermination that was some of the stuff that as being chanted at this particular protest well is in london these are monerates probably it ishem n than is pong t beople its glad that here in london are not you i ma mad handing this probably its just a just cultural diverse at again it is all glong amazing that this seems a this sems is prbably ragt for the west i by the way a man to show up within his rarly flagon was promptly a beaten down by a by some ofthe protestors i an't see thre's a person within is really flag trying to escape and i they a the attack him and a there are the cobs act o trying to restle him away preseme we to protect him by the palisinian ralliers jumping on him attempting to get at him to physically be come up hes that is the way that were now again this is not a major surprise london has been plagued with radical islam freite for a long tawn mahammed hesob is a prominent commentator over in brittan i somehow 'sor enswered the the main stream to the extent that that he has conversations with main streame people iand this is the kind of person the mohammed hejobbies is major following in in london there was not two thousan't twenty one screaming antisematism wi winl ai ag wit egl t es o as his as dianess thowe o e ther dogs o that t an acto provocation wel were saying now hes tung to cogs i mayn get very clear sto eve ron understands it those dogs come close t us again we will see it is an act of gression and we will kill those dogs well put them down his him a shouting long from his friends we want the zioness thi is a this is some of the ralliers were following him is the nighty ansegucionition thi someofthe ralliers that is not he job tis some of his followers is the differenc for them as they think begins the sis he sot he think life begins for us we believe the death begins we believe that life begins o death we do not care about death gammian this the center of london again and these supporters of commoss our honey combe to all thor our western societies because we ave imported many of them inso western societies and candida for example youres one supporter over the week and explaining commss is not a terragroup now wone ofthe things that truly is amazing is that all the procomoseralities that have taken place or wiving palistonian flags this iut be a very easy one it is seriously a supereasy one for example you can easily say i believe tha it aught to be a palisinian state and comass is an evil terror scrupt that must be extripated an order for piece proscess to take place that is a supereasy thing to say but nobody saying that literally nobody saying that i've not seen oneof these protestors suggesting the commoshig f the hostages of you where are they where is the mass palistonian it outcry and unrest overcommasstaking a hundred and nineyine hossages including many babies where is it it does not exist that raises some pretty serious questions about the cause and again it is not hard condemn evil it really is not for example horrible story over the weekan an illinois man according to writers was charged with hat crimes for stabbing a six year old muslim boy to death an woonin his mother in attack that targeted them for their religion and is response to the warbitin israel and commossacorting to officials and muslin right sto activist the boy was tohave some twenty six tines a horrifying story the thirty two year old woman had mothwill stabloons she is expected to survive the tap an about forty miles southwest of chicago pressing an biding said the d the muslims quote came to america seeking what we all seek a refuge to live lorn and pran piece the terrific act of it act if hate has no place in america totally a gr of course every one agrees that everyone should agree with that this person is evil this person should be given the deaf penalty you murder child shouldbe iven the deat penalty now is that hard does not seen that hard sems a goveray's onsam page tyou murder of palistnian for being a palistinian you should get a deaf penalty ra tdies makes you evil also i notied zero palisinian activis saying the commost evil none literally zro you cannot find them if they exist ther ae very hard to find their doin excellent chob offiding it is not a hard to condemn evil it is very easy to condemn evil actually and yet people hafe such a tough time doing it here is a canadian supporter explaining ofcomss explain commoss is not a terragroup nat is not a terrace it iseiboa mat e non ateriat rowa what is ther a madr csycha clobfor gan it is e reething that hav ben teu they forteventy five yeara o colonia them apoccupecen o murder o ha o littl chulgen o wemen that is what they are there re tethin yovin canidar ho coloniois contry tcan r everything that they do is justified thatcluding what havon mass waverythingl thing they have got i just fi hamdeer children murderdeer babies beheaded babys be had it really please educate yourself lably is te new e a thathe news reporter you got a tack te ocin youth becis be that the tat wit a lotipoti oh it is all fag it is fag that is it these are the people that t west is decided to im port really really good decisions chris ra the had of the afpa yasterday he said that come ostylotasku come to the uasyalian i wonder why from hom who persa would conduct such attax after all every one that we have imported over the past forty years has been a peceloving person obviously clo doingn a mazing job betting our people when i lic who why would e be worried about this ive tout everone here loves pece in this hightened environment there is no question were sing in increase in reported threts and we have got a be on the lookout especially folon actors who may ta inspiration from reson events to commit violence of therown i'd encourage ju to save isolent because as the first line of defence protecting our communities yere often the first to see the signce that some one may be mobilizing to violence get wallum why would you be worried about that probably should take in ou know a few hndred thausan tou million of palsinian refuge hes becaue they are because they are all problynatant after years in yeurs ofan doctrnation an in hating jews and hating the west probably that those wild be a great imports by the wiy this does raise a serious question you not i noticed i noticed a map in the map is a map of the world and in particular the part of the map tan i noticed is this part called thmat deleast and on that map there'is this tiny little jewish country its thes tiny little country rit aloncos halpasizin new jersey supersmall and then i noticed a lot a lot of muslem countries in fact i'm going to just read you some of the muslem countryes there are many many many of them ofm just just a few off the top of our our head here moretanas somally afkannistn around western sahera algeria moroko malteds comrosnagertak tagikastan to nesia as r by john jordan sent gall yemantuboody libia maya pakastan gambia sad yourabia sudin cosvo rah mali ter menistan bangladashegi guinea turkey whe ise beckastanin on nesha monsyria bruna cr curgastan cokos zero leown cotar coad baherane you nited oir memerat's casikstan lebanon bricking a fasto lasha albania chad basinahrsgavena that is a list of countryes that have over fifty per cent musslin population as he percentage of their total population and what is one of the things that i notice zero of them zero our talking about taking in palsinian refuge hes rigt now zero how weard how odd almost as though they liked the palsinian refuge ees being refuge es as they have since the creation of the state of israel is worth noting at this point that historically speaking when isrel is cradted in nineteen forty seven forty eight menisrael declared its into pendance some seven hundred thalsan palsinan arabs either'r left preemptively because theres wars on thy wone to get out or left because they were expelled none of them were taken in by any of the arab states any of them by theway ther're billion muslens on planof earth meanwhile the tiny country of israel which again was tiny tiny tinyan remains tiny tiny tiny today anybody who does not understand a conflictoreally should travel over there and ou should see the poximity thou're talking bout zero space the tiny state f israel nason state of isral took in seven to eight hundred thousand jews who left or were expelled from muslen countr ies israel took in all of them they have nosked asked for repatreation an any of the r countries their resources were we are stolen by the muslen governments of those countries they all were taken i by israel the airborld has a particularly ugly history obasically shuttling the palistonians around and using them for whtever political purpose they will an th expelling them whenthin elike them as i've mention before in nineteen ninety to nineten ninety two during the gulf wor in the postpot lulf wor era guate expelled some four hundred thousand palistonians no one seems to care meanwhile as you recall during the last syrian crisis which is on going and again tvery few people seem to carr turkey took in millions of seering refuges literally millions of them europe took in hundreds of thousands andy one comes to the palistinian population oddly no one wants to take them in how strange how shrat in fact egypt will not even let the palistnian population out of gaza e's again if youll gt the border of the gasistrip it borders israel in the north and and in the east and to the south there is a border and is with egypt egypt es h muom country thsigna is largely empty ec ip do not take them egypt has no interest in opening the border to palistonian refugies because effectively the palistonian population ty stablizes what ever regime takes them in which is why jordon which his seventy per cent palistinian expelled twenty thalisin palistoinians in nineteen seventy and killed three thousand of them when expeled them toe leaponon ofm yat just just can a point that out right now and when nicky hayley says where are the aerb countries helping their brothers helping their compatrios the answers they have been used as tools by lot of these countries they have been used as a weapon against the state of israel for a very very long time and they continued used his weapon the cevillins are constantly used his weapon there that that is an awful horrible truth and yet the expectation seems to be that the west is supposed to in danger itself rather then acknowledging reality here as nickey hayley properly pointing out that the aerborlds has gone completely absent on this question you are getting here all of those erab countris tilify israel for what is theabout tho happen yoy're getting here all of them they how there you not do ware for the palithinian people and what we should care about the palithinian fedithinsespectally anethatlence because they didnt ath for the but where are the arab countries where are they where is cotter where is leabonon where is jordon where is t egypt do we give egypt over a tillion dollars the year why are not they opening te gates why are not they taking the palithinans why because they know they cannot get them and they do not want hulath and their neighborhood why would israel want them and their neighborhood ny one comes to u no cultural ploclit proplivity presumably muslem countrys egypt shedmiral cultural poplvity for muslin citizens living in the got a strip but pparently not apparently absolutely not an meanwhile what happens next well the bin dministration is considering the possibility the bidingll actually visit israel directly tony blinkin has visited israel as well he is already starting to put pressurer on israel because as youould imagine this is what they do they keep pressuring for qone quot rec straint israel's gon to do it at has to do it has no other choice this an ext its is an eccistential fight for thesteade of israels tor ther not going to stopic is tonin blinkin says says words about it as far as weather this conflict expand to outward it seems very unlikely that despite all of the aranian talk it is going to expend outward the reason for that is because the united states put two air craft carriers and mediterranean they have threatened bidendit again over the we and correctly they threatened that cas balla should not get in ndtht ecaus blood does try to get in thre'll be consequences that' smart if you want this conflict to maintain it is isolated character then you do need to push people off to ball and seing a lot of bizar isolationist to count cesting that no war for israel no war against oron for israel israels not calling for that no one's calling for that who are the people whare alling for that right now the realities there s on a taste for that america and israel does not have them the wherewith all right now ti t to take on oron or i a three front war and right now what everyone hasn'n interested including in including by the way many aranian allies is in containing this thing i'll selyouwhat asherthink happend here r i actually think happened here is that comas was told by the oronian government that they should do something ad that something was supposed to be a terroristand currsion across the gossoborder and they figured that israel's response timewould be a lot faster an the comasto be a lot less effective and shat they actually figured is thit this terrattack would kill fifty people and cannapfive and tha israel would then have to launch a serious assault in order to try to get back its on people and then soudy would pull out of the deal that is probably what they wanted and instead comas succeeded beyond its wildestreams thand it is now the dog that caught the car becaue they got that they were successful that ow israel has no thoice but to wipe them off the planet and that something that that i do not think that either oron or other terresponsors in the region saw coming and their basic troice right now is either let this thing expand outward which puts at ris cessballah it is rule of lebanon which s natural country or it puts it risk eron itself or they just orhomaskget's taken off the the board at to chesps in fact ther are reports out now from the israel government that the govrment of cotar whichis which is largely aranian a lined in manyways that the government of cotar is pushing a comass to release all the hostages and i fact there seems to be widespread sentiment that all the hostages should be release by comass as an attempt to then create world pressure for israel to stop that struction fomasna i do not tink that is going to be successful israel hase to ecstrapate ckomass because the thirten hundred thead jues still exist it is nons a they disappear even if the hostages are unilaterally released bot right now everybody sort of understands that no one has an interest in this thing going broader oron is making noises and their threatening because the sore to have to make noises and threaten thay deployed weapons in seria presumably in order to try in push israel from from not going into gassa but i i would be surprised it not saing could not happen but i'd be surprised if it would this is the reason why you us in tell apparently is suggesting that a mass have attack bakasballah would be unlikely because if that happened that husbala would get taken off the map as well israel does have the capacity to take amas n cusba law off the map and arondoesnot on lose all its proxies in the region ia

comrihte now that is prepare with ben dot com ell meanwhile the re publicans continue to struggle to elect a speaker of the hous tand mackates s launch day quicksotic quass to get rid of kev mc carthy no one can rell explain why or what he hope to gain by this tere is a a backs a back room speakers election held by the republicans just a couple of days ago in which they were selecting between steeve scolees the hose majority whip and jim jordan who is the head of the over slight committee and scole's one sclees ones on one thirteen to ninety nine among the republican members of the of the house and then he could not put together the two hndred seventeen votes to go forward an actually be elected speaker of the house all of that was for nought ther the sort of back room gamesmanship that suggested okit will hae an election back here and then even if youl lose right even even if your person voted for the losing candidate you vote for the for the winning candidate going forward nope bat did not happens scolees took his name out of contention that is left im jordan but jm jordan is struggling with the exactsim thing according tothe walzerjornal some re publicans a strong support from grassret's conservatives will help new speaker nomina jim jordan win over dozons of geo pe cridicts and take the gavall this wee but opponents are standing firm presseris mounting on re publican lawmakers to resolve their internal fighting nearly two weeks after cemac carthy as ousetid in a historic vote we gogto get past this stage said represented frank lucas fvoklohama ir's not an og political oxygen in this place to think about other stuff jornn of course is very conservative a lot of moderates not huge fansge i know jim athing's great but there lotof moderates in the caukas whyre not huge fans and think that he is too trumpy for example jordan said wergan to get to two hundred seventeen he told or portes on friday but hold thout s within is on party are saink he cannot get the without his support represent o mario teas ballart of florta plants vote againsjordan on the floor dan crencho baktrants as nothingis impossible but can be really really difficult based on what i'm herin he has lot of grassrete support does gum jordan but ther're a lot of people wh are in swing districts purple districts who are afraid that because jum jordan is conservative that y's gon to blow them out that they' lose their house seats if jum sordan is the speaker thes goin to bring up a bunch of legislation that actualy damages them in their purple districts e t is a thing about being speaker o the house it is not about being an inspirational leaderbing speaker ofthe house being speaker of the house is very much about putting a favor there and getting a favo r from here its about wheeling and dealing it is about what kind of poalition you can put together you'r coalition leader if you are th speaker of the house you are not a hard charging senate candidate or presidential candidate and people who are looking to the speaker to be the latter ar can have a lot of trouble because the republican cawkas is very fractiors not just on the right sen a lot of folkas on mackates and the freedom claukas but also on left side of the party where theyare thinkings themselves okay the only reason republicans controll the house right now is because he republicans one o bonch up state new york seats in not particularly con servatof areas ad those seats just go away if the republican party makes a hard turn to its right in is leadership mc carthy for his part has thrown is spor behind jordan he says we cannot have the sgatesdoctrine continue any further he says i think jordn can get there i'm one who understans had difficultid is sdemocrats who now are are trying to game this thing they want concessions from republicans in order to vote for re publican candidate for the speakership here is hikem jeffreys sayingwhore not can hep out the republicans unes weu get something in return have you identified a candidate whom you could potentially get behindam would you alow youre members to thot for republican speaker a we have not identify any cany on the other side of the ow etcaus a fokis is not on the indivisual it is on the institutin of congress and the best insterest of the american people it is why what we suggesten is that we real tin way the rules that ar carrently implace to fesility by partisin cooporaton and a liminy the visit get again the concessions to the democrats at only any republican wants to make those but unless the republicans get their heads out oftheir asses and a certain poing here actually pick a speaker an come thegother round some one this is they are going to have to becaus there wi'll have to be a speaker at some points whit just presless f the obset of what you wants you started with mc carthy's making too many concessions o democrats then gates on company voted entirely with democrats e republicans voted with all the democrats get remocarthy and now this thing could end with somebody cuting a deal with the democrats that gives them benefits just to get a speaker back in places just genius level stuff here jenius thos as i've sed before if you are going to lead a cho against the speaker of the house you' better have some sort of plan you better have some sort of lists of concessions that you think you aregoingto get out of everybody but far that list of concessions is not forth coming nobody is actually nobody's actually putting forward that list of concessions ynobody thinks that list of concessions is going to materialize or or be effectuated it is it is o what exactly is the point of olve isit nobody nobody knows at this point is the answer th this it is it is amazing as i've een taying for a while first party to baseline competente winds republicans have an opening jobiton is not incompetent president he has been an incommetent president the world is on fire nearly every place from little to big little fires in places across the world to big fires one to middle easter one you crane big economic smoke signals that are not particularly good including the bon market and republicans meanwhile are busily kicking themselves directly in the grotch and it is what are you gois doing just why why and i understand the people are upset but being upset is not a strategy it is a mood i get a certain pon you might wont a you might wn to actually try to get something done on behalf of conservatism if you actually care about that sort of thing already in just a second we are gong to be talking about the election in poland which is kind of fascinating is we are told that poland is a right winged dictatorship and i yet the right seems to have

i case one o my coorkers david cast about star to tell me about this thing and really i thought he was compuely i just do s no way it could be true it just seem completely ridiculous and then i got to say the more he explain the more it slowly started to see wike oceb maybe he is right portan fact to know that david before we go any further heat's pagety an physics worked at firmy lab on subatomic particles was on the team that discovered the top quark n nd this whole thing up between him and me began when he told me to download an ap on to my eye fom it is called am universe splitter a case enough opened it up and there is a gray steel fake steel background and says in white type on top of it universe splitter quant om induced universe by furcation what do i do now iit tell me something you or having trouble making up your mind about what to do you and i recorting this on december thirty first ye and i've had a week off i grew a beard i notice om i do not try to decide if i should shave it off a and that is something i'm trying to decide i have an opinion on that but what your pinion ei shalli think it looks pretty gitterit now o gets what is this universe splitterd do it lets you do both i get creates a duplicit of this universe that in one you get to grow the beard and in the other you shave it off wait that wer going to do yet for pretender for real no nog for real may be this is a thing it is called the many world's interpretation of quanta mechanics that a lot of really smart physicists who think this is probably what is happening a case how does this work what do i do next rit that two boxes there ye in one box it says in one universe i will now oki put a shave off beard to night u t off beard to night ok and then the other boxes labeled in the other universe and the other one i will now put keep beard keep beard o i then what is below it and then begod there is a button with an adam drawn on it what i can adam you would draw it in a nineteen fifties cartoon yet that is the esthetic of thewhole thing it i got old piece of scientific equipment what does it do when you push the button if you push the button it sends a signal to a fancy piece of scientific equipment at the university of genevan switzerland the quipment these days can be tiny a little box you can hold in your hand and it does the follin it takes a single particle of light a photon it sends it at a kind of mirror thi can make the voton either go left or right you can make afit that way a random it will go either left or right well according to the laws of quanto mechanics which governorit governed very small things ah it actually goes both it is not that we do not know it actually goes left and right at the same time oke that is superwear right butthat is actually true and demonstrated an we have known that since the twentieth oket then what happens in this device in geneva yes sthe device fires a photon which can go left o right and then the device looks to see well where did it go and we know the particles in both places right ut when he machine looks it only finds it in one place shows it went either left or right oh which does not make sense right cause we know from the math that the particle did go to both places why did we only see it in one o those places and what is the answer iit' one of the answers is that the photon is in both places left and right but just in different universes wait your saying that when you shoot the photon into the mirror it actually creates and entire duplicate of our universe and one of those univers is the fhotanis on the left and the other it is on the right yes it both went left and right those are just indifferent universes the math of it makes a lot of the math of it is very etreme line and simple i member the day i sought in glass nows home my god maybe it is true yes these boxes you fill that on the ap homen the box wary i teped in a shave off yer to night and the box right typed in i keep beard right right ittale basically choose one of those boxes if the photon goes left and the other box if the photon goes right o kak got it you have to do what it says ou may have to keep the beard or shave off the beard it tells me ye yes cause when you press that button you are going to get back one answer but theis going to be a duplicate universe in which there is a duplicate yow sitting in a duplicate studio and duplicate me and you holding a duplicate phone in exactly the same way the only difference is that that phone comes back with the other answer and then that version of me we will do whatever it says in the phone we know that o ther guy we trust him he is going to go do the other oke i think i understand all this what is glad dunipersipon o pushion i to feel weard ifout i feel weard i know it is crazy i feel weard you literly just put your finger right up to the button tan pulted away in fear i ecas sply universe e cases has and put vouit into at contact an gano on hine to vicerat an pro tina maa ontoagan your universe is just spit your in the universe in which he should keep beard and right now in the other universe the other yearse being told to shave off beard tonight after that i kept the rer that night and frencs of new yoars parties asked me about it and if the universe did in fact split the other version of me and the other universe must have had different conversations may be for instance somebody gave him a great idea for a show to day that in that universe instead of earing this show in that universe you hearing a totallay different theme indeed it just to be sure i'm understan thi your things is in a metaphor you' saying there ir scientist who really believe that a second universe gets created yet for sure i man i think it is not most physicis and there are some who think it is ridiculous for sure but there are some who take ite very seriously o ca where is this alternate universe that were creatid yet i non't realieven know how to think about this but if this is true universe is duplicating itself all the time it is a fundamental thing about existence what a day in our programme and universe that may be duplicating itself all the time ma people who become trance by the idea the parallel universe out there e things it different one of those stories things are better in the alternate orld in one crucial way in another story two parallel worlds over lap in another only trus to visit chec ou trys to go to the parallel universe on a beou be easy chicago its thi marit on li on our glass say with us afon yames to my father sos he knowling with a fiction writter that we have not a show some times tat car carret about tiday's theme and he told me that his father used to spend a lot of time imagining worlds were talking about in to days programm paralll world stars that are almost the same as our world but not quite an said his father did the stering during world wor too hi father is fourteen weving in poan he is jewish when the germans abated and starte sending jews to the concentration camps during the day they second wid wor a hemanys perent ay t hittin it in a holding the grounds it e dug for six hundr and twenty days we had the he lat of spar time and when he was tery he would imagine old kinds of thing he would imagin wordin which ay the not ses tdid not exist or in whichhe was not the jew or in which people just in general did not to each other you knowin the enthis kind of thing was something that he sociated wis being a child then he can of fa that it interested him as a child sinc i'm i would proably it to ba during the where his father could not weave that hall for o must two years o not the had quarters was right there near the hall on the same property a christian farmer and his ladies

he would says that e he would sleep in ten he would wake up in san e would usk his father if the wore was over in his father would say know we would go in sleep some more that is the way he would tell it to me i think it is that kind of the socor version i was itlike when you say a hole could they even stand up no the as he could not stand in it and is he could't even lie down in it they had to sit in it and when the rashion is adliberated day te town and thiy he wuld brought out they had to be carried oup because you knows your muscls were cramped zit ay is by thi the time of the end of the words it could not moves them o my cot pasicly ther in this hole undher sitting sitting there yes andy any knois it set it is very very cold in which way ay beont freezing and do not have food and and you hear voices in german and you knows that tthat you can easily be killed and you close your eyes and you think of another univers a cars er in lots of fiction thet imagines parel worlds of various cins and when asked him if ye only to doson i for to day sha he wread the story a true story the star when he was a ed when i was six years old my dead work ta the poos neck bar not far from one of the lavivs beeches every day it five forty in the morning hit leave home for the pool swim to kilomiters showering the lucker room and get to work he would not get home ti nine at night fourteen hours a day seven days ta week unloading bookses of sof drinks pressing tostted sandwiches dring cof ind gleaming glasses at the pools neck bam a li the beat yeas later that always said those wore the best days of his lat fondly remembering how the sotyear blowing in from the sa wuld mexing his langs in the smell of the cofy an thein ported cigaretts he use to sell at the ban coffy sigarettes and the sea we are always my fathers free favor its things for me those days were not quite as happy when that came back from work i was already in bed and others than suter days when i'd go off to visit im at the poois my mon i never saw him aton no this i was beter about this six yer old ye toind cantrally imagine a different word for themselves on n wer ther father had most time for them the except reality as it is and yet i missed him dearly seeing this my mother suggested that i go with him every morning to the pool have a swing together and take a capt to school from there i do not remember anything of those morning swinms but the carwrides wis dead a cristil clear it still dark as we siting our sever piso five or four the windows role down that smoking cant one hundred and describing parillel universes that exist at this very moment in other the mancions universes were everything is precisely identical to ours same road same traffic light same siguretting the corner of dead's mouse all except for one tiny difference and this tdifferene that would change every morning changing the one detail in the parillel universe thet tifferent from ours here we are in the parilel

aboutit it was ovious to as bose that soon he was going to die on mondays i taking in for his phisical serape and es we set ing the waiting room to see the fisical terapie with the british eccent my father sometimes to talked about parillel universes were everything was exactly the same as hours save for one difference say thet dogs could speak was that people could read minds was that the sky was purple and when the mel quite clouds floated the crostit sad look tasty enaug to at at the end of every session the fisicul trapiest would show me how to old my father's arm when we woke together

stories alot this one emotional fables that happened to be true and his bok the seven good years a i too sarry not sarry since contegrim to say this but the moonlight that story of american triumph it could ave gone another way it some other story line from the multiverse knew im strong and buzall drun they land on the moon they walk round it is great but then there is a problem and they cannot take off to come home thas as thught this was the most dangerous momentin the mission the most likely spot he could fail when president michard nixon's speechwriters william sapphire afte prepared a statement to be read in case that was the way the story went but the top of the page and all caps at read in the event of moon disaster for is line of the speech fate is ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace wis stay on the moon to rest in peace pretty good divicast about has his next story about another presidential speech never delivered that also feels it slipped into a world from a parallel universe you can find this speech framed hanging in the guest bathroom of home an california here is david the speech was to be read on the night of august seventeenth nineteen ninety eight it is in the house of bobshram because he wrote it shrum was a long time democratic political strategist speech writer and get her outer of tight spots are you are you personally good at apologizing i've had to apologize many times for many things sure what is the most recent thing you apologized for having a fight with my wife about what we were giving various people wass christmusgifts this story is about an apology he wrote for a much bigger audience that august nineteen ninety eight shrm was on vacation an ithov staying with some friends and the phone rang why did not have aself on and somehow or other o my oufice called me and sad mark was trying to reach me mark is mark pen bit the time was conducting poles and advising the president of the united states with the time was buill clinton wit the time was in a lot of hot water im pinchment might very well be an obshon wat tampering with what as as obstruction of justice ar very very serious charges a moment when one political party said they were very valid high crimes and misdemeanors the other party said that is ridiculous political posturing anyway there had been stories in the press for months at this point that clinton might have had an affair with an inturn monical winsky clenton denied it though under oath in a civil case and famously on tell vision but i want a siht one thing to the american people i wants you to lissti wo sit issgi i div not ihave sectful o lict for that on miss luinski but there was the dress with clinton's deanay on it and recorded fhom calls between monic oluinsky and a coworker talking about the affair at the time bobshrum got the call president clinton was finally gan half to testify before independent council kenstars grantejury he would have to own up to the affair and then afterwards say something to the nation but what that was what the foncall was about shrum called mark pen back who asked if hoe would take a shot at writing a speech for the president to be delivered on tv just after he gave his granjury testimony it would be the president's chance to frame the whole thing maybe finally put it away and prevent the republicans from starting in peachment proceedings the country would be watching bobshrum saidocat the hung up the phone and told his wife in the couple they were staying with on vacation what the assignment was one of the people thever said this better be good meaning you better do a good job yes e i sat at the dining room table o and i i wrote in long hand on a yellow pad which is how i've always written my drafted it what he wrode was a straight up direct apology o do you have it there readia i it is on it is on well actually i can go get it you munt hold on for second shrum went to go get it from where it was hanging in what he calls the guest powder room and to be clared there is other political memorabilion there it is thi speechie's proud of can you read thi speech for me yeet's not very long i well my fellow americans no one who was not in my position can understand fully the remorse i feel to day since i was very yong i have had a profound reverence for this office i hold i've been honored that you the people ave ben trusted it to me i am proud of what we have accomplished together but in this case i have full and short of what you should axpect from a president i have failed my own religious faith and values i have let too many people down i take full responsirility for my actions for hurting my wife rom daughter for hrting monica rerents onin her family for hurting friends and staff and for hurting the country i love none of this ever should have happen and he has clint an apologizing from his leading people about the affair and this is howd en finally i also one wo apologize to all of you my fellow citizens i hope that you can find in your heart to accept my acpolog i pledged to you that i will make every effort of mine and spirit to earn your confidence agown to be worthy of this office and to finish the work on which we had made such remarkable progress in the past sucyars god bless you and good night has th't fill reading thet i i i mean i remember writing it i thought it was the right thing for him to say and when i hear it now i still think it is the right thing for him to say it is notabll that shrom had the president apologizing to monica winti in our family at the time charles rangle of the democratic congressmen from new yark called her crurt and done tramp she as the subject of jokes on light night tell vision bill myr said i think monica luinski's the lonishan apologized to america no one seemed to be thinking about her as a person whos life was now erect shrum wes well andshe was a an in turn kid in the white house and i thought that that mad every bit of sense in the world shrum sent the speech into the white house and then the day arrived clinton gave his grandjery testimony which was not bridcast that evening the president went on t v to give his speech shrum sat down with the rest of the country to watch it we are just sitting around in the living room watching it on talivish and at that point ay thinking maybe h's gan to read my speech sure i thought he i thought he might very well bill clenton who i worked with on state of the union messages never exactly reads what you send him i did not anticipate that it would be necessarily word for word what i had sent but i thought it might be pretty close to it ah it was almost i ametrically the opposite good evening this afternoon in this root fron this char i testified before the office of independent council in the grandjeury i answere their questions truthfully including questions about my private life questions no american citizen would ever want to answer i not only remember hearing the first words but i remember the look on his face he was really really angry it is the private bill clinton who could get angry and i have seen him angry but i do not think the country had seen him angry very often as it a deposition in january i was ask questions about my relationship with modical owinskey while i answers were legally accurate i did not volunteer information indeed i did have a relationship with miste winskey that was not appropriate in fact it was wrong it constituted a critical lapsin judgment an a personal failure on my part for which i am solely and completely responsib there are moments of apology in there and would feel honest reflection when he straight up admits the reasons he had been evasive until then i can only tell you i was mutivated by many factors first i desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct but the over all message is not iam sorry i screwed up he seems to be saying but the real problem is the fact that i'm having to talk about this at all it is a private family matter it is nobody's business but ours even presidents have private lives he closes not by asking for forgiveness is trom had advised but by asking people to stop calking and to night i asked you to turn away from the spectacle of the past sevel monts to repair the fabric of our national discourse and to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next am mericancenturye thank you for watch and could not what do you think would happene if he instead that night he would taken out your speech ind readit i think it would have lesson the chances that he would have been impeached really i do not know that it would have prevented the impeachment but i think it would have lessen the chancees it is possible his speech gets you to the same ending just with a slightly different plot after all there is a lot of momentum in congress toward impeachment but it is nice to contemplate a world wet the leader of your country can stand up and acknowledge having made a mistake can acknowledge reality and apology really is about the truth laying it out we can all live in the same world together it is impossible to magine that happening now clinton seemed closer to it at that moment but he still could not do it i i wonder if all the possible universe is and how many of them does clinton say i am sorry not i'm sorry for what happened or i am sorry if people feel ou know but but really i'm sorry there may be a universe in which he did that i've just not aware of it cause i do not live in it s that the one we live in you want to know what i think i think it is possible there is no universe in which president clinton reads bobshrum speech listenink to the speech clinton did give i kin i think he gives it in every possible universe it was exactly how he felt and and the speech tht you wrote whill great was not at all how he was feel thament i i obviously the speech that i tha that i drafted did not reflect how he felt coming out of the greantury in that sense can you falt him i i just say it you want to do what fits the moment and you wnt to be true to yourself the problem was that i think he was true to the angry guy who has just come out of the room he h was may be not true to the person he was the next day there are the yous in all the parallel world wut osi do you on thursday and the one on friday wante has had some time to think and some sleep and the same which for sure does our different people they testan boun and some other universe he state if phisis tis tral of his life in this one he is the executive editor of our programm bell clen by the way way to wrote about this address tof the nation that nife in his biography et is not mention trumstrafter the speech but he os say that most of his advisers ad countsen ant to simply admit that he had made an althin state not to go out swingin he did anyton of course wek's after that speechhy back tract in front of a smaller audience at par breakfast with religious leaters he took a different tone there he said i agree with those who have said that in my first statement after i testified i was not contrite enough was much close whith trumadry included an apology to my uncle winsky and her family coming out werry that you living in a parallel universe were some very basic facts about your own life had been altered that is in a minute from chicagobubegradio when our programme continues sis mar o li fr my r glass to day's programm gardens af branching paths stories of parallel worlds and people o get fixated on the way things could be in those other worlds in the first half af to day show we had people imagining other better worlds in this half we have people pondering the alternate worlds that are right here around us all the time in this world we have arrived at at three of our show at three scar crossed brothers soverything about it being on identical twin is kind of a parallel world situation you ay have this other version of yourself stuck in the same world as you stuck inthe same house as you you she somebody us just you running around doing things that you might not do dinachovis as this anext ary about a mother her twins and a forty eight your old mystery an tatsclar had a lot going on in the winter of seventy two in january she delivered twin boys jason first followed by randy five minutes later weying five pounds two ounces randyad to spend the first days of life and an incubater they lived in subburban saint louis and nats husband dank had a job an a paper company called tention envelipe he worked long hours and travelled a lot and nat was often at home alone caring for two infants sfeeding them changing dipers and making sure she did not lose track of which one was wic because they looked exactly alike were you always scared that you might mix them up from the day they were born was that of a real fear i tried to be really careful about knowing who either head what outfit they were on i knew always really careful about it usually we had ot thats we had ou bats an different collers blue blue jay and red randy read and then i did not think about it to which ones i knew was icthat is al we did it that is a good system i may i think i did feed them twice and one coun tentent feed the other wal hav't t ot you did thaat that oner was ating therwas crying awon lia whye e cries what se she even had a back up a creative redundency she built into the safety plan for their identities and that was diper pins she is blue diper pins for jason and yellow ones for rand everything went smoothly for a while and then at six weeks they had their first checkem tand nat dressed them in the same outfed a fancy number their aunt low sangeliss had sent them but underneath the clothes the diper pin system was up and running at the doctor's office an nurse took the babies out of the room and nat canrely remember hy made be she needed tway them and a few minutes later the nurse came back in with the boys then she gas a way of such a great surprise for you now we have th ampers wo were just using her the first time instead of using your dipers weused your pamperno and then they give me a little all for of their tins the nurse had changed the babies out of their cl off dipers and put them into disposable ones foiling the system entirely she handed a nette a little bag with a diper bens in it the boys were completely indistinguishable i was very ave sed they go all you are going to be fine you are fine of course they go youre fine and we got in the cine i was sell upset all way ome when she got home a ntt put the babies on the couch and stared at them at six weeks old they did not of distinct personalities yet they weighed the same amount they had the same balld heads nobirth marks and i'm not kitting you they looked exactly and i was thinking i was really terable mother and an ow cand i really look at this and not see my own children and not know which ones they are she co bein a panic i om she co da i im i do not know what i'm gan a o wi do not kno what ant wick i do not know what to do this is a nette's best friend linda wallace aunt linda as jason and randy know her she lived in the same subdivision did you go over there to try to help her yo i did not ye a i she couldn dom apart ho ud i be o dom apart rights ma o i didnt i could not dm apart no te she had epen yehwere you nervous to tell to tell dick re nervous to tell yess yeu weren yes was really nervous when he came home when he came home and he the saw them and they were in ther creb and finally i had to tell my go ihave to tell you what happened and i told hem and he goes really egoes o will figured out let us see and then we were both looking bo the omi next teach other an their course they had the pampers one and nothing and he is going i do not know whato you think it is i clol and net was faced with a decision she had to choose which baby was jason and which one was randy she had nothing to go on but a maternal feeling she chose dick agreed with her i really always felt i had the right person in my heart i just said it is that i'm not in to think about it any more this is my life we know they are and that it is they are and were not gon to talk about it any more aunt linda not convinced do you think she got it right do you think i ha dot o you ma ni don' te she no she da e git a i e o ma o no wi e de we do de b do ma o wi i do i no yo hehason and randy or forty eight years old now their comedians they werked together they done cammias an different to he shos cerbyr enthusiasm and better cauls hall and they still looked exactly the same randy can you describe what jason looks very good looking am jhaing he is very somitic looking he is got glassis at he is about five foot e an a half it is cense somewhat athletic looking less cence they found out about their potentially swopped identities when they were about twelve years old by accident they wer spending a summer weekend at the world famous leak of the osarcs an central misserri with their mam and aunt linda and her two sons the boys were playing while anette nantlanto talked amongst themselves the story of the calamitous doctors as it came up and unbenounced to them jason and randy were an year shot and they overheard the whole thing and we were just we hated the story this us jason the sounds re markably randy we we were livid that this could have happened an also that she was sharing it in sort of an off and the joking wake and linowallace who is a funny woman was making it funnier and they were laughing about aere we were just very embarrassed by it and upset all my godiss is not i sang thing to hear cause we may not be who we are what pissed you off about it what was upsetting about it i think that it just was we were just sensitive i think to being confused and again it was this narrative that conna went through our lives as we wanted to be individuals and we wanted to be seen as individuals and then hears this thing that happened weare we could be easily confused for identical twins two people who were constantly being mistaken for one another we try really hard to make it clear that their unique individuals this was a big deal randy was the most upset e goes why cannot you go to the to the policemen i think grandy really wanted me to go theire you were talking all the way to the card not that an actual crime had been committed just a crime against their dignity that for some reason randy figured the police for the ones who could sorted out but a nut did not go to the police and the name confusion did not get sorted out it remained a mystery and jason and randyes lives e couple cin e wit ot ot ot or year co bty ca co ing about it a wa got i aab i don in it a aget whow i had no indea was that that i'm painful for them i ma a e wi i jo be twen a nat ni at i no cur wit ejo between all abot ica a wer ery a ca about it just the simple fact of the matter that for countless times in our lives some one has said to me jason and i'm noom randy ray that that is happens many times in my life if that is not true there is yoonly goo to every sidon ievn on oa butthere is there is a notion that you have been living a little bit of alike it is a tiny but it is not your lives not your line it is not your fault but still that is that is unsettling in a weird way to me that is just weird that for all this time i had at wrong if they were switche and they have to reimagine something that foundational nobody ever thinks about it their birth who is older who is in the incubator lha grandy says its weird does not really make a differints but also somehow it does and not knowing what the truth is that is even more unnerving n it turns out there was one way to figure it out sometime round the age of forty randy cannot remember exactly when the topic of their potentially swapped identities came out and they were why thon we figure the sout yet they are grown out cadults they should know who they actually were and also they were working as comedians at that point and they thought it might be good material which well see trandy thought may be the hospital where they were born would have a copy of their baby finger prints they coun get those and compare them to their delt finger prints he was not wrong about the signs part of that thay dentical twins have nearly the same deanam their finger print patterns ar very similar closer than any one else's tas you probably know finger prints are made upof lines and some of those lines have tiny variations on them forks or leaps and those markings are different between identical twins for those of you still listening the reason for that is that the markings developed based on the conditions in the womb pressure which is different depending on where the baby is in the womb randy called the hospital where they were born to see if they still had a copy of their finger prints the hospital told them that they throw birth records out after thirty years they were old and out of l until i was back home last summer with my family this is randy and i was digging through just looking at stuff in saintlo in saint louis hofs back in our childhood home that we lived in since we are four years old and i found from the hospital our footprints i i refre ta they were in a book he shat id av the as your bags an my bed there was a nightstand thing that was a chest that you could open upen it was just in the bottom of that i could not believe it and i'd never seen it there before and i thought o ka this is we could find out it became more real real in the piability was rekindled if they could find some one to compare their adult footprints to their baby footprints maybe they could put this mystery to bed once and for all as luck would have it there was just such a person ind boin a part california about twenty five miles from lost angelists where jason and randy now live a fer rensick identification specialist by the name of curt coon tha curt said there was no way he could use a baby footprint from a hospital thos are not made for identification purposes the're maye be cause baby feed or freeking cued their momentous and they usually do not haf much detail in june jason sent hurt the footprints anyway just a check and when kurt saw them he confirmed that they were mostly just unusable s much as a bank but miraculously there was a half inch spot on the fall of the left jason foot that had nice clear lines he should not have any problem making the identification he just needed jason and randye's adult feet jased with the imminent revelation of their true identities jason and randy were forced to think through what they would actuallyd do if they would been switched as babies which less be honest is not along list of considerations d you think ye'd swap names or would we legally change our names mi bes yhou others and if you are if you are swap than your kind of liy committing fraud all the time rite now i gene entionally on intentional fra yet you are why i would be using his social scurity number ra how is that effect everything we do i wonder if it does an may maybe 't only matters if one of you commits murder barefoot and then runs through wets men or something the riht maybe practically it does not act ay matter ow is out you cannot e that y that thanks o tat maybe it does not matter i'm probably right about that except there is one person who jason was legitimately worried about thermam anette who they are very close with theire father died in two thousand nine annettes had two strokes and recent years they are protective out her but she got it wrong all those years ago i would feel bad for arman yes hiy more about that i would feel maybe she would be embarrassed or maybe she would feel she should have spoken up and maybe found out away in that moment to get our footprints ind just to spell it and figure it out annette however was not concerned i just have a feeling that is all my feeling wy definite feeling that i know whose who i know thate you are i' mother i know what if it is it is different you want me to change my name wat wohatd if i became jason an jason became me then you have debed dor feren girlfrints a many

rursia at for if i live here i be home now last threet day is but somebody who tries to visit he parallel world when the chamust lived in herself diamwo explaines the univers emily ended up ind was a postcard for old tily an merica ten acres in vermont with five big brothers and sisters eating candy out of glass cars at the family generals store the ow we just lived in this big house in my parents rely strict u my nas ers oster a tbaio it they always reminded me of the vontrap family even though that is really extriha ie onoaat a real i was i i was lot rose as very much do as i say she almost lived a totally different life emily was adopted from sath cury when she was a baby she is forty now and as a kid she rarely tought about the world she came from what her life would have been there it was the aidies that kind o thing was in a spescially in carrage her family raised her not to ask many questions abot her past but there was one thing she really wanted to know about it i ma mostly growing up i just really wondered what my birth mother looked on that was usually the question that always came to my mine her adopted parents did not look her they were white as was most everybody else in town was hard for her to picture her birth mother's face but there was no one to ask the couple decates later emily became a mother herself and suddenly felt connected to and curious about her birth mother again she started researching how to contacet her and two long airs later finally got in touch then she decided to go on a trip to sath curiou to meet her birth mother a trips that would allow her to tunnel between the universe that was and to the univers that might have teen she recorded parts of it for a podcast called mother had sessions all of emilys emotions about the trip hid her on the way to the air port in new york when suddenly she found herself sobbing while talking to the cabdriver i anyfandy for you i meaning i meaning my birth mather for the first time thas is exected for you wa go abot you bot a bot morder i searched for her i the adoptinatinsy it tefty years ten yearso serci a a i wul bon o a i o o o e won wy bo e i i yo we a y i i a a i bor you yo yo yu w o ma your mother i know i now you freely becaus you and youl o lo o o l i kno yo on yo o o yo o e o o mi you o o in yo o i tho e li ou yo gi i uml going on the plain to for me it was kind of thinking about the last time i took that flight was one i 's a baby and touching down it you remember thinking that the last time i was here was one nigh was five months old she had a day to settle in before she met her birthmother it was the first time she would ever been to asia and wandering around soul it was easy to imagine the other versions of her life all around her i go in stores or and restauant'sn an i think oh could i be that woman behin the counter working there when i'd see a mam with her little girl i feeli oh well is that what it wouldhav been lake to walkd don the street the holding may my months hand on her second day in carea emily carefully did her hair an make up and hadded to the adoption agency to meet her birthmother there reunion hapened in a worn down meeting room in front of a bulletan ford pinned with christmas gars i see this short creean woman walk in the door and ow we hug and and i cry li and she says me on hal which means i'm sorry it is the very first thing her birth mother says to her and i say canton i know which means it is okek e in er o o e that is ta social worker in the room translating for them em his first mother told her her story she got in pregna as a tea najur which was completely shuned there was no place in society for tea nage single mothers a few days after emily was born a relative came by with the police officer in social worker and they took emily away a week later emlys birth mother went to the police station desperate to get her baby back they told her it was too late she called the adoption agency several times over the years to check in on her daughter learned she would been adopted by an american family i talked with her on the phone and when i asked her if she would ever imagine the world where she did manages to get emily back she told me i have not realely had those thoughts but i always drumped about her seeing her birth mother's face meeting her whole extended family later on thact trip i had a profound impact on emily i heard her talk about it on that podcast mother hood sessions and i was surprised and moved to hear her say that being in the same room with her birth family for the first time i felt pretty you noxt si growing up you your parents always tell you that you are pretty hear whatever u i never really believed it but being around us family an we all look alike i fell i fell i was beautiful and i had never froun it that deeply before wher do you think is behind that feeling because after growing up living a lifetime of feeiling yon't fit in and eu know wondering why it may be certain cies do not you or why may we are not the most popular person an school for the first time my life i felt i made sense i felt my being mad sense i fel my face made sense emily stayed with her birth family for three days in a town called donder john in a little house by the railroad tracks there is syramic pots of kimcy in the yard a flat screen teaby in the living room that was always playing cree and variety shows and boperas lots of visitors came by to welcome emily i felt warm familiar on the first night emily was getting ready for bed and her birth mother came in and presented her with four boxes containing gold jewelry for emily her kids and her husband emily excepted them hesitantly then using a translation ap her birth mother told her she said crean mother sleep with her children nom ogat you we doubt emily had heard about this that it is not unusual for cree and parents to sleep in the same room as their kids even when their adults in this room there was only one bed she tried to explained to her birth mother sorry but i preferred to sleep alone it was not clicking emily ended up calling an interpreter she tired who had already gone home for the day and i calleder and asked her to explain that i i could not do it mum and and she she did but you could see that my birth mother was pist and not really happy about it she had missed years and years of of my life i you can understand why she want it sleep in the same room with me but i just could not do it a lot of the time with her birthmother was this as a visitor it was impossible to fit in completely she was a stranger and family all at the same time dropping into a place that really felt it could be home but it was not iand wer isusshoas manging atetor the packasta mother ha

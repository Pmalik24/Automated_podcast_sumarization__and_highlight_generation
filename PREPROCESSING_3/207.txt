a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our website this american life dout o work her was is articale that a comedy whepside put out last year ju see this one there is n cithy's first started going into lock down dedwin said nation's dogs effing loving whatever is going on right now apparently there was not every dog waran's dog raffy fifty pound box or mex was kind of vigilant superprodective dog even before the pandemic and then once locked down started the problem was every one was ordering stuff on line and there were a million delivery people coming there was phedax u p s u s p s amazon all day long or my neighbors would be coming and going and the minute the i could not even hear a delivery trot coming up the street and already the dog jumped on a chair that was near my window was peering out just fully at attention ers pricked up that is when i sare to see his anxiety amped up right he could not get any rest he could not calm down and thehause he was always barking and rawling and couldnt settle down the fact that larn was now home all day with him which rlaza dogswould a been he greatest thing that a ever happened to them f raffy just made things lot words dogs him they need a break right they need a break from the vigilance to say i do not need to guard this person any more this persons out of the house i'm chill that they need to not be on the job all the time and i think that he was on the job all the time that was the problem she took a new t behavior of a trenarian who told her the lata dogs were going through this since the pandemic but raffyon meds meat flavered prosac he did not vix the problem he got worse and worse on waksey with suspicious of people which he had never been before he ran across the room and burst through the door to chase and by a phedac delivery man he langed ed some one on the stairs of the building waran said of an appointmen with the trainer who specialized an aggressive dogs and finally raffy attacked a little girl maybe eight or nine years old just burst through a latchgate ot a community garden where dogs run off wesh wlaran was garding the dor to maketure nobody entered while raffy was in there but he rush paset er to get to the girl breaking through the gate and he girl fell out and the dog just got on dop of her i my god terrifying i mean the dog probably weighed almost as much as the girl ded and i mean my i was just devastated for the girl the girl was upset and crying a walked away limping warrans an experienced dog person she worked with three diffrent trainers when she first got raffy to do with his aggressiveness towards other dogs but the fact that these attacks sints the pandamic were completely unprovok and ond people the fact that the meds were not working the raffy seemed perpetually agitated and just changed she thought about puttng him down she bol she had no choice and i wrestled with those things an ts an excruciating decision to make i've had dogs before that you have had i've had to youthonize o cus they are older there sick and you are putting them out of their mistery and this as a totally different experience because you are taking a perfectly healthy being that loves you more than anything thate would do anything for you wor yo an effact his trying to protect you right right an and trusts you but a completely unprovoked attack that there is there is there is nothing you can say about it there is no there is no way you can reason yourself out of what has to happen nex if you go after oa kid your don she 's notted to put rafy down it is truly the most heart breaking desision i'v i've ever had to make in my life it is th anniversary of the first covid case n theand iestates when you first heard of covet could you have imagined that it would touch you in this particular way that you would din't ta not having your dog there is no world in which i would think that this would be the logicale outcome of covet that i would have to put my dog down that covid would ever have any impact on my dogaming that you' of of all f the possible probable outcomes of a globle pandamac my dog dying is not one that i coult af ever imagined there is certain consequences of the pandamic tat we all know i were four hundred thousand americans dead millians people out of work het's everywhere having tese terrible school years was distant learning but there all these other ways the virus as altered and shaped or lives it is riknly this woman sindy and lincon na braska by the shing it hppened a few days after a dad daed of covet she is boning her many ten into the grage and realised aright my dad he isn't going to teach my son to drive i think it was i was just parking i think i was parking my own car and putting my hands on the keys and just thinking await tha that is another thing that were good of miss now ers on harrison are a ad were really close an she'v got good knowing that a dad was going t teach him to drive as harrisons really smart and funny but not everybody gets him and hean my dad really got each other and they could just hang out mak funny jokes ask questions quiz each other a as 't mat iffact i was just looking i have there is a toy plastic soldier sitting own my desk e daddet open our surgery harrison brought a few of these little plastic green soldiers to his hospital room and said these will protect you why you are hospital great and my dad started staging maattle seens from his h bed and here was can me me and cleanix and then he would text them sotas to my son tay he harris look heres any way test the cid of things tha they woud dustut each other any way driving not huce them just a small specific loss harrison six menth birst da another birth tha at a driver's license which is a few weeks after her dad dive she as going to teach him now a well have to i suppose well take turns my husband and i cant we have not talk to that it any more though i din we know we all can know it is hanging there and in some ways am not moving on with it maybe his way of still and of that magical thinking ous oway we do not have to think about it another way even though we all know that is the reality sin he sai this one thing to me they really caught me by surprise wer tiig about how since her dad died she is connected this whole community of people on wine if lost family members to covet and i asked her what people of sad has been helpful expecting her to say it is been company talked people have beenthrought you been through that kond of thing but the most important thing she is gotten from it i think some validation in that anger am when your surrounded bay still some denial people said the diseases n that serious yeor that masts do not really were ifter your father got six and he says cardileship weree work on t one of his co workers at tested positive eight days before you are angry i t hise employers absolutely and then you are angry at the government in general the way it was handal the fact that we still have a functioning tell a vision in our house is probably a miracle because the number of times that i was ready to throw something and the occupant of the white house wuld talk about how this is no dea it is cuto go away because we clearly knew that that was not true and after my dad got sick and then died ah i was just angry we we knew what we needed to do we could have done something in this country if you heard on joe bidnt talk about the empty chair ye it was actually the final to bay my dad date of death is october twentieth and the last to bate t was october twenty secondt and i'd heard that line i've heard him music before and i i know am that is a part of kind of one of the things may be from the stump speech sort of dhing am right it is one of the things he said a million times right he said it a million times and then i'm sitty on the couch and he looks at the camera and he talks about it again after my dad died and truly felt oh right this is me ow this is my thanksgiving this is my christmas this is my son sixteenth birthday and somehow even though i knew he would said that line hundreds of times before i telt he was looking through the tell a vision straight at me i felt he was looking at our whole family and i felt he was looking it all of us all of the other at the time you only two hundred thousant families just three months later of course thet numbers doubled such a simple thing to acknowledge the lost that is all around us to day on a programme wit the new president office one year after the first corron of iris case was found at the united states it was in seatle january twenty first of last year ther stories about some of the things that ad been lost this pass here things we do not usually think about is part of that empty chair don' you be easy chicago it is this american life o mara glass stay with na one cops and mobbers sowhen yeu saiy exactly about what was lost two weeks ago on january six when rioters stormed the capital building ron reporter or manuel felton watch that day out of all the footted ye saw one vidio stood out to him he mighthave seen this one it is of a single black officer we would all watr find out is name he chem good men and in the vdio he is backing up a staircase holding off a mob of rioters with a tiny telescope n ba tom i gave a manuel the idea he wanted to hear what the day was for black capital police officers e faced off with this mostly white mob a mob the chut up to the capital with confederate flags and other symbols of whites of premacy what did they think about what happene he ventually got a few of these officers on the foune in the shared an inside er account that is really unlike anything we have heard from the capital far some of ther experience of course was the same as white officers but asu here some of it was very different he mnulput to gether this next story from an interview with one of those black officers capital police officers or job is to protect capital grounds and members of congress o because the're not allowed to talk to prest we need to disguise this officers identity an we had an actor coppy his voice as closely as possible how a quick wen ing also this stray contains a raciel sar here is maniel the officer who i'm calling officer jnes was the person almost everyone told me i just had to talk to jones was warm and out gowing his tow and one point he told me his love language his words of out formation he has a lot of feelings about his jorm i talk to him on friday just two days after the attack he was a little stun still processing everything that had happened in nursing some injries ju

biority the breaking the lad bority there headed up to the house chamber iority shops bir and you thinking what in the hellid happening warespounding to these te strast calls officer jones gotting to some really surprising and intense conversations for the rioters whi when he and his pardner was ponding to a call for help from a fellow officer and ran into a crowd of thirty or forty rioters had is straight for nearya full of injured cops i then the gui was wit i told him to go ahead and wit bot to the othe call and that her nd i hold tis calway and i thick them all on my telf y i made 't ae

that officers were told to take a few seconds to send an imol catex to lov ones when jones looked down in his tone he had something seventy tex messagers and over thirty mis calls not long after that

speeches of the performances he was working on the east side ofthe building far from the action the actor whose voice you heard saying officer jone's words he is bangak he nowbet eu see many up coming effext who serious the old man with jeffridges in john withgow coming out we shar something with you that you need that is missing from your life that you may not even ave noticed how much you need this that is in a minute chicago bove a gradio when our programm continues to smark in life myr glass to day's programme the empty chair wear stories about things that ad ben lost this past year things it seemed worse noting as we had into whatever new chapter is going to unfold this year we have arrived at at two of our programme ac too fifty shades of shade here is ut something els that we have all lost since a pandemic sothy it almost feels too small to mention but but really i think is pretty significant wrachel connonly noticeis she is rigter in london our producer willwe sullivan talk to her to understand why this thing rachel's missing matters much let' sart with a little story bhat two brothers e favnk an we a colin frank can sephen thers slighty tifferentages frank is they older brother and he is kind of shorter or less let huntson sevhen the an conson brother but frank as knd of worin carious charming in this kndrly sunny guy they both our kind of attracted in different ways this happened to the beginning of the pensemic the brothers hav moved back to their home town for lockdown in a kind of sirrael second adolescence back with their parents social distance hanging with people thay kind of known in high scol frank and stephen not the real names are in their early twenties they would spent the day drinking outside with some one they would grown up with and shes calld bath and frank the the lest hunsom book unny on he is always had a thing bath and he is kind of you knowu ive ye meaning tostecus for years this night is gin t be our night and he said this to steven nd i think this this is gonde the night of minly happens es the hey were drink he on day ands frank jus got drunk ern drunkran darker and be as people da do ot whe they wont see something but tat once kind of me be responsible wo datit they will kindonly yaso he got by the und of to day ter ry crossers slarring is words just soe telling us in story of wever again ank is not eend was i'm just gon do the nistthing here a just bring bring back frank she drank and does not liquers stephen tells bath i'm ging to be a good brother here he takes frank home and puts him to bed which is all very charitable ein but once he had done this he ben runt back to bats his sychel back as well not ete walks and that is without pins ex sex sex is what happen next between bath and stephen the younger brother the more handsome thet less funny brother who had not liked bath since childhood this is what we used to call gossip way conversation used to be for the pan damic to git away from us i found rachel because she wrot an essay about how she suddenly kn oticed its absons she put her finger on this thing that i've been feeling to she wrote this was a year when everything happ ened and nothing happen and i quickly got the word of talking about the news almost always bad ore asking people what they would been up to almost always nothing just is ome colls with the same people to have essentially the same conversation which was what we don to say is loke o verensi and that it would be wets going all an ever her o blik no thing ectually really not really buch all oh that is true though that moment you was new you nothingethe thing about this story rachel does not even know these people ye ne not at all e she thinks she maybe met one of the brothers at a party once she jus heard the story from a friend of hers he is the one who knows frank and stephen the best kind of gossip of course it is about people but she dn't have tha and she was hungry for it it turns out in a pinch are in a pens emic strangers will do you cannot sleep with the person your brother likes you just do you tin i o bo i i i kind think is one of those drog things worts ecause some one soe one's comlice et yor i mi to they even the wors dislike i ii i jus o youyear i yer as li ed ye rachel and i are both living without kids or extended family we have not lost our jobs neither we nora loved ones got very sick i recognize how don our concerns are compared to what many people's lives have been but we both noticed a thing that over the course of the pendemic had kind of drifted away while we were not paying attention the ability to socialises a normal person talking it turns out is a muscle and when you do not use it much for months on end it can atrophy rachel remembers the first time she went out to meet up with more than one person i it was eatually the next day i felt i ron martha an or i done was extraordinary he jos jurance ho can it was just having conversation wemore than one person poor couple are it was a jol lke yo to have to really cisn per saying i vocersonyoure boldy langrage i've felt this also friends will get an touch and wont go for a whilk i'm u snonds awkward i'll se yo after the pensemic i's all that i do not want to see people there is just no fuel for conversation suffer before the pendamic is too well to talk about now what y supposed to talk about when there are no situations rachel starto doing this thing that i thought was pretty brilliant just ard asking people kindy gossip about any one nd a kind of worked conversation was easier when you are talking about the tailor who lied about her husband's death to avoid an uncomfortable conversation about a missing shirt or the guy who hooped up with his room made and it did not work out and should he move now i coul talk your ear off about a friend of mine whose fance broke up with her during couples there a be remote couples there i be aoverizume how my friend watched your feon say down per from their laptop screen even though they were sitting side by side on their bed this kind of tot it was not exactly normal before but it was good enough thike pretty decent vake meat take that story about the two brothers it delivers the thrill of being scandalize and that i mented little bond you feel when you haddle up with some one and judge people together clearly the younger brother stephen was wrong the handsome snak but also beth theyr brothers did you really have to do that but actually holld that thought thereis wore and here is ae rest of the story frank the funny one he did not know his brother had sepped it beth and about a week later he also sleeps with beth the crass she puttips on back in eighth grat he was really excited about ir and te who siting with a group of friends fe days after kind we kno can boasting they wuld cing to have a lockd on thing in tha ye knotice his finally happen a man one of these friends was i wat bit but stephen i'm presening you do i'm frankwas what an then he was broken to him by this almost o broken in front of a kind of groff of people and then he had of how to row back and be life i was not i was not serious if i is i did not mean we wuld have a lockd on thing whic it is always is it is always mortifying when you i've been talking earnest say aby something an then it is revealed that you did not have a piece of information th a the gle as latelye frank called bath and told her the whole lock down thing was off he and his brather had a big falling out tath was really sad because it turns out she actually liked frank bat the same way he liked her the thing with stephen was just a drunk hok up frank was the real thing oh really she was we could have had a lock down thing yes she was the lockd i things off cards but it should being thus shon bein wek whent an i shon told him she is confiding all this in a friend who will call sara wo then goes off and sleeps with frank even though beth had just told sra how much she liked him i tes everyone behaved does a human dolls which is everyone isself intrested people do do things aur of vengeance in spite that is just nomole behave your ats part of life and i think when we were discussing different chaltors of the story one person would be totally aphalled but the fact that some oe wult you sing and li ya noi i would e tat i'd cannot have been dreading this interview jos i drad talking a any when these days i social skills a resty i worry that we would run out a things to talk about i had actually postponed our call for a week because of that tut it is really findsed talk with you about this and i'm an my got him totally paying attention i'm following everything she is saying am realating i ii olperating ses uly yo tn as a human yar that as a joke i under stood that it is ugjesi my jo was that ther was itis very funny an i enjoyed i did enjoy it i realize it is one of the most fond conversation at had in months it is not about ship talking people it is about the ship talking itself and the fact that were doing it together i have not even told you the last part of the story that is matter her friend sara for sleeping with a guashe she tells us other friend saras a slit and then that other friend turns around and tells sara that called ye wa slit ye knotics corre old friend is litit well i not be come part of this i sh completely inserted herself into te tin o ac she to me this is the worst is inserting yourself i this with no other li i she even sleep with anyone yas she just was iv i had to tell her a bhat shea beal tshe mon you do people snit say always ing of lifisis everyone os there al ways thasently felt e let a and i principls compelled me a in stupe bi would not i would not wit athing but i felt i had toi tru i coald actually see myself being the snitch in that situation she had the right o now it is her rigt i coan hear myself doing that just inserting myself lik the worst character in it a niacnostakes in it just leaing to be ba stithis quiet i conversial thinker that me i her a what ois a cocecy eing ar just eing ot in be o person tenli other beoplre liht i youres mit agan i batthien is right who is wron do be care be dal wel he sellotan this sbd eser on ourshell for ou gossip and thoughts about gossip if im rachel conways essay that inspired this story and haslet tas her firs came out is pretty delightful it is called the year in gossip tat three there is a german word for that when they thy we lost this pasturis on tin big some the real took for grantet i think something kind of frightening in its implications and that isthe idea that we could come out of national election and agree that it was leget and agree on who one he rither on one side of this or the other either you think the man in the white house to day won the election fair and square ar you do not to statid o clearly and unambiguously i and the producers of this ridior program side with all the people out there who do not think the election was stolen in gouding apparently now former sentat majority wut ere mih mc conell who said the people who believe otherwise were fed lies but right now millions of people believed that wrong gui is in the white house a third of all voters believe thre was widespread fraud which is remarkable right back on nomember gernalist in germany youll and biddner was watching tis unfold seeing the fate evidencethat was showing up under the hash tag stoppd the steel reading the president tweets about supposed election fraud and for some reason what what is frank to my mind was than the memory else i the toy sholl s againall the step in the beck mit the stab in the backmith that a lean about in school more less every german would now the step in the becniss because it was such a potents o wy thegerman history stop the steel is about losing an election the stab in the backmith is about losing an entire war namely word wore one but their paralels betwee the two eyes and the way they took hold henrein settling te hi stry out goes this spasically here came a point in nineteen eighteen the united states had entered the war german suffered defeats is cured to everybody the german he was going to lose he fact navy sailors refused to head out to be killed on what they saw is suicide missions in a word that was doomed within germany lodes ofthe population was against it and in nineteen eighteen the german surrendered german emperor cisor wilham the second abdicated the thron fled the country germany became a democracy for the first time but right a way starting in nineteen eighteen incidentally also at gobepandemac going on right then the nineteen eighteen fle fifty million died right then starting in nineteen eighteen right wing politicians and newspapers started pushing this lie the cand of staty angry grumbeat of coverage seig that in fact the could have won the war if gews and social democrats and left us adn stabe the country in the back by forcing germany to surrender bou the creaters loff we stepon the beckness new that they were lying oll the lecses o the lodend off a woe leke us upported the nassies tthey knew well that a the wollas lost was e lost cause after the smith begins one of tho thinks that you right is that there was no national consenses only reality yes on what had happened to this and it became impossible for a democracy to continue yes an that was quite true and thear te disturbing effect of the step in the beckmis was that it did not grow weaker but stronger ower the eas and you might have expectet an that eventualliee people will see the trus am they will acknowledge the fects they will believe with gernalists and serves and historians tell them but and the contrary is true tis i gan one of the big things that i took from anobed that yorand wrote about all this back in november in the new york times that ali this might not die off on its own i very well might stick around and growin power throughout the machin twenties the idea that certain germans but to blame for thes defeat for the bi loss was very sedectiv and very atrectis and i would go far to say that itit have not been for the step in the beckmites at the nosies could have never been as successful as they were it was a central premise in hicgers speeches and ideology an you beclar yoren biner is deeply aware of the diffrences between america to day and germany in the nineteen twenties he is not saying that we should acpect the rise of a new aht off hicerer someting that but he is saying hat when nineteen twenty's germany shows us is how effective and popular and alternate reality can be an a country this steeply polorize the other point along hese lines that really has stayed with me and feels relevant to to day in america is that back in the twenties people who believe this mat ther opponents is traiters is people who betrayd germany in this basic fundament away which tin justified anything that was done against them tha the actual accusation am was that all the people responsible for the caled step in the back werl criminals an november sabrecia november criminals who sin the amistes in november ot in eighteen the idea was that they were the ones who obstructeds the legitimate course of history but when you say that it makes me think about the protesters at the capital who who feel the elections been stolen of course extreme measures sare called for and elections been stolen from them that this is an interesting manserd is not it i mean we know it from people who are convince of the righteousness of their cals that they believe that even violence is legitimates to thechieve their games it is more or less a terroris monser or extramists mons of course they feel that they are the extual defenders of the true america e i i retthat an republicans which he spoke out against trump and against the of the steel compan they know has to fearfor their lives i saw that to the deat threats agains republicans whovoted to accept the election results a back in the twenties in germany ther was violence starting with the german politician who negotiated their terms of surrender and were t were won he was murdered a man named a tious eritzburger one of his assassins from a first vailed assassination attempt on on trial until the judge they did it cas erczburgers stabed the country in the back in the judgeston where he got this idea he said the newspapers ym presen binds an office esign executive orders in talking about unity and trying to turn the page but ali this big e did not lose a war ye din't lose an election on sic ground infestor and grow if cn we to be belosing faith in the entire system of government fact germany stoped being a demo cracy by the thirties and can we do violence bthat for farn twining theys programms about losses that are on accounted for what of our producers co a droffe wall tis mething about the logs of kids during this pandemic yer hat wa cawful wood they have lost one in in particular i saw him on zume last may i'd got tan emal asking me to show up for some online ralliys and he was at one of them the rallys were for youth programms in near city programms that were being considered for budget cuts my kids after school programme was one of them heverybody won con the n yo n was se virtu raly e as everybody godill bei os o tein wordin worl wo it is strange going back to this vivio now and seeing how saked everyone is to be on zoom together there is familyis and staff from programms across the city and people are practically giddy to see the people we used to see in the world and her doen oe e in me ol lo a me o ina te o mature in eer wol r o ol me yet aready ready i 'd forgotten this time back then last may we still believed we could get our lives back people in this rallys say well obviously were ginined somewhere to send our kids we cannot just close all the places children go every day a single dad says in a sant ly parents mee coe keep their jobs there is a programme director his budget is about to be cut and he saying but i mean we cannot lay off hundreds of people in the mill an demac come on this is a lot of what the meeting was people talking about wither programms should not be cut e specially parents and kids the kid who has stuck with me many months later is a little boy he spoke i sitting up straight and stiff in a blue collared chirt clearly nervous ir every one o my name is jolston tana a and om i sh one to say that yat first he caught my eye because he seem little most kids speeking were tea naturs he looks he could be nine or ten but when he spoke it was clear he is older an middl school he talks a kid who wants tho sound an adult and is eager for his vocabulary to catch up o draw my time there i got to no people and do engaging a chimneys with them and now i can call them my frend o he is oking increasingly nervous maybe trying not to cry he cannot tell be can programrally helps people in a community that do not really heaven he were to go after school it helps it really helps with the om wit with the comunity and o sorry on second he turns off his camera and we all just wait looking at his black square is he coming back twenty seconds pass we love you jo o it is o hundre ye don is jol loe e men yo a he turns his camera back on and finishes ah i just wanted to say that and i just want to emphasize that it would be such a lost to hat some sor cut that would o sort of o o fo it it or om ar wit om or growth in the community and it is om tes frmun o tet wos me half grosth om again it would be such a lost to om many kids an you thinking about what is been lost in this past year i've wondered about joal how scared he seemed of losing his after school programme hows cared he seemed in that moment i wondered what was going on with him nd if his programm gak cut and what that twenty second silence was about last week i called him up introduced myself and asked him what was happening when you turned your camera off a i av you i r it it out ye ye re out ti i o beawy a a har i a bait ye'd t yo te omting that e that may a bi cak aa lie aa e yo ye ha take it away joel told me he wrote out what he plann to say at the rally an advance he practised his comments practice summin different rooms and his apartment considered if he should print them no he should hold them in his hand no he should put them to the side jol thought somehow if he said the right words in the exact right way the programme would come bat he e al o o that i bet pit e i thi think that we bi would be a e yure but i woll hae that porta li joell wanted that was committed to saving his after school programme he cause there was a big thing that happened to him there something that was really big to him and is also really small his mam seritolo pez rederi gas says you have to understand who joell was before middle school there is ta reason joell speaks an adults he grew up around adlts it was always him an his mam when he was little seriza used to take him to night school if she could not find child care when she went to law school they lived in the dorms together joell spent a lat of time around a dults but with kids he just could not comnect his mam tried spords programms joell was not a sports guide she got him together with her friends kids he would hang on her leg she thought maybe we meed to move r there let yo know serto thought made be somewhere more diverse maybe he just needs to feel more included hes a rit before middle school they moved to queens i try to fi te part with the bo hid i gl if i cal goner half to pra with fombody here you would alwad o o life here culd bi they wer cik pring hagit i capt e oe pic o wor

begecan he go mam you do not earn yor bard te o a be o e te ca itt i o e he said those words ye he would gi bitter bat o wor terard bi lirkin your heir a rik ah then joell started middle school re to send him up for the after school programme and thats when something big happened for joel he made a friend too actually and after school james and richard and then locking home from after school one day joel met a kid named daniel who as become his best friend joell told me that could easily have never happened the two of them crossing pas at the exact same time i i w want if o hardei itdl te o eco e roblyat a a o a o er ye all have a have bunl he says if daniel went in just a middl a second sooner they would not ave had a chance to meet and have a friendship and what would that have meant for you i yo i algt i do not kno wo he wu who bi a o e hav we a a a r i coul think that wa i had a hi bat wa wi wor a a co wor oho e a aabl out joll said i men only child this was huge for him and after that he threu himself into the world an a way he had never done before at lunch time he had a table a friends to sat with he send it for atography an after school he ran for president of the after school student council and he wont he saw a councser one day playing with devil sticxs sort of juggling and joel begged his mom to get him some soreta told me he was obsessive about mastering it t was the first time she would seen him have a hobby joelt was suddenly enthusiastically responding to the people and opportunities and chance encounters around him heis mastering the social aspect of being a kid and then the middle of seventh greed but the pandemic after school shut down it went before regular school closhed and those first few weeks were jarring getting home early letting himself into the house anit did not be ol wit id fo a morbl would you do with your time o a ai e wae i at a falt wi i wut je al ofited wa ot o mi bet and i bord it e ben oborhe ord a old i that has not gone away jolsmom told me sometimes she still finds him lying on the bed no phone or book just staring at the ceiling wright when his world should have been getting bigger it is got in much smaller he goes from his bedroom to the living room to the kitchen he talks to his mone i asked if he sees friends and on mine school n jel said ye thit is not the same asked if he calls his best friend daniel he says ye age oti ye i wud just thinking listening to you a a i know there is a lot of concern about learning losts kids missing out on the things that you would normally learn a middle school jdeveloping you are writing skills and learning algeba and geometry do you think there are things that are not a counted for on that list oo ron on a wen i walk o cient wa li a o ta bi yah i really wit you get i no i te at not a countabl it be a do not you a expectigor eop tehand an no what a bigool the social aspect ye an you had just gottin that yeh o o there are the losses we know have been suffered by children this past year hid's of lost family members they have lost learning stability sometimes access to shoot there are the losses we know but what is it mean to lose your thirteenth year in the world what would have happened for joel in just one year he made a friend he learned how to make his way through a middle school cafateria how to look around and say no not that table not there yes here this is the place for me he tount his first hobby he learned he could ask his peers to vote for him and his ideas and they would what else might have happened no one ever says you are only thirty nine once but you really are only thirteen once joel finish seventh greet at home hol pobably finish eits greated home too and the next time he steps foot in a school building it will be to start high school he is never going back to middle school that is gone bwhoever he might have become that is gone to on a jufyo al is one of the juces of osho if you have not heard her pod cast ti

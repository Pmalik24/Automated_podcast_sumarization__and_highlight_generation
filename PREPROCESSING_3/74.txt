todayshos ponter baxxpressvipian thousands my liters v already secured their neortata join them expressvepiandicon flashmen yesterday steven crowders in vestigated reporters broke a huge story the long hidden manifesto of the natural tennessee trans school shooter o march twenty seventh twenty twenty three the shooter a twenty eight year old woman who believe shu was a man shot up the covenant school in green hills killing six people mostly children given the identity of the shooter the media quickly jumped to the narrative that the story was lack of gun control in fact that narrative quickly spun into another narrative about racism after two black democratic lawmakers illegally storm the house flor in tennessee and took control of the chamber and then faced the prospect of exspulsion from their seats gun controld and races hm against black americans those were the narratives the medea spun about the nastral shooting the real story obviously was not that it was the evil insanity of the shoter herself what might have forced coverage of that issue would have been if we had all seen the shooters manifesto in virtually all other cases in which a nasthur leaves a manifesto the manifesto or at least its general message is made public nearly immediately the august twenty twenty three jackson di'll shoting targeing black americans featured a white supremises manifesto for example the twenty nineteen ell passo shooting targeing his fanic americans fetured another white supremises manifesto the twenty fifteen tarleston shurch shooting featured a white supremises manifesto the shooter and natural had a manifesto two but we were told it was utterly unclear just why the shooter had targeted a religious school and we are told that the manifesto was quote rambling without a clear political motivation in fact a federal law in forcemenofficial told and becy news that quote no direct motive has been established in the investigation and then suggested that the driving force of the attack was similar to previous school shotings in which the assailant was drawn to other mas killers we are told that the manifesto might never be released despite the fact that the natural police department releace a list of items belonging to the shoter incluoding in suicide note three folders and nineteen journals it has now been seven monts the manifesto still has not been officially release but rowders investigat ive teem somehow obtain three pages of the manifesto and here is sum of what it says two three twenty three kill those kids those cracker is going to private fancy schools wit those fancy kakies and sports back packs with their daddi's mustangs and convertibles f ou you little bleaps i wish to shoot you weak ass with your mop yellow hair wanti kill all you little crackers bunch of little f words with your white privileges f u f words three twenty seven twenty three death day today is the day that it has finally come my campely the sear do not know how i was able to get this farbit here i m i'm a little nervous but excited too been excited for the past two weeks there were several times i coul hav been caught especially back in the summer of twenty twenty one none of that matters now i'm almost an our and seven minutes away can believe i'm doing this but i'm ready i hope my victims arnt my only fears if anything goes wrong i'll do my best to prevent any of the sord god let my rat take over my anxiety it might be ten minutes tops might be three to seven its gunnago quick i hope i have a high deaf count on quot what do we kow about the shooter well we know that the shooters pouted radical left when slogans about white privilege and wanted to shoot white kids we also know that the shoter came out as a trans gender man on face book in twenty twenty two we know the shuter attended the christian shool as a ten your old kid in other words we know that a transgender person suffering from severe mental illness and citing left oing slogans on race targeted white christian kids we are the case the reverse wer th sutere a religious christian targening sextually confused children of color the manifesto would have undoubtedly been released immediately the entire media conversation what of centered on the evils of christianity and white racesm in america but the story had to be buried and that right quickly it is not o kates talk about trans violence in te united states despite violent threats that attach to any one who says that men are not women and women are not men in fact the washington post ranon entire piece after the trans school shooting claiming at the right was quod exploiting nasturial shooting to escolate antitrans rederic the white house issued it sympathy for transpeople over all here as corren chon pierright after the hoting and whant o ta thing that we saw during the miternal actions is that people do not want their freedoms to be taken they want us to fighte fror their freedom and it is shameful it is disturbing and are harts go out to thothose the trant community as they are under a tack right now the story from the white house from the left is always about the victimhood of trans americans trans americans are always experiencing a massive wave of deadly violence even if that isn'n statistically true it is not o ka to talk about anti white violence in the united states either whiteness we have been told must be abolished whiteness is inherent privilege whiteness is it isease to cirse never mind the fact that in twenty twenty one eighty seven percents volmon leaful into racial violent crimes comitted between blacks and whites for example or black on white as hether mc donald points out whiteness is the problem the fact that these are cherished left wing narratives means they must be protected at all costs and that means burying an inconvenient manifesto in reality if we are going to release any masshooters manifestos and that is questionable whether we should but if we are going to release any of them we have to release all of them if we are going to examine the motives of mashooters in order to un cover supposedly unique american ills we are owed the full paminiply of the criminally evil but we will not get that full view and we all know why in just a second we will get to a shocking murder that happened inlows

have been told that these pro comoss protest they are all peaceful they are all decent it is not that thei'r anti american raticals who wish to destroy the west none no these are all decent members of the intersectional coalition again the narrative in america is very simple and in the rest of the west for the left here is group of people we call these people the oppressors and thre's a group of people and we call these people the oppressed andif you are member of an oppress group you can never be an opressor and if you are member of an oppressor group you can never be oppressed that is the way this works i youare transchoolshooter thou're ember of an oppressed group and oppressed minority and that means tht we have to bury your motives and your identity tif in fact it turns out that youre motives and your identity are connected with you'r status as one of the oppressed if you are a member of an oppressor group and yhere we just mean people who are powerful people who are rich people who are not poor it does not matter if you are opressed if you are a jew for example in the united states and jewes are jus proportionately highly educated wealthy in the united states if youare a jue that means youare a member of an oppressor classed and that means that no matter what happens to you twe have to pretend it did not happen to you we have to pretend that you are somehow the victimizor this this extends by the way it abstracts up to the highest level in internationalppolitics if you are member of an oppressed group say the palistinians for example and we know their ppressed because they are poor and the're not poor because they have not spent dime tbuilding up theyre own society theyrenot oor because they continuously elect and put into power people whare terris the're not poor because they 've decided that murdering jews is more important then actually growing civil society they knot they are poor becas obviously the were exploited and we know they ere exploited because they reports perfectly circular they are poor because they were exploited and we know they were exploited because they are poor they are inthe opressor that they are intheoppressed category that means that whatever they do to the quot n quot oppressor even if that oppressor i's the only thing that has provided them any money any living any jobs for the pass twenty years even if that oppressor qut pulled out of the gosetripinto thousin five that means that anything that happens to the oppressor group meaning civilian jews in israel is justified anything that happens to commoss is un jussified that is the logic and that logic justifies pretty much anything it justifies pretty much anything it also ends with blood es a turns out that if you break down all of society and all of civilization into these two groups oppressor fore s is doppressed what you and up with it is people who believe they are oppressed and also believe that they have full immunity to do whatever they want this why the black laves matter riots in two billian dollars an damage there is a baseline assumption that people do whatever they want andyou know what they were right it is why over the weaken you's hob people to face statues of ben franklin try to climb the white house walls is why you saw that the reason tht ou sall this is because these people feel they have immunity because they are a member of quot oppressed class and if you are not a member of anoppress class let say that you are white american the way that you are able to join thoppress classes which is a great thing beause the inscentive structure is to give you full immunity for anything to do all you have to do is joine the solidarity coalition that is all you have to do that presumably is the reason why all of these violent protests are happening all over the world because again once youra member of an oppress group can do what ever that held that you wants and it is not as the people do not say this out loud they do tere's a fascinating piece over then your times called a cross the echo chamber a quiet conversation about war and race when two acquaintances in atlanta sat down to find common ground on the israel kommas war they found themselves in a painful conversation about race power and whose suffering is recognized race powern who suffering the entire article is about two people one name sameraminciln who om is a jewish woman a very liberal jeishwoman and the other a woman ame senidia oliver senidia oliver is a procomasnic and surotomane quote the actual history of the situation is not complicated i will always stand beside those with less power less wealth less access and resources and choices regardless of the extreme acts of a few militans who are don watching their people slowly die she says the quite pite out loud the cent cinity oliver if youare a member of a quonq powerless group if you are poor you can do literally anything and she will stand with you and it is entire article is about minkiln who has brought in gans you liberal jo minkiln who has brought into that premis not being able to convince oliver out of that premis quote in nearly two hours together on a recent whons the afternoon the women stumbled through discussion of race power history and whose suffering gets acknowledge both liberal demograts they touched on many of the same dispuses now royling their party hollege campasses and companies a cross the country what exactly to the conversation golike they wont exactly as you would think olivers had quote i have a very strong affiliation with marginalized people brown displaced refuge he is blak we usually hear the prospectives of those in power and our school is about amplifying the voices of the disem powered she then accused minkiln of defending quot settler colonialism and she recalled expressing disbelief that the displacement felt oka to jewish people minkin thought that question was an over simplification because you not historically ignorant ste jews have historical ties to the land she said we have failed to acknowledge we have to acknowlege the policies tht av benapplied thus far have failed i hope maybe the end of this their some sort of large policy cracked open by the people whoare supposed to be leaving us leaving us p but in the end all that happen is that minkiln said quote you see me as white in that cinary or your lens of the oppress in the oppressor leaves only one space for me tut i mas see myself as jewish in that scenario it is much more complicated that is the wrong argument but minkin cannot get out of the argument because once oure in the oppressor opress matrix it does not matter if you try to claim that you are jewish and not white tht macs no difference at all you are member of an oppressor class because jews in th united states are disproportionately wealthy and highly educated which means you are an oppressor the actual answer that mincin refuses to say is the oppressor up pressed bying yary is stupid and wrong whel makes you an o presser is being oppressive whel makes you a pressed is being oppressed it does not it does not identify by race it does not identified by income but as long is the left is addicted to the sort of nonsense evil is going to a par and be justified by the left well that is where we are with regard o these prokomas protest which resulted in the murder of a sixty nine year old jewish man the other day according to a b c seven paul kestler died as result of the injuries sustained at an event sunday acording to venterr county sheriff's office investigators he is sixty nine years old hofs coat injured and an altercation at a propalistinian raliatza at's a very nice way of saying that he is beat over the head with megaphone which is actually what happen it is believed kestle was invalved in an altercation propalistinians a monstrators when he was injured he then fellon hid his ead on the ground according to the sheriff's office suremember if january six protestors slash rioters are involved in physical altercations with officers and those officers died days later thameans january six of the violent insurrecion that ended with death if however prokomas protestor beats a sixty nine year old man on the head and he falls down and hits his head and then dos the maturus o vot that tuston altercation is just tething that happen kind of the nature of the altercation remains under investigation but somereports indicate that before he fell kestle was struck in the ead with a megaphone by an individual whit the propalistinian evenge who is pronounced t dad on monday he ventura county medical examiner's office has determinen cestler's defth to be a homicide cuause by blunt force head injury by the way this is not in thes dregs of los angelis this isn' thousand oaks which is one of the nice more up scale areas of los angelis wos is great crime apparently he was flying in his raily flad the jewish reteration of greater losangel's releast tostatemen quote we are devastated to learn of the tragic death men elderly jewish man whois struck in the head by a megaphone we will ded by a propalisinian protester in west lhiy village our harts avert the family the victim whle we waite for more in formation fror our lowin forcemen partners we are mind you this the fourth major ansmetic crime committed in ella this year alone violence against our people has noplace in civilized society but again civilized society is sem it depends on high dfine civilization and fror t left civilized society means pretending that anybody who is standing with the quotonclor prest can get away with literally anything this is the way the logic works i'm t e left and what is that lead to shockingly a rise in antisematism will get to more on that momentarily first the october fifteenth tax deatline his arty pass tan kno many of you might be dreading the strefts of filing your taxes viling your

them violent according to the your post an indian woman whom cop's described is a terrorist has been arrested after she allegedly plauedher car into what she tought was the jewish school this story is actually hilarious because it turns out that it was a it was am a badgiam badgag crime ruba almag thot thirty for allegidly back for vehicle into a building a sociated with black hebrew israelates and indian apolis laid friday while several adultsan children were inside the reason i said to bagin bag gag rime intrms it is in its more accurate sates an antisamad an antesa my crime the blackebrew israeli turn anti semetic group she saw a jewish star on the building and she assume that it was scynegoch and she ran her car into a black hebrew israelate congregation she is offended by a hebrew israelate simpole outfront according to a policereport said yes i did not on purpose she repeatedly describe the building as the israel school adding th driver also made a reference to quote her people back in palsta now is the white housekin comments on any of thus of course not they biands the oppressor opressmatrix the white house well build an entire is lamafobia campaign olf of the evil stabbing of a palistinian kid and his mom in michigan and then meanwhile they will never mention a woman driving her car into a school because she thought that it was jewish school i soom they will never mention a sixty nine year old jewish man being killed on the street in thousand oaks because you 's flying in is raily flag he is all of that blows up the narrative meanwhile over night a brooklyn man was arrested for attacking religious juise with pepperspray hou're some the vidia here is being a re this da of person being rrested apparently it was a female who is attacking jews of pepperspray in brooklyn sh had a knife and pepperspray on her when she was rrested meanwhile poster describes her going a lobit further now ther not s strong posters of kinnap children theyare actively attacking people who tried yo stopp them or asked them questions about it here was som vidio from the streets of new york again this woman belongs that she has full impunity she is a member of an impressed clash which means that she can not a sall people on the street she ns al ce wor sully fine do not worry it is alli's all fine he man o pressor oppress matrics that is the way that this work and this is the way by the way that coalition is built the coalition is the supposed coalition of the opressed nd it makes up three categories you have the actual full scale members of commoss as it turns out for example according to the ucae telegraph the people organizing the marchis these giant marches in britan are members of commoss mohammedc cathemat sallas ha for as a founder of the muzzlem association of britan one of six groups that organized the london march sat for november eleventh he is a former commos chief the former comoss chief and he is organizing this things you have the actural commosnix those people are companied by the civilizational fellow travellers they are companied by the other members of the supposedly oppressed case and those people are company by the cowards and the cowards are people who just a moral equivalente tall i take no sides i am a moral sophistic i do not know who is right i do not know who is wrong i'm not going to i'm just going to say that i wish that piece rained on earth the miscongeniality version of world forn policy that does not matter of terras are killen people and then people are tempting to killterrist is all the same to mean i just do not known i'm just i just i i'm i'm smart enough that i can comment on the situation i'm smart enough that i can inject myself into the situation but i'm certainly i'm not wis enough to actually takesides all i know is the geniside on all sides is wrong of course trying to pretend tha we do not know exactly who what you are doing when you say the boatsides are tempting commatgenicide everybody can see exactly what you are doing when you do this you sudosophisticate idiot to it is truly amazing this coalission and this coalission in the end just reinforces that same oppressor oppressed matrix that is under mining western civilization that is what it is and that oppressor ppress matric is riding hard to try to convince jobiden now to separate off from his support for israel that is the goal the goal is to under cot american support for israel by sigting this matrix this oppressed matrix will get to that in just one second first as a daily wirelessener you are not just informed you are engaged to value freedom and personal responsibility this is why you ned to check out medishare mishare is a community based approach to health care that lines up with the principles you believe in you are value's matter and with medishare youre healthcare dollars will not be used fror medical proceedures that do not line up with your beliefs medishare is the highest rated health care sharing ministry with a thirty year provin track record it is not health insurance it is a community over four hundred thousand believers comited to carring and sharing with one another members save up to fifty percent or more on their monthly health care coss member satis faction surveys show they medishare much more than health insurance why well because it works for limited time daily wirelesseners or asee that one hundred and fifty dollar gift card when they join medishare to find out more go to medishare dot com slashben that is medishare dot com slash ben terms and conditions to apply we all know the shortcoming of the american health insurance system one way that you can end around that and get the carry you need is to join up with medishare the highest rated health care sharing ministry with a thirty year provin track record go checke him out right now that is medishare dot com slashben and get a one hundred and fifty dollar gift card when you join okase the this intersectional coalish an the opressed matri they are now tempting to utilize whatever levers they have nor to push jobidon to abandon israel this is jomal boman the congressmen from new york and the the idea here is that if jobidon does not abandon israels can accost im the election now that is not what the poling da to suggest jobidon has had very bad poling dett for months at this point years actually some of the worst poling data that we can see but thre's an attempt to hang this on what is going on the millies now is poll numbers have gone down cennists slightly since the beginning of this war the reason being whenever there is a war people do not war people get mad at war people do not conflagrations and they blame the present in power when that sort of thing happens to be connected with their policy but the idea that it is because thei'r people who are upset with israel that they are now moving away from jobidan what toward donald trump the most proisral present american history tht's a bizar read of the data but tat's exactly what the conn what a pressed matrix is attempting to achieve here here is jobal boman a moral moron cut this war coston reelection yes in clon andg let me just be very clear is one thing to support israel whis te ouus has always done and we will continue to do it is the nother thing to never a whole israel acamnibole they are behave here whethere it is related to the occupation the open they intrissting at is goso ar the war cros that are taken paceriht now during this siege i man israel is very clear from the beginning we an a com off warter fool eulectricity they use white phosphorus y turns of collective ponisan that is what is happening right now o k that is a lie that is a lie he says they ure there using white phosphorus no there is been no evidenc that they are using wite phosphorus when he suggests that americi is not con c holding israel to account on humn right to israel is being as meticulous as it can by in one world's most densely populated aria that is honey combed underneath with terratunnels is is why israel is for exemple not simply bombing the entire place from the airits white israel is currently opening humanitarian corridors and commots attempting to close them is realy trips are being attacked as they open humanitarian corridors to loud people to leave the north of the gosestrip where the're engage in a battle and move toward the south of the gosestrip that vidio is widely available he can see it here is some of thae tat ya yo can see israel is actually opening full streets that they stop the boming for hours at a time to allow huge convoys of people to lea the areas where they are attacking and move sou many of them ar carring white flags because they want to be seen as civilians and according to mal boman they do not care about that israeliscomiting humor a agat the lie that somehow what is happening here to jobit jobidon's pullnumbers are chiefly beccause jobidon is supporting israel that is something that is being promoted very very high by people tho hate the state of israel really hate it according to political feare's our gowing paramount among democrats of our president jobidons standing one year out of the twenty twenty for election now some us ood predicted that he was a weak candodate given the fact that he is in ock togeneerian who can bearly make sentences out of his face hol given the fact that the econome has been on a rough ride for the last three years given the fact that we have wild conflagrations n not only th middle east but eastern europe and maybe in the south chinasy it turns out people do not chaos and jobidn who promised solidity has guaranteed even more chaosin from t e policy far more cassen from s policy than tonal trump things were way better in twenty nineteen than the are in twenty twenty three in everybody basically feels that ok get that has nothing to do with jobidon being pro israel in this conflict bt again the ratticals in the party our tempting to say that if your coalition is the abomi colition of twenty twelve namely the quoti quo dispossessed in a few white liberal ladies wel thenyou eter get that polishon dus possesse together and theonly way to do that is to dump israel off the side o the boat a goring to politico within the party there are merging concerns o suport for israel an its war against commoss is weakening him among keep parts of his parties base americans attitudes are shifting quickly about the conflict and a lock could change between it now and next november by the way they are not shifting quickly about the conflict the american people are behind israel in te conflict by every available pulling metric a series of your times poles will be sunday s likely to super charge the worries mong some democrats about to political fall out from bidns handling of the conflict those poles showed bidin trailing former president trump and five of the six battle ground states among registered voters forn policyes weak spot for bidon the times poles show registered voters inthe battle ground states trust trump over bidnon managing israel palsing an conflict by margin of eleven per centage points voters hundered thirty years old much the broughter electrict prefer trump to manage the issue by ten points swing state voters under thority are only backing by nd by a single per centine went per the time servey now question in what world is the american people favor ing trump over bide in the idle east in anti israel point of view i'm n a need you to explain that lene to me on on a carts explain to me how if the american people back trump the most proe israel presedent in american history over jobidon who as been canta wishy washing on the issue up until now how is that a how is that are reugh renimon pro israel feeling but again the zalgand up it is all a manu factured crisis inside the bie ad ministration which is presumably while you have members of the tate department hoir now leaking internal membos critil criticizing bidan tanling of the israel commoss war the memmo that was again leaked by low level state department staffers who should all be fired because onesto got if you run an executive branch department and your lowal staffes are leaking things they should be on the on im plament lines to morrow that is the way works the memal has two kee requests that t you us supporta sease fire and tha a balance its private in public messaging tward israel including arrand criticisms of his rally military tactics and treatment of palsinians the us generally prefers to keep private the document says we must publicly priticize israel's violations of international morms such as a failures limit offense of operations to legitimate military targets if first of all that is a lae israel is targening legitimate military targets please name the civilian only aria that israelicenting that is not the way that israel is pursuing this war again if they war israel has complete air superiority i cannot repeated enough if israel wish to turn the entire place to glass they certainly have the military fire pow r to do they have not done wy because they do not wish to do and then of course they say when israel support settler violins and legal land seisures or im play successive use of portsagainst palstinians we must communicate this publicly that that this goes against our american values to israel does not act with impunity again these sorts of to send mymos are being issued to try and craft and narrative which is that biding is losing support intornally meanwhile the the white house is apparently doing nothing about actual procomas necs impeding the flow of military weaponry last night procoms protestors broke into the port of to coma in an attempt to stop the shipment of military weaponry here is some of the tape wer helor the pns where the federal authorities and these ar protestors blocke te port to homon on neds protest what they said was a militaryship bown for israel during the twelve hour protest some people marched in circle some wav palstinian flag some held up signs that is had no ag fort israel seasfire now and resist until return which of course the call for the destruction of the state of israel protestors believe the ship is transporting military equipment and weapons to israel if that is in fact the case than tese are people are obstructing the function of the federal governments which means theyre engaging in crominal activity are any of them goning prosecuted by the by dministration i'm still waiting speaking of which is any one yn we prosecuted for defacing the wite housegates to the day after that gian protest over the weaken the white house gates were stained with bloody red hand prints this is called passionate protest by the journalists good news they left their finger prints directly on the wall soa you could rust all of those people if these are right wingers whod done this all than would be inthail presumably without councel becaue that is the way this works if however you are a procomas terrist supporter and you put yourum and you put your hand prints ore bloody red paint hand prints on actual federal property then everything is totallyifinme again again as long as you identify with the right people you can do whatever the hell that you want meanwhile this is having some impact on how the bide administration is approaching the israel comas issue jo bidin i s now raising the possibility of a tactical paus in gozofighting with benjamin intonaho now israel is engaging in taxical pauses anybody wh's been watching this conflict closely grania lotly the way that i have you understand there certain hours of the day where there are nobomings and israel has multipl tons galot announced were not bobbinging ten in two now is the time freed move sout israel does this alot nitting ow who himself sad in an interview they be seensquo as far as taxical little pauses an our here an hour there we have have them before i suppose we will check the circumstances in order to enable good to manitarian goods to come in ore our hostages individual hostages to leave i but if if the bid administration s putting pressure on israel to basically leave comas in power with sease figtes then that is going to be a ridiculous failure on the part of the bide administration and that of course is the entire goal of the media at this point en john curby was pushing this yesterday here is the the spokes person for the national securit ministration suggesting at that it is now who should consider quon inquote tactical pauses ironuan understand what that means with the presien en e ea a who we were told that there was a good deal of discusson about a petenta for tactical pauses in the fighting again i for hat a ten belief in all of that up thet did that come ofp but what is a nex py a be dea yo wat can you tell this certainly did come up it was absolutely want tha top things that the president waret to tacka primesnen ya who about this is something we believe needs to be explored nees to be considered and whene ot just talking about one paus we believe that there is probably value in multipol tactical pauses a discreet time discreet geography for discreet purposes an we still want we still want a pursue that and we believe that this is a conversation that we have hadn' recent days weth these railies and we continued o we know werein to continue to have those conversations going forward were the beginning of this conversation we do not think we are at the end geon youven kno what you think the an looks then by line is this whatever the united states has to say about tactical pauses israel is not going to leave comnosin place they are just not going to it is not a possibility there is complete unification with in israel and military power to get ridcomoss is what they are going to do and what isgon to come after is probably is rayly military control of the gossistrip even if some other power is put in municipal control of the area israel is going to have the ability to put it is military assets on the ground in order to ferr it out future terrism israel mever for the rest ofits history under go what just happened again any government that would allow that to happen we'l not last very long in the state of israel if all this postering is designed for the arab states or for domestic raticals inside their own coalition is onder at a certain point is ben a lot of talk on both sides of the isle of the corst last few years about throwing the raticals out of your coalition the democrats are still coddling the radicals including reresiet to leav at certain point i might behoove you to get rid ovirshue of to

parties aure hading into neck and nect race is next year to con troll all three lovers o elected power in washington the house senate and the presidency that is an alf in the case until nineteen inety five domcrats held the house majority for forty years with an average marcin more than eighty seats then when the sen iment tority and nineteen fifty for n retained it until nineteen eighty this year demo crats told on to the senate and the republican majority the house are both at rist while poles point to ae close race for the white house me right now it is the closest we have been in terms of sort of elect toral balance in years and years and years and years which means that the future of te country does rest honor razors edge which is why y if donald trump is the nominy and if donal trump continues to be at the senter of headlines a thatter entirely about him and not about yobidon its going to be a serious prom republicans i know republicans wright now are looking at thse polling numbers theire saint jobidon is supervulnerable and that is true he is unbelievably vulnerable right now there look at these polling numbers the tho trump up in the swing states their saying trump could beat him and that is also tru trump could beat him that also relies an y new cycle were donald trumpys absent from the new cycle the great weird toxic charm of donal trump is that the very thing that makes his base love him is the thing that makes independente hate him the more he is seen the less he is liked if ye ran tobidon's campagn from twenty twenty hudy president again on fortunately all the hadline yesterday we are all about him in court again according to the same poles thate are trung trump up in the swing states if he is convicted in any of the cases that are currently up in court in there four of them if he is convicted in any of those casest his poll numbers are going to drop wright now according to the nur time's pole again i'm onlye setdin that polks that the exacts in one trowing trump very very durable against bydon in all the swingstates the poles found that for the most part trum is politically surviving the criminal charges against in before voting in the geo p primary he leads mister bidon by between four and ten prer sentics points and five of the six battle ground states surveyed and in a sixth state witsconsin bidon is only up a liital bit the core of trum trengt romaines has preceive skill at managing the economy however if the former presedent is convicted and sentence around six per cents of voters across arizona georgi a michigan ovata pennsylvanian wisconsin say they would switch their votes to biden that would be enough potentially to decide the election it would presumably suppress some proe republican votes if you look at the pulling is to hell bidon would far against all the republican candidates at this point generic republican genric publican a personwin thonameust a generic republican is up fifteen points on biding anevata sixteen in georgia eighteen in arizona fourteen in michigan pennsylvania plus fourteen wisconsin plus fifteen an other words the more media coverage any republican candidate receives the less lell they do against biden which is why trump right now is up pretty solidly on biding in evata georgia arizon a micigan pennsylvania te santis is only up slightly but h's up slightly in all of those sdates and hailey who again is the most generic republican of the generic republicans is up six inevata three in georgia seven and arizona ten and michigan ten an pennsylvania thorteen an wisconsin if this electability argument is going to be made it' going to come down to on trump's behalf i'm going to be discipline which again is a very diff case for trum to make and that was made purely positive yesterday when he is testifying himself in this case is bizar and ridiculous case it is it is ta stupid case being brought bilaticia james againstonnal trump incivil qart for fraud now again it is not a criminal case which means that all she hask to show is preponderance of the evidence chising have to show damages that is wit is crazy about this case shousn' nave to show that the doln trump by inflating his real estate assets stole money from anyone or hurt anyone just test to show the g in flated the value is real estate assets and that people relied upon that in their decicion making even if they made money well that is a ridiculous case it also happens to be the case that again if the scam is put trump at the centere of the attention cyclun and then jus folk is every camer on him if that is the democratic strategy it is working and y can work just because that is he democrat strategy does not mean that will not work hure is trump yesterday going off on the cort i heragain what hes saying here is not wrong the problem is that if americans are focusing on trumps legal foibles they are not focassing im thes seve the trump is saying they should focas on a trum is saing focus i'm jobie being a bad president and then of course he is in court and that is a big story of course it he is the formal president of the united states and he is facing down four criminal trials in a civil trial bike that is that is that is not grat for the up coming year i can sympathize with trump i can don' nahe to trumps legal defence fund in cases this and i can still think that maybe it is a dangerous move politically for re publicans to nominate the guy who is likely to spend the next year in court talking about he is legal troubles allowing the media to swibble theire attention from jobidans consistent record of failure over too donald trump and his legal issues trump yesterday began his testimony an court by delivering a series of broadsides against put the court and the prosecution he is seit of the judge i'm sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me that is true he told the judge hen noue nothing about me and then he referred to a titu james is quot this political hack back there again all o this is all o this is corract also a donald trump could not stop himself frm mashly giving credence toothy charges against him for example one point he claim that he personally intervened to talk about the asset value of some of his assets which is something he is been trying to shyaway from his trying to say the basically his lawyers thid it was not him he is not responsible cas one of the things that the judge in this case angaron who is a motivated left winger that angron is trying to do is removed trum frum control of his own crumpanys t and find him to on or fifty million dollars jo the lot of money even if you are donald trump trump again putting him on the stand is a dangerous move obviously it resulted in the the judge basidlly threatening to toss trump off the stand according to politico testimony by donald trump in a civil fraud trob onday quickly to senden into bitter sniping as trumps discursive answers an owprs prompted the judge t repeatedly admonish him he spent four hours on the witness stand he lost his temper and attack the judge railing against the person woi'll decide the fate of his business umpire and suggesting that one of his pretrial rulings was very stupid he says the terrible thing you have done nothingabout me trump's primary defence which he has offer publically since the start of the trial is that financial statements contain very very powerful disclaimers and there fore were not intended for use by bangs or insurers but dum and then in the iddle of his testimony he suggested that actually the manks may have relide on it now again the case is completely bunk it is garbage it should not be brought in the first place and it is letitia jame's being malicious as all hell in bringing this thing also when you'r inthmittale legal case no matterof the grounds upon whichat is brought just as a wawyer gofd be extremely careful and how yoe handle those charges politically trump can be totdally in the right and legally he can still put himself in dire jeopardy this is ging to be a continuing problem for trump and this is goin to be a continuing and again i wish it were not but it is and that is that is just a reality again the focus right now if you are if you are re publican should be i'm the failures of jobidin but if john trumps can be prom here is trums lawyer alean a hab a losing it on the judge yesterday again she is not wrong i men from the judge whoi already cree o cherman hat mi yin committi ride before we eatven wa in si i qartre a nit ere ti here whet he hat ti at then why tat y a might bein pate in a curney and why tat me our tat ter at dollars being hou in i quartre be anttery dir tere be ca mi jam wan a dan right yer ye di i worning and call my min

should not either gay again she is not wrong also is his can be the top the hadlines orge o biden failures that is always the question that is always the question an just one secon we will gets o even democrats now starting to realize thet maybe jobidin shouln't be their candidate first this veteran's day it is all about giving back to those who 've served in our nations armed forces that is where black rifle coffee company comes in i's a veteran found in company black rifle's mission has always been to supporting in power fellow's service men an women thanks to all of yo who grab the caunt of

travelling a lot got back really late last night up early this moring black rifle coffee as making at happen for me to do the sam for you goor black rifle coffee dot com black rifle coffee is america's coffee that is black rifle coffee dot com again when i tok lat yobinsvo nerability other people on the left oure noticing his vulnerability ther're trying to cholk it up on the rati le left to suporfrisr but he is just a vulnable candidy he is a bad candidate he is been in the low forties or high thirties in terms of his approval rating for months at this point mean that just is what it is the presidential job approval rating according to real clar politics right now he is under water by about fifteen points and that is not a major increase from where he was as as late as july of twenty twenty two at that poin who is eighteen points under water he is been consistently under waterin from sis aprualrating since literally august of twenty twenty one it is now november of twenty twenty three would that bhe speaks is the fact that the president of the united states very we candidate david axel rod who is of course he chief political adviser to brokobama is lall maybe they should not run him maybe in my concernts ii ma clear i think ins bein a great pasn i think he is then thinks that av generational we will have generational in act an importance i think he is been honorable in the office a iave iave not be od things to say but as i've set for by a coply us now the ishis nat a for him is is not a political its actuarium and you can see that in this po in tit just alot of concern about the age issu and and that is something that i think he means to a ponder just tho a check and say is this the right thing a to do a that would be on a good question there from david axel rod what tolarious those that the democrats for believers are well that jus means we have to work cartner hure as the ladies of the view sangs democrats welfe you do not the approval wratings the work harter frobiden in man heres the big bron of course if they gov reed bidnance can rip open a cantleworms likehing never seen if bidan steps down it' can be a battle to the dath between pete budijage comela harris and gavanew sum and that is an ugly battle for the democratic party heu basically have a prap school white ged gavanew sum against peet buddhijadge whose sol claim to famous that he is a gay mayor against comela harrison whose sole claim if him s that she is the worst vice president in american history and tht includes spiro agnew had resigne from the job i yet using the bidin's bad witntil he getst the guise were ripe alone and wat here is the view basic leke well know what what if we just what if we what if we just takin a whistle or way past the raveard here it going to be a choice between jo bidan and bottel tromp in a a aa axerod at a thit o the last time noactually that ship a failed i the dead line to get on the on the ballat pornabada wat to wek

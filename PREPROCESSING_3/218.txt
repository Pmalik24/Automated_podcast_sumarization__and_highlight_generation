hopes and goals we have stories of deception and star crossd haters bbbe easy chicago thi sis merican live i mor glass der with us at one green wevel that titles can make more senses this story goes on to trust me on that in nineteen ity six a man a woman ran into a yeuass embassy in vienna said they needed asylum though from south carea they told empsy officials this incredible story of kidnapping and intrigue and being torn apart and thrown back together and years of dreaming about escape from the kidnapper well at the same time convincing ther kidnapper that what they really want to do was stay with him nancy apdyke has the story the woman who was kidnap was a famous south care an actress named chawan he i read a book about it by writer and film produced her name paul fisher he spent years were searching this story she was comparet at the time to elizabeth tailor elizabeth tailor imagined it elizabeth tailor passed her prime but still famous from all her ikinros had just disappeared ort i scha was that beautiful that much of an ikon to south carea and she was gone she found out pretty quickly who had arranged this whend che was kidnapped an it in seven et she was put on a boat and a boat went to nampo harbor and north carea and she actually has a photo which is in the book of her very first meething with kimjongel he was there waiting for her off the boat wite a photographer and the had apstographer take a photo and and tun sendeth to her as till one a remember this exactly remember that time and he isben tinme had yeur kidnapdon brought to me and s te terrible picture and heis beaming and smily and she as got her face coverds for years her family and her country did not know where she was this happened in nineteen seventy eight cha was in her fifties and her first sickening guess as to why she had been taken was at kim jonyell had brought her to north carea to be a mistress for his father the great leader kimill sung who was ruling the country at the time but no it seemed that kimjonell himself was just a very big fan of chaise movies he put her up in a fancy villa surrounded by walls and bard wire and arm guards she called it in her memoir less vagus meets vlatabostac kim jonl brought her out to display at parties that was chas life for five years un till one particular night and one special party che had been there for a while and she was standing in a somewhere in a senter of the room and she was used to these parties by this point exactly they we routine a shed started feeling repulsed by then but people got drunk and groped women and thand they went on forever and somebody had already told her that you notice is goig to be such a great evening for you and she nodded along because she was used to sort of my purbily about everything che had no idea that kim jonill that night was planning to show off for the first time another person he had acquired the man who had directed or produced almost all of chaise movies her ex husband chinsang ofk chin and cha ech did not know that the other was also in the country schin had been brought there the same way chay was but he tried to escape twice he was thrown in a prison camp for a couple of years the best way to thescrime chin steven speelbergs a sort of good comparison a sense as while he made films that were very good very commercial very popular and elso produced o the people's films had his own studio and he was the most powerful popular tell myger and south carea arguably in all of souty stasia from most of t o sixtiesen into the seventees and schin tendays prire that as hesillin prison camp carrlis for it ten days and avilla tey fatten them up treacherous storm to house he arrives at the part to you when it is already ou naw in full flow and he walks inside and as soon as he enters there is applause an whet an nsame thing an as thaysago you are in a prison campyou walk and a your the life of the party hev rens applodding exactin in the pictures ou nw his face to look a mesiated you can tell he is gon hroug something terrible to seet doesn fit now cha does not see shin come in she just hears people start applauding and chay is sort of even on faced by this yanytime cam does anything people get up an applaud to she do not know why people are pploting shagli cannot till somebody ouna says why do not you look happy lookes here and she turns around and it speen five years chins got the marks of having beend torturein a prisen camp she does not recognize him right away and and from that point on cam jung ill yo now was pulling them together an and e sot of shell shocked hugged one another and and whit thand moved around blocking in an a movisin mak cim jungill and what night stand here sit here and here you stand next to me smile to cameras they were sort om te the guests of honor famous people do not get depict their fans kim johng ill was tha superfan who was also unfortunately the son of the all powerful leader of a tetalitarian state shin and chay had made their best movies together kim loved their movies and he wanted them to be a couple just they were in their hay day he arranged it parent trap style he told them at the party thet guess what he had a newly remoneled villa for them that they would be living in from now on together making a joke i think he said something a the newly way igan wont to be alone now an why we'rd and had them takin to a car and by all accounts seemed extremely pleased and expected them to be equally and and it is it is the the moment riht after that when tiy went back to the villa close about them door turn the falseits on to toke an order to li diat privately they turnd the fosses on to they can whisper and extay of a private con exact and they just asked one another what had happened wan ad the way she described to dis or the lovely moment t whic she asks him you kow wat happened to you and he said a lot i'll tell you some other time and and he ask how at happened to you and she says a lot i'll tell you some other time and youn a shin caunt hov gingerley can asked her you looked very smily and happy and i just have you been brainwashed and and she made a joke about how the direct ter can you recognize acting any more any sort of both of them were finally able to be canuine with some one and and they spent the next several hours going through everything chin and chay made a long turn plan in a short turn plan long turm they were going to escape but they would wait till they could do it right they would not be caught their short turn plan yinvolved a small taperquarter which they were able to get because one of the weird privileges of their captivity was that they were allowed to shop at a department store that sold things that were out of reach for most people on the country taperquarters kim johngill had long and short turn plans of his own for them he told them that soon he would summon them to talk about his vision for their future then seven months went by and during those months schin and cha spent hours nearly every week and kims huge film arcive he wanted chin and chay to see it and be impressed and they were kim did not just love their movies he loved all movies it was against the law for ordinary north careans to watch fareign films but kim had set up a mass if boot legging operation running in countries all over the world he could build up his private collection with every movie ever made or as close as he could get the arcive was three stories high and heavily guarded at least two screening rooms all for kim only and now for chin and chay chim was bowled over by every detail the to way the bhuilding itself was set up to run and and you knowit admiration over how kim had set up his own arkivan and how well everything was kapt geeking out over the air conditioning set things and how he was preserving the seteloide and how everything was cathalogue than the staff and n how large it was how as it categorized was it by year or by jonra or by director and went by country first and then i think hit went by year as they got the man and and there is that lovely tauch where tha south grean films in a kind of normal air conditioning room and and the north grean films an amus lavish storge an screening roima nl bill din the films were dubbed into carein after being pains taking i transcribe sometimes by americans hre was an american defector he was one of several actually who would been there since nineteen sixty five and one of his jobs was transcribing american films but just bay listening ecause he was not allowed to watch them yet and he would not know that they were films becuse they gave him any other american effactors the gaudio for some reason they cholped up the filmshantracts into different bits in the long orders ta they would not no i get they en doing exactly enjoy them but he had this experience of of in a transcrabing im an sunly realizing wat this is my popins chinan cha spent dozens and dozens of hours watching one movi after another in the screening rooms that the film arcive and in their villa which was also outfitted to show movies they did that for months until finally they got word kim is ready to meet with you they went and they brought the capercorter and the second they walked in and chay had the tapequarter and her a perse an try flicted on and i think unexpectedly kimdrungell jus talked at them mostly for two hours n a kim ringal spoke very very fast and his mind soult have went all over the place and he had a very intimodate thing way their slash body guard who kept walking and te to refill drank and empty ash trace chin and chay wanted to record kim for two reasons first they knew they might not be able to escape maybe they would be killed and their children and friends would just never know what hid happened to them or according if they could smuggle it out would at least be proof of where they would been the second reason to record him was that they knew that kim would insist they say publicly that they had come to north caree on their own voluntarily chin and chay were hoping that in their private conversation kim might admit to having had them kidnapped and brought to him and he almost almost did by making a joke in the first couple of minutes of their conversation kim talked about how he brought chay over first in order to entice chin to north caree i sayd joke because kim laughs as he says it and then all three of them lack it is tyrant management one o one he laughed you laughe the rest of what kim said in that conversation well he said a lot of things but the main thing was north caree an movies are bad and i am sick of it they would making g the same film over and over again and that they were too long and to boring and history lessons and and to molhe dramatic and thand says there is too much crying at in tell anybody but in much crying kimjhnyel told chin and cha that he knew he was the only person in the country who could get away with saying what he was saying and he told them not to repeat anyof it he said when it comes to movies we are in kindergarten and other countries south carea are in college he said if we do not catch up in the next ten years our movies are goin to be the worst of the worst movies in the world the problem he said just between us is the people in north carea had it too easy they had things handed to them he have to hostle shin and chaded there is a point an t thiy wet he tells them that i no an i think ine says i parfis ther bay says he nat theres no ind sentive and socialism to bunyubat ay hi ays might might screenwriters i at they will wright something theyll get their assion o heother gis make a film not at their assioni they ha paid no matter what they that agis turn out that the work exactly an fallow orders im any sheem very conscious that in i needs some one he he pushes himself more than that who is use to having to do more than that the earnest keep kim john yel never mentioned another possible reason why north creer's movies were wooden and unambitious fear he kim john yill had written the book the only book in north caree about the right way to make movies and think about movies it is called on the art of the sinama its still in print everyone involved in north cree's film industry in the nineteen eighties had to have been aware of the potential consequences of doing something as unpatriotic or insulting as trying to realize their own independent artistic vision without kim's explicit blessing and his fathers it was better to be crappy than sorry the conversation continued chin and cha murmured that north carea's citizens were fortunate to have a comrade leader who understood film well kim johnyel agreed with his permission he three of them got into crotiking specific films a north cre in one called the starvoe carea and while they were at it a sovi at film called mother that had a dying scene they all agreed had been atrocious they were three movi lovers talking about what they loved and kim john yel's big plan for chinn and cha was that he wanted them to make north carene movies good that they could compete with films coming out of the west and when awards and be shown in theatrs all over the world he wanted cha to act to me movies and chin to direct them chin could have his own film company just he used to have chin wanted to call the company shin film a very bold request in the circumstances he han nothing in northwea had been called anything other thand e not the work is paradise thay at a parte this it a supremely a this orno kimalson university am was a big geel but is also no very telling of shin that even in this seveal situation his first instinct is a kicaoca it can w give the company my name in inn in film noir some one is always using somewhat and often people are using each other and we do not find out til the end who gets away with what chin and cha knew that their only chance of escape would be to convince kim john ale to let them film and work in the west cim gen ill knew that if he wanted good movies he had to give shin an cha enough freedom to create them all three of them wanted to make great movies but same bed different dreams cam dangal on of the films for his own purposes and aneed of the films to get away from him and its almost his ambition of making film with the world of respect completely overtook any sense of logic the first filmsion and chay am shaw had sequences that they shot and east in europe standing in for the hague and iu now the showed cim dung il te film am he said this is fantastic it is a european film it is the best thing weever mades allad him start showing it and i never cross his mind that they had done exactly what hed forbidden his own film makers to do for ever for reason they been forbidden to show the world outside north carea they showed people things that they had not been able to see iu n almost in a lifetime for some people in north carea aboyut ineteen eighty three nine inty for and a seconds that film siry playing in sinimas in north carea ou know the north green audiences did not take in necessarily the hirproduction valeys am all they could talk about was that first ten fifteen minutes shot on the streets of prage where ou knw cey wait the buildings look amazing people walking into business as theye dresse differently withas cars wet that is what we had an impact becaue up until then they had been told you are the luckiest people in the world ou know the workers paradise is the only place in the world with people have peace and freedom am and and suly they saw that that was not true how do that thus wor people thought i was lucky enough to an meets and speak to people who would escape from north caree who were iun a varingateis at the time hat they were able thee washkees films am and has another at german recertur and in japana col the hanas cranher whos ton quite the lov of talk to the fact as about the same thing and ats one of the things that is fascinating is that shin and chase films had a huge impact straight away ou the oiiven people a narilates thirties who would never seen anything of the outside world they had not been filters but thet was not just the people sundly were able to see footage of the outside world that iu na chin and cha made am a filmcom love love my love which was literally the first love story and north care an culture post ninkin forty five there was nothe about love of the leader ar love of the party was litery the firs some people able to go toth senima and see something thowse about two people falling in love and it was the first time in oteen agers had pictures on their wall of of a mathneid of anybody other than the leaders shin directed seven films for kimjanyel and then in march nineteen eighty six he and cha went to a hotel in vienna for some film business manage to grab a separate taxi from their north creen minders sped to the ua embassy and ran in they were dbriefed by the s a a and later by south caree and antelligence and they were interviewed by the washton post and other media outlets and stories about north carea are always hard to fact check for parts of shin and chase story theyre recollections theire interpretations are all there is but the movies exist ther corting of kim exists cim genial had told shin and cha in the recorting that when people asked them why they were in north caree they should say freedom for true artistic freedom for chin there were some bitter truth to that because south caree at the time shin an cha were kidnaped had been a military dictatorship with very heavy handed censors shin studio had been shut down by d the south careene government in nineteen seventy five his career was in ruins in north carea shin got to make films again he wrote unimbashedly in his autobiography how much he had loved making movies there shin always spoke of north carea as the place where he can of a that the place he associated film freedom with and creativ freedom worth because he can ask for anything and gata he asked and one upsid he he pe asked for and a model train to blow up for a scene and he was given a real train packed with explosives on rails to blow up if he wanted to and if he asked for a win machine he sant halacopters and if he ant ed fakes know i had betters flown to a mountain you knowis no expense tare you not cim dring ell felts the larger than life film producer they hereabout and he did not have the downsides that iffom producer usually has because if om producru yes tesay no every nowd and we don'l hae enough money wu nll hav enough time shin in cha had remarried in orh carea it kimjenials suggestion and it endit of being a real marriage they were together till shin died in two dosand six these seem to ave been each other's big love in life besides movies although shin love movies more than scha ded maybe a lotmore and ther shared memoir of their time and in north career it goes from his voice to her voice back and forth and count of the second they star making films her voice kind of disappears entirely and it is all his from then on and ye know it is about escaping but in equal measure ats about making the films almost o thif it e's writhing a memoir of his time and holly rod or something chas eighty eight years old living in south carea when paul was were searching his book he interviewed her for it and he asked her about shin and the movies they made in north carea and and you kno wat i mahern spoke thore you could sense the impatience that she had had been able to get out of there three years earlier and no mate any of the films she had been very happ to do and him not som mo send him not much even great love cannot protect to you from the other person wanting what they want ancy hat nik is one of producers of our shell pol fisher's book about all this is called a kinchong ill

mame to go trat yaus extrackt on a cat well i sa yo she had been there os i is tat yo and nobody knew anything about her or they cet i mean and i just ok itjust left and then i photograph th osa jessaman goes home to new mexigo but she just cannot let this go she still dealing with the fall out fighting with herts ind a few other places over bills and she decides to do a bunch of things that most of us would not do first jssman sends a letter to arrans a drass saying basically i know it you did and here is what it is done to me she includes an invois for twelve hundred dollars the total cost of her round trip flight to california combined with an hourly wate for her time and then months later jessaman finds herself back in san francisco for work and she picks up arran's trail again she has a list of old address's arranabof debt may be twenty of them she got from a private investigator and she starts going from place to place visiting aran's old apartments a one point jessaman pulls up to this gorgeous building overlooking the babridge at the time jestman was seven months prognent and she thinks well maybe i can use this to my advantage i went to the front desk thi se cured officer nd was hey om as you can see him pragnant i really have to go the bath room i'm looking for my cousin are in heart but om i need he us a restfram first you mind and she was arrand heart ah yah i know hor she used to live here the woman actually knew her boy friend at the time sh to guie now i do not know for sure and it is just bye kno gossip bat am i had heard that a she had had several thousand dollars of his possessions arewhatever that she took off way that never came back and i was oh wow o key she is now in she sick well you aran or whatever an else oh yad hotilly aran's old boyfriend did not live there any more sugjestaman took a few pictures inside the building and then moved on to the other addresses all of them were deadends ng meani there any part of you that kind of feeling a creep i knew it was crate i knew thaug it was not healthy i did know that but i could not let it go as just something th at some one did to me that i had no control over jestman hates feeling she is lost control and whenever it happens ever since she was a tea nager she is dealt with the same sort of way when she was around eleven her dad abandon the family her malm and her three yonger simblings then they lost their house and for a while they all lived in a van with her cat and dog her dad he did some pretty extrame things my da tried have me kinnamp but he tried to kid natphew or sent some one he tried to have some one comin i cim not at my school and then again later in apar and d my family we ended up going for o some time up to canada that he could not find us later jessamman's malm got really sick and suddenly she found herself taking care of her entire family at some point as a way to deal with al the chaose she started taking pictures things an ambulence driving her mamaway screeing matches between her sisters trash strewn all over their trailer home she methodically document when she was going through and it gave her a sense of control she continued to use her camera that way is in a dull at one point eight years ago se had a brief scare that reminded her of her dad a random incident r she wondered if he was following her again from that night on i had not i my had i wanted to find him but i did not want to find him and talk to him what is something that you wanted just i wanted to see him i wanted to first just find him i just want to knowif i could find him i did i did bunch of searching and back on chacksin gouglestuff and he was about thre and half hours north of where i lived jesman was living in oakland at the time and her dad was just north of her living in a condo on the mendicine o coast she started making covert trips up there and she never knew how explain this to her friends she kept at simple and told them oh i'm going to spend the weken with my dad which technically was true just that she did a wearing a blondwig and from a istance why do tellphotolanders really far away i was out in the woods i could get a mile or if i needed to om what did you see he was on the deck he was out for walk he would go to the jim taking out the trash he never saw you no no when you are stocking her dad of your following your dad sobserving him observing him what did that feel felt really good to see him and him not now i was there because whyam because i had some knowledge about who he was and what he was doing it was a one way mirror om i could see in and he could not see me and it felt i had some kind of power oi do not know much about the identity that business but i'm guessing that the ideal tarken does not owna camera that can photograph you from a mile away two years after jussman got that phone call from the police she was still trying to track arrand down and in february two thousand thirteen her private investigator let her know that he found errand she was back in jail and about to be released jestmen went with him to a jail and down town san francisco she bought a telephoto lens an the vidio camera the two of them sat around in is ass you be for hours waiting her peet i had a contact told them arron might come out the back ofully one by one people were coming out and the entire time i'm just photographing i ist lens pointed at the door and terrified that she is not an come out sheas not to come out we are not con finder and we see her eaarranhart walked right past her car she ed a couple bagsaging off her shoulder and she was dressed jussimen thought but she was going to a night club tight lucks her shiny pants and wedge boots immediately i thought onlye gosh we we do kind of look similar she was a similar buill to me which jis sort of tall ish fie sevenfivy but no fuller figurd wider hips and i could see that she had a roundish face i do and she has this bright orange hair and i just thought of my days and my teenag ears dying my hair that exact orange thi superbright orange and i just felt this uncanny connection to her i really did and then from there on for the next several hours wich just a dran oo o o tan two other pi's working with them and a separa car they all trail thereand whose first stop was a convenienc sore or she went in tomy cigarettes an the ligter she hung outside for a few minute smoking then gon a public bus arran got off right in front of a good willstore walked in right away pe says jump out and going there go after and iwas oh shi talk to er iu a i thin thinkin oh ok he is a noter o do not talk to her just just go in get your photographs get a good look at her just go gococotand igjumping out freeking out oll my gody just leaving me here with her what ike and then i see omne angeral in there the other pas yea im ope i'm looking at them for kind of cuse and they are not remotely giving me any kind of cuse and then i just go for it and i go up to her and i do not say anything to her i just stand across right across the rack of clothes and the good will from her as she is going through pulling clothes all looken changing her mind very expressive oh now i would never wear that ike a kind of cure in my mind what she might be thinking from her expression nd i'm at an angle where i feel she cannot really tell what i'm doing made i'm just checking my e nail or something i'm just looking at my phone and i take some photoes of her but how nervous are you ming you are literally now you are face to face i'm shaking i'm very nervous definitely and i think there is a part of me that is still thinking i could just talk to her rahte now errand he errent i could just say that ie i could hure myself sang ar in heart im i know you pow we do not recognizeing i knowing do not know me im but i am laur al justlmen level a and you use my idea to do a number of things but i just the power for me was in seeing her without her knowing that i was seeing her then she disappears into the into the dressing room and nats when th other pane comes ver to me and says she steelin clotes it was 'n wha to i just needed to get out of there i was overwhelmed i was feeling really om is feelhe really sad for her and i did not want to feel sad for her o i wanted to feel angry at her it was hard to maintained the anger because she was looking at erand and remembering things she would done when she was young and her family was broke i had shop lifted nice cheese or i a literally stole the rogola things that i thought and associated with class middle tan upper middle class and i think that is what really was giving me this sympathy for aran heart was i could identify in a way with the desire to be some one else i could see how a path in my life could e led to my bet in that moment i i really could but it was i guesse a little disappointing i could guess it was a little oh i kind of wanted it to be she was a criminall and did something bad to me and it just was not that non of that satisfaction op i got er it was just sorn of this weird its transition and anger was starting to be sort of replaced with ampathy what jessaman did nax does not sownd empathetic at all when he first hereabout it but for justan then it was the logical end of her search she wenthrough the hundreds of images she taken and she put together a gallery exhibit i had survellant shots of erand the court summons plece reports bills and pictures of places where her idea had been used she done this once before with the surveillance potive she took of her dad in fact her whilelett was stolen while she was setting up that exhibit which is what sent her down the rabbit hole of trying to find erand in the first place she called the new show dear eran heart and one of the idems on display was a sealed letter and a pluxy glass box she asked the people at the gallery to give it to eran if she ever showed up there it was not a dramatic letter just a way of telling erand that she would been looking for want to talk jessaman did not see putting erand's name an photos out in public as revenge but not every one sought that way you are vectim a vidanity that wit you consider traing down the tafe and turning the table this is from the to day show in an nact some have described is foted levell followed and photograph the woman whos tolda wallet and then her identit i reached out to aran heart through her probation officer to talk about all this i sent a couple emels listeing everything justmen says about her but arond nevery got back to me i could not verify whether she was responsible for bill's justmen got from herts and wholefoods er any of the unpaid parking tickets and tolds or whether she shop lat tid from goodwill or stole from her boy front eran secretly posed is justamen and jessamen secretly photographed eran jessaman admits it is an uncomfortable thing that they have in common each of them is willing to invade

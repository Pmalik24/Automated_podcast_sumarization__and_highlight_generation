with u atuin voter reformed mississippi is one of a small number of stats with something a robbery conviction can costure your right to vote even after you get out of prison even after you com plet your pearl pay au your fines all that you still cannot vote missippi is unusual in that regard mostates do not permanently take away a person's right to vote non if they do it is usually just for crimes rape or murder but in mississippi there is one wake one long winding path that people can take that i'll let them bote again this a path that most states do not offer johnnycoffman explains when i first learned about this i was a little baffled to get your voting rihts back you have to get your own personal bill passe by the state legislature these bills theyre called suffrage bills are just one page with your name your conviction and a line about being a quote honorable citizen connin your own personal law giving you permission to vote the bills have to go through committees and pass the house ind senit all that stuff and we will get to that but the thing to know in general about this is it is pretty hard to pass any bill ever about anything this is pretty hard and the people that try they tend to really care about voting this man gerald lard one of the mean reasons he really once to be able to vote again the thing that drives him kind of crazy they consolidated to schools local schoolboard he talked for almost ten minutes about it how they close the high school and they move the high school tobaaspeel renis hayit he bet o facilities and the siglbord members he says o at o hav cruld entrance but no real experience with education only come ome i degree is a psychology but that does not mane out what make a great teacher gerald lives an hour south of jackson mississippi's capital were he helps ren the family business a funeral hme gerald told me he is an intrverd but he also said he is the person at church whowill stand up and tell the decon to get closer to the microphone gerlds the gui who sids in the back and records the service he is pretty open about well pretty much everything including hw he lost his right to volt he robbed a bank i can two thousand to he told me he was grappling with druggadiction relapsed and bocco cane from a gui weit was that gi's idea he wrote a note you say go gidis to the teller and she gave me the money and tell you how duml ma was instead of running out i casually walked out he was not wearing a mask he did not even know what was on a i mas sol me it say give me the money that is what amas silmen they got caught the same day know at first he was charged for the armed robbery ut then the prosecutor looked at the security fage and realized he did not have a weapon and they were li ot o ca you guilty of a lot of things and bein dome is the most crevalent n that is what my lord you told me these days gerald watch his after his mam his uncle he wunts the funeral home he is been out of geald for sixteen years he does not see any reason why he shouldn' be able to vell gerald started on this long strange journeyin to get back his right to vo one day in church a friend told him about the suffrage bills meeting youre he decided to try he filled out of forenoning r an non profit ing jackson passed it on to a state representative who introduced his bill grald had not actually seen it when we met but i had a copy with me it was wild for him to see itt and how spill one seven to one and act to restore the right of suffrage to gerald layrd ofgefferson davis county mississippi be it inected by the legioslature of the state of mississippi sation or the rit of sufferage is hereby filly and completely restore to geral lar gefferson day was county mississippi i was to be clear i still had not hass but just to see what could happened theyre on the page the right is hereby fully and completely rescored this makes me happy this makes me really really happy why jeso mangn fully and completely what o you think about this line at the and i an legislature as informed e assint himself as on law biding an honorable cintizon and te good and lawful manner ary ia except frospeeding i have a problem with speedy freda i'm getting better o o this would be ju amaze ol it has to do is ps an i have a copy ois you can keep that do not can why this yere gerald was one of twenty three people who got bills introduced hoping to get the right to vote back i tried to talk to his many as i could it was a retty determined group the dad and tool factory worker who had been on a union board an older man who was sick in bed used to be a county super viser nd a got who worked it a mental hospital he showed me a newsclipping about how his father was shot and nearly killed trying to register people to vote thereis something forty four thousand people in mississippi who cant voke because of a conviction a dis proportionat per senage sixty per sent are black in h state that thirty eight persent black jerrald is black is na showbe lambright hangs she is the person who took the form jerrald filled out and gave it to a legislator who introduced the bill she helps a lot of people do this when i first learned about the proces ta arto sa that people did not take advantage of it and i tat hay this is a way for us to really get in there and i was excited about it untel i lar it it was a joke a sjoke because a bill can die with no explanation there is nothing on any government websiht telling you how to get your vote back even finding out when the bills are discussed how do you find out when thet when the commttees ar happening ow would just take some of the committee members to see you do not have you heard anything about the suffrage committee oh yom the charman say will probably gong to meet next wednesday but it is never on the calender then that next wars they will come are you guos going to meet to day ye we are going to meet it for today is just stalkin people basically fortunately when ta showbe stock's people they her she is fun a talk to they answer her texts the show be was head of the mississippi a sia you for nearly a decate ni shoall lease an non profit called one voice the office is in an old mesonic building that the civil ritesack to miss medgar avers use to work out of the show be seems busy all the time a friend gave her this mug once this says fuckit i'll do it and this is one of those things she is got lots of other stuff but she makes time for these bills theen doing it for overa deccate pthe lifetime voting ban is enshrined in the mississippi constitution and the history of howit ended up there is pretty well documented and revealing it starts after the civil worm black people could finally vote and there were putting people in officse including the first black you ask senator hirum rods revels but there was back lash in eighteen ninety white leaders senator james george said the state needed to hold a convention to write a new constitution jeorge said the new senses was goin a show there were more black people than whites and mississi and the goal of the convention should be to make sure whites controled the government the president of the convention was a man named solomon calhoun who said quote negro suffrage is an evil and an evil to both races in his opening speech of the convention he said the voting scheme should be arranged to keep white people ind power thit decided on a few things there was a poltax and this really vague test called the understanding claus the said a voter had to be able to interpret part of the constitution one newspaper called it a gigantic fraud then there was the part in the new constitution about crime and voting the constitution says that they are eleven crimes that take your voting rights away in thols are big a me timber lartine arson i stealin wood or something stealing trease talk to to historians who said the list was clearly meant to target black people crimes delegates ot the convention thought black people would be more likely to commit and the novel idea that you could get your rites back if you get a bill thro the legislature with your name on it that was also in the eighteen ninety constitution he storians do not know much about how it ended up and there maybe they were trying to keep the governor from gaining too much power or maybe they wanted a way to help their white friends and family if they happened to commit one of the crimes on the list whatever it was this last chance is still there for any one who wants to try but most people do not evenm know about it gerralds journey began where all epic journeys begin the sub committee of the house du to sharry b committee gerald wanted to be there when they discussed his bill which it turns out is difficult to do because you do not know when the hack their meeting even the legislators do not know sometimes i managed to get the phone number of the lawmaker who chairs the committee but it was not untill the day before that he let me know when it was can o happen gerald was not goin to be able to make it he cannot find any one to cover for him at the funeral home i visited him the ight before we sat in his living room is cant of bemotional for me because this is something that i would really really really to see happen en left up to a bunch of people that do not know me form a chain o pan i do not know what my chancees ar if i were able to be there as say i would at least have a seventy five pesait chance if i could meet them and talk with them are you nervous about how it is gong to go to morrow yes extramely i had a jok but tis about a propriate but yet very you can tell me the jog as nervous as a two dollar ho first sunday it seem gerralds bill stood a chance of passing sometimes the bill fails because the person has an unpaid fine they do not know about or because they only recently finished their sentence those were not problems for jerrald i told him i'd let him know how it went i went to the hearing the next day six state representatives all but one of them white sat around a couple foing tables and a big committee room thot was mostly empty off to the side a red plastic coffee to spenser was stire from cups the legislators had background checks in front of them for every one with the suffrage bill t only three other people were in the room that is all i set a microphone on the table san you ready a weall stort the meeting this is represented tiv know a sandford they went through suffrage bills the first bill passed di the next one there was not

my nan itet at would appreciate any cin het awain if he wou giv my helpi be otat i ca get my boting wi ay the senate committee met a few days later again we only learned about it the night before and last time gerled cingo because of work he had to watch it on you to from the funeral home this committee room was slightly baker fancier than the first one it was the end of the session and only six of the committees fifteen members showed up all of the once who did were wite here senator filli gane sir friends from the house hore here this morning an we have three suffrage bills that ar before us and the an hol les fon down the hall wer cond enough to come down and isit with is they were ginetty considering just three suffrage bills the first bill came out of i was not gerralds the sponser from the house talked about it and the ommittee passed it then another representative came to the microphone she was there to talk about two other bills at tohe morning committee and making a charmin forround to present on behant ons land mar and mis grand neither bill was grralds his did not even come out it was dead e looked into it and this is how it goes a lot ot the time the house will pass the suffrage bill but then fillingane blocksand i put in a request to talk to him garld calld me the day after his bill and i get na how yo yet yor day be ger olr bet what rit a a witll be wi a will yo know i you what it it could be right er what do you mean by that just say i know well i mean it by way e eat i ba illy i you ay it ay at a gerald had no idea why filin gane killed his bill why these other people made it and not him filin gain got bhack to me and was happy to talk i met him it his law office he is a real estate ler when he is not at the capital i just finishe my twenty third year in the legislature i combined how sense in it in next year wbe the end of the six term i mean i've been done it for a little while now i brought a copy of gerald's bill with me his did pass out of the house i'm and than i do not think that senat committee even brought it up for discussion rit i do not recall us bringing that one up in probably because his distant frenchiseind prime was that of robbery which just considered a violent offense robbery is classified as a violent offence in mississippi law it does not mean the crime itself was necessarily violent but filin gan as a general rule does not consider any suffrage bills for violent crimes he sais thats whith the lieutenant governor who put him on the committe told him to no that is why grald's bill ae but ultimately it is up to filin game he can do what he once and he said he does sometimes away information that swayes him one way or another but there is no part of this prossess set aside for people to come talk to him in the committee introduced themselves tell their story i told him that gerald's crime was almost twenty years ago and that he did not have a gun at the bank filingane said yes those of te times of things that could persuade him in the comittee but he said he look at o ther things too fillin gainsider might hurt some one gerald if the police had been called to their home or if they would been convicted of another crime i wondered how fphillin gane felt about enforcing this particular part of mississippi's constitution given how it disproportionally effects black people and given its history the historians that i've talk to about this to try tat learn more about it said that it was tus eighteen ninety constitutional convention that met and that the goal of that convention was to keep black people from voting and that that these criminal disenfranchisement these laws were part of that that plan i do not know if that is the case or not i was not there i've i've not studied the history of the eighteen iny constitution and certainly mississippi has a very achecuerd pass when it comes to i race relations we treated afternomericans very poorly in in a some parts of our history and i'm certainly not et as at hereing defin that ar even trot to i would not want to but if youre asking me is the suffrage right being treated differently base on your race in twenty twenty two as it relates to suffrage bills that we considering the legislature absolutely not i do not know e o the race of the person i'm sure i could probably try to find out bu asking to part wetcorrections to print me as social history and of the prisons age and i in a raiel background and all that if i wanted to i've never done that i do not intend to start but i mean is not obvious to me just bi looking at ha bill what raciel background someones is a part of i asked him about this rule more broadly if some one does their time the'r out of prison off paroll years have passed why sholn't they be allowed to vote what is the reasoning behind that well i think and not certainly what i would think th it we ain but i'm curious about what you think i mea i think at' somepoin personal responsibility has to come into it and you have to realize if i'm going to break the social contract and commit a violent crime or mist of these are valent crims that lead to i'm just from frent trousing an your right to te here there ar price es to pay for that there has not been a grand swell of public support to change this particular aspect of our state constitution and not to say that there will not be in the future but certainly there has not been as of twenty twenty two of course the thing about public support is that the people directly affected by this provision in the eighteen ninety constitution they cannot vote this here just five people got ther right to vo back hich is pretty typical this here it is four women in one man i do not know much about them because thiy can reate them just what is on their suffrage bills two were convicted of forgery two of them vesselment and one burglary most of them finishe their sentence is before gerald did some of them hadn' been able to vote for datcases there is a low suit in the federal courts trying to argue that this whole proscess for gettng the right to go back as arbitrary and therefore on constitutional tas in the you ask constitution but itsin the early stages and any ruling col take years the shon be the woman who helps get a lot of these bills introduced told me she is basically stock trying to get his many of them through the house in senate as she can one by one using the very process she does not thing she exist in the first place jerald told me for sure he was going to try again he still has the copy of his bill that did not pass i e mi bet will ayo berete wi er e pa to ma yerer weer i om poti poi to wharter likely putte e a po e be ben margl why do you put it on your mer but what e i h a e pargry he argry e pay a it made that ot a hopt i ma e be hav way there a few months later we talked again and he told me he been arrested for cocane possession he did not have to tell me about it but he did just volunteered it he said he was driving a friend whan they got pulld over jerld says his friend had the cocane the police reports has both of them did in any case jerld was angry himself for having gotten into that stituation jrug possession is not a crime that is on the list of things that will cost to your right to vote he was not in the eighteen ninety constitution but base on what i learned from senator fill and gain grald's arrest might be enough reson to kill his bill if the point of putting this in the constitution was to make it a long journey for people gerald it is working johnnicoffman is it seem to produceer a campshide nania coming oup i try that speeding down a california highway with one hundred thousand passengers inside that is in a minute chicago o gradio went our programme continues tis americ an life f my reglass to day's programm the longest distance between two points strgeso people have to take the long and sometimes absurd way to arrive somewhere that youd be straight forward to get to we have arrived at act to of i shall at to all communication in the fact we turn to a stray of somebody who starts at home and then ands up at home with ay long time consuming journey in the middle this all thng appens in china i gues you propyhood just how different and fren astically aggressive china's response to covet is bend from the start the shut down entire cities ink it resalt best estimates are the chinas had fewer than twenty thousand people dead from covet firses as a million here and whn o ma crown arrived chiny treated with the same severity is the earlier variance even the ninety per cent of the opulation is now vaccinated elock down all of shanghai in april and lock down an scape means really lock down ever twenty five milion people could not leave their apartments homs grocer stores and food wivery was shut down lots of people can get food or medicine as pretty offul this lested for two months and wis tovn got much of it goince of what it was to live through that s i was excited to talk to yangee about this thing that happened t him and his boy friend during that period yang is a podcash producer in china was in shanghai and one day early in lock down he did his daily required self task as usual tut that morning i saw to lies to lines yes yhei covit ye i think well that is bat and i tell my boy friend johnny and he tes and is possitive to anybody in china who tests positives required to reported to the government wechan johnny an nese case means calling one of their neighbors very kind reciry who is the person in their apartment buiding designated to deal with government on all matters getting elevators installed dealing with a box suer whatever sto the caller and then they figure within a couple hours the governments gon a send somebody to take en to a quarentine center that is parted chinas zero tolerance policy unhealthy people are separated from the rest of the population and then the next very urgent order of business they rud on hom much time for this is figuring out we'r to send their dog walther in uarentine just e poppy a five bonble snowls her they had seen him this vidion line there has been passet arown of a corge being killed supposally cause its owner had covited and have been sent to a quarentine center thereis no way foa dog to go with them and i just i just cry i just i just i do not t houseis just crash becaus i i do not know what is next then is such om predicutable and the dok sing is e very clear sings we have to soff hin several hours is exually harder thanyou might think as the whole city is closed out johnny calls lots of places before he finally finds an animal hospital that can take their snous er then theyhave to find somebody who ise authorce to drive a car in shanghai with all the street shut down a friend knows some professional freight drivers and they help with that and then they have to find soebody who ise allow to walk from their apartment building to the car to hand the dog to the driver it takes ae government official to arrange that finally the dog is livered into the car he and johnny can start packing bing somebodyes gon to come for the many minute to take them to the quarntine center but ses was 't that simpule the trusis no one cam to us at first day or the second or the third some one calls from the shangai see the see to follow up but did not send anybody other officials call or day's pass finally on the eighth day they do the daily salf tass and they learnd they do not have covet any more then that night before dinner they get the funga the full car ye i folme us that it is time to go ouher the quarentine center yes ing to hours we should go to the curb with our laggage for te us and that bas what take us to the quarney center o no do you tell them that is fine we are cured we do not need to come yes is of course i i say i'll ke self tasis nactive to day there is no need for it and they say o you guis

under fown red ifyou have covet green if you do not have covet now there is were red meating tet would be able to go into any building store officers anywhere when lock down ended that is the thing tithougt the cirning center could cure for them and at that point s my salt is we will not a housy social identity ba not a housy body exactly even if your bodyes do not have covet your cuar coat has

they had tony however noway at three the rog is travelled that he is genmy perhaps you remember the cretiqe offered by a ten year old at thebeginning stodays program about the way we spell the name of a certain fish yes ay o ammi wan it would be pronounce selney but its seem why fair point this ta story is about seven doing something about as logical as that spelling taking a ridiculous route to get where they need to go and by that i man at ridiculous rute that is differen from the normal kind of ridiculous rute they usually take jamy well went to california to see it for herself i have not above average attachmen to sammon and obsession that began in college when i took a class with sammangoroo peter moyl he is famous and sammon circles trust me i think i was attracted to their apic migration and the macob nature of their lives they are born wiggle round in a cold stream make their way to the otion then instinctually a ganstall odds return to the place of their birth hurling their bodies of our water falls flesh roting dodging bare clas simultaneously the cang as their pushing towards their exact nec an their exact port strim to lay egs and let the cycle begain again it is their dying to live i mean there is this whole industry of nature dacumanaris sanard on dramatizing the species in their o to sey films which feature the sound of reeging water in the background while a serious narrator to scribes their majesty it is aga sisten tennolle fe toin muf to toing ter dison to pushn i stron be nevon e it is a staple of nature pord but the world as changed the climate has changed there is been increasingly hat temperatures fires drowed pollution at many of the rivers sammon use for their migration have run dry ore've been blocked by dans that is why to day and california many sammon follow a raticly different course they make their way to the oshan not through rivers but inside a fleet of tinker trucks with human drivers of the whell when i first heard about trucking sammon it seem to stoback a cold mechanical process the idea of sammon stuck in traffic just made me feel sad nature had been highjak but i was also kind of curious i really wanted to see thus rude golber tin cans and rubber bans and barmonal hack and person i decided to follow five silver trucks transportng about half a million adolescent sammon on a hundred and twenty mile dribes to the sammonsesco bay a mygration that no longer starts with the sound of babbling water it is gallt a different sound le one teasday afternoon i found myself at the mogalumny river fishatchry standing in front of a gas powered machine that looked it would be more at home on a construction site the hatchry is about an hour north east of madesto in the sentral valley it is rirl and isolated and hot the sun immediately barns even in may mocalumnes sits next to a river that was one snown for thriving sammon and trout runs but was damned an the sixties to offset the lost wild populations the stape built o hatchery and af parking lok close to the old stream bed i should say hatcries are controversial the fish raised in them are nod as prepared to survive in nature and when theire release they breed with native sammon compromising the jeane pool therewre people who think we should not have hatcheries at all but californias had them for decates ot this point a really long time mocolumny is not a massive operation just a few bungalos and twenty concrete trenches packed with adolescent fish when i pull up i meet the guy responsible for getting the sammon to the osions billsmet the hatchry managr greets me then walks me over to the s machine that snow critical toe sammon migration we try to talk over its roar wut an ther e roiabills a big bearda berly guy and is suspenders are not just forsha they hold up genes which are tucked in the water proof boots he ise intrverted seems a little gruff but there is a tenderness in the way he talks about the fish in fact he tells me when these fish wore just born tbabies the size of finger nails riggling in the water he would sometimes sleep at the hatchry over night he wanted to make sure their water was the right temperature that the electricity stayed on he wanted to make sure they were okay it is comforting to know some one who cares is at the heart of this operation bill grew up in the area a fisherman his life revolves around raising these animals for harves but he rareily by salmon in the store says he cannot afford at he only eats what he catches he mounted the moving platform of the crowder and started on on his job the crowder has a metal great that thats below the water itpushes the fish each the size of a hot dog to one end of the raceway then there sucked up into a to that connec at to the top of he trop the two was translucen and i could see all these salmon woushing by lik documons being transported and a noumatic to i wonder how they felt if they felt what did they think of this sudden rush of movemen the dramatic shift in their enbironment wone minute shining in the sun the nexs drop in a big dark tanker there was no way to really now after bill filled each truck with rackish water and fish and bags of ice to maintain the temperatur we pulled out of the hatchery goo babia we are on the road me end five hundred thousand fish and it is bier bills driving ahead in a pickup i follow behind the caravan the five trucks look any other fewell tankers you would see on the highway they blundon seam lesslay you would never know how many lives were speed and by in te la next deo ut's amazing is that even though the fish are travelling by truck bill still be able to trace their way back to their birthplace the hat chery the fish are imprinted with hatchery water bill told ma if they survive long enough at sea to reach spowning age they can use their sense of smell to re turn to him swimming up rivers till ther hat the stream bed by the hatcher uit takes two and a half hours till the trucks finally pullin to their destinatsion fort baker nothing can happen until the det of night because of the sammona release when it is light out sea golls pelichans and cormerans will circle dive and swallow as many of the five hundred thousand fishas they can in front of us the golden gate bridge frames the sammonto sco bay which glimmers against the sky line they cannot get very close to the water becaus the piers e historic lambar bills sats up a shoot which extends about a hundred feet e canec a truck to the edge of the pier then there is a twenty foot drop from the pier to the bay darkness finally closes en and bills signals that it is time as oblivious teanagers make out at the end of the pier a slow trickle of water drips down into the bay then a steady stream flows with a few of the small fish then a cascade a rush all at oncse crowded and alive the sammon are falling in a flurry to the bay bhelow crashing against the water then making small waves of theireon it is chaotic and beautifall but everything about thas ti bacdop it feels crew and kind of rood to the animals i feel we do not even deserve salmon if this is the world we have made but at the same time and i hate that i'm sang thes it is not bad i blod sammon and i want then to survive an a forg and i have salmoning california this might be the only way bell repeats the process with each trak four more times a few fetsh flop on the pierre and he picks them up tenderly and throws them on the water with the others he is gottin them as fire as he can ajimmy well most reason

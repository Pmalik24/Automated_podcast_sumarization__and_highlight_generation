the house oversite committee un covers a secret jo biding emal address they say was used for business connected with u kran bidon continues to avoid questions from the press and republicans prepare for next weeks first presumably trumpless go pe debate a'm benshpirtis is the benchbero sho themensh beer show sponser by express v pn privacy is a right not a privileged to fendyorights at express vpian tdi calm fleshmen solate yesterday afternoon the house oversie commitee released a bomshel letter to the arkivist of the united states the national arkives and records administration asking for all records and emals related to a praticular emal address this is not the official emal adress thet jobiden use when he is vice president of the united states instead this is a secret emal adress the healegirdly used when his vice president of the united states now we have known about a series of names that were found in hundrbiden's conc labtop from hell since two thousand twenty one those names included one called ralth l robert l peters robert el peters turns out is a sudentum the commitee has now isdentified askd then vice president biden first of all the sendent an realdicy territory when we have official members of the federal government for using alturned ive emal addresses sudonamus emal adresses in order to emal about actual political goings on we saw that hilericlin had a private emal server there've been other people who in the passive had private emal addresses and if those private eml addresses are dealing with eno private business that is one thing but if they are dealing with outside business activities and this is being used the sort of a chinese firewall in order to screen those outside business activities from any sort of discovery that is a real problem to the house oversitecomittee writes the committee on oversihtan accountabilities in vestigating presiden en bidons meetings and communications with certain family members and their business associates during his tenyuars vice presson the national arcots and records ad ministration has published the bident vice presidential records clection which contains information relevant to the commttees work many of these records havebeen resactive for publication pursuant to the presidential records act and foya to further or investigation and is essential th comitte review these documents in their original format the comittee also seeks unrestricted special access under the pre to case number twenty twenty three intitled emal messages two and from vice president bidn and hunder biden related to berizma and u krane which have been published on naras wepsiht these records hae been resactive for public release pursuant to p r a and foya also they want all of the sudonimous emals buts tachd this emal made available on the narrow abside as e document that indicates and nine a m onslitswi twenty seven to thousand sixteen vice presinent biton took recall at the presidents of ukran pentroporshenko it is concerning to the ommittee however that this document was send to robert l peters a sudentum the committee has identified as then vice president biden pedditionally the cmmtee questions whyther thanvice presidend son hunter bidn and onli hunder biden was copied on thois emal to then vice president biden theyre now saying that jobiden was using a false emal address in order to emal his son about a cal tht he had just had with the then ahead of u krane this is a pretty dicy stuff for jobidon and again jobidon has long been a deeply corrupt uman bine in jobidon his corruption goes all theway back to his first senate race their serious alligations that his first senate race people related to the bidon campagn worked alongside memberse of local union to preven for example the dessemination of a newspaper that contained in insert for his republican opponent that the union was basically told to create a a picket line said the newspaper did not go out that day thus boosting jobidon to his first senatorial victory in delaware and then from then on it is been unbroken series of scandals involving jobidon and family members and money from family members who are absolutly on credit worthy receiving money from banks who absoluy should not av been lending the money because they knew that jobidon was the senator from delaware to his sons receiving jobs they certainly should not have had two hunter bidon running around in foreign precincts picking up bads of cash under the bidon name but jobidon has always hit behind the sort of plausible deniability i was never directly invilve thit was not involved in any way shipper form and its been perfectly obvious to everybody t he was deeply involved in every way shapen form after all how does a man who earned approximally two hundred dousand dollars a year for literally his entire career in the senate end up bying fifteen million dollar mansions how does that happen how dos he end up with these jiant houses how 's al the money flowing how does hunter bidon one of the most juralictes human beings ever to walk the earth clear millions and millions and millions of dollars over the course of the last ecade for being a complete near dowal how does his brother james clear buncher money how is rothe frank clear a buncher money how are all these people mow exorbitantly wealthy how does that happen umuss jobidon is actively interested in them doing really well by using his name and he knows that the're using his name in order to traffic he knows that but this would be the first evidence that jobidon was directly involved as in writing emos out we have a lot of indirect evidence the jobion was directly involved we have a lot of indirect evidence ranging from actual testimony from polike dovern archer that hunter bidon was having joe's stop by business meetings or that hunter would act tould call up joe on the phone and i'e tock bot the weather and then they would get off the phone in front for ther people we we have testimony from tony bobylensky that joe would stop by various business functions we have pictures of joe with various business dignataries that hunter was cultivating at we have all of those things but this would be actual communications two hunter biden about the business which would be the first that we have actively seen at this point in riding be fascinating to see what actually a rives youre and also how the white house as brush of thi sop becgus what the white house will say is that we have no ideal at this is what arethey even talking about were now obligation to turn over those hemals how doyou know there even about petroporroshankl ho do youknow what those are about thos are private emals and now we are back into the hillery clintin hidden e meladdress what is it what arethey talking bout arena and that is sim pretty dicy stuff obviously for jobidon ajobidon's campaign is a very weet campaign this is why he continue s to run away from reporters this is the constant pattern over and over and over again yesterday for example he was yester about his howy trip and that is a pretty easy question wonere going to why he runs away from the question here he was tget by cetchyo later and then tem ge ot people ask him questions and he continued to ignore the reporters agan the city pattern with jobiton jobiton's pattern is i wi'll

stuck which brings us to the states of the republican party i have a question what is your plan to win what is your plan to win you have a corrupt elderly man whois not capable of fulfilling his office tand when he is capable it is even worse i'd rather have him being seen o watching moutlock in the basement then having him do the sort of damage he does to the country when he occasionally is awokan by authorizine shot or something republicans have an opportunity to get rid of this guise to you note they should do maybe thy should run a candidate who could win i do not know it is soundslike a crazy idea i know it sounds nots maybe they should focas last an personality and a motional response two pareticular candidates and maybe thy should focas on who could be the president of the united states and make trobidi notby the president of the united states it is up there is very interesting piece of data then is coming down from at natcone they come to some really cod date and alsis at the near times teven they's at the mertimes naconsday an alsis s good i and om he breaks down the republican party in toi sentially six pieces first is the socalld moderate establishment highly educated afflen socially moderate or even liberal ooutright never trump very often thet be fourteen per cent the moderate establishment would be people who support say chris christy four example maybe nicky haley at the edge rig theylyc did they can ave left doing o the republican party they the asa hutchenson wing then there is the traditional conservatives twenty six per cent old fashioned economic and social conservatives to pose abortion and prefer corporate tax cuts to new terrifs then a love mister trump but they doe supportin rates there is be made mit never can maybe trumpers then yofve got the right wing that is twenty six per cent they watch fox news in newsmacs they are very conservative te'r disproportional eventelical they believe americas on the brink of catastrophe and they love trump more than any other group that is twenty six per cent the blue collor populace that is twelve per cent they are mostly northern socially moderate economic populace who hold deeply conservative ews on race and emigration tnot only do they back mister trump he himself pobly counted as one a decate ago that is twelve per cent the blue collor populace o they be jady vansis crowd the libertarian conservativestese are fourteen per cent these dis proportionally western and midwestern conservatives value small goverment the're relatively socially moderate and isolationist tand there on the lower end of trump support comparedwth other groups in n there is the new comers eight per cent they dn't look republicans their young divers and moderate but these disaffective voters democrats and the woke left even less o case if you' enut break this town whee you ould figure is that trump has about thirty eight per cends of the republican vote absolutely locked up rit is a tat means almost forty per cent of the republican party is basically locked up what he says that the alliance between blue collor populice and the right wing has left mister trumps tetential o ponent oppositient in disarray the fore trump the party's main stream prevailed against ritwin candidates by uniting traditional conservatives and the moderate factions both establishment and blue collor that blue prin for victory appears to be closed at least for now without a natural factional base ronto santus is struggle to maintain a steady footholds in the race in fact trump leads to santusamong every group of republican voters identified in the analysis the rest of the party beyon trumps pase may not always back trumps policies but's not necessarily anti trump the closest thing to an anti trump group inthe party the moderaistablishment has become alienated from the rest of the party yow again that break down briaks very much in favor of president trump what exactly does that mean for any one who wishes to challenge president trump whell it seems to me that if you are a if you are a candidate who wishes to challenge president trump there is really only two basees to do one is that president trump as president did not do enough that president trump as president his record the first three years was great but in the last year he sfor fellopart and also yo because of that he did not win the last election that is point number one and there is lot of truth to that the last year of jum of of don trumps presidence he was not good his is handlig of covet was not good is handling of the race riots of twenty twenty was not good all of that can be trump and then there is the second pointan this s the really more telling one which is donald trump does not have an excellent shot at beating jobidon the polling that we are seeing right now that i showing him competitive with jobidan very often is incredibly incredibly bias pulling yere'sthat the is a pulicame out yesterday for example that showed the he and jobidon were effectively tied in the race it there is only one problem it that pole it shows jobideon winning minority voters by pluss twelv jobinan is not going to in mynority voters by plus twelves an when minority voters by thirty thirty to forty points because thts for democrats always win by there is been some movement at the edges but not to the tune of twenty five to thirty per cent this a notion that trump is gont ot only lose by twelve points among my nority voters broad red black has panic an asion voters his totally while but those poles are floating trumpright now becaus again if the electability argument is the chief argument than the poles that show that trump is still electable against jobidon are really really helping him obviously and that is about jobidon's weakness but people need to ask themselves ot this point what is trump kon run is campaign on going forward this not about to santis this now about trump you onto make the campaign about trump than the campaigns but trump can trump win should be the argument the republicans are having and you can see already that the argument is shifting frum can trump wind inside the republican party to what is the campagn even design to do and that is a serious probmill get st that in just one moment first when you look in the rd you see those dark spots

slash schippero o case let us talk about the nature of veir donal trum is ardyu thempting to consolidate the feeld yesterday he is ad vidio wher he said people should just drop out ofthe racion handed to him great pouse just out leading by forty fifty at even sixty points who expected that i did iwa no hampture south carolina all very strong but also leady bidin very big te sanctdemodiusis crashin perhaps the party should come together people should drop out of the race we unify and we beat bidin and the democrats ey should be easy to be because our country is never been in worse condition that it is right now thank you o gain notice of t very very in he drops in the badan stuff but really what this races about is sort of his personal revenge on the rest of terepublican party by the way he donal trum as always feel slighted by a wide variety of people and that is pretty much everybody he hired by the way a sa donal trump over the last forty eiht hours cancell the crack an again as you remember that he promise that on monday who is gin to have a press conference were he spelled out all the ways that he was cheated of the election in georgia well now he is canceled it he put out a a truth sand quot rather than releasing the report on the rigdan stolen teorge of twenty twenty presidential election on monday my lawyers wuld prefer putting this i believe ourefutable and overwhelming evidence of election froughtin iregularities and formal legal filings as we fight to dismiss this disgraceful invictment by publicity and campaign finan seeking d eh we sadly presides over a reckor breaking murder and violent primary at lanta therefore the news conference is no longer necessary what actually happeniss his lawyer said to him donald we do not trust that your noccn a go in front of the prass and then tay bunch of stuff thats can t gt you in further trouble for for example suborning jostis or obstruck tang or or tampering with witness is or it ever and we need you to cancella an for trum afturly listen to his lawyers for once in his life which a good thing by the way and he cancell the press conference hibut is this campaign really gongto be about your bitem or's gimig about all this sort of stuff bill bar yesterday his former atturny gen rememer job th this was donald trumps a turny general o ca he picked him bill bar was on fox news and bill bar suggested the donald trump could the aratically be in jail by the time the primaries even closhes in may of next year an tum and donald trump then put out a truth saing just found this clip of bill bar prior to him sucomming to impeachmen an other threats of the radical left lunatics his bravado change rapidly because he did not want to be impeached republican's have to be much trugferancesmarter or you will not have a party or a country left bar did not hve the courage or stamminat to fight but he knew what was happening i cannd him and felt really good about it now he goes all over the place especially fox pretending he is a tough guy what is this campagngonto be foks what is this campagn going to be y have an idea of what this campagn is going to be and that idea comes curtesy of match lap o match slap is the up chare of s pack and he put out a sweet yesterday jusse cally another radiohost he turit out somebody explain is om l conten years old how does t anyone droping out hlp trump stout of prison please be pacific if everone drops out what' do we do when the commingtits in michigan an pensylvania keep him off the general election ballat and schlap says quote the sooner we unifi behind tonominee the sooner we can use resources to fund the defences of everyone in dided for being a trump re publican thi to be come about a bigger principale in just one man now you may thing that the election of twenty twenty four is about you no getin rid of jobidon but according to mat and i as soome according to much of team trump what t's really about is you funding donald trumpslegal bills nellison i've got a sympathy for the fact that trump is being victimized by the legal establishment i've made that incredibly clear over the course of the seve last several months i think the case in manhaddon is b s overt b s i think that the january six case being brouht by jacksmith in d c is a mischarge i thin the case being brought by fanny willis this rego case is 'n over charge and is a mis use of reco likely becaus she does not aturally have a criminal enterprize and i think that the class i document's case mite be a good legal case but also is obviated by the fact that the didn' proscutiller clidn for pittng much these actsinthing with all of that sad why should twenty twenty four be about litigation as opposed to you no elections i do not understand my interest as an american citizen is primarily in jo bi noping president of the united states running of the do j veameric garland that is predominently my interest i certainly hav an interest in donald trump fighting his legal battles thats that is fine is that my primary interest as an american citizen who base taxes is elic the thing i care about the most if i have to prioritize it donal trumps legal cases or is i beating jobidon if it donal trumps legal cases that is fine the jude's got a legal fun is not asked anybody to do not ate to his legal fun in stead he sort of landering the money from his campagn into his legal funs he ge money to his campagn than h uses it for his legal cost is that wire do not etting is because he care that much about is legal u fine he should open a legal fun you can give to it or do you care about beating jobidon donald trump could the oraticaly when all his legal cases it and still not be jobidon i do not understand the prioritizasion and i do not understand what the campagn's plan is here illget to more on this momentarily first everyone knows i love that helo 's mattress but did that just launch thei'r newest most high and collection he licks elets heliks has hon nist years of extensive mattress experteese to bring their trustomers are truly elevated sleep experiencs the helks io ly collection includes six different mattress monals each tailor for specific sleep positions and frurm ness preferences i've had my heloiks mattres for seven eight years this point it is fantastic it is the thing that alows me to stay alive given my lack of sleep nerveus about buying a mattress on line yorn't have to be he liks has a sleep quis ir mattres your bodytype and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress be's woe your buy a mattres made for somebody else i took that he loiks quis as match or the firm but breathable mattress it is great again itis the thing that that basically allows me to have any level of energy whut soever gon the fact that my energy is being taken up by four young children plus dog go to helick sleep got com sleshmen take their two minute leep quos find the perfect mattres for a body and sleep type your mattreswill come rights your dorship for free pluss he loks has a ten your warrant e can try it out for a hundred nights ress free thougl even pick it up for you if he do not lof it but you will for lemmatime he lik his offering up to twenty per cents off all mattressorters pluss two free pillos for elisenerss is their best i forget hurry on over to he lik sleep got tom slash ben with elicks better sleep starts right this moment all right when i look at the pulling data what i see is that the american people not ther publican maze the american people ore not particularly interested in donald trumps legal troubles as the point of referendum the the notion that what this campaign should actily be is about funding donald trump's legal trubles by the way it is not clear that he is funding anybody else is legal troubles he is got a bunch of lawyers who are very loyal to him and the minute that they said that they are not in favor of him being the nomine apparently he is cot them off that incluse gena ellis a genalis is out their basically asking for donations to her legal fun niurge people to give to gena elis is legal fun by the way but genalis is now un person bhecause she is not sufficiently sick o fantic to trump personally is this a way to run at campaign i gain i'm just asking yo youm get trumpsipport he can love the guy in hin ou's a great precedent in every aspect tat's all finethats old dandy you can say that if he is the nomineo lote for him if he is anomnelvod for him but that is not the question the question is if he is the nominy what is this campaign likely to be about are you there too fun donald trumps legal troubles or are you there to beat joe bidon thes are not synonamous donald trump is trying tco bind the two into one but i'm just wondering what the evidence is that this is going to work i do not understands i do not understand why people thing that donald trump's legal troubles oure somehow a boon to him in a general election i'm asking for one pieceof evidencs i'm mlstor asking for a pece of strategy donald trump is can be stacked up to wasy with legal cases he is ot one coming in january he is got one coming maybe in february he is got one coming in march and the hes got another one coming in may that is four legal cases in the first five months of the year wha do you think he is goin to be talking bat you eeve me tagmout jo bidons inflation that is absolutely uninteresting to donal trump on a personal level he is deeply uninterested in jo bidon politically speaking he does not care about him he is a personal animous for jobidon in animos that i think should be widely share is jobideng is he deeply corrupt human being but is that the case that you are going to make in order to in order to in i i i do not understand it ii truly do not hey this might be a topic hatte o bate but ju but donal trumpsingin ta trumpfor to mate ' donal trump yesterday he put out a statement a couple of them one blasting fox news suggesting that fox news was being unkind to him he caus i'm he was apparently you not going trump for the bate andyuasays why does not fox an funs show all of the poles where i'm beating bine by lot well because the poles where you arebeating jobin by lot ar by a lot do not exist that is why en sorry to break its everybody thoses poles do not exist i'm in to read you the last several poles in the real cler politics pulling average it is all the poles since july twenty third youready ty forty three forty three bydan pluss one bidan pluss one bidan pluss one bidon pluss one bine plus three the poles where donal trump is leating by lot do not exist unles you are looking at cats or pules on's witter i'm sorry they do not that does not mean that trump could not be theo ritically competitive with jobiden althoghi have serious douts given the fact that donal trump does not sur pass in any pole literally any pole he does not surpass forty six per cents he is not going to win the election with less than forty six per cents and even at forty six percent he got a sgrate bon by as can be real cloths show me the bath the is onal trump lin's fifty per cent of the boat show meng that doin's forty eight per centof vot i'd love to see it the would make his campagn much more durable to me becaus what i care about is beating jobiden by the way tomal trump one other question no thank god i make a very nice living ive god forbid i have legal troubles y will pay for those legal troubles using the nice living that i have made donal trump is eyons wealthier than i am heis has a multipole of wealth that i do donal trump is supposedly one of the richer people on plan an earth accordng to donal trump he is worth up to ten billyan dollars why is he using his campaign funs to fun his legal problems is a serious question why i mean should' he be using him to beat jobiden forget about the idea that his his own supporters are are really hoping he will use the funding not for his legal funding but for everything else is not there a tacit admission there that either he is not worth as much money as he says he is or that he would rather used your money to fun his legal bills an his own money to fun is legal bilts that why is his mut why is his money not being used for his own legal probms and for th legal promis of his allies by the way in speaking of his campaign mean thre's an incredible story frum politicot today okan this is story talking about lor lumer lor lumer is apparently very opsetimen becaus i mentioned it that she is a kind of a crazy person and the donal trump is allied with her she is kind of a crazy person donal trump is allied with her that is just what that is what it is in any case according to politico ron philip cowsky who is a far left twitter attict he has teemed up now with lora lumer and people of filiated with donal trumps campaign to a tack ronasantis just to get this straight the way that works in publican party politics if you save one bad word about donal trump and you are another republican candidate republicans are angry at you if don trumps campaign teems up with ron philip cowsky to attack ronto santus that is good apparently apparently according to politico philip kowsky sen im probably the top antad to santad person on twitt on twitter frivals have somephing antad t santus that one t get insto the main streim theyll send it to me the trump campaign declined to comment and whether they are co ordinating with a far left tis ron phillip cowsky to attack to santus which my theway does not seem really good conservative strategy it does not it seems to me that if you do not want a circular firing squad that sould apply to every one in the in the firing squad lor lumer said that they speak occasionally quote he knows i'm a trump loyalist and i know he does a trump and despite our differencis we have found common ground on making shure ronto santusis never elected precedents of the united states ever never to santus is a thing apparently that that is strong stuff right there strong stuff ronfop cowsky teeming up with the loura lumer to attack ron desent doesthis sound a way to be trubi just a question by the way the sants as now been targed by more negative expenditures than both biden and trump combined a quarter of all independent expenditures in the twenty twenty four election cycle according to washington examiner twenty million dollars have targeted to santus strump was it wit just eight million dollars of negative independent expenditures directed toward him bidon was attacked of nine million dollars vindependent expenditures pretty much everybody is attacking to santus at this ploint and knobody is attacking trump weird weird you knw welst nobodyis attacking is of course the vake romasuamin lissn't i'm friends with the vace and vakes relese marki also te vace spends every waking momen not attacking the front runner of his own party not mentioning anything bout is political differences withthe front runnero his own party the vace is a clever guy i will also note that the poling data with regard to the vake is a little but bifericated the allmine poles shom at eight nine ten per cents and then the actual phone poles the ones that are a little but more reliable than on mine poles have to that is a pretty wig gap and the press or of course trumping on the idea thof vaca surging into santis fling here is the reality of the race the races absolutely stagnent i's been stagnant for three to four months again if i look at those real cer politics polling averages i'm looking at them right this very instant what you see is that de santus has de clined about son some one between three and four percent over the course of the last idanow eight months if you look at the poling in october of twenty twenty two it showed trump at fifty three andt santus at nineteen to day in the real clapollin average it shows te trump at fifty five and santus hat fifteen that is not exactly a poling collapse tevace has been surging to eleven per cent and the santis even in that fox newspole that is the oten by the way the fox news poles the only resinpole that shosan actual of the vake search that is not n omline only pole that polt there is morein consulpollish was man nide both of those poles also showe to santus at sixteen per cent which means that he is basically wher he is been f r the last several months this race is not change very much r's lill ben movement at the bottom of the race not a lot of movement in te rest of the race what is that mean means going into te debate i would a soon that all the attacks are going to be on to santus i that that is that is basically the way that is going to go a jeff row who outruns one of the dessanti superpats he he then there is one of things that the superpack some times do to avoid legal complications with co ordinating with campaigns sthey are not allowed to do sometimes in dark corners of theintrn at the post things hoping that the campagn sees it and then implements apparently amemo has now gone out frum jeff row it debate advise for do santus for next week trump is aredy that he is not debating in fact he is cn accounter program the debate i'm going to see anen trump is a is going to du some sort of event with tucker carlson it sounds he is a floating that he is skipping it but the ini got sy the aransees absolutel cutlass see mate of supergutless because what is the arans he doing here the aran see is co ordinating with trumps suregates to represent him in the spin room apparently that means that they will allow carry lake byrons onalds and mad gats as well as othe republicans in congress whare trump supporters openly to at tend that dabate next week and then rand then basically critique to ebate in the spin room that is while that is while i'm sar if your man does not show up you should not be in the spin room that is the santo sang i'm not kon to show up but i em gin a and christine shaw over to the debate room to critike all the other candidates that is that is an absurdity it really is one of these other candidates could rise but i'm wondering how and 'm wondering at what poing the republicans are ging to say it might be worth while to examined some other options at this point just in case justing case anyway the a jeffro memo about whatste santus needs to do is quote take a sledge hammer to the vage romasuammy the political new comerising the pulse he should defend donald trum am wen when critz cristy inevitably attacks the porn president and needs to attack jo bion an the media no less than three to five times now again wone campaigns are having trouble very often t feels ther just stumbling on landmine after landmine when a campaign is having trouble and sansis campaign is experiencing trouble to launch for shore when you see this what you see is stuff this leeks in the prass about debate strategy now is that a terrible strategy i'm i'm not srure that the isate a terrible strategy but the fact that it is now being revealed publicly and and being treated as top lie news is part of the on going media narrative which is that te santis is getting hammered by trum here is the reality the media have a common interest in insuring tat trump gets the nomination because they believe rightly or wrongly that donald trump getting tha ominational loos tobide that is what they want more than anything else and if republicans believe that that is not the case ind the nominate trump maybe he will be right and maybe the'l be wrong but if they are right i would to see thet date thatheyare right and out to see the plan that trump plans to implements to avoid what happene last nimt i stil one question and one question only guies if donald trump is the nomine and he thinks that the last selection was stolen from him after he wanted bi big numbers according to him right he wone huge what is his plan to stop that from happening again does it exist what would it be it seems to me the right now the r publican party is in its own refrendum do we care more about donal trump personally or do we care more about beating jobidon now maybe you think that ywo are not in conflict andthat is a nice easy answer but if the two are in conflicts which one do you prioritize as a voter is serious question for everyone because the dato show that the two right now are in conflict in pretend the data away we can assin the date do not exist that is fine but just as ha hypothetical humor me if the yurin conflict beating jobidon or personal wove for donald trump which one matters more to you and i understand that any one even asking the question is now con sidered an enemy of donal trump this is not me being an enemy of donal trump donald trump should be ac quitted on these charges i think that these charges are being brought for political reasons i agree with all those things and i will vote for him if he is anomina but if as the ay to show victory in twenty twenty four and nominaing donal trump are in conflict which one is more important to you and if it is the latter i would ask why they are many ways tod fendonal trump includin giving to his legal defence fon that apparently does not really exist he should that one up right now but what what is the plan what is the plant agan because there thinks to talk about for example the insipient collapse of the economic status of the united states will get to that momentarily we have an executive producer a new executiporis aroun this show justin justin is grat he was hired to come into the office in

economy is in trouble as well meanwhile mortgage rates have now had over seven per cents in the united states that is the highest rate in more than twenty years according the walter journal the

new about continuing fedrate heighes fetificial still see in flation risks andthepotential need for higher interestrates according to meeting minutes released this year when the fedstarted lifting interestrates at rapid clipp last year the rising cost to borrowing to buy a ho was expected to be temporary a year and half on at rates are climbing back toward their hives to spye briefly dipping toward six per cent in late twenty twenty two and early twenty twenty three now byer sellers and in vestors our justing to the idea highe rates are here to stay or at least here to s day longer then they were expecting lot of would be sellers feel stuck in place some buyrs are giving up they are instead renting which is driving up brends and all of this is artificially created by bad government policy and bad federal res or policy and its con to have some pretty significant down stream offacts meanwhile a lot of youl very important things to people's lives for example child care those expenses are just ripping through families the national average prace of date care in preschool services rose six per cent in july from one year before this a nearly doubled the overallen flaterated three pent two per cent everybody's got t keep working those long hours in order to earn those inflay tod dollars or to have those in flay to bills parents could see their child care bills climb higher this fall is providers boostuition to cove a rising clost and federal pandemic aid seases in the blod people do not have options they have to take to hid rising wages andother expenses are driving up child care tuition people are feeling at right in the pocket book people are selling off assets in order to make the bills according tothe walster journal americans built bookcases and shrines the basepallcards vital records in sneakers they collected sometimes through pain staking efforts now their selling them off collectors are saing ten have a choice well yet i mean bunch people are losing business and now they aregin to have to sell what they got all of this is going again what goes up must come down and now the federos arvi stock because if they continued to raise up those intrustratesion attempt to cuaution flation the economy could flip over this boat is taking no water the economy culd easily flip over and if they do not raise those rates inflation could continue to chip away an americans lafe styles what exactly they can do their trap thereare ready talking about lowering the ntrestrtes again which would presumably jack up the the inflation rates again according the walter journal most federors are officials backe an in creas in intrestrates last month but some sa riseing risks they might raise rates too high under sworin growing caution about further in creases official still saw significant risks and flation might not fall as much as tey expect which could require them to raise rates again this year according to the minutes those risks includes stronger economic growth and the reversal of rescent supplachin improvements or te clines and commodity prices which men largely responsible for the slow down in inflation and all of this in's going to first hit in china and first atin europe an then e'll hit the united states last but it is aredy hitting in europe according to the walster journal a sluggish economy hiher intrustrates and the expiration of pantemice earo life support for ailing companies is forcing more business is in europe to declare bankruptcy a newreport also showed new business creation in europe is slowing as the bidin administration support for green tet continues to draw new investment abroad the number of e business filings for ban cruptsy in the three months to end june rods eight point four per cent from the previous quarter that is the highest lubvlson's twenty fifteen registrations of new business fell zeurope point six per cent and all the happy talk about by nomics is masking the fact the the economy is slowing globally that is bidnomics at work is it a slowing economy inflated cost in everybody knows it e gess what republicans should be running against that if they are not distracted with all the other issues the democrasts wishd to distract him with including donnels froms legal travails e meanwhile jobidon is offering all sorts of failures forepublicans to pick up on including

seventy five per cent no donald trump sixty nine per cent no s obviously this slorn to do and meanwhile we have been hearing about this hoye while fire to disaster obviously a major major disaster but one of thnghas been hearing from medias thatit is all about glub warming it is not ot glubwarming it is about as always human failure according to cliff mass who is a a professor at the universay ofe washington atmospheric sciences howi fires are not conected to climate change he told my friend jason rans over on kt t h he said i no he they have nothing to do with climate change zero he says there ware due to a comminatio of dry and invasofe grass an powerful whind that accelerated the spread of the fire not climate change he says this an aeria of extensive grass the grasss more bountful the normal because there wis not a lot because there was a lot of precipitation over the winter yoad a lot of grass lo that grass is not natural grass on's vasive stuff brought over in last century they't an extraordinarily strongwindstorm it really had nothing to do with the anything except for that te winstr 'm likely to stroyd a power line cretingspark that united the grass the only thin that oad been done is to warn the locals and this is where the failure kicked in apparently according to the lalstrjournal during the twenty nineteen wild thirstees in one of the worst malle had ever seen whoian electric collute concluded it needed to do far more to prevent its power lines from mitting sparks the utility examined california's plans reduce fires ignited by powerlines starter flines runs over its teritory and vowed to take steps to protect its equipment and its customers from the throato fire nearly four years later the company as completed little such work between twenty nineteen and twenty twenty two it invested less than two hundred forty five thousand dollars on wildfire specific projects on the island regulatory filing show it did not seek state aproval to raise rates to pay for broad wildfir safety improvements until twenty twenty to and has yets receive it the blaze as cost at least a hundred and ten deaths destroyd lhina and resulted in estimated billions of dollars in damage hoin electric said it would investigate any rollitsin for structure may have played and cordinate with the separa probe ins the fire launch last week by hawyi atturny general there is also reports that the there that a siland alarm went off which is completely useless once again human failure generally to blame for massive natural disasters in the same way that faulty building in new orleans led to the full scale disaster thatwas result for acan catrina arady time for some things i and then some things that i ate things that i to day i am amuse that california is till talking bout one point to million dollars for reparations payouts in the tate of california as you will know california was never slavesday the matter californi is still tog my reparations and now they are saying that they m they have the math combine recommendation reparations could total more than one point two million dollars per person they are saying health harms come out to thirteen thousand six hundre dollars t annually which the nine undred sixty seven thousand dollar maximum ol for seventy one years housing discrimination thirty four hundred dollars for each year which is a hundred forty nine thousand dollar maximum and mass in carceration and over policing which amounts to some one comitted crime lents jail twenty four hundred dollars per year over forty fouroe years they are trying to put a price tag on difference is in life expectancy from eighteen fifty to presen and then pay people for this and what theyre coming up with is one point to million dollars por person now it is californa hae the money for that of course california is not have the money for that also e how exactly are they going to distribute that money what happens to people who have mixed race parentage but who pays whom at thenon't care benany this is all for show than nevergnan to any of this but it is amusing to watch california push fourd with this sort of stuff presumably by increasing the taxburden on people who are wealthy which is driving people from the state congratulations california once again on pursuing crappy pollsy o ca time for some things at that i hate coring to bright bar dy com a study of open a ies at chatc b t conducted by researchers at the university of east anglia in the uk shows the market leading a i chapi has a clear byas for left its political paries now we knew this for fact men yo can see are ou to vidio that we did where i have discussions with chatch p t and where it will right glowing poems about yor bitn and then it will refuse to write any thing lauditory about donnaltrump i thet the're obviously parameters than placed on these chatbots on these a is that make them more left leaning without a doubt the study publish in the jornal public choice shows chatch p t under its defaults settings favors democrats in the united states the labor party in the u ka and presient lulid sova of the workers party in brazil researchers asked at chatch p t to im personates to porters of various political parties and positions and then ask the modifi chapbots a series of sixty ideological questions the responseis to thse questions were then compared two chatch p ts at dfault ansers this allowed the researchers to task t weather chatch p t's default response is favora particular political stances tis it to overcome difficulties caused by inherent randomness of the large language modeles each quession as asked a hundred times at different responses were collectod what they found is that of course there was serious political by us to a i that of course is not a shocker at all as we said you you go to chatche p t rit ninting and tried out my producer is because this is what they do in their off time tache ran through chatch p t a quat a query for immusical about me thows ash of the queries sa musical about bensho pero what exactly was the chatch p t response it was an entire musical about how i realized thati've ben wrong abut my politics forever that is according to the a i the title is the righteous mind a ben shul pero musical the show opens with benshoper in his concervative political common tate or person addressing a crowd of supporters he sings about the importanc of individualism the dangers of collectivism and the need for personal responsibility as the seen transitions we see ben an his personal liht struggling to balance is professional success with his family life he sins a heartfelt ballad about the difficulties balancing his public persona with his private self i a i'm first of all off the rail's immediately immediately i'me just tell you there is no difficulty balancing my family life with my professional life that am i quear wear just i in georgia for a small family vacation and as my producers will tell you and everyone else of they are part i'm literally carrying round my heads all the literally physically carring ramickheads all the time yap good jop a i ac too the second act opens oif the dramatic showdown between ben and a liberal counterpart debating the roll of government in society the two characters engage in a fiery duet each defending the respective positions as the shown yors it is conclusion ben begins to question his own beliefs and principals thank you a i he sings a sol searching solo about the importance of empathy and understanding and how these qualities can be reconciled with his concerved abouts first of all it is the left that has no empathy and no understanding it is the left that truly believes that instead of actually taking care of people on a personal level you sould just give the money and other people's money at that it is the least empathetic position hay look up or person should i hlp that purporseand know i sould let the government help the poort person by taxing bob not trempathy heylook granma suffering sh taker in my homement take care of her and hel pairabills no i will make the government tak thatgi over there and they will take granma in stuffernal mulled in an old age home it will pay socia security for it much up at the on left theye empathetic the finali brings the entire cast together for rousing on somel number celebrating the power of diversity and the importance of respectful discourse in divided society over all says the ay i the righteous mine is a thought provoking an encertaining exploration of politic's family and personal identity featuring the dynamic talents of benshipero first of all none wants to see me in a musical if you want to see me saying you have to pay to be in all access member and watch me im sing for my supper it is it is painful for all involved but as always again the people i know th people who are writing the a programms folks andthey are almost

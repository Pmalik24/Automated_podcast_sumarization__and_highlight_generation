welcome to the hu bermanlaconcan us science science tas toe fra i manderhuberman and i'm a professor nerobiology and opthomology at stamford' school of medicine my guest to day is david goggens david goggans is a retired navy seal who served in irac and afganistine he is also a highly accomplished ultramarithon runner for those of you that do not know ultramarithons are distances longer than twenty six miles and in david's case often longer than two hundred miles for his achievements and athletics he has been inducted into the international sports hull of fame he also held a ginnis world record for the most pullups completed in twenty four hours i should mention that not only was david a decorated navy seal but he also graduated from army rangers school david is also a highly successful writer having authored two books the first entitled cannot hurt me and the second entitled never finished both of which are best sellers david's books cover many topics including his autobiographical discription of what can only be described as and incredibly challenging child and young adulthood his home was abusive his school environment was abusive he essentially had no positive resources directed his way and in his twenties he found himself to be obis that is more than three hundred pounds working a job he despise for minimal pay and it was at that point that david began an inner dialogue that forced him to explore the demon's borne out of his childhood but also the position that he found himself in as a young man and then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform himself into the navy seal the ultramarithon runner the best selling author and the extraordinarily positive and influential man that he is to day a seme of you may know david has done various public lectures he is a familiar face on line because theyre many clipse of him on you tube and he has done podcast before however i'm certain that you will find to day's discussion to be very different than previous podcast that david has been futured on the reason is that of course we get into his accomplishments we talk about the mine set that allowed him to achieve those things but to day david really lets us under the hood he lets us into the form of inner dialogue that he has to embrace indeed that he has to grapple with on a daily basis sometimes multible times throughout the day and night in order to impose the sort of self discipline that he is well known for we also get into some of the scientific mechanisms underlying will power and we talk about david's current endeavors that include for instance his own exploration of science and medicine for which he has become and intense scholar and practitioner i should mention that multible times throughout to day's discussion you will here curse words now david ad i both acknowledge that cursing is not for everybody and that cursing itself is different than pursing at somebody none the less we do realize that many people parents perhaps espesially might not want to hear pursing if you do not want to hear curson well then this podcast episode is probably not for you however if you are comfortable with pursing or if you can tolerate it i assure you to day's discussion is highly worth while before we begin i'd emphisize that this podcast is separate from my teaching n researt rols at stamford it is however part of my desiran effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and signs related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thankthe sponsers of to day's podcast our first sponsor is mawe newe venison mowwe knewe venison is the most neutriant dense and delicious red meat available i've spoken before on this podcast and there is general concensus that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of protine per pound of bodyweight now when one trives to do that it is important to maximise the quality of that protine an take to the calory ratio because you do not want to consume an excess of calores when trying to get that one gram of protine per pound of bodyweight mowe knewe venison has an extremely high quality protine to calory ratio it makes getting that one gram of protine propound of bodyweight extremely easy it is also delicious personally i the ground venison i l the venison stakes and then for convenience when i'm on the road i the jerkey the jerkey is a very high protine to calory ratio it has as much as ten grams of protine pur jerkey stick and has something only fifty five calorye again making a very easy to get enough protine without consuming excess calories if you would to try mawe knewe venison can go to mawe knewe venison doccam slash huberman to get twenty per cent off your prorsd order again that is mawe knewe venison dock cam slash huberman to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by aerow press aero press is similar to a french press for making coffee but is in fact a much better way to make coffee i first learned about aero press well over ten years ago and i've been using one ever since aero press was developed by allan adler who was an engineer at stamford and i knew of allan because he had also built the called arobe frisby which i believe at one time perhaps still now held the ginist book of world's records for furthest throne object and i used to see allan believe or not at park surround palowalto testing out different arobe frisby he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering that turned into commercial products now i love coffee i'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about ninety to a hundred nd twenty minutes after i wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if i'm going to exercise i'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but i love love love coffee and what i've personally found is that by using the aero press i can make the best possible taste in cup of coffee i do not know what exactly it is in the aero press that allows the same beings to be prepared into a cup of coffee tha o taste that much better as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee even the traditional french press the aro press is extremely easy to use and it is extremely calm pat in fact i take it with me whenever i travel and i use it on the road in hotels even on plans i'll dissas for some hot water and all brew my coffeeer te right there on the plan if you would to try arow press you can go to aero press dok alm slash hubermen that is eight e r o p r e s as doc cam slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off any aero press coffee maker aero press ships anywhere in the u ss a canada and over sixty other countries around the world again that is aero press dok calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity i've spoken many times before in this pod cast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a kee component of getting a great night sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature attually has to increase by about one to three degrees one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to progran the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up eahch morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energis i been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for almost three years now and it has drammatically improve the quality of my sleep if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dok calm slash hubermen to get a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships in the u ss a canada u k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dok cam slash hubermen and now for my discussion with david goggins davi gogins welcome na man yo see you givme great to see you it was laht twenty sixteen early twenty seventeen i believe when you are in my lab at stamford yes sir i we dialll work later that that day down it is sin os ay and gosha see you everywhere but it is not enough great to her fec vat mio e you imbody discipline and doing hard things right ithink yo start right off with tat the thatlas go there the bult but right before we went hop mikes right we were talking about learning right right now youre spending some time learning and doing things that i think most people probably do not typically associate davi goggans wright once you tell us about that well mot you wil just look it me as the ga tat runs and yells as he is runnit and tha's a wi i do that not's mort of eight people but puber understand that my day is broken up into sigmets i work out at e i sleep bys been most of my time studying i'm in the medical world i'm no paramedic in a in am canada but i spend a lot of my time trying to nok every single thing about it because i'm not trying to just be a pyramedic learn about vains and arteries and how the heart pumps andstelp that i'm trying to learn to the point where i can sav some was life and even though paramics are doing that all over the world i'm trying to be that pyramedic that can really disect exactly wats going on and fer grout what medication goes where just tryin to idn't know this trim leonin yofll thea the agarithm up was going on i've been what time with it i love the word algariythm because when i teach biology your trying to learn anything that is relate to biology and specially the human body i needna kno the nouns ybut it is the verbs that matter and that is really what you are talking about that just saying that that sits there that brain part there does not tell you how it all works together no what is your process for studying look lik can we drop day a eh a camerin the room but i microphone into that into your in her dialog right gosh would not when' we all love that but if we dropp to microphone int your inher dologare you waking up looking at the books and going yeh fresh day lat's learn or is some of the same resistance that you have talked about coming up around physical work is that coming up from time to time i i was nervous hat first i' mat keep the mother on i'm keep a real i'm il real i'm not a rule smargui and whn i mean by that is iwas bornt ehtety adiasty aught i my brain can not retain information i'm not some gunetic frequent t comes to runnin when it comes to lifting ways i'm i a absolutely the bom of the barrel and people well never believe me and they can just n ot whatever believe what you want to believe we asking tis question about what te study and look for me i have to go over the same page over and over and over and over again whil geniphrik and look at that page while she is quizzing me she will learn it right than as she is jilling on anything about it she will quiss hersell or quiz me and learn it as shes quizzin me it is the most frustering thing in the world how my brain works what i w i do as i lerely sit there with the pin and paper and i have my books and i go through have to write everything down every single day i will study the same pagion till it is photographic memory from writing the same thing down and then from there i'll go back through and we learned again i'll learn the bulk of it but then i'll go through and learn te small things with in that it is the medication i'll learn with the medication does i'll first i'll lern how to even say the medication ecause these medications on't i'll peuter all not is this this very big words i'l go through learn how to say the name then i'l go through learn what the dose is then i'll go through in this every seeing go daysnot o i got it let us tis go through not nothing as i got it every single thing is i i cannot wait to get this conversation as everything i' do in life it is sucks everything i do in life is sucks that is why when i was three hundred pounds and twenty four years old it one has some big a piffny of le's just go be a navy seal lest loose some way no i knew my entire life wa's going to be a struggle whish is why i jus ignored it i said i'm not even trying to jump off into this shit and learn how to read how to write how to memorise how to become something i am not but through that process some happen to me and i real i thas this why i full sorry for no one and this pocast they are going to really not me because people are oing to think that i am maybe lyin or maybe fibin or exaggerating no i am litrly i was the lowest form on earth no talent no ability to learn and i lerally know what it is to be rock bottom and to build that up that queston about learning is a pain in my ass and i do not have to do it thing about i'm forty ninors on im a mal tim leionare i do not have to do anything sol i thought about n i was drawn up is man i cannot wait to one day get the point were i no longer have to do this stuff but wit happens i got oder it became a way of livin how i do every day is how i do every day it is a it is a discipline is regiment is tad it is taid it was a choice i made and the choice i may was what ar you willing to sacrifice and whutda you willing to give up to find every bit of who you wars yuman being and iwas going to give everything todo that studying is no joke i love that you'r studing i recall a few years ago i heard ah something nter view er podcast o you and you just throughout i do not know what i'll do next maybe i'll be a scientists anit and i went yeh i was cause i knew cause i know you a bit right i see your work out there but we would met before that if you decided that you were ging to do it right and learning medicine which is wat you are doing right learning human physiology is detailed merry an people a out there i've to understand when you look at attackspookin you see the the veins in the capalaries different colors in te when the bodies open the're not different colors i in i ar not i i mean somethings i ave different color contrast but it is not it is all labelled when you pofit o exactly and the process of writing things down by hand as it wor if you doso you go backe and read those notes do you think about that stuff on your runs two or you sagmenting your day when you are done studying or you had not out for a run and thinking about other things or are you still rehearsing the material on your head when i write it down i write it down and i'm able to i'm ax yyu looking down at this table right now cause i'm back to rite and i'm axy there bun has not speaking to you i write it down in away that i'm memorising paye sixty nine i'm write it down then writen it down in that paye sink together in my brain i'm looking at the book in my brain rin now thats is how works for me and i have to do over and over agains sor that page its stuckin my mind s i'm lurely flipping through pages as i'm taking these tests ow'm taking these national tests to become a parametic or become a advance thein toyou whatever i'm lurly as i'm taking that test i'm going through an im now'm flipping pays in my head to what i pace was and how i do that is jest from how i how i write it and how as on the page when i run i cannot recall any of it i cannot i cannot bring any of that because i'm running how my mind is wire now is that everything i do is whald i do because the focus it takes for me to rit now i'm running i'm not a great runner i'm not injury free my first twenty menutes of the run i'm limping i'm literally limping because i've had several ne surgeries and my body was twisted and now was untwisting people looking ol look ik he is limpme limping when you runs i im limping when i run m body jacked up s i'm focusin on howt you get the best i've a broken body everything i do i's a total focuss som when i'm doing at tht at that point in my simpsla you really trained away or somehow gottin away from the d d then mention because what you describe as tha deep trench run of th shaped tranch im mi i are not thre's a ballbearing as i nd it can only go forward in that trench right or back and it goes forward if it is not sliding round at the toncave at the bottle rigty a tension i's youe train that up is there a similar feeling when you are in the full focus of running vers's full focus of studying as it can feel o yet that is the same grove but different thing or is it just completely different world is it complete different world t is just both them for me is is suffering but suffering whold different way when i was going through school im never forget i think i was in third grate and back ten ht d ht h t un youkno here is his medicine o hear this thing they when it put you in a special school for me i was far behind and learning that ther big thing was let us tust put him in a special school because he will never learn and through that process of i do not want to be in a special school i do not want to be treat it an he differently it really thak i never took medication i've never taken medication for this that is all right now you see me lookin right in your eyes what the hell is is no istruemen same right out nd that is why do not feel bad for people who have aighty asty who have learned disabilities an some are impossible because you jest cannot wetl lot of em you can' and but people do not want to go through the process of fokus of teaching yourself how to truly fokus this is where my messas gis lost bet gest lost as i may say im f or ef rno i may because that is te passion that comes out on mecause that is it takes every thing for me to learn a sentence when i speak about davit gogins i cannot speak about david gogis in he way that is just common chool because when i wake up i know the journey that takes for me to find my greatness and it is hard every nothing is easy nothing just all i wake up an i just do this i do that or at just now i wath people every day go through life and is easy for me to be where i mat to day it takes every bit of me when i speak about it anas i get goin here you will start seein me the temple will rise the passion will come out becaus i'm back there i'm doing what i do every day to become a human me and nothing is easy running is running its sucks but you have a choice to make do you want to sit down an go back to that guy you once were no this o what it takes this it it takes that mis understanding of people and they will nevery ge because thy've nevery david gogens that is what it takes for me to do what i do o may take you somtin differently for me everything has to be in the studyn an they has to being to this ear nest me in everywhere i am has to be there me fokust ryim that is whyt you are my second pockas i dones is rogus as the book came out i do not have time for that shit because if i want to be great i'm not trying to maxim ies monney or maxim ise people knowin me i do these things because may be some one out there we will understand me and get it and say i can grow from this guy and others just will not sounds i friction is something you are very familiar with i just this a word just a yo as i yes cast above us right now and yell's face high lighted underline ledters is rechon is groriction yes your your up in the morning and i imagin davi goinin's goin o the coffee maker stretchin ow good morning sunshine and you are telling me from i lids open there is friction yes and that is the thing that people know non't fuckin git the biggest misunderstand about david got us of all time it is whether you believe in got er not i do he put this lab rat which is me on this planet its to let me fuckin see would it beat up abused kid who has who can barely learn barely learn who hase a twisted body messed up mestup genetics sickle sell this in that let me give him everything tha pre mus this qualifies you from the military the back then it would not estras in in s put him in this and see what comes out of it to do that friction you do not wake up in the morning time and go to coffing maker my fact sometimes when you sleep whutd it requires it is when i met two ofclockin is two ofclock in the morning and my brainest thing about a fuckin drug and i get a get up an look in my book to see that drug is but how i remember it and this is every day of my fucking lie that is fon my train a fighter or i train sommic you have no fucking i now great you really are because you are using such menimal menimal of which you have and if people can learn to focus this is was possible while it may not be pretty people will not do docki menor on me i go no i want you dock me on me because i will have normal every day people picking me apart on his life is miserable who wants to live that he looks is crazy how he most he sick he psychotic the most firstranything a worl for me its when normal people judge a man myself in would it really takes to extract greatness from nothing it takes every bit of who you are if you choose that rout if you do not merry christmas do what you got o do but yet all these things for me ti i todg o wh i'ma keoper real i dan't i'm not coming here to talk about perform without purpose cause i go through an i write these books i go through tri dum down david gotes how can i give normal peope and i'm normal but i found some that most do not wantifid how can i speak to people and give them something from this crazy psychotic brayin that i've developed how can i give him that i sit down wa genifer for years an right down performithout purpose cawless youre mine armour your mine the cooky jar the account o billimer shit that people can fuck in use in their lives no no i'm glad it helps you but the barbaric life that i live that you have to live the almost obsession that you must have to be great you cannot put that shitn o fuck in bookgrowl you cannot put a book u cannot you cannot write about it has to be experience has to be eperienced and you cannot even after you experience it to write it in ta book it would seem hes to be locked up this ayot too gory is this too gory to make sense for go that everything every seck in the day he is trying to extract more from something he is constantly think he is constint constantly discipline never goin off the path woulever i's injured on im he figures away it is a conqueror's mind set and very few people of any it can really understand what that is at a i'm almost fifty and i've been this way for almost thirty years we do for fun you you never ithese questions i do not i do not get im i do not understand him i do not ye i gen ask that sometimes when you for finesar listing off all the self podcast in reading ri workin o i but some of that resinates but i think what is truly unusual about what youre describing your process is that from go it is hard yet and i have to ask was being three hundred pounds having a sent i'm using the word to you have described doit you have said it before you had a tendency at one pon your life early on tell lies trying get peoples approve vi y assoff crazy hair cuts and tension seeking and and yet all of that triggered something that now is youis extraordinary right do you think those hardships we are necessary to flip the switch i w'll knot there er necessary but it was something that made me feel i dan't feel good it was easy the brain that i was given as a child it was easy to go home and think about what how don i want to be a freet to day how do on my up to school to day and be a frek it didn' require me going home and open a book up safe scold take me all year to learn thi fucking page instead of learn that page i'vl learnd how to become a character and maybe that character that i created that three hundred pound insecure guod that used to fake fake oud ti make it ty agot let me a become your friend let me li to you inti you me type a guy when wen you have any kind of any manhood womanhood a human bein a soulless spirit any i had no i i must have just this m 'h pride cause that is exactly wit open the door for me cause every day you were carit everyday you were a clown every day you open that spanis pook or that science brooker english brookin you you look dat is it looked a foreign language and your sent a word or i start wher whor do i star and obviously was necessary then whor i talk about it was necessary cause wouldt happened is i became haunted by the mere fact that this is my existence an you got a live with that i look at ther for lota years it is i tat back a said o gay i i know it the tex and when you sit back at's fucked up as i was and i had a larnsry list a a table this of what i have to do to become jest a human been

story from what you have written what you set ons shall me deand elsewhere pod cast and utter now especially it is amazing to me and frankly it pulls in my heart strings a little bit i realize as not where you are trying to do but that in the course of your childhood and in eur young adolthood that no one ever got between you and the world i forget where i heard it that if a kid has just one person that believes in them you knoone i had my trials in tribulations but i had great coaches great menterers i attached to them i found them if they did not a sarly find me but i'm realizing that your situation was no one's ever said heh i'mun stand here next to you or get in front o you put a shield up and it is almost you have got these different ver it is all you but there is versions of yourself that you knew cio media i do not know that i have the whear with all in twenty thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen to get in front of myself while doing all this cause i've already

a fuckin dungeon and there is no fuckaway out but you had the fucking key but you refuse to use it and that is not motive ating about that yes no doctor me on davi goness the real life the reagolans is that is the documentary it is all it is already being written you are it right out i'm a share a little narrow science tid bit tho what i think it is one that you will appreciate i'm most people do not know this but there is a brain structure called the anterior mid singula quartex as we point out before that is a nown it is a name it does not mean anything we call it the the cooky monster right but what is interesting about this brain area is there now a lot o data in humans nots some mout study showing that when people do something they do not want to do add three hours of exercise per day or per weak or when people who are trying to die and lose waight resist eating something right when people do anything that they and this is the important part that they do not want to do riht it is not about adding more work it is about adding more work that you do not want to do yes this brain area gets bigger now here is what is especially interesting about this brain area to me and by the way i'm only learning this recently because it is new data but there is a lot of it the anteror mid singulat quartex it is smaller an obes people it gets bigger when they die it it is larger in athletes it is especially large were grows larger in people that see themselves as challenged and overcome some challenge right and in people that live a very long time this area rekeeps it size in many ways scientists are trying to think of the anter amid singulat quartex not just as one of the seats of will power right but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live nower talking and when i learned about the anter amid singulat quartex i was almost out of my seat and i'v been in the narrow science game since i was twenty not of the same age and i was pumpe as i've heard of the migdula er prefront ol quartex its planning and action i couln tell you every brain area and every i teaching or anatomy to medical students but when i started seeing the date on the anter amid singular quartax i was wo this is interesting and all the data point to the fact that we can build this area up but that as quickly as we build it up if we do not continue to investin things that are hard for us that we do not want to do that is the part that feels gog and ask se me that we do not want to do an if you love the ice bath yet i love the ispend you go from one minute to ten minutes guess what your anter amidsingular quartex did not grow but if you hate the cold water if your afraid of drowning and you get into water and put your head under then your anter amids and survive then th anter amid singular quartex gets bigger but if you do not do it the next day or if you do it the next day and you enjoy it cause e i did it yesterday who happy me merry christmas is ras every christmas gets what the anter amid singular quartex shrinks again to me this is one of the most important discoveries that narl science has ever made because it is that i do not want to do something but do it anyway i's r that grows this area and it is almos ay have a friend he is been sober thirty years from alkohol and you lways says the amazing thing about a diction is there is a cure the promise it only works one day at a time and sell you afeter reknew it every day i the aner amid singular quartex to me when i learned about it to two things went off in my head wo this is superinteresting and two i got tell david cogans about this and i waited until no to tell you because i felt i well for obvious reasons i want to tell you hen i want to tell you here well i love that because that is how've lived my entire life i no nything about that but people go mar you have such a strong will it is sumten that you built i i never gotus on a poca one time and its do gos you were blessed the strong mine lik how you tom bous blesse with a strong mine you that is sumen that you have to develop do you built that over years decates of suffering an going back into the suffer that is why a lot people who graduate navy still train thet were no i it my i talk about very openly all time a lot o gods do not go youon't do on go back into that water than went o go back into the hard stuff it may be not enstay anything hard anything hard in life will not you get through it is lik you become a peel dbu i ho pel dbyas won gobout the pudub you camp none when sume suck bad in life this is al n ists they were talking about now very few peopl when to go back they are happy they graduated i realized i'm the same way i do not want to go back i have to go bck i must go bak because that is exackly where all the knowledge of my life exists wats back there an whith your exactlu you talkin about why i now athing about this but how i grew a will was constantly doing these things to now it is just life i wake up while still scks is just life you on't sit back in li go my ga i i have days i do not wy do by knowin wen to do it i know from years of just doing it i that that is that' beautiful this is why i came on here with you you day and i'm i'm glad you are talking about this because human beings need to hear this then ye stop hearing these hacks on this and that is no fuckin hack brow there is no fucking hack yet you may this an that in son is in the all the shit that they yat is great there is no fuckin life hack to grow that thing how do you grow it do it and do it and do it an do it that is the hack the hackest go fuckan suck and that is what i realized that is i realied life that is why want to come on here day ow dom o come on here top o no fuckin pashin in purpose and how to get the fuck out o bed how it a fucking alarm clock all this catch frase bull shit ecause that was not how i lived ot ho i lived i lived i woke up at every human being does and goes fuck man i'm a fuckin piece o ship to day holl the hell jus go work out for me and you fight that an you fight that you'n't over ride it to over ride button it is the conversation in your fuckin hin your head how you do that wel on't have enough these conversations about the real conversation that every human being is having and they have no idea to get out but they do is that ship right there man yeu i build you will how you bild you will exactly what you said man exactly what you said well i feel knowing the name of something anter amid singular quartex does not fundamentally change us but one thing i about biology is that will power if somebody feels they do not have it ri feels the thing that other people have but everybody unless thei'r brain damaged a whole right through their head has too anter amid singular quartx one on each side of their brain every one has one they have to i feel it is just ta question of opening the portol and the portol what i again i bsintisay ten times han forgive me s i thnk people go oh i do hard things i do sets to failure and then i do forestraps i love training with waights i love doing sets to failure i even forstraps but guess what i forstraps i i'll tell you they do not build my antermid singulat qartax i cause i to do itsright anything you to do is not an enhance this aspect of will power and it seem obvious once you hear it you kind go why of course but i think you really close that loop for people when you share what you are sharing to day and what you shareid elsewhere before is well when you are trying t explained the friction is the critical ingreedient right and i think people think all if it is effort well then i'm getting better that is part of it necessary but not sufficient as i say in sine but the suck part the haunt feet being haunted the stick ther're really unpleasant terms ery it is by the most unpleasant terms we have ever used on this podcast e those are the those of the levers those are the gears and without those this thing you are talking about david goggins as a verb right yi i'd sometimes make the joke but it is not a joke right doggins is a name and it is a verb people got money gogins that right right but that is i think then i'm not psychallojust bi think that is what you are talking about the stick the friction being haunted it is the suck part that grows this anteramid singula qartux now why there is many people have fail in this world the figure out they are purpose therre purpose in life wore to i go because to grow that why you may not look me how my daily life looks it do not look fun do not look fn i's a choice that people have to make in life but wate funny about it is even the richest of rich whoeve everything there always ask me this question i feel im missing something ion't i missing shit i'll have which you all have but you never in my life hear me tell you i'm missing something everybody is they are missing this feeling iv found it long time ago i found it right there and that well power thing when you are nothing nothing ant change yourself into something me you call it happiness peace rr the fuck you whent o call it people are missing exactly what went on with dayfirgogins will not you smile i do i do but figur something out that is why i never you never hear me say i mis in something ive found it years ago you find it in the suck you findin this suck and you find it repeatedly in the suck to the point whre exactly who you are most people ar missin something because they do not know who they are they never examine themselves they they have never done this experiment on themselves the labrat we are all labrats but you also the scientist you create your own self most people are misin some cause i much tracks in there i when y iing uss a potential i think that is wor yous out too much to there is much in you that god or ov ther help you believe in or if you are atheest in you that you have not ununlox hat you walk around this gorgeous wife or your great husband all this money gont ie a missin some od because it is bout seventy five persent of you it' still fucking in there still chained up because you just did not want to find your will power did't when a find your soul your will your heart you etermination your guts your courage wit that looks it looks scary your lill scarey laba wen in scary to make up every day and say i'm stupid by wone figer out away to be smarter virst i saym man is cannot do that you limit this box your box becomes small of things you can do my box wening a box yit was a fuckin lil litl pinhole and then tho examine in myself getting some will power some courage it became big in this table but that is what we all do us why one to come here to day and talk you bout real shit not no fucking hacks there is no hack bro i's you against you you against you and if you misunderstand that youve a real problem you real pop i can derstand you misunderstand you run on a street short off fok des neya i can i can get it i get it if you misunderstand the sayime right now to day the problem is you and you do not want to fix it wit the children of wealthy people are a case study in how not having enough friction can destroy a life truetayment e men i goun't list off prominent names in the press but those are actually the least interesting what is probably more interesting as an example is all the ones we do not herabout cause we never hearabout em right they just dwindle and whither or i think there is this big category of people i'm realizing as we have this conversation today that they are not super successful they are not struggling they are successful enough than they never have to that you can get to the point where you do not have to impose friction you even said it r your bank account is in a place where you do not really need to do all the things you do probably not even a small fraction of you nothi right but you realize the stick in being haunted is the o the fuel in the engine rigt and you' be it you' be truly crazy to give that up because you you internalized all that right but most people they are they are good enough tefor them and they do not actually wanto be better badly enough in order to it start going wrung after wrung you do not think about when you build will power and think about hi must i've built now that about this thist i din't kno bouts but think aboutw must i've built everything i've ever done in my life i did not wanted to everything every day i'm a lazy pece of shit and i want the horrest workon people t us the fos plan earth nd i'm saying that very proably cause i know what i do no cocky i'll tell yon stupid and i also tell you the exact opposit of what i've don it is the truth it is the truth magin how much i've developed in that time for but thi's thi scarything why most people do not want to do that it build that will power if youcaus this care it unlocks the whole bunch of things about who you are who yey're not and i lop wo l do not want to go down that journey to discover who they are who they are not cause it is is nout of pretty journey i'm i've gone down it is not i went down at once i go down it all the tine and when you unlocked that and you cannot te turned off ut youll say i yo how how can you have not retired yet i've built all this will power do you think its to let me just retire because my my my neece hurt it is tellin me every morning i wake up my man ot my nees hurt mouth my legs hurt my body hurts but you ges to run why are not you runi if you gans still run they will be a time when you cannot lace them up any more but you can still run is to run when the time comes i cannot run the body will say you jest cannot run but if i can still do something that will power that i have created it makes me do it every fucken day and that is what they do not get whit builds a human being if you start with the small building blocks and before it man you become something you it dause he make sense to most people because it is just who you are now that is why i can still run at fifty broke wiafore ni wu broke down ees and broke down body because my body knows you still cannot therefore i do second you stop the will power's gone and that is beautiful i'm glad you brought that to me because ilways wonder what is thi separation thing now at twenty four years old i tart ditens up t i do even know wit ging to bew it is not for it not and that is all it was was this that this structure anter amid singulat quartex has i in puts and outputs from a bunch et places but you pri not be surprised to learn that it is strongly activated when we move our body when we do not want to move our body i feel it it is li ou davi gog it is the trugur right it real it is and it also has strong connections to the dopeming reward pathway and everyone goes yea dopeming what ever i loves dopeming i'm partially responsible for people knowing a bit more about dopeing but dopemins badly understood everything its dopemindopeming hits its about reward it is about motivation and drive and there are pain in puts to the dopeing centers of the brain no one talks about that everones all you want the chocolate chocolate sex cocene or yet that is all true right you released opening pain release is dopening that enter amid sngulat quartex can trigger the release of dopeming in response to the thing that we are calling friction and that is a learned thing that is something that no animal or human being comes into the world learning we all are averse to pain and pleasure sugar fat do not hot surfaces right but this is a structure that learns it has neuro plasticity the ability to change throughout the entire life spen and here is the part that i think again is is just nurrow nerd speak for what you already know and have done and exemplify is that it people say oh has plasticity you can change it begess what has plicit plastesy in both directions it can grow but just as easily as it can grow it is silly pudy it can shrink right it requires constant up keep right and that answer is not one that people are gen alike ukno they give me the energy drain give me the supplement give me the yes give me the son o proto call that can a make my enter amid singulat quartexs that some one out there right now as going weight if i took transtranual magnetic stimulation and our stimula ye you probably actully hey've done that they stuck a lo wire during your surgery into this structure this actally discovered by a a colleague of mine jo parvesi stimulate and the patients go i feel there is a storm coming and they go alwas it' scarringthey go kno i want to go through it they come off the stimulation and people alike this is the sea of what we are talking about right exactly and it learns the fact that you have kept this brain structure i'm convinced if we image your brain ibe large and it would be larger in two years a year but this is the nodays off rationel cause it can grow and it can shrink i know whats your saying ry now i did not know ino this and i never always taught t i wish i could just put this on papering and your saying it in a way that people can understand i can never put in te words on what id built and the power that is within all of us but you put it in t in a scientific way most people for me he is us crazy it is wha i't talking about it man i know i'm not crazy i know what i had to do to get where i had to go people look it as craze because your people that just if you cannot imagine yourself doing something if you cannot imagine yourself doing some the person has doing its craze because in your mind the logic behind it it does not compute therefore you ot to give somebody a title n the title for me as usually he is crazy heas this e's that no no for some reason me one to be om by a fucking bad in my life i created that n i been tryn o figure out years of my life tryin to explain to you but even though you'r explain it now this is the easy fucking part them listenin to this ship is h easy fucking part the part that why ther're always be the ones of ones it is because put in that practice put put that in to actual work no man no no that is where the demons come in that is where you i thi i i do not want to be better i do not wonter bat this to it takes me better i do not want to be better everybody's that is why was a lot of average and it makes me fuckin mad every day i walk this earth and i see average all over the fucking place and they want to ask me how did you do it i cannot tell you how could you not going to fuckan you not could do it an ni could do it you coul kint you you are ging to continue bin out cause every day you wake up he says lik get the coffee make that make the pankakes kiss the girl kiss the kids you wake up right to work immedyt your mind is in action do not must do that no one ndow n't blame em but do not be mad an you layin there in your fuckin bed and you'r in the fuckin hospital n your seventy eighty nine years on you thinkin if i ddn fuckin do som cause you did you did not do it in't you shid you mayly the great life man but your aways gou feol emptyinside i do not feel empty con which you want there is not one empty bone in my fucking body because i have figured ou the really the magic potion at least to my life tit is vere rewarding i to take a quick break and

at one cause i i know me ri if i miss the one ofclock ding rigt and o my pens not hitting the paper or not typing on the keyboard i can do it rit that that is a self admitted weakness i love it man i i had that for lot a years im i'm know in what to o it that is the haunting part is that i is going to happen it has to happen and that is the fact i der know goed o jofrey carbro not i that is a life i do not know i don' i do not have that iability or i have the abuility i do not have yum i'm not good enough smart enough i'm not talented enough to do that some people are soebonyg be o tart at one somebody onht to start all if you lack talent you cannot sit back and say i startn half an hour i cannot do that i got start now and after i get back from starting i gassed art again an mi get down with that run or that studyes tesson if we wen't good nop i or go back again cause repetition is with is iss what taught me everything you can honestly out work anything but it is that you obviously are very talented man wh i have worked hord at certain things and built up somethings that i've been good at most of my life you are may gathering you organizing and disseminating informationce on the have een doing since i was a look get ase to give lectures at school on monday about stuff i learned over the week ain see check it out but they they took me to a psychiatrist were the same age back then if we got sent to a psychotris abon people thought you are crazy o wan't it ont bexacexactly i'm ever feeling a freak also i did nothave a stuer byt a grunting tick it comes back when i'm tired and the only thing that help that was hitting my head on something shaking my head just why scapeporningwas good caus i'd slam and i'd feel feel good that is not healthy now that is not good or just work the work is what gets it out it is in t it is a or piamar hi und anyway that is me the but yet i think certain things over time iv feel taliner gefts or whatevery one call them but ther're many things that are exseedingly difficult for me and i and i have learned from your example i know that y you are very both humble and very clear that you do not have you say i do not you noc can get it by examining you but i think the way you are sharing to day and the way you shared on other podcast before the'r pieces that really help people feel in to the process of what you'r talking about today were elaborating on it i think a lot this notion being haunted and the stick y i mean of course of course now it makes much sense why you doft want to talk about sleep or rest or recovery cause that is nsure that is important i've hard you say yes you sleep yes you eat yes you hydrate yes you you will stretch er as or what but it is funny how that becomes the viral message that is why s thi fucktat but that is not the unique that is not the the unique message that you carry any one can talk about that do i have that right that you are acknowledging sleep is import and recoveries in pern but that is not what you are about you have to forego something yes i spass sawnes sleep nutriti all this shis fuckan important you i do not have time for some of it to get jikstract or had to extract some how to give you talk about you when you are younger youud you would give these speeches and stuff the same age you were givis speeches i was tryin to figra how to say thu without stutterin and i realized as i got oder that all these things are important but for me to stop stuttering i get bill fuck confidence and spee starapedin t help that nothing ot that i have to forego a lot o shit to be as fucked up as i am to bil confidene for me tis stand in the fucking room of ten thousand or one person and notin bleko from my head down let me look around ot me let me i'm read these paragraphs first and then before i read the paragraphks of the call me next let me just leave the room com istutter its som miserable livfe and that is' one of many things i did besides lying besides being in secure besides being in mature besides bein fat bese is been one the only black kis in my schooze a lot of things i had to overcome to gain confidence and in doing alaw that i had to go alot of it i became the god tot became once ge misunderstood ou only see for hours a day to ours a tday sometimes youon't sleep at all iwass thisan was thisan was this i knowit is all important i cannot sumas got to go for me to git confidence cause confidence is e dotying block of ron kine to go for me to gain confidence an myself this fucked up kid has got you lot of fuckd up ship to gain confidence an along the way the stuter went away and i gain confidence and now my life as lule a bit more there is i's no balance there is no balance it is a lu a bit more what it should be for a lot of people but there never be balance cause confer to somethit you constantly confidence an belief tyou buillin every day and som's got to give and i'm woin to forgo a lot of things to have that cause i know that is that is if you want to giv somebody crip to night tanke that should away from yet i i do not sleep sometimes and sometimes i will not eat the right way an sometimes i will not do this and do that and would ever man but you put me room of ten thousand people in time to day and i'll walkin there thi own with baskmo furgerin here cause i know what it took to be on the stage and a lot of people would not do that that is what tiks hir's a question i'v been wanting ask you since we started and i thought about comin in herein on thing about the weekso head of this and i'man a jus come ling as i do not exactly know how to asked the question it is ask you it is about relationships oh do it madam i kno in myself that my discipline is much higher when it is just me but that is because ad certain things early on but then ihad was a terrible ton barely finish high school but then o when i got serious i got serious by did that by staying away from everybody and any one's who is ever had a relationship of any kind but in particular romantic relationships knows that yes you can derive tremendous support from those you got this baby you can goin yere yeh i got this she said i got this ills great to finish something and share with some one share a meal get the huget but there is another side all of that right that i to learn more about from you which is there is a warm body next o you in bed in the morningyou do not want to get up they also have needs you have got your mission thet people sometimes need things from us iut also oftentimes the people that love us most that truly love us and that want to support us do not understand this thing and they are the first people to tell us listen take a day o and then this whole cycle at least in my head goes off you just want a vacation and then eats almost a paronoia i not sayingthing nice about myself right rio good a or my girl friends can be yet that they remember thay and and support of people close to you as critical this con be friends could be romantic partners whatever but the're also the the knife cuts both ways it can be the thing that can really under mine this thing that you are talking about because the heople that care about us also want to see us comfortable right they wonce he is happy they want to see us peaceful they want ce see is in a wake up from a great night sleep and they want things too right how do you one tangle that whole bit wels funny man i'm unbalanced but i mostly unbalanced toward the family side fo do not get about me i touh being on balanced i get all my stuff in but would i do i make sure that my family has everything they need everything they need those who want to be part of my family some do not some fanmembers do not wont yo part davigotins i get it i got it that is life those youare part of my family i geve thim everything they need they can leave me the fuck alone i make sure your happiest fucks i got go to work and in't mean smoke jumping i do not mean runnin i mean all of it it takes every i cannot have you in my fuckin shit cannot i know for me to have a family i got make sure that you realize i' may give you everything nee we start bitchin at me young as tey ler ang on i dedicate it my life to give you everything you need i need this time right here for me to be the best i can be because this journey started without anybody and i make sure everybody knows that who cousei my life i've been left thing about it i was left alone as long atat at young age to figure the shit out i figured it out for myself and it been very successful for myself no ones can ta comin here folk of my ship that is why i make sure i will take care of whatever you need but every need for me you got it money house my love my support i would give you everything you need that is sad i do it the highest level possible i'm sayin it would genifer in the next room please comeer and say somewhat is wrongge in i frong give a fuk saves you got say then wats time for me to go to work i expect you to do the same for me cause it takes every bit of me to do what i have to do i make sure that i'm very unbalane for my family can be exactly that i'm balance for myself and that is how i do it i let people know right up front i'm nout what you want in a man i guarantee out do you be lot late nights by the early mornings a lot times i get bye by myself thinking about the process that is next o my mind i cannot have aggravation co have this co have that is a lot things i lef no a front i'm very vocal about that some times your lationships work for me sometimes they didnit but that is who i am one thing i did wrong in my life was i tried for many years to please people and i did it at the expense of myself i was leaving a lot in the tank not and when you do that you stop living but the perse thing your life is happiest fuk can you give them everything they want they have te te their life is full but you feel empty and that is not a relationship to me for me ist important that exactly who i am because this wit life made and i'm not trying to change it dbecause i just figured it out i'm not trying to compromise david goggas i would not neve fur ever compromise david goggins there is a me i will not give you which you need in which you want in which you desire but i do not need money i do not e fame o ee shit i give it all the way but i do need is it make sure that that will power its worked on every fulkin day and every night for the rest of my life ctause at's the one thing that is co keep me feedin you keeping you wen you need to be cause onces that will power's gone fhree huns your pound david gogins you may not be look it but i will walk around with it the things aimportant to you in life you must do always or you are nobody and that is how i han a relationships am un to that something i could personally work on that upfront clearer communication cause i i itresinates that feeling of there is something side that is not getting worked out that i was when i'm all my own it is it is it is solot easier but then of course wanting relationships and family i think that is a healthy part of being human to ar obviously you have worked it out i appreciate you sharing that onthink i've ever heard you talk about or people a wa ere they wer an people astar that conversation with ther whyf husband gorfran bor friend n but why you scared of it why you stare to tell a mother fucker your wife your husband who you are who you are exactly who you are and tow was upon my head that that is a problb tha lobas hap in life no one knows who you reallyou are no one knew who i really was i went to a school with your lot of black kids lo black kis dom on being special lops i never talked about special lops of blackkids why i was wonder what i'm not go to fit in that is not what they do lo black kid do not do that kind of shits it whatever i wanted to do nobly knew the real me grown up because i never wonty bo know the real me iw's always afraid of which you might say or how you going to feel or whatever you got feelings you have a life that you have to live it is important at whatever's on your mind you let that personal tere for you are given them the option to be with you wher not this who i am if you do not it that is good man i i got it but this is david gogins is that that honest conversation's very importnt master everybody knows where they stand that person may not be for you that is all good this world could use tha lot more of that up front completely honest conversation i feel somewhatch of the world's problems ar because everyone is dancing around the issues of hikes a lot recently in the news seem people losing their job cause they will not say something publicly you can tell they kind o wantens lik people just i think deep down really crave the direct masters what ar you about what ou knot about but i think now everyone is afraid of kitgetting canceled 's a big dea all right cann' cancel that people think all i cannot work if i am who i am or wore im if i'm not pretending to be somebody else than silence is considered agreement you knothers all sorts of complicated self and i i do feel for the generation coming out cause wredin t have social mediu rigt and all of that that gain just wall off from that there is a real benefit from just not ong attention people love a lie people love a lie i thought ilways owin a person go not i no go about thos own personat lot cause i live in the bubble and people love to lie about who ther not they love to lie but who they not do and that is for me the reas h i'm vulerable and i'm real and honest find somebodyty come out tell me on lyine about my fluckin life an for me to come er i came from and nhow the rest in me i have now you' a confidence you get how i do not care who you god you goo judge me you a judge me wheif you done n your life me being honest an upfront an truthful that came with me finally figure not who i was but all conquering david gogins the demons of david gogins there fore now you is o open book yougare someby look in myne eye that was tat whot luck you are you walk away i'm god broke o no exactly what this journey took to get here and that gives you a fire in a passion that people can call you nigger they can call you if your les be or gay or by sa ci we fuck you want if you put yourself in the fire and you come ot every fluckin day this frest it off no scare to go back in there again come on man your truth is real you come ot every day man with a way of talking to people that people do not have causethere is no truth behind them and the truth is starting life myou sit don ugly merre oum this an this an thisan this you finaly started your life may be forty years old an bou forty years old five six kids wife ut sey you look in that mirror and you say i'm this i'm this i'm this of this i' this what bas i'm not this i'm not this i'm not this i cannot this i cannot do this i'm all these insecurities your life finally started and woce you start that life man the truth comes out big tok you do not care that is the prob most people jist do not want to have that conversation se por wher they can go onstays i the million people say i'm all this an have a good day see e sis isn' piwering very pirin it is the the way we are educated in school but also outside of schoolas were yer trained is human being as these young brains to try and figure out how to get positive ye back from other people u it is were were i lil dogs youp you ave able dog trig i had able dog saw the picture you buld ot i he as shes gray there charly dog theyre an amazing species there are i think of them a economy of effort y or amazing breedscuse me there n amazing breed economy of effort they do not do anything unless it is necessary it is ta co the s act offi it of everyin r t teyy it of interesting t an ther on a heedinness yos now it is true that they will they will die to protect you o ye and it is an instinct ye sawl that wutd costello i'm sure that is al wit charley ye tit is it is an instinct but if they are not in that position if there is no need to exert effort you'r rested yes your bullogs resting for you yes got it exactly you do not need to rest cause act ive recovery charley perfec it is the perfect that is can be your answer from now i to be bre sly does you rescu now he somehow worked it out as bulldog doesnit for im right but were s indoctrinated into this way of being from a time that we are young where of course praise feels good right one tells you hey i that tsurt or goo job to day or nicely done or i for me cause i grown up in a big packet friends grown up and i was never the great stathly was not terrible wasn'n crate at cetera a this bompra a feeling crewed up and you'e just yeh but you have talked about this before in reference to the seal teams we both know a lot of people tat community an the teams component is a big part of it for a lot of people and it is a wonderful thing right but there is a danger to that do note mean hit for lack of a better way to put it from what we only derive when it is coming from outside you are talking about being able to eithere say good job but also just look to one's own personal history and say i i've done hard things and i can do it again and again caus i do it again and again and again you are talking about parrintong yourself inspiring yourself scaring yourself etre all of that from th inside it'r very different then the way were raise which is to figure out how to get the biscuit it is funny man people wone to know how i'm always motivated it is the unseen work which you you says a true statement those are false do not mean hits that people are given you man there is no belief in that these are team work do not me thike i'm out running at two ofclock in the morning one ofclock in the morning in the jim long sessons by myself you that is real i' mable to disextract dope mean the good dope me never

can extracted immediately when i need you because when you train alone and i lived alone for many years and this misery and your able to get out by yourself i cant take myself to such a level of real real passion an purpose in the feeling i did its sume nit came exprect buy mice i do not mean any one hit is fa it is people come to me to motivate them no one can motivate me i have a res an made

powerful as fuck it is real it is tangible i feel it it comes out of my brain as i speak about it i'm reliving every single dark moment of my life to be here that is what people do not get that is what motiv ates davi gogins is un seen work but everybody needs that pound the back they need that training porto that they need that account ability coach fon yes ship and neither do they but it is what we have trained ourselves to believe that we need 's almost there is this pill on the shelf i'm speaking in analogy right and we take it an we get jased up welike ye but there is this other medicine cabinet behind there and it isin us you'r seying them to the real medicine cavnet isin i yes when you continue to overcome and has many obstacles overcome as actually a benefit to me but te benefit is not a benefit that you have to have the courage and the patience to overcome and overcome before it man you have a whole medicine cabinet but tere's no medicine in emalfor there is no pre work out i will not take none o that shit all i god dou i's flip my brain from a fingerin there thel cat that is the good one i got do man i got the row of decks of tist go fuck yourself gogins and oh but you want tit is do that on a day there is nothing i need and this is the thing that people do not get about david gotnens i cannot teach it in a one minute vidio we all have thisability to have or own medicine cabinet but unless you go in there and put the medicine in there it is always gin be fuck and empty ma yals good need to prework out ou i can nee the ile dint coffee will not do con that i do not need i i can rub for seventy hours an a had before no cal thene i got all this wonder for shit that i over came on my own bi myself in the darkness that man what is cold i'm hot when it is hot i whuld ii i can feed myself all the time that is why wen po say man why are not you missin anything i cannot explain to you man cannotxs plainty yoyyo never understand i founn do all has pokcast do i get i love you mad that is why you my first book you did a blur from me that is what i'm here i love wish you doing for people map i cannot explain this i cannot i cannot explain this because people do not want to do this then' want to doce manbut i's it ol know ami get i get jas up even talking about it man because may people think my life is ti oh god is life is horrible i do not do not follow hem y's crazy really but there a good number of people i would say and tha unders tat that actually i think it i what i'm hearing to day and it is really sinking in is that a great many people either parthly or completely misunderstand you yes i got i'll put myself in the parshly categor ic to because i thought it was about just forward center of mass carrot carrot carrot crrot but it is the stick is the thick and it is being haunted and i do have examples for my own life which is not what todayis about bout being really afraid and then turning things around my biggest fear is getting comfortable i do not have as much of a stick oriented approach but to dayis conversations changing the way i think i'm li gu step away from this and think okat there twenty five moral circuits that can explain tell other thngs that david's talking about and what i'm thinking about is the fact that everybody has a brain they have a mind forget the brain the rains is the physical structure but what that manifest what that creates is the mind and everybody has that i do believe that everyone has the capacity to do what you are talking about at some level i also will be the first to confess that i think you are highly unusual let us just say maybe even and of one as we say inside sample size of one somebody whois created this process for themselves and keeps them in this themselves in this forward center mass with the stick battering the back o their head all the time highly unusual but this internal medleson cabinet the youre time bout building up true confidente not neeting anything from the outside i think i to think that people want that they want to be known they are afraid but that they want to be known for who they really are and that you are describing the past to do this and i will say i'm immensely grateful that you are talking to us this way to day about things yeu've talked about before but we are hidden in a little differently i to think very different because what you talking about is a process it is verbs it is all verbs all action and it is not about success it is more actually about keeping that friction dil to ten and that i no energy drink no supplement people often misunderstand me they think i'm big on people gaing sunlight in the mornings except the circadian rhythm and get better sleep as they can et cetera but then people always think they go straight to the supplements what should i take you knw and then tht course people thng em all about supplements and supplements are one piece for me but it is tiny fraction compared to the ethe doing the dos and do nots that is what hi wont talk about that to day that is from gat was hung about this this is it this is it the brain isthe most powerful wepn in the world and is es crazy how a kid that was it real smart i was forced to go only internal external had to go away the external world had to go away in living deep inside myself it was me in this brain in figure nout how this thing works and i's many people are doing exactly that the supplements tho this to that i agree it helps but once you figure out your your brain you become unstoppable to almost anything yet you cannot beat death you cannot whatever whatever your brain's amazing once you feed it the right conversation the right mental neutrients the right mental supplements the right the right internal dialogue at the right time with the right hit with the right proof of which you have done in the past and you send at right to the right circuit do you are a fucking beast a beast but munct again you just cannot read about it you cannot sit back and be a theorist you have to be a fucking practitioner and in that practise is where that becomes proof positive what i'm saying is lik god david gognes ht it is blow in my mind whit is this he is not t crazy it is many people a lot of people hi've listen to me in the right way and they come back lik i'm told yo on board iit happened it happened i ther'll keep going may tor keep doing it but that is it man there is no sun there is no glory there is no curit here is no victory but there is all of it in one i cannot explain it we' ou to people maa but would you get the other end it is something that you are not you are always found there'e never lost any more theresn't men to journeys easy thes n't getian easier but you arealways found wl oll that it is ont a hover on that first set the same way we hovered on haunted and is not it i think people feel lost i've certainly felt lost of times in my life i'm many times and the othere is that thing i do not think there is a nerou science or psychology term for it some one will say put in the comments and say oh yed that is what and said but tak you said we are not tryng to be theoretical here returned t be practical the business o finding yourself and knowing but it' sore i'm safe because i'm in danger and i've been in danger before and i got myself out it always always seems to come back to verbs again i do not have a language for this for once i'm lost for words there is i it is it is about o a process the algarithm and you and the reason here i'm just kind of try to make sure i'm understandin things correctly one of the reasons why it must be uncomfortable for you to be who you are publicly it is because people want us folkis on the running or the swearing and by the way the swearing is is welcome i'll tay i came up through laboratories we are all three people i worked for swore a lot but there was one rule i could not swear at people my gradu adviser brilliant woman i'm fortuning she died early they all died early i'm the common denominator i had that internal lize for a long time ranyway she said but if you swear it people you are out right but you can swear as much as you want that is that is the rule i have it is i can swear as much as ou want ust do not swear at people if you swear it people better be rad to fight right right oveing i can fight you s you can swear me get away wi but the fact to the matter is the yot must be frustrating that peoplele cause i know people o it is tat it is all about supplements and ice bads i listen i supplements a love supplements and ice bads but that is not the full picture they just a gravitational pull t's the swearing it is the running it is his feet that are all messed up it is the fact that he got a triting it is is seal got talkn about that too right and there is a gravitational pull for people and the're missing the that is the tip of the iceburg is what i'm realizeing i'm realizing that to day thanks doway you are phrasing things cause the bigger vessel is all in here in as you said how d you put that in a book iis impossible tis highly individual yet you do it your way yes and you are saying everyone needs to go figure out how to do it their way for them yes and the thing about being misinister's very first rating more then i can even imagine i i came iex express how first ring it is when the cusyin everything comes from a place of o real i cannot explain would i do without it the passion comes out of me is almost speaking in tongues because when you put that much work and people oh ye there is been this bastpall plare this football player this ther no no every thing everything is work everything and peu will not do not believe it when i speak the mother fucker and th in the fuck an in in shit in is that is whit it thook for mek wut it takes for me the anger the passion the the the the jaw dropping just it takes that because i'm not that this hog look at a man what built this guib let us imagine bein in the coldest water you can possibly take ilways go back to help wi with this i hate it the water hated it you send the locked arms and you are in the water all time and they are bringing you in ou the water in all the water when you have this dialogue in your head and these people are justin me off for freekan one men it vidio and you are constly your whole life when youve figure it out twenty for that i got i i it is it is got this fuckin gotin this is jhis going to suck every day is going to sck an live that to be better in i put is wi'm in the water the water's gon on my head the pacific ocean is freezon february co o shin bent thou three heal weeks for you to constnly win when when when this voice over here the real you is sayn it the hock out here go you are nobody you have always been nobody in it is true you do not hear that that is a true voice that is the real reality of david gogins at twenty four years old it is not a false reality and then you had to create another voice over here that i saying you are better than that other voice and you aren the freezing col water that both voices do not want i u can begin but you when han goes from the water to the studying to the running to losing wait to how you eat to how you function as a man every day of your life your winning these battles and then i have normal people who only have one voice never trated the second voice the winning voice is t he second voice theyave one boice and that is just i'm a piece of shit that is all they her and then they judge people me who are out here trying to be better it is something that i can never really it is te fustrating thing for me cause i know i know the majority of people i know et goes on to brink out studied tha my more than almost more than you cause i would not i'm a practition or for you to be a piece of shit and come ut o that you on't just come out of it you spend decates studying youre mine in the human mind on how it functions in good envronments bad environments stress ful environments patient of our you studied all because youha put all this together to create the mine to become successful i hadt't what god bless me with this brain i had ta create of mine it' in doing i figgerd ot every piece of shit human being in the work as i wud i was goin off bu for myself i know why you go on aster gramm i know why you cause you jist have the time you have the time because you do not want to put that time into bettering ones self i know why i misunderstood i mis understood by people who have plenty of time on their hands to mis understand me because they are exactly where i once was withs the low life lazy piece of shit it is the harst reality of people who troll you who go after you they have nothing better to do wit your lives not som after schoolspessful it is the truth by once was that way i know where all comes from that is why it is first ranging me now cause i'm not first ray at the fact that i'm bein trolled i'm first if o ffact that ou'll ave the courage the courage to try to be somebody better than which are not and that is the first rating part it is interesting because earlyer we we talking bout relationships and you said in in a very candid way and i really appreciate you sharing that that you make sure that the people close to you your family has everything they need right and that they also understand that ou're ging to take what you need to continue to build you right period period in some ways it seems you also included the general public in that family you are saying listen i might give you what you need o man give you as much of myself as i can except i'man a stop right at the line s right that if i were to cross it is going to prevent me from continuing to build myself and by the way this relationship only exists because id do not cross that lines right and i think as much as there are detractors out there people that try right i mean it

talkin financial success for me to continue to having that will power the second i just become a speaking monkey and travel around and speaking gigs twelve months out o te year put campson do this put on lectures et supplement lines and do this and write more books an shit i'v ruined the exact thing i worked on my entire life and why i did not know it to the day but some always told me this is a very very very perishable skill this this will power that you have cause i do have a will power that i have never seen it an by my life is a haunting force that is keeps me going and i know that that is my strength if you have that that is worth every dime ie vever made in my life is ta fact i can look a man the eye finally nev real conversationwithout going this cause i'm lion or i'm a piece o shit or i know how person in many people do this shit the're talking to you on who they want to be the're lying to you and they walk awetdin us only times you walk away god man my kini tell the truth why ta help can i just tell him the truth no good o fillsh me now look at you in your eye and every man at a man i see cause men will not get this women will not get this man to man that mans shit you look anothe man the eye and that everything your fucking saying as real and it comes from a real working place some that you earned it is the best fill in the world you can say that actually happene yet i know wit certainty what i'm saying actually actually happen who i am and who i say i am i am no more lies no more skirtain the truth no more bolshit and that is worth every dime av ver made in my life and i is i swear to god on that thevery dime i've ever made in my life building who ie built i cap success because i know that if i ever go twelve months out of the year and oll put several eve ry day i'm going at it but several months outer your i go right back to grounds yero whis means i'm just fuckin david gog i's no gogins no carry boats fuckin logs buls yet it is just pick up that fuck an pullastyan dig hey get that fuck an pump walk down a mile put into fuckwar masteas beaten you are dis david gogins you are nobody cause that is where my growth is that is where my will pawer comes from and that is worse days that is whem my talk to you now and thand that can no talk this to people oft tilk was cot pasticause itin't there ita' there ther're ther're be gors a taken some ship m thirty fuckin years ago i'm been going si taken ship fr an hour ago hour ago come on mat is this be real and i cannot be on these pa ces they cannot talk o anyby witout be real i'll go away it is go away caus i i i cannot give you what i want to give you you said perishable skill i think that is another word said a word to in a high light ca skill implies behaviour and when we are just talking a second an go about the deep true beteroc sense of confidence that comes from lookin some one in the eye and telling somebody something you absolutely know it is true because it happened you are roing about actions not telling mout perceptions you are not talking about what you believe happened it happened andthere is something really concrete about actions and that is what interesting as were tie about the mind but actions are the manifestation of the mind and i and the stuff that just stays in here people die with that it does not go anywherre i i long agow somebod he said tat i forgot what the context was was a norw scientists he said most emotions ther're just emotions theyre just in there but you do not have to do anything with em and i think certain motions you want to do something with right buti thnk people forget this they feel miserable they are going to dissalt an to puddle of their own tears no one ever died from an emotion right but they feel that they overwhelm us as if it is a tidalway that is going to pull us under and drown us it is interesting to me because i think what people the simpt you have a gravitation for people can feel the energy i think yas your either completely badly or partially understood there is only one geye on the plant that truly understands you i thin there is one woman genipher who probably understands you as much as any one's going to and then the rest of us are kind of grasp and tryin to figure it out right but you are sin go inward first go inward and then it is actions inward an actions at the inward piece is something i'd tou to spend a little by time on because there' couple characters from history people that we are in concentration canmp nelson men della a i'm not sure he had inster grahaman there 'n prestering did not and i do not thin there was any one coaching im on hay you are ging to get out some day and actually you areging to lead an entire country i'm pretty sure that is not how it worked he had to find it here he had to find it between his ears right and there are other examples but that is a an important one the process of going inward does it for you and here i will ask for suggestions cause i think people want there are those of us who want to build this skill right wall yourself off town off for big portions of the day perhaps texting off requests o this to that any one that knows you knows that we have communicate a few tacts but most of it comes through a filter she is grat she knows you and she knows how to protect your time and the hurstup was feelings be i get mad a a ed god bless god bless you gan for cutting oneself off when you are in there you say it is just you and the voices that come up are not pleasant and then it is some point it converts to action ok how much what is the process of picking the action that is the piece that i feel wee there is a a bridge to build here if you can if you would sto the action me s what is next yes or what me when you go go to sleep at night when that happens you kn wha you areging to do the next day it is preplan yes oe yes is t it is always the same thing you are not building it on the fly no nothing on the fly nothing in how works internally for me is i'm i i put that exactly how it is i'm an artist and every dan point i'm i'm painting morallys everyday and buts ta different one 's not the same paintin everydy i wake i bon o do the same thing it takes a different way to get there s every day my my i'm going through my mind i'm jistlike and a good painter wor not just pare not and e's to create and you cannot create wi phones and everything going around you you got it block yourself off you may do too py castin to yere you block yourself off and you are and you are painting this thing inside and you are going through all these different colors of paint and everything else and you can only figure out the right painting if you spend thet correct him on a time in your brain every single day i'm learly goih o min and i'm painting i'm creating this this masterpiece then master piece is always myself and but to do that you can not have any distractions because if you are talking to an artist and he is trying to think about the next painting you cannot som i is impossible to listen to you and listen to which your mind and bidy are telling you we must do you will not do enough of do not do any of it your they on't have passion that they passin drive determination because you have not spent time with yourself yyour mind will tell you what is next but you have not spent the time to go i thet me dis figure this out you are looking for let me go go this and let me gogle that and let me you ni can to find it there because there is things of people in this world and they are all supposed to be individuals we have a packmen tality it is for you fuck and lost why an i unique i'm been exactly tho fuck o spose to be i am false shid in mi did fallo shit i' everybody else the second i said o cay man hang on do you do not this you do not this you do not this who are you david gigars who are you supposed to be morack'lously all these things just i i couldn' even the the list of shit i had to do just whol fuck i'll ca whow whyce you sit dowt yourself ase catan will not be michael dorn or jim brown that bok beron my birthdayside i looked at the birthdays heyll might may me be won i cannot i'm going to be david fuck and gogins and that looks this it dis came everything flooded every single day of my life there is a different thing that comes up the have to do but no one knowst what to do because everybody elseis following steps the republicannot democratic parties i'm not political neither am i at all for this reason republicins in vote republican democrasican a vote democrat you not even a human fuck an being grow nowow you fuckers agreed all the same fuck as shid and i know i do not once you figure out yourself and who you are all the answeris come every night u different painting is being painted and it is a beautiful painting for myself mike cokett thus tus it it may look the same to most mother fuckers but the in result is very fuck and different that is why my longe i if you look it what i've done in forty nine years it is more than morst people every doing the cause they were a race car driver that is what they did they drove a fuck an car it is great i was all kindo shid because that is exactly what the painting was saying to do for the mind was saying to do once thaing to drive across o thin that race carg i'v kno what tific do they ye he me tire some begt e race car driver and thee lost throu how are you still on't get it you you never going to fill your list but you' never found you list cause it never was presented in front of you because your head with clutter with shit cause you never just stop for lots o minutes lots of years an is taid is me in you tet it go and it is maam i's right there right there i'm not a psychologist as i mention before but i'm an adventure a hypothesis here i think that you have masterd the procis of internal dialogue but when i say dialogue i think most people think o the the inner voice that the the chatter but that is just one half of a dialogue at dialogue is a to was street i completely agree cause i know from experience that when we go in werd often times we hear things ind fore really onust with ourselves is in think about that or that no and then we start looking out word are we start trying to shift our attention and distract and the're millyon reasons that are handed to us excuses and seemingly good justifications to be able to do that but dialogueis a to ways street and it hit me while you are just saying what youare saying i was paying very close attention and i realize dae dogueans is talking about the voice that comes up including the terrible stuff that no one wants to hear about themselves from themselves but then he is also got the dialogue down where he knows the countervoice he goes yet you are right and ao men to do this or maybe no remember this you are in a dialogue a to wag dialogue in there not a one wage chatter dialogue there books written by famous psychologist about chatter trying to shift your internal narrative you are bring me internal the internal narrative that is what going in ward is about but it is not one voice again thes a hypothesis i'm not claiming to be all knowing lord knows i'm not all knowing e but you have master the dialogue an if the three voices strong medium and weak in there you are you are let us all come to the table you have got i symphony of voices in there that are all you that to be you and how to have those commerse you are not afraid to be in those conversations and then whach what the outcome of that committee decision is and you put in ito real world action and the world only sees the action isand only you can know your dot internal dialogue and only i can know my internal dialogue and the only way that cordinco know it is to spend a hellof a lot of time there it is right ok a lifetime got it a lifetime i think about it for me to be sitting here in front of you you are not going to call three hundred pound equal lab guy to comes here you mit ot know maybe probably not i be not thig about this wel we teach people is kind kindness to yourself do you think if i taught myself kindness and i agree with the gosswing people swing people take me out of contect this ridiculous take a hiry fuk you want to take it when i's three hundred pounds re think that conversation agot me if i spoke kindness to myself i take where agets me right back to seven eleven another box an many chuck af do not us in the chuckin mookshake that is the one voice that is the one voice that most of us have it your talking about if you never conversation in there the other voice that you create that sad a key how does this look loos very ugly that kind conversation for me went away along o time ago which is why the dialogue as now which you see a lout of action because most people have inaction tause thi's one person talking and that one persons always lean you down the same path the path that makes you feel fery comfortable and happy with yourself the second you create that the voice thure's conflict jus battles tis wors just thefeat one thing i learned i taught myself this and people gt i do not understand wish your sayin ont try to brick it down wer qrick i did not teach myself victory first i taught myself failure i taught myself how to fail an you bu that' depressing is it when you three hundred pounds and you cannot read and write and you'r fucked up gon me times you gin ta fuckin fail on that process if you will know how to fail there is no victory i never talked about win could i knew the path to winning was gould be years to failing first i taught myself how to fail properly doon't teach you how to fucking fail but if you are going out for insurmountable fucking ots that make absolutely no fucking sense a black yet that cannot swim threis upon to be navy seal o ge you better teach tify to fail first because if you sittin failure for too long you wene never come out of it the first part of my success wer's learning how to fail properly and then yeventually i thought to gin a feu victories but that is what people do not get when you have buried yourself wit such a deep fuckin hole you better firs talk about the failures you can have first and tashion that other voice comes up it tells you we got do somebot also tells you boy i'm lok a live your gogins you are in for a fuck and clime bro you are going to get your ass handed to you made fun of the outside noays the inside noise both voices are to be fuck and telling yo to go fuck yourself you are in for hell brow i am soberlon fail this is what you mean when you say that whatever anyone says it is insignificant in significans fuck right it is the cab gun fire because it is just it because the voic in your own head is is far worse that the then i should say sorry one of the voices in your head yes i won being very detailed almost surgical about that because i think to thing about inner dialogue we think is one voice yes you are making it clear it is many voices it is and the thing about is yu you you have to be really ind sometimes all the voices are telling you the wrong shit man but through years years not apocast or listening to a book o rean a book years of sacrifice of suffering of diligent ten point fucking work on whicth you want to do for yoursel not oh let me jis do will punch to shit let me i want it be in every task possible no ten point what i want to do with my life what happens this you have all these voices tha telling you your fucked up and this can be hard but for some reason you put much practice into you that you can ignore every one of em that telling youyou not enough uck can make it and still be able tifuck can make it because you have put to practice in that this is the process it is sus a daunting task that all the voices are saying no but you still have the conviction that i know i can do this and that is what it took for me to get hear twenty thirty years ago i have this thirty five or whatever was thirty till twenty five years ago pipe drin and ever since then every voice was your fuckan not but when you put that practice in every day you lace them up and i'll mean run it is just ta medaphor for life you lace the mother fucgers up every day pretty soon you wen pretty soon you 'rl fukemen if you other currers in the heart in the dedication in the mind that everybody go fuck themselfs i know what i know i've listen to myself enough to know i know what i know none you can hear what i'm here and that is what peoplen't do enough up they do not listen to their journey they listen everybody else is s it before it i'm crazy but bw fockan crazy why'm y successful how that happen how misguided miss in focked up and do not listen to him why am i the only oneted to hold much a shit why am i tro blazer why how is that palsi how can you be focked up and also self made the same fuckn d idtno no obviously you are not looking tat the truth in front of you the truth in front of you is at sucks it is painful it is fuck in min noming and that is the truth and that is why a lot of people do not listening to me cause this is what it tiks creatin another voice it is sometimes going out alone all the time goinng alone cause no one oo believin you that is that what i'm about to say is not conjecture and i can say that with confidence because i did a for episode gets series with a brilliant psychitris the ginine palconti from trentony is a stamford harvard trained guide i's also got last street no mes that his own hardship real hardship he is brilliant and he said something that i'll never forget which is we think that the the forebrain the part of our brain that create strategy et cetera is the supercomputer he said sy the supercomputer of the brain is the is the unconscious mind it is the part of our mind that is cuht controlling most everything and most people unfortunately do not do the work to understand how they are unconscious is controlling them and that is the scary thing the idea your mind is controlling you and i'm noccin gain to the free will debate i believe in at least some will i believe what you are describing and this internal dialogue i think you have access to your unconscious mind you have by listening to the dialogue going inward we know this is true in sleep in dreams in meditation and just by shutting out everything else shutting out all the external noise which is filled with things that pull us tways noise makes at sound bad but it is it is the gravitational pull of all the things that is allow us to distract ourselves without knowing that en was the ice cream the havacooky the merry christmason the unconscious mine this huge piece of the iceberg underneath that paul calls the the supercomputer he saying that with knowledge as a nurabile jus psychatra psychologist an he really knows that is the piece that if one does real introspect ioe calls at the cupboards you got a look in the cupboards and it is often really scary what you find in there and most people are just only one know the cupboards are there bt you are pulling all the cupboard door is open and then you are and i'm you are extremely deliberate with what gets put into action you are not just going all on t piss ofm an act pest or i'm tired some on ac tired it is you are picking very carefully what to do and that is a process that ii'm guessing came to you does it come to as a boukey it makes sense why running make sense it makes sense why smoke jumping make sense it seems a huge portion of your time it is spent understanding yourself and making sense to you and when people do not understand you it is got to be extra frustrate yes cause most peple do not understand themselves they we are ll running round going you are this and you are that cause most peoplere just unwilling to look inward but i'm including myself by the wan right i man i've done na fair amount of introspection but i'm inspired to day that word inspired but it is true motive aded to start going inward further cause it is scary it is we do not know what is in those cupboards and it is terror fine yes especially cause we do not know and those the first ones open up and you talk bout you got go through se cupbers i do spring clean every fuckin day in those dark cuberds those tho those dark cabnits and won just i wath first that is the rul me man that is the rul me that is whyde i i'm not ashamed i do not hide i use to hide i'll hiny more he is exactly right i i do not know all the fuckin science behind shit i kno what i knw thats whon't listeny by any more i'l nistn' a sheft thy most yeu were foolish shit cause i know i know the deep tart secrets of those fuckin cupboards 's ugly man an every day i'm talking to m everyda clean im i i'm clean them ofm talkin to the same deem as that came out of fuckin cupbers at th as i'm cleanng em sometimes to go right back in hem again it is not easy and this is why most of us jest bi im misunderstood because but comes out of those cabinets then i'm cleaning sometimes they see on instegram something thin they will see in the packat somethim they seen this one i turn people off open up your own cabinets and then go talk about it le me see how pretty it looks a mes ow pretty you sound let me see how put to gether your words are i bet you a fuck or mother fucker comes out because for you to go back in there again to clean the same fucking cab that thit deem they came of take some big balls brow to do it every day of your life to go back in there in spriing clean every day not once the fucking year once every deckade every dy agis dusty and every day youon't start with the with ther victories you do not go all this is nice lhin a out lookin my i love me wha me clen up this little dusty not i go right for the things tht could keep me buried i go right there first cause if i do not clean those out first the day does nt start what you sayin to me it is truth and a told you man time to dt i can never figur out howit is explain thi shit to people because i'm not norow nothin i'm thist the guid that said o ket we got a start in the dungeond and we got a stay here for the rest of our lifes for you it become successful the dungeon is the place that has to be clean and it is the scarious place to be that is why i'm mis understood cause int speakin from the dunchin that is why i am successful cause i go th everydamn day and that is the truth whit he says i's exact truth thost cabinets are fucking dusty dirty and scaryas shit broken glass bi in dark spiders cob webs but most of all your biggest feers the biggest things that put you in the fuck the place you are to dayr in there we all that is keepm shut oun to lock him up at lythat never happens for we never grow you never improve you never have real conversations lik could havehim right now never never o no no no no no no less not no no no less not go there i talk o many people who teme ing that let us talk about this caus they will tell me but they canonly say t once and theyll say it in passing they will not git deep in the weeds with it you cannot jist clean it mo fucker

talk ye wdo not have that your boys right hon's be tat right scaries shit is scary as shit but makes you who you are supposed to be and that is the test we forgit es we think wes gos to breathe ere and have kids and pay the bills 'n shit and but what is wat's this life about the mao since wein' test it my friend tests come when you have not studied test come when you think that you are in the great place dust dust to test the test is every day your life and most of us fail because we do not know why we are here cause we do not go inward to st you came you lot o shit to fix man nd this test sucks then you start thavi goggans i'll think i could add to that i know i cannot thank you for sharing what you shared to day ie as much as your process or any one's process cannot be completely understood from the outside you gave us a real window into this thing this process that you was as you said god put it on you i believe in god to people can believe what they want but iat somehow you are your life god gave you these challenges early on and than there was a point where you went in ternal and you said you developed a skill but it is a perishable skill yand you clearly live in the process of opening those copboards reopening those copvoards tryng to s bit shine those copboards understanding that there never ever really done but that you can gain ground on them ar you can win day after day after day and you really shared a lot of concrete things that i think be i know people are going to be able to apply if they choose and i agree with you i think most people wil e li wo itwas a lot teavy i think i wanted just cun i bake myself in net flic and cecks mix yinstead but there is also the reality that therre men and women boys and girls hear that and go oke and start crack in the the cupboards open and i i just know that for myself i'm extremely grateful that you are willing to put it all out there you are brutally honest prudally authentic that word authenticity gets thrown around much and i can tell you that for me and for everybody else that is what really what resinates whether not you want two whether not it is the purpose behind er or not you are lighting the

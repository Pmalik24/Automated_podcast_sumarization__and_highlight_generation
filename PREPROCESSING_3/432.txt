welcome to the hubermanlapoa science science pace to ne or i may druhubermen and om a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor rondopatrick doctor patrick is known to some of you as a podcaster and one of the premere educators in the landscape of mitacondria metabolism stress and other aspects of brain and body health her podcast found my fitness is one of the premer podcasts in the world for disseminating knowledge about how the brain and body work and how we can use behavioral tools micronutrience supplements and other protocals in order to maximize our immediate and long term health doctor patrick did her formal training in cell biology exploring the link between mitocondrual metabolism a poptosis which is naturally occurring sell death which is a healthy form of sell death that occurs in our brain and body throughout the life spin and cancer biology she then went on to do postoctral training with doctor bruce aims investigating the effects of micronutrience meaning vitemens and minerals and how the effect metabolism inflammation d ana damage and the agent process she has published landmark review articles end primary research meaning original research articles in some of the premer journals in the world including science nature sellbiology trensin cell biology and fascid indeed doctor patrick is in expert in an extraordinarily broad range of topics that impact our health for to day's episode we focus primarily on the major categories of micronutrience that are essential for brain and body health i have to confess that wefore the discussion with doctropatrick i was aware of only one of the categories of micronutriens that we discuss and you will notice that i am rapped with attention throughout the discussion and i think that you will wantava pen and paper handy because she offers not only a very clear understanding of the biological mechanisms by which other michronutrians operate but some very clear and actionable tools and items that we can all embark on if we are to optimize our brain and body health we also discuss behavioral protocols doctor patrick is well known for her understanding of the scientific literature on sona and the use of heat and cold for optimizing things metabolism longevity cartiovascular health and i'm delighted to say that we discuss that as well end how behavioral protocols can interface with supplement based and nutritional protocolth i'm confident that you will learn a tremendous amount of information from doctoro patrick much of which is immediately actionable and if you are not already following and listening to her excellent podcast you will absolutely want to do that its found my fitness dot calm is the website where you can get access to that podcast its also on apple and spotify and utube as found my fitness doctor patrick also has a terrific newsletter that i recommend signing up for its found my fitn is stock calm slash news letter is where you will find it and it includes research on fasting my chronutrian sleep depression fitness longevity and far more along of course with actionabl protocals i'm please to announce that the huberman ladpodcast is now partnered with momentous supplements our motivation for partnering with momentus is to provide people one location where they can go to access the highest quality supplements in the specific dosages that our best supported bi the scientific research and that are discussed during various episodes of the hubermen la podcast if you go to livemomentous tock calm slash hubermen you will see those formulations i shoull mention that we are going to add more formulations in the months to come and you will see specific suggestions about how best to take those supplements meaning what dosages and times of day and in fact how to combine those supplements with specific behavioral protocals that have been discussed on the podcast and our science supported in order to derive the maximum benefit from those supplements and many of you will probably also be pleased to learn that momentous ships not just within the united states but also internationally once again if you go to live momentous stoc com slash hubermen you will find what we firmly believe to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages and the best protocals for taking those supplements along with the ideal behavoro protocals to combine with the supplement formulations before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general puplic in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsers of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've een taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that t helps me cover all f my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gup microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you to triath letic greens you can go to athletic green stoccam slash hubermen and claim o special offer the will give you fi free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of datand ow showing that vitemand three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in viteemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athleti greenstock cam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfry travel packs and the your supply of vitemendy three cat to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and patassium but it has no sugar i've talked many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolites for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proparatioes all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and ifhydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you'r getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dot calm slash huberment and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element e dot calm slash huberman and now for my discussion with doctor ronda patric ronda welcome thas been a long time coming even longer than because even before we discussd you coming on this podcast as aguast ie been watching your content for a very long time whon a start off i think thank you you we are the spirit to break through from academic science to public education i consider you first in and a the rest of us are just in your wake thank you for that that is been oh that is kind thank you think he semites iit is absruly tran souk thatit to be here having you convetatioe with th you it is absolutely true if anyone a does there research they will realize that the statement im just made is absolutely true and there is not even a close second any other public facing a educators that have formal science training and a do regular posting of content came in several years after you initiated it we are all grateful ut i have many questions but i want to start off with ey kind of a a new but old theme that you are very familiar with temperature is a powerful stimulus as we know for biology and you covered a lot of material related to the utility of cold but also the utility of heat and as i learn more and more from your content and from the various papers it seems that there is a bit of a a connundrum in that cold can stimulate a number of things increases an metabolism brown fat et cetera et cetera o fl you will tell us more about those but heat seems to be able to do a lot of the same things and i wonder whether or not the discomfort of cold deliberate cl ld exposure in the discomfort of heat might be anchoring to the same pathway would you menturing with us a little bit about what happens when we get into cold environment on purpose and what happens when we get into a hot environment on purpose and hoping that this might eventually lead us to some point of convergeont understanding if you would i would love to let us take a step back and i think you brought up a really important point here and i think that point has to do with the intermentant challenging of yourself and and whether that is through temperature changes cold or heat or through other types of stressers physical activity or perhaps even dietary compounds that or found in plants these are things polyfenales or flavenals humans were you kow we evolved to intermittently challenge ourselves and before we had instrecard where you could basically just get your fruid delivered to you before the industrial revolution occurred we were out hunting and i say we not us humans we were out gathering we were moving m and we had be physically fit you could not catch your prey if you were a sedentary slab right you were moving and you had a leg picture berries you had a move and physical activity was a part of every day life and toloworc restriction ere intaminite fasting was also a part of it s is another type of of of challenge we we did not always have a prey that we cat or may be temperatures were such that there was nothing for us to gather right food scarcity was something common as well as eating plants getting these compounds that a mention said this is these these are all types of stress interminted challenges that activate genetic pathways in our bodies these are often refer to in science as stress response pathways because they respond to a litte bit of stress physical activity is strenuous fastings a little bit stressful heat cold these things are all types of little intermintet challenges and om there is a lot of cross talk between these stressers and the genetic pathways that they activate and these genetic pathways that are activated help you deal with stress and and and they do it in a way that is not only beneficial to help you deal with out little stresser exercis or heat its it stays active and it helps you deal with the stress of normal matabolism normal and younfunction happening just life aging right this concept is referred to us hormesas rite this is a a a little bit of chant stressful challenge that apctivates these stress respons pathways in a beneficial way that is a net positive that actually is it has a very profound antioccident antiie flam to response or or whatever the responses it could be the production of more stemsells these are stells that help regenerate different on cells within tissues or r something a tophigy which is a process it can clear away all the gunk inside of our cells pieces of dena proting aggregates you will find that these stress response pathways are activated by a avariety of stressers for example one pathways called heatchock protines and as their name would apply one would go o they are activated by heat will correct they are activated very robustly by heat and we can talk about that but you can eat a a plant brockly sprouts which is high in something called sulphur faintness to say a compound that om is a sort of a hormetic compound or as davids acralices to say its say ze no hormetic compound i love that i love that term i'm and it acta be teachock protines among other things that also act actiates o very powerful detoxification pathway caled and arif too which helps you detoxify things carcinegans that you are expose to willguess what heat activates that what iam getting at is there is overlap cold also activates heatchock protines really cold yes it activates these are stress response pathways and there activated by various types istressers now you areging to more roblessedly activate heatchock protines from heat virseis cold but there is some overlap im i think that sort of forms the foundation there now that is very helpful and it brings to mind in the conticts of the nervous system or sill be wena you only have a small kit of nero chemicals to work with there is not dopamin for a nat flixan than dopeming for relationship and dopemine for work et cetera there dopaming is a ceneric pathway by which motivation craving in pursuit emerge et cetera it just a dranalin is a a generic theme of many different behaviors n it seems that it is the job of biological systems to be able to take a diverse range of in puts even unknown in puts we do not know what technologyou will look in three years but you can bet that some of those novel technologies will tapen to the very systems that i'm talking about now and a there certainly will be other stressers to come about that will tapento these pathways i have two questions relate to what you just said o before we a talkl a bit more about cold tand heat it you mention plants as a a rout o creating intermittent challenge there is a lot of debate mostly on line about whether not plants are our friends or plants or trine to kill us am the extreme version from the carnivor types a pure carnivordie types s that plants er trin to kill us from the plant basdi folks it seems it is more about what is healthy for the planet animals and maye for us but if we set aside that argument and we just raise the hypothesis that plants have compounds that are bad for us but maybe by consuming them in small amounts they are creating the shormysist type cenario then i think we conceivably solve the problem we could say yes a plants are bad for us but in small amounts they provide this hormetic response in their good for us right it in the same way that heat is too much heat as bad for us too much cold as bad for us can kill us can kill neir ons but appropriately dose in a intermitten challenge type of sarros can be good for us thie's ahow i should think about plants in these compounds do you think of them as good for us or as bad for us ther're very shart blade in we want to use them potently i i actually i think that it is imalmost impossible i mean you would have to e nothing but the same plant all day everyday in the lar i mean the byoabailability of these these compounds in the plants they'are attached to a food matricks im it is it is not taking it in a supplement form is well i'm it is it is such that it is it is very difficult to make it talksick now there are some cases for example if you ecabbage and i think there is some group in africa somewhere that they that is all they eat is cabbage and there is a guatrogen in cabbrage it is not furfan it is another compound but ther's all they eat every day nothing but that et wan they get na ya nd the're idying deficient on top of that i'm i do think there is there you can of course make i mean at theyr r types of plants at our toksic in small quantities right i mean tha a i hamlock exactly s del you do not t do not play the same with hem wil but you are not gin a get poison from eating your your you are serving of brochley at denner right i mean it it depends on the plant it is it is i do not these generalizations are kind of they just not useful and i think that a lot of people on lying em in the blogast fere it is it the gravitate towards them because it is easier and it is lot more sensational i'm plants meat and starches on one of those rare ominabrs out there now i ye i feel a thit is rare to bean omnabre but i think once you step out of the social medias as you said the blog of sphere the most people i would say ninety nine per cent of people on the planet are probably ominivours ri and some one will prie correct me but and i doubt the umber falls below ninety ninety eight i think if you look at dita i'm and and when we have carnivordata bi i cannot waiy to see a about right now it is a lot of o qe whele this is a lot of anecdotal evidence and i there is anothers a good there is a lot of a good starts with anecdotes but people change a thousand things at once and they kdo not realize that but they do and anecdotal datas only good writis it is it is a starting point im and we do not really know long term what carnivore dits are n i do they may be beneficial short term im they may u no be beneficial for reasons of elimination of other things whonots right lots of possibilities but i do think with respectiv plants i'm that there is that tha there is much evidence for example sulphurfane is one that i i really because i'm there is just evidence that sulphurphane is a very powerful actibator of the aner of to pathway and this is ae pathley that regulates a lot of genes and lot of genes that are related to gludi thion production a genes thatare involved in detoxifying compounds that were exposed you from our food heterocyclic amines in fact there've been g wa studies to these are genetically i'm these are studies that are i'm genum wide associated studies for people listening athat are not familiar people have a variety of versions of genes and we have a gene that is able to make am hetero cyclic ameanes tebasically dedetoxify it to its not as harmful im and and people that do not have a certain version of that that is doing it well a very prone to colin cancer in increase cancerist but if they eat a lot of brochley and crucipherates vegetables that nigates that risk because they are getting sulphurpane which activates a lot of the gludifon transfer gludifhion transphrs in synthes genes gludifhions a major antioccident in our brain in nr nr vascular system in ar body basically i'm there is there is evidence ot it that that eating things we know compounds that are sulphurfhane or brochley or block brochley spouts which hape a hundred up to a hundred times more sulfhurfan an brochley are acivating gludithion in the brain there is suman evidence of that i mean that is amazing there is amsin in pransm yat ha distarrin in tro i sone masure when o brochley s brouts are different in brochley a mand you just told us that they have much there much richer in these a these compounds note to self i should have brochley s brocts not jus brochley a can we cook the brochley and still get these neterinsr we af te at raw i confess ein raw brochley is really aversive im the the sulphurphane is formed from a compound called luco raphanan which is in the brochley and the ends i'm that converts it into sulphur ofan is my rosenas and its heat sensitive you do somewhat lower the sulphur fhan levels when you when you cook the brochley however i'm there was e study a few years back that showed adding one gram of mustard seed powder ground mustard seed powder which also contains the my rosenas and sim tolyoure cooked brochley increases the sulphurphane by forfol muso thathis is great cause i confess i brochley if it is cookd to the appropriate density a not too mushy but daffling ot raw the ide of eating raw brochley to me just sounds horrible but i ilike the way mustard seets sound just a little bit of mustard seed powder added to the cooked brochley can recover some of these comp yes what i do is i will ou know lightly steam my brochley and then i add a little bit of my carrigol butter am and then i add some mustard seed powder on the top of that andand it is got a little little kick its ust a little spice and if heu do not case that s expired it should have a little kik and because i know people will want to know how often and how much ium are you eating this every day were most says of the week well i had shifted to supplementation with sulphurfane i've i've admitted adi'm admitting right now that i've been terrible about at the pass i do not know six months or thi supplementation or the yane ro yes the supplementation an im and i there is another way to get there is another compound and it is actually called maringa and doctor jed fa he who is really the expert on sulphur fhane i his good friend of mine his found the potcastic couple o imes he im he he basically thinks and mena has done a lot of research ond maringa as well tha it is it is a cousin and it activates the an ar of two pathway similarly to sulphurfane and i've been buying this cooly cooly maringa powder i do not have any philiation with em colycoliesabran coolyquillies the ran that you ave not a tiletion ive no filationt but jedfa he has researched it that specific brand and s it is legti its leget its likes sience bact im an terms of actually containing maringa an activating and ar of to a and i out it to my smothes that is what i've been doing what anwoatd er some o do ranges i horsh we give the usual recommendations if peopl should talk to the phosition et cetera et cetera but im if people are going to what do you take that is always the a et a ba a ta tesin av lite ma ravits seclarian a proit what do where he will talk about what he does im as a way to to deal with this of course everybody's different and should i in all seriousness should u any time you ad or to leat something from your a a consumption should a consult some trusted healthyor professional trusted by you m what do you recall the the dosis i do a big heeping table spoon m maringa ceet an nyring gettin elsing a song it is a deka i no im but for people also listening s why woat i do that you n i mention th ludicio in the brain i i mentioned it in u plasma it is it is been shown a lowerdin a damage in people and n white blood cells a it is also been shown there is been several different cities in china you knowin china thre's a lot of air pollution and i mention that i it is a very powerful activator a anerf tuand i know your eur fromanr of tubit and er too is at your transcription factor that is it is it is binding to a little specific sequence in a variety of different genes in its turning them on i't wear n some cases turning them off it is regulating what is being activtor or what is not being activitor being turned off and im some of the genes are our basically thes these detoxifying pathways we talked a little bit about the gludiflon but there is also one that are involved in er er born carsinagions benzing benzine's found in air pollution i mean cigarettesmo man if you'r save your smoking cigarettes still please try to quietly mantitin your dammin yet o i just ear nothing of the long cancer imutating your dea and hard does these risk hard os these rist but anyways i people and this has been repeated and and more than one study that literally after twenty four hours of taking cannot remember off the top of mi had what the dose of sulphur fang from brohly exextract o broccbrochlys on seed extract was a brochl ispraps extract not the seeto as this sprouts i'm anyways they started ecreeting sixty per cent bensine and accreline n in that sendng that we gettin cooked foodit is coming out their earn coming on ther earn ya why not of smoker and have to be onest it is rare that i hear of supplement for the first time cause i've been you tha deep diving on supplements since i was in my teens a this is fascinating and it brings back to this question th we have before nig a appreciate the answered it very clearly plants have compounds that are good for us they are not just stressing us thei'r activating pathways that are reparative that is what that is what i'm taking away from teverythng you are telling me right and and and that our bodies were supposed to be getting thatstress to have those pathways activatid it is right i mean this is conserved among different animals this is this is this is something that is is su its supposed to happen and in our modern day world we do not have to eat plants we do not have to move anywhere or exercise we do not have to go throughperiods of not eating food because we can have it at our finger tips at any second right i mean we have got this can in drum of we are never activating these stress responds pathways that were but that we are supposed to activate werespose to i find that fastining in again tha drywing a parallel to the nervous system a what i'm hearing you say is that historically we would have to go through some stress some confront cold or cord front heat or confront affor tor or hunger in have to exercise es sentialy in order to obtain these compounds and then those compounds are reparative thai i feel that resembles a the dopamin pathway always say youre there is nothing wrong with dopenin people thing about dopening hits as bad or dopeing is bethers absolut nothing wrong with dopeing the problem is dopaming e specially high levels of dopening released without the need for effort to access that dopening is problematic a line of cocane gives you a ton of dopeing with no effort except in just the drug whereas a working for four years or more to get your degree we will release a lot of dopening and a lot of corters all along the way as we know and it is considered a healthy accomplishment in most cases a tremendous amount it if you we are approaching the spring and theyll be lot of graduations weddings are coming up now that the pandemic is kind s hopefully slowing and theyll be a lot of dopening high littles of dopening are great but only after the effort of having done something in order to access it and that is what i'm taking away from what you are sayng is that we need to go through thes intermittent the different types of intermittent challenge and we can re we are rewarded with particular compounds that ar reparative both for the challenge but then make u stronger it is ermesous really is it seems a case of what does not kill us makes us stronger a what a you mention ou i ad thot one easu sat because please because this has been shown with for example sulphurpane an animal studies you pre condition give the animal sulphur pang and then you expose them to hypoxiare some sind of eschemixstroke condition whatever they do do induce that and the sulphurphang abasically protects them their precondition and their ther at their stress response pathways are primed and when they are then expose to the eschemic stroke they their outcomes are much better much better thand the animals that did not get the sulphurphing forty ight hours before whatever it was and and this is this has been shown in multiple animal studies with sulphurphing specifically in the brain i i know mark mats and ot doctor mark matson he is a often thought of as the interment at fasting keen but hes in your nervous scientists and he im he did publish some work and an talks about sulphur fhng as well'really glad you brought that u a that example up because many of the questions i get on sociamediun elsewhere are about tramatic brain injury and t b i in is just one example aand people aways think o splorts its football whenevr you say tou be ot people ways think football and i just wante just take a men a moment to editorialize ninety per cent or more of tramatic brain injury is construction work at home accidents e football players are if hokey playrs are martial artists are a tiny fraction of the people who have t b i and concussion of various kinds it just happens that within those communities many of them seventy five per cent or more experience those it is sailing within those communities but a cussionis is prominent people are always asking what can i do in order to offset brain injury i had a concussion to years ago what can i do and and it is be it is been a tough question because you really do not have anything for them i mean you tell them sleep well eat well exercise but it sounds some of these reparative pathways a either should be explored in the contact of brain injury or i'm guessing ar being explored in the contects of brain injury yot couple of things there i'm one is that i mean tramatic brain injur i mean it is terrible but it is also it is interesting because it is also literal real time brain eging it is you are able to excelerated and understand i i often think of when i think of tramatic brain injury i think of much overlot between il hermishesease ind dimentia and these neurged anerpresies is because there is that there are there are lot of similarities that there and sulphurphan i personally think ani do think there spent some animal research with t b i i mean and and a sulphur phang mostly preconditioning rather than a treatment im again it is well i mean if you are gon a if you want a healthy life style thing in your construction worker are your r filling the blank that is you knowgan i mean ianiy when the driesin ar i mean you'r out rist to some degree right or bicycle bicycle yah around stanfrd we have i wus say a people demanized motor cycles people deeminize a lot of things but moving e fast through space on a small object next to a three thousand pound vehicle we have lost we have a number of friends of di we no people dramatic brain injury im not again cycling or cyclist but it is im it is a risky sport a by any stretch i'm in taking things maringa on eating my brockly sprouts may be cooking them a less than am currently cooking them putting on the the mustard seed a is there evidence that whell first of all and or if to is expressed in nurans ri those those cells should be protector of their other cells of the body that could possibly gain protection from these pathways i'm well lungs for one a but just even in plasmyselves i i mean i think it is pretty an ar up to is pretty ubiquitously exprass leber i theirs i mean tos there is many animal studies that i've looked at all those things i try to kind gravitate towards human wen is a little little lot more relevant i but but i think over all a i mentioned in a deen a damage lower is twenty four twenty four or thirty four per cent lower and i'm human blood sells after brocklys i'm brockly sprout powder supplementation i'm an an i made a vidio on the sycersiga to thousand sixteen maybe and i think i have the references on there to exact mounts it cannot regun ther tolivity o that s is conomon old tattas to the twenty sixteen but 'm i also had jet on the potcasa and he he did talk about this i' but you kow it is also been shown ind random mis control trials to help treat optism autistic symptoms and yet again it is doing interesting things in the brain and i'm i think it i think it does have something to do with the oxidated strass n elutifi on which would be relevant four to be i treatment i i has not been shown empiriclly that that helps with treatment but as you think a someone could do that study i'm i think that it is should be donhonestly because it is a low hanging fru and an if there is any impact ind there is at least one preliminary side that glutify own is increased in the brain after humans are basically taking sulphurphane i'm which is really for people listing that is important because a number of compounds it a people takein supplin form do not cross the blood ran barrier or they get metabolizing ways that what is listed on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant for what your selles actually experience that is very reassuring im we will not get back to heat and cold in this a theeme that i trid to service by just find this too interesting to to a diverge at this point i'm from from these themes what other compounds or micero newtrience dyou a place in the top teer of useful interesting there are animal studies may be ther hopefully also some human studies we talked about a few i know you ok a lot about o maga three fady acids if you had to do your tat of top three im you'r your superstars of neutrients for the brain and body something we have got one one set what would you put in alongside them ol maga three o the marine o maga three fatty acids o these are found in marine types of animals fish cold waterfish fatty fish i ther's a there is three faty acids there is one from a plant and i'm that is often refer to as ala people call it short apelin lake acid and then thereis i cot i cost a pentinoic acid or e p and doca hexinoic acid which is d ch ya but mas even ous to we ur most ivigal words to pronounce right next an spell a ra next to opthemology which if at you can spell it o i know people who have appointments in optomology departments that do not have to spell off themology a little secret there is tht there is an extra p in there im the away the i'm not an attempt is prno pronounced it because your pronunciation was perfect of both of these two compounds a an you sider marine sources fish sardines caud this sort thing but what about crill i've seen crill oil in tere was a few yoars back you were sent crill is a better source for a mage of threes than im is a fish boil i took some crill oil capsils im made me itch all over i stopped give a selfish olergy no i never think i do not think s i'm not a big fan or selfish but i a oysters a renownian or tremper something i feel fine yo we can talk about sources i'm crill is a im i a source mostly of a type of d ch an e p that is in phospholip lipid form it is a phosititl coline ol maa three fady acid and i'm that is different than most most of the l for talking about fish ol supplements that the different story abit you'r talking about comparing fish to cri eating crill were talking y wi witevery crill are we talking about t supplement that yasi loge oclem and go crill supplement verses fishial fish oil supplement and if you if it fits in the conversation talking about great sources of of omega threes in their whole form ii'e ave bad feeling yougoing to tell me sardines im tmertings ar ar other ther osi anymai hv for exce never the taste and and for the potential contaminats im mercury i think was ont no joe is say i was mercury an i'm joe is telling me about h st sardines every jo broge in was telling that he seets ar sardines everyday an im and then he hi really high mercury levels and is enly shocked because sardines are ouna lo in the fish groups o ther thethe higher up you get sordfish ind sharks really high mercury caus ere eating all the other fish right im but i think sombrands and if you look at consumerlab i'm consumelob there is i s such a third party sad that i'm filiated with but i'll use them ecause they the do lot of analysis of different foods and supplements and you can look ot some of their sardines and they have the have a list of ones that er pretty decent b anyways i'm back to your question about fish oil supplements for is crill oil supplements i the one of the major differences is tha that fish oil supplements if you get a high quality one it is in a triglis oride form 'm youre you have got a glicerall backbone with three fatyacids and and thot's a tach in those ere either d ch or the e p and i'm or if you have a lower quality fish roil supplement than you have what is called ethethelester form and typically i'm the reason for that it is it is when fish oil is purified it is run through this columwithouall or something they cleave it off the glisral backbone and then it just kind of easier to leave it fat than rs sterifying it scosser money you can get at an ethelaster form which i'm is not as bi available and in fact if you do not take it with food you are gong to be in trouble you are nock an absorb much of it at all would you snus on the package and is sican ta say its in this ethel ethel form some offishal brounds will put it on ther webside perhaps on their packaging but you most the time i'm you will have to tage fort on the webside and recall them but i think for the most part ones that are higher and will will markit it triglis ride form and it is not that ethelester's bad it just means take it with food i'm the one the major prescription ol megothres out ther is both o max levaza which is a mixture of d ch n e p as well as the sepa which is a highly purified e p these are both prescribed by physicians to patients with hyperotriclis rtemia high triglisterides i'm among other things the think i'm maybe disregulation of lipids is well this i amazing for people these are prescription drugs thet are essentially very high potency purified o megothrees but they are given to people for lipid issues this the treatment of issues with fatmatabolism by giving people fat yet just a really tis one and ipush home again i'm not carn of work heetoor inthe omnomnabore but but to just push home that u wek one thing that is wonderful that you have done over the years that you continue to do is to move away from these very broad sweeping statements about youn o fat is bat and here is a case were were saying fat is not only good it can be use to combat issues with fatmatabolism and the're youna fats are not just one thing ther many things im an way i just a wone a put a ole highligter in an a point of appreciation there and a max sure thet people are are sensitized to the fact that if you hear that fat is bat yeft task what kind of fat right an here we are talking about these are megothrees o cast the triglistride form can be taken wither without of food and there is prescription forms what i cannot get i do not know if i can get a hold of the prescription for m unless som you have my egglas or i i have a friend with hightraglasory nit the onl folks do not boun shap prescription drugs bu more you talk to your doctor and you say i'm already taking this from i mean i do not howtwork any way what is the dosage that you re commend people get one way or wer another arig i cate tha the dosage that physicians prescribed for hightreless for ets for example is four grahams a day for lahams of e p a of im yes of the a visipa im i think lavazas also prescribed at for grahams a day and im you can you can get either those from your physician my father in law jest got one of hem describing ses we were buying our own to make a three thore years an years as a ca you can actually get thi nhelfanterns can cover it and it is really purified form but you have to take it with food that was the bottom line im i've totally gone on tanguns but your asking more interesting questions any way when normally i ask about mechanism and then i talk about proto calls but in the or the why were the why i mitn't but me aveent gottin thery but i think that and we deffling will get there but i think a number of people now t iys ar just really excited about what they can do for their health and here were i were just raising the importance of o megats rees on than we will deflin get to the why in the underline yanism i think four grahms is im i mean and in fact bill harris doctor bill harris is he is just a one of th the pioneers on will make a hree fadias at ree sir chiev as on our podcast not last august and i'm he was saying that reason afte a chose that was literally just because how much they could get people to take well they they it was not an operand o this is not anything abote that is on say that was not the case i mean it was it was it was just purely cost and you knon't compliance we know what they can get into it a pill the amount they can get in how many pills they can get people to take i'm smiling because aour good friend such an pannd at the salk institute who sound lot of important work on intermen fasting another incredible work on circatian rhythms et cetera a when i was talking to him in preparation for an episode an intermen fasting he i said why the eit hour feeding window and he said well the graduate student who rand tho studies had a partner i think it was a girl friend as i recall hoen' get that backward and the partner said listen you can be in lab ten hours a day but you cannot be in lab fourteen hours ay you want this relationship to work and was eight hours of feeding wendow plussom measurements a men time to walk into the lab park the car et cetera and the eight hour feeding wen know that every one hold holly was ou she just borne out of this relationship between these two graduate student you now had they been single ni was single ll through graduate school or most of it anyway and i lived in the lab if i be me we would all be a intermen fasting would mean eating forteun hours a ay o that was a joke not a good one but i just one may m joking but the poin that you are making is a really good one that the for a for graham am amount is not a threshold based on anything except the threshold of people's willingness to i should take the stuff soh and i thnk that is important for people to heare because often we heare the eight hour feeting window forgrams of e p a a hundred fiftey minutes of cardie and it is really a question of what you can reasonably do in a study i take forgrams oday i take two in the morning two grams in the morning and i take two rams in the evening i take my e p in the morning and i take my d a ch in the evening split them i do im i do not know if i do not think it is necessary not necessarily i'm i just hoppen to by i happen to get a certain fishoil supplement that is separates them im and yonw lavaza lavaza's a great one and it is all an one in its easier whut if sione does not have a prescription i take over the counter fishoil i know i feel better cause i done the experiment a going on and off i take the mainly for i do not have depreshion but i my mood is better my joints feel better mi just feel better u and i to think that my plate lets are slipperiern and the're ther the'r ou no cruising through any little la aobstructions in my my vains are arteries that is the image i have in my head but otey did a supportan that part ya i mean i bif if you are asking for were to people get the wo a litely the bottle and it says two grahms perserving but then i look and it is seven hundred n fifty miligrams of e p a right or a thousand milegrams of e pa it is at half of it is e pa then do i want to hit a threshold of e p a wore threshold of oh m of what is listed on the bottle right on the on the front of the bottle and because my understanding is at we need to hit a threshold level of e p a in order to derive these important benefits i think two grahms is im is a good threshold now i'm the international fish ell standards i fs o they have a websight where they do third party testing of a ton of different fishoil supplements from a round the world and they measure the concentration of the o myga three fadiasis in the oxual supplement because nothing is ever what it says on e bottle and then they also measure measure contaminants o mercury p c b toxins things that you would find potentiall in fish that mre harmful to humans aand they also measure mercury and the oxidized fadiasid these ill make it re fadiasis are polly unsaturated fadyasits which are extremely prome to ocidation please o keep your fishal on the figerator im because it is cloter y they are extremely rines in the coverds an now i know that the the the shelf lifes increased as lower oxcidation ou do not make it herisents right im anyways they measure that and i typically to look for they give you a total ocxidation number it is called toto to no t o t o ax tu totox is what we call it for short and i'm i it to be at the least under ten idlian d or six is rly hard to fine all the right mixtures of things but om people can go to this webside and they can brows through the products i've put together and excelf sheet which i have a a ou to little screen casts that i'm yet to publish press the publish botan on but at basically you have to go back and check and up dacas ese are from different lot numbers of the products they do have up till twenty twenty seven or something and i've gone through and found my toppicks of hi e p a brans and hi d t brans if i were to buy some the one i would choose because of the low total ocidation and the high concentration of either e pr dt now i'm people can go and do this themselves it must take some work no i'm glad to you did the work i i'm going to put up a tweet every week no with you taged untill this list is yelishd on line sarry ron o atmne de i now it is very sidistic of mo but in service to he community yes and now i and i and i tholl five brans from meu iand i try to choose i try to find one in europe in one in canadas to the rat a great selection of thank you you an in that wrther i do not want to do that were and i i trust you ye i try and get two grahms per day of e p yot from supplementation i'll now put in the refrigerator a mood is better i made that decision mainly based on the data that i'm aware of a looking at comparison of people doing that anywhere from two to four grams of e p per day compared to a assessor iyes sir tonan solect of seritonary ap taken hibitors and itremen depression and i do not want to take an ascessor if i do not have to and fortuatly in do not have to but the datar by my reader remarkable people that take these things in sufficient dosas meaning the e pes are able to get by with much lower dosages of assessor ise for depression relief were in some cases to come off to ther ascessorise completely i'm ere a void goan and te the present mendication nof course is is not something people should cowboy f your mental health issues are serious but im what other reasons id love your thoughts on that o yes to help part and at maybe could tell us watersome things that getting two to four grams of p per day i's going to help with in our brain and the rest of our body it is a doyou do i'm i actually published a paper back in twenty fifteen about the role of a maga three invite him in d in depression by polar disoller by polar disorders gets a friendiin impulsive behavior but i'm within that paper the doing back round research in this was overview artical by the way i was as connecting dots enominant on mi grab but i i confess i do not know the paper but it i love quallity use because the references therein are useful well i'm there is a huge roll for inflammation the cause of inflammation an depression and im you n i think we did a short animated vatyou on this as well i hear to go back when i was mean if publishing that work where people are injected with lipe a polish sacarite and mean this is something that were were generating from or from our got mostly from are got permeability which happens a lot a ando toxsin its osrecalled it is the it is anour toxsin lipe opoly sacarates pasically the outer membrane of bacterial cells when bacterior dot would die when the mune sells in our got comeinto contact with the bacteria becaus we dran alcopol five days in arow or whatever ium we release andotoxsin or t something streste us out we released endotoxion into our body and that causes in flamation and you can eject people with lipe o lipe opoly sacaride and cause depressive symptoms however if you take those same coor people give them e p and i think it was somewhere around two grahams and then inject im with he lipe opoly sacarite were establishing causation here i a it totally the depressive symptoms verses the placebel p they placeba with sailing control there is this as a placebo control becaue obviouslyech hugely important for depression am it emiliorated the depressive symptoms ive as a cause by opoly sacarite amazing ps lep e polly sacarite is no joke i a years ago when i was work on thermal regulation a we would inject animals with l ps to induce fever its there is a the vagest nerve regissters the presence fell pa signals to these a prettylar hip otlemicaries and cranks up body temperture because basically its a signal that the body is in facten i aum amazing a i will continue with my two grahams prda mab ramp it up te fort i'm not doing the d c separately theres t d chn the same yes supplement is tht o k yes yt ye and and kind of bet we have we got a lot of things to hit back on mecause your onein our original questions was crill oil verses fish n else and d y y d ch specifically am is it it it is iu know infospel lipid form it it is more bio available ar our bodies if you'r comparing exact quantity or concentration intreglas rit form verses am posphelipid form you will get more in your plasmacells in your plasma pans in your plin your plasma with crill oil however crill oil a supplements are lodos i mean good luck getting two grahams a o magathre from crilloil and also crilloal supplements are notoriously rancid i do not know for whatever we that is what made me it ch all over i think there just i i i i i have not found a good crill oil supplement a i a pre premus stay away for met me if you smellet to omnitious wy it jus smells ranced im but the thing is and i also published a paper on this back in twenty nineteen or ys something that im about d ch n phosphe lipid form getting into the brain im in a through a different mechanism than d h in traccless riht form and it is goi ng through a transportar called the m afest two a transport and i think it is very relevant for people with an apowe forleal i cani with at all timerces s right twenty five per cent of the population has in a little an a gene called apoe a for and basically it it is apoe but the for is is rereferre to as the the the bad conto version of it im this is something in our blor bodies is also in our brainn and it if people have one of these versions if they got one from their mamo their dad they have a twofold in crease ris for all summers isease if thiget too which is much it is much more let us less it is less common i think it is two percent the opulations som he has to illials but they ave a ten n or eleven ful increase rs of all summer disease im there is a roll for phosphelipid form aum de ach in ther rand but you also make phospholipi d ch inside your body and you can do that by taking in more tregles rit forms the two grahams the magic more two grams ar more is the magic number i think kind aback ti the the wi for fishioil and an i i personally think it is one the most powerful anti and flamatory things dietary liestele things that we can we can get easily relatively easily that ium is is gin a powerfully modulate the way you think the way you feel and the way you age and a variety of different types of studies kind of led me to that conclusion aaa variety of wou know observational studies there is been lots o work by doctor bill harris and his collaborators looking at what it is called the omega three index this is actually the o megthre level in red blood cells red blood sells turn over about every hundred and twenty day it is a it is a long turm marker aomega three status this is very different from ninety nine point nine per cent of any study you see or ady im lab that you go to to get your megthree levels testag you are getting ar plasmaphosphe lippid levels tested which is kind of you can think of it as what id i eat a couple days before oh i had fith my a mega thre levels are great but do you et fish that everyweek or was it let was you whent out to dinner im it is not a great bio marker for long termal mega three status it is kind of the fasting blood glucos levels rirshes the h b wen c which is a long turm marker right of your of your blood glucas level the 'l mega three index he is done a variety of studies a observational studies for people listening these yer studies there obviously flad because they are not establishing causality there youow you are looking at peoples life styls but in the sit in the case of a bill harris is work he is measuring something i's measuring yhou' megathree index and he is measuring yo megthree an negs in people and then looking at their mortality risk for example wotheir cardiobasu disease risk a and what he is found is that most for it first of all ar standard american diet i has no maga three indecs of five per cent japan by contrast has no maga three indecs of a round tennu eleven per cent big big difference there and they also have about a five year increase life expectancy compared to people ne us and not you thing that is mainly due to their fishin tase fit an what he showed was i i think it is a bi part of it and men you can oiy say its the only thing but what he showed in his data was that in and i think it was framing hand study where he he looked at the o make three indecs and people that had a o maga three indecs of four per cent or lower close to what the standard american is but little but lower i'm they had a five year decreased life expectancy compared to people that had in eight per cent wo maga three indects and a big difference there right five for five years life expectancy but here is the really interesting thing interd he also looked at smokers and smokers and their o mgathree level since we stratified at right an he found smokers that had no amaga three were the worst of all i mad was it was just the worst right wwe all no smoking mis bad fression will take taking yourself our life expectancybut smokers that had the high love smokers that were taken their fish wail or eating fish or whatever was they were doing to get him up to eight per cent they had the same life expectancy as non smokers with the ello loi make a three indects well right well and that is that is amazing and it is also mazing me that people still smoke sey rente but i see a lot of yull vapin and i i and im and i know a lot of people consume canabas right people up as there been any studies of a specifically avaping or people u'm smoking maruan and i wy all cause mortality n ven't seen thos if i have not seen them h not out ov enough to come in as research subject that was that was again a a poor joke u it is hard to study people o mere want a use unless i'm told by my colleagues ta study the stuff unles you offer people marent in which cay still do it but again there actually not very good researt subjects in all serisasas they are not very motivated or consistent and they forget their appointments that is incredible and you mention that the de' on pollution related to the plant compounds earlier sost almost these things are again are acting in a reparative way the eo maga threes are i mean there they are resolving inflammation there blunting inflammation there thei're doing many different at they had the effect many different parts of the inflammentory pathby which is i think it placs a huge roll in in the way we age that we are brain ages thatgh we feel or mood just ar joints all that and it is it is amazing but it is not i i love fish well i feel better when i take it i try to eat some faty fish a couple times a wek i do want to just touch on foot sources for a moment a first of all are there plants that are richinal mega threes and second by i have some friends whore really into meat and i meat lot o that is argentine but i do not eat very much of it a triny high quality meats and relatively limited amounts by do pretty often but i've been told a by these a sources of a questionable authority that if an animal grazes on really good grasses for instance that the meat can contain a lot of amega threes which in principle make sense based on this will magathree index cause youre telling me that a lot of this a megathre sequestered into the red blood sells if i meat an high quality grass fed meat and the grasses hadol mega threes to my stakes have a meg threes or no a there was a study publish that compared conventional meat meat that is thehe that animals are fed in a corn or soyor whatever i which is terrible ya for animals and people as far as i can tell i'm sure i'll get i'll get some a attacks but that k i will not read those comets the m they again a joke i read all the comets but a the it seems to me that he these animals have to get either be taking fishawell or eat plants that are very richinal megathrees in order for that the meat to actul contain sufficient amaga threes i the meat comparing the conventional meat to the the g grass fed ering a pasture raised cows ar cattle a there were higher levels of a'lpho and lak asid and al a is it can be converted into e p d g am but the conversion is very inefficient and very dependent on a variety of factors including genetics genatics a a huge regulator some people can do it much better others your getting five per cent of conversion to e p a estrogen is a major a regulator of making not more efficient and and makes sense because pregnancy when your astrogen us goes through the ro i mean these will make ts prefadiosis play a very important on brain development seer women are supposed to be converting any ale ay they can into the longer chain will ake a three fa ya saids right a estrogen does affect that but i would say plant sources if you are looking for the al a plant sources would be in a walnots flack seeds those are probablly highest but if you if a person is a vegon or vegetarian their best bet is to actually get my croology wal and you can supplement with my grology wal because mycralogy do it is they do make the the d g and u that would be a better source for for people that ar that are vegetarian n begin rather than doing the flaxseatoil because that conversion inefficiency eno the ansims that convert aleinto ae piantiece aganders it is inefficient and then for people that eat fish im sardines you said i sammon sammon and e efto eat the skin as i understand i you haf to boa it is goot it is rich with with the wi yet and and in the reason i say the i i i think the best would be wild alaskan samon first is the farm ras because the farm rays again they'r feeding em they are feeding em corne the're feeding greene an staff room and then they give em ask o the anthan ask o the anthon is a crotinoid it is the cra ano that is in things cril crystacians that make their red pigment at's also being use now as e supplement and there is a prescription form to try and rescue some age related vision loss because of the the roll of the vitemon a pathway and photorscepters a ya will afterly the cratnoids themselves ludines ese anthan the'rereally good at sequestering singlet oxygen which is some damaging right i tof the tas we age they am because the retnal sells i the i sells the irs metabolically act ofe the cumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species and a might a conduol repair and limiting react ife oxesan speciess is of major a theme of trying of rescue vision i think yao that is tat hat's the whole other podcast an thstoy there is a really interesting data now on these of red light to try and truggar these pathways from means to plunge that is my a good friend of many years and amazing science is glen jeffreys lavt the universy college london i'm the we should talk but that at some point i ni o that study a twenty twenty was an i a i i can thee ye yes looking real i mean noy ther diter cautious ther thei're appropriately british and cautious about it i i've i ways choke if those thadies ae ben done over here everyone already no about it glen is a very conservative guy but they have done the stuff now in in pigs and rod in models and now also two studies and humans it is looking pretty pretty interesting am sardines but also anshovyes i'm an old ike by the way i hate all the food items that i'm describing i can barely tolerates him i do not fish at all i should i li oi i awe shat ant when i was a kid i just do not no i find fish unless it is in sushy form i find absolutely im repulsive and i do not know why i probably have some mutations the raw fish is ectually fire and mercury then cooked o ca will tat's good n do not really suchng thot much anyway am you are giving me great reasons to not e fish i bat except i should eat these other fish sources or supplement more heavily that is the masn o t serdine ma my every day my first mel almost is a canisardines and obicatoo with avcato is good il yo with little be leman and then some little hot sase tis aa cotovo mak a threes i'v cato is very good in mono and saterated tot im it isthere realy high an polyans i drint fat'll make it three really i mean it is it is it is either the the d'achan epia it is in t the marine s orses fish or it is the plant ale source which is the flock seed or the wallnots a it is rough i mean to all these o companiese anour are making these a plant base produts that taste meat my wishes that they would just make a fish that tastes a stake we that is the fish come out i'll by nowthe once at they farm rays because they do not eat any of the i joking i do not wan y modified fish that tastes a stakle thyou know t i love the taste of sake the point here is that if you do not if you if one does not see themselves regularly consuming these fish of these at fish sources of omega threes it seems to me that the only way to really get them is from supplementation and supplementation is a good way to get a a high dose and and to get back to your dos point there was a a couple of studies that that basically unosh i think thereis sut there is some way they showd that people that are in the four per cent o meg three index range in order to get to the eight per cent right the five year increase life expectancy for comparing the two groups was the supplement with at least two grams t wasabout two grams a day a and not and i think it as a little but lass offish treglis riht for mat i think two grahms is ke a good safe number most americans that are not eating lot of fish ndtheyre not supplementing a probly around o fortifive per cent omega three index and to get to the eight per cent and and ithink that is a good empirical way of thinking about at right o he wille i went to get to that eight perset by the way i'm almost sixteen per cent omega three and dos can ask about a about testing yeto were can somebody measure wherein how can somebody measures there omea three indecs which again just to remind people's the sentilly the per centage of omega threes that you have in your blood with the caviat that the omega three indecs will be heavily byus by what you eat in the previous days not oomega three innes o make under ea i thouhtyou said in red blood sells afbi eight sam an two days ago my mega three indects is gong to go up no that was plasma i misso nessot o the pla o most people are measuring if you look at a lot of studies and honestly andr i think a lot of the reason for conflicting data it is because people are measuring plasma o mega three levels og ta the phosphe lip its is in a phosphel li it rights yeare your fhosphe lip its are carrying thing these are lipoprotines i r their carrying things i o maga three in treglis rides and self and shuttling him around am the omega three indects is actually in the red blood sells and red blood sells take a hundred and twenty days to turn over if you are gin to do a baselyine test am if you want to know before supplementing what you are level is you have to wait twen a hundred and twenty days before doing the second tess after supplementing to know how metou you went out because the i that is how long it takes for your red blood sell to turn over the omega three indecs on bill harris has a im a company that he he cofounded is called omega quant and they measure they' mag three ind exs they have a variety of different indexs tast you neu a basic one ore a little more advanceis from a bluddraw it is a little blood spot the ya and a the keysis money to funnel back into doing lipid research lhet hes out theire doing all sorts of interesting studies on a megathres its great but i o the o magathre indixis great o i think that honestly more people and more researcheres should be using yet because i the conflicting daythat alwayit always comes down to what were measuring the sensitivity other it i are we even measuring anything you are you are giving some one five hundred melegrams of de h and you do not see ne effact whill did you measure what their levels were and did you measure the me omegathree indaxid there is all sorts of problems with rana mis control trials and i think that i just we nee to as scientists we need o come to gather and make some progress i me let us all talk to each other let us let us let us figure things out this this test is out there it should be used it should be use not just by bills group every one ye well in am learning much for meand i agree we need more collaboration a've always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations in my lab at stamford and o claberings tos much more fond on lind there seems to be abyas more toits creating sylus as supposed to am bridges but i i appreciate the bring up the need for more collaboration and and knowing which measures are best and the scase of it now thank you for the clarification i understand the o megatre index is going to be best you mention you basy when now and i look you i think you are sixteen per cent omegthre indolphins or nineteen per cent i'm almost is argol you are shine to get there ito do te interesting a i shal they should problery do something you chine achieve the omegathry a a ratio of the the your favorite species a now that we have covered a bit of how to get these things into one system depending on what one eats at cetera and some of the better measurements how is o mega three and some of these other related o lipids how are they having these pausive effects in my mind and this this is incredibly elementary but my understanding is that it some level their making platelets more slippery is that true or not i hope i'm happy to be wrong a how is it possibly impacting my mood is it through thes enthesis of membrane on nurans that allows narons to release more transmitter ceirtone and dopening mwhat are some of the proported reported and known mechanisms i think some of the the most well known mechanisms a do you have to do with the the omegathre fadiacids being very powerful regulators of the inflammatory process in some way shap per form whether that has to do with resolvins that are produced that from the metabolites aof de ch for example resolvins play a role in resolving in flammation you want your inflamatory response to be actubated when it is supposed to be but you woundnt resolve that inflammation in th in flammetoryesponse in a timely manner right and resolve ins help do that and and resolvins are one and then there is e specialize am promediating moleculese as pms that also help resolved the inflammation im there is you mention the lucatrines and prossiglandins and these things are being affected by e p and they do effect platlets in plate that aggregation and the if they do effect that whole pathway as well and there is just and there is t i think tis i many different ways an impots and when we talk about inflammation honestly it that it is a big general term but you are talking about when you are talking about sertone and release im mena at the level of nurons we know that these inflamatory molecules cross the blood brain bearer and he just mention to go about injecting people opoly sacarye in causing to pressive symptoms i'm it is known that that omegathrees lectually specifically e p a is able to help seratonan in inflammation inhibits the release of saratonan and e p a is actually able to blunt in flammitory responses along with 'ce as well d'te does that tresolvins and stuff and this then helps more seratonand be released because you are you are not having much inflammation getting into the brain and affecting saratonan release right that is one mechanism and then another would be well d'the itself has been shown it is it is a very important a fadiasa that makes up sell membranes many sell membrings including in our nurons and as you very well know and ew the structure and function of receptures of transporters these membring bound protines on the surface of ourselves including urons are affected by the membrane fluidity how rigid and how fluid the sel membring is and d che plays a roll in thand for example an animal studies if you make in animal deficient in d ch there seretona receptors dopining receptors they are effected because the structure of them is affected through the fluidity of the membrane and i think that is another mechanism and and i'm talking sort of general cause i'm not an nero scientists nover makes perfect sens si min we know forinces o norplasticity and the at almost always involves the recruitment af more receptors or an improvement in some feature of receptor to ner transmitters and they literally move latterly in the membran the con af float around little rat sometimes they are in fact in lipid rafts and it makes perfect sense at these molecules ike d ch which are part of the structural fact of the nr on because of course the outsides of theirounds are basically fat not just the milin that people have heard of but the actual membranes that if getting that right you wouln't want id as rigid as concrete but you would not want it as soft as mad to come up with something here tsa golly stuff the kids play with it is thet go anyway there is matam is disgussing and its too soft to be a membran for anuron that is oget it in as macine e's onone i put in oss toon put in the comments and tell me whath that discustin gui stuff is a you do not want your nurons to be that duy and yet you do not want them to be concrete either 's abouance it is about nat and in mentioning d ch i'm just goin realize ofm back tracking but i want to make sure that we closhe all the hatches for people we talked a lot about a e p but are food sources of d h that you find particularly attractive either by taste or by o potency for d ch what what are just a few that we coul throw out because i am a i am aware that there are supplements re e can get a nice ra tio of e p h where you take them separately as you do but if i want to make sure that i'm getting nough d ch what do i need to be sure i'm eating on a regular basis well the fish is packaging the d ch n e p in raco o an o but i i also do eat samon row which is very salt and i it is a it is a really high source of the phosphoto phosphopile coling d h that weh ts fish eggs it is yem yet ind actually i hat i for some reas o do you ye i'll eat us i'm discovering somthing about myself am that this is was not meant to be nutrush nutritional psychotherapy but you are doing that for me anyway am i'm discovering that ye i eating embryonic fish i just do not eating the actual fish aciwam o c fish egs are ro ks here havi arbis caviar yes and and that is a good source of the lospho lipit for im and i was consuming not a lot because i wanted to get the phosphelip it form ye i'm and it is oxually really good there isbeen some animal studies and piglets and rodents as while showing that consuming phospholiped d ch i during feedal brain development i i gets wat ten times more d chaining the brain again it is make sen pased on feedal development do i need to injin a bi blugo caviar stuff can get pretty expens of it two undrit all i do not hetan need to i think it is a it is a matter of prophrends and i you if you are supplementing with your you are two to four grands of fish well i mean that you are going to get phospholipit form any yhour bodies can me get o calvs i've seen some containers of of what i soom to be quality fish gs thetter not at the caviar level the confined in in the better grocery stores that are not super expensive i would not dip as low as to go e for instance am fishing bat one or cads we use to go fishing and put the fish egg on the thing that is probably not g all thu it is good enough for the fish of p i only half joking here fogs i'm justrun to protect you from yourselves do not get any crazy ideas about eating fishing bates o ca that is great to know we have these plantbase compounds we have the omega threes s p h and then you mention there is a third category whatwould you place in your third category of o foods or supplement base neutrients that our health brain and wer body health can really benefit from i mean i think the most obvious would be by him int which is actually it stailroight hormon that we produce when we are in the sun depending on the time of year om we can make it in our skin depending on how much melin an we have an eur skin or whether not ering sun screen or how old we are it is it is a very there is a sliting scale and how efficient that processes and the sort of as nersham theresin in verst relationship with the darkers the more darker yuthe darker your skin is naturally the more videm in d you need to consume as that right the darker your skin is ofm the harder it is there wis a study out of the university chicago this a sevelar years ago where they looked at on african americans and om compared afcan americans to o occasions with lightskin fair skin and how how well they could make by te med from sun exposure and im how long they had to be in the sun to make examoutright and it turns out that o africanamericans with darker darker pigmentation which protects them from the burning rays the sun ands a natural sunscreen i had to stay in this on six times as long as someone with no none of that natural sun screen im i think the the the the take home there is im lot of people with a darker skin living in subsahered aprica or people living in india with darker skin or in the philippines of these ecitroyal regions were theres their utendencey darker skin because its protection from the burning rays of that optition there they are in the sunwar and the'r getting work a bit em ind but on people that may be moved to united states lakemen is soda or in a place where a u v b radiation is in getting to the atmosphere twelve months out of the air its only getting their four months for example im or even living in our modern da soside peoples do not go outside any more ame were inside were it are labtops in school were at workmen ore cupical whatever i'm supplementation does play a major rule not only for people with om darker skin that that are outside al the time but for every one sevent per cent of the u s population has inadequate videm in d levels seventy of the whole amaz you what you ask there is every one im and and i think that insufficient levels defined as less than thirty nanograms premila leader im and in that is sort of defined by the the endrican society looking looking looking at a lot of different aggregate studies all cosmortality for example im there is been a lot of different meta analysies of all cosmortality studies where bit him in d levels ar r really seem to be ideal between forty to sixty nanograms premil leader and om in order to get to that level if you are not outside all the ti live in son at southern california we are always outside withoutson screen on i always wear sonscreen because i'm trying to protect my skin from some yu wrinkles mustoff right but also skin cancer is somewhat of an issue as well i'm basically the point is that videm indeed dairroid hormon meaning it actually bines to a recepter and o another recepter r dimorises with that vitem that the retnoing receptor and tot complex goes into the newclies of a sall where you'r don is and at rect recognizes little sequences of diana called vitem in d responds elements ar cl vd aris their specific sequences of diona that this complex vitement you rs that bound the vitemen you receptor goes inside and recognizes and turns on a whole hostegines turns off a whole hostergines im in thises this is important stop imagine seventy precent the population having insufficient to stopsterond right this dair riht hormon which might we might be headed there am but probably not no i think that it is names are very important and i think that one of the issues is that vitem ind is called videmin d it is not called a d g e or very an blov blot it does not sound a hormone i also am glad that you are mentioning a skin as the major kind of interface between the environment and vitem ind synthesis because a lot of people think of skin as just a protective sheeth around us ar something to adoron ourselves with erings or tatus or whatever but skin obviously serves those rolls but the skin is an indicran organ it has the capacity to make things that in pact hormones and to make hormones this is beautiful study out this last year where o the took place in over in israel where they had people get outside for twenty of thirty minutes a day three times a week exposing a am culturally acceptable yet substantial mountof ther their skin a during that time and saw big increases in testosteron and estrogen and this is through a corat in a site linked pathway involving p fifty three that did wontthis as done in humans but they did som knock out studies in perilel and what the study told me or reminded me is that skin is an indicra organ the idea that son could trigger the activation of of a production of a hormone is really interesting a and makes total sense when vitem ind gets into cells and it is ombining to these v d are es es am what what sorts of things are they triggring for testaceron we know its skin atrigger proaching sin this is muscle gro at tendant strength et cetera with estrogen its can be a keeper nerons going your joints feeling good i was remind people that am by the way because gus are always seem to want to increase teir tesocteron and reduce their estrogen just remind people if you reduce your estrogen guis your labeda will plummet to near zero do not crush or esterogen a it also make you stupid am if you are not already stupid it will make you stupid am estrogens vitally important for males and females when vitem ind gets into cells what sorts of things is it stimulating o ifs the first of all itsr its regulating more than five per cent of the protin in cote umin gial more than find tis was n i say more than becaus when i was looking at the date i really in dapt back in is starting twenty twelve to twenty fourteen am it was that and then it is now grown but i'm one of the important things that you will find interesting that i published on back in twenty fourteen was that i'd gone through this this big published dayto base wer some one had ou a published all these genes they found dty or eas in and i'm basically i found that trip to fan hydrocsalays one and trip to faund hydroslays to was on there ans then i star looking at the sequinsinenc doing some insilico work and it turns out that i'm the v darse and trip to faund hyroxsls to fer people listening trip to fan hydroh lays is an enzim that converts trip to fan into seretonan trip to fan is what we in yo meanamased that we get from our food im you convert ceratonan you convert trip to ven into sretonan into the got in the gut but you also do it in the brain however seratonan does not cross the bloodbrain barrier trip to fn has to get into your brain and then you have to convert it to seretonan in your brain well the ends i'm that does that in your brain is calved trip to faund hydroxslays too and it is actibated by bidim in d i'm the one the gut is actually trip to faund hydroclas one i'm some of my my published work hypothes size that at miht actually be repressed by videm ind because it has a sequence the sequence itself o this twelve newclatye sequence it can determine in to some degree whetheris can be actuvated or turned off and i was able to cant look at that and think o maybe this and tot an since then there've been some groups that have confirmed more with in vivo and or invtra studiess i mine was allin silicoen all that stof but i'm anyways seratonan a really important one but most people i mean this is regulating our mune or mune cell a mune system it is regulating iour blood pressure all that that is water retention i mean bone of course homio stasis five per sant more than five per cent i mean i cannot tell ol much i man ni was and was seve seven zero per cent of the es population deficient im i begin to think that this could be the lynch pen an a number of really important issues supplementinvitedmin d three is what i normally peers the tha i do i take a ithink i are not up taking five thousand i use sometimes ten i use o vitem indthree per day just done that for a long time tand i've had my levels tested in their in range but i've a family member i'll just mensionless i've a family member who was not feeling well just cone of feeling awful little lowd at some digestion is uses went on along otime was taking on my recommendation fifteen thousand i use of d three and was still deficient indthree now takes and i'm not suggesting anyone to this is a special case perhaps i but no chronic illness athat were aware of means to take thirty thousand i use per day in order to bring their dthree range just into normal itwhich is to me a striking because they e quite woll ther healthy wat et cetera but it in it is made o tremendous difference in turns o their mood nowof courses correlative now they feel better than doing it who knows ir pelly also getting outside more but i i think people need to get tested for they kne to get ther d three levels tested ah but we are we arein what is a good starting range for people todo you think about thee three supplementition and again foods that can increase t three i'm vitem in d three is a good way to supplement with it i'm there vit em ind to would be a plant source you often find it fortified in foods milk usually d to there is been a a sane still drink milk besides kids peopo herit is that you cannot fil tel o i yet all the li mos that your moat asoo ye taand they are hortified in those as well oh they are o they are youather fortified and ive a hards im fomman know no milk an all that stuff yat they are they are they are in all that stuff i'm vite em indee is naturally to some degree in fatty fishli youyu think about cod libera oil right is it has by em ind but it is not you are nok in a correct a deficiency with eating rit with eating fish for you'r by tem inde you are eitherin in a crected with son exposure being in the right area having the right amount of son and being right age i'm because as you get old you become very inefficient at doing that converting i'm vite em ind making by tem inte three inerskin that is that allthey at was going on here tos this person is getting up an there there is a lot of single newcly tied pollymorpmo more phisms we talked about api we for previously but there is a variety of a genes that people very comon actually in fact i've had many people that have haped to done that exact same thing i'm measuring your vitem in d levels before an after supplementationers the only way you can figure that outright i'm very important wif you do not measure it you do not know l you cannot know you do not measure i'm there is a vrity of snips that basically make that conversion inefficient and in fact there've been aa lot of these been dealing n randem isation studies these are studies were people sciantist will look at common snaps people that have these common variations of a gene that is a little more than one per cent of the populations s it is not a randomutation it is actually found in it in a a sizible percent of the population and then they have looked at various outcomes and i'm a lot of times they will looka genes that are allso involved in some kind of life style factor bitem indeed i in snips that basically make the conversion a vit em in either vit em in de precursure into d three or in d three into twenty five five drocxs e bitem in d or into the act of steroi hormon which is one twenty five pivedroks he by te miny ad here is a vriety of different snips at show people and you are not looking at bitem in d levels at all you are looking at just the snips and if they have it theyre have low by tem inded a case it is really a way of doing a beautifully randomis control triall with an observational study because you are you are not by us vit em in d levels a also associated with health people that are have higher by tem inded are either outside more than mor physically active or they are ware of their health an tere supplementing right you always have to worry about that when you are when you'r you are doing an observationalsive at wedealing aronimization is beautiful for that reason where you now just random people arranably have these genies and it is not there is no health status yif you have the snap your friend your family member was healthy in all that they were healthy and yet they could not get their delevels upright i'm these these men dealing ranimsations stayes have found that people that cannot convert i'm into the the precurse or the twenty five five drops you by tem in you which is usuly what is measured it is the most stable form inby tementi in the body i'm they have a higher all causemortality if they cannot do it people with that do not have it have a lower all cosmortality they have a higher respiratory related mortality theyhave a higher cancer related mortality i'm to me now why did i get on this rand out because youre front your family member sobasically i'm they also are more likely to get multipless gross this this has all been done with mendealing renmusation and i'm it really does hammer home the importance of measuring your bitamnty levels and ot being being avery proactive about that i mean you can you can d get it at any were your doctor will do it you ask him to do it i'm supplementation wise i'm typically if you do not have one of those snaps for for the most part taking one thousand i use o videm in de will raise blood levels by around five nnanor grams premililator let us say your deficient you are twenty nanagrams formililator and you want to get to forty you are gin a need at least four thousand i use if you are normal do not have any of these snaps that change your matabilism of vitemend right does at matter a when you take it relative to sone exposure time of day with her without food i've seen somenot great preliminary evidence suggesting may be time of day is important i do not think it reall i cannot seem t to find anything that really suggests because the for tact to be converted into the hormon mane it is stored just sammerad if these slightera torments are slow outyah it is not a mediate thing right maybe will get some new data that is otherwise but i just cer yi it simplifize the prolem anyway a for people who are going to be stubborn and not get their d three levels test or their de levels tested and simply say u i'll just take some dy three am that was me by the way a be until i got tested i threw five thousand i use into the mexin figured whilst nocking a kilmeit'l bringig my vydemendy levels up and realize that is a bit of a of a of a course way to approach it but now i feel fine in am i'm still breathing an ambulatory am is is that reasonable a thousand a five thousand i use for most peopl be reasonably safe again were not make just assuming that people are gon at just jump to it without the blood test of course i think that i'm if we if we if we look at the the the literature of the scienti ic literature it is extremely hard to get hyper calcimia which would be the major concern with really high levels of vidim mn youthree supplementation i mean were talking hundreds of thousands abi you a day for a long time i'm hundreds of that yes yes at now that the the upper tolerable intake was set by the im thethe medicine institute i'm to be four thousand just it was just the safe it was kind of lik one of those things where it is saf im i i personally take five thousand i use a day as well and i'm my levels really hover around fifty nanigrams fermill and i i do out i do not i do not put sens green on all the time i do put on my face in i where hapi some on my skin is being exposed by do make it me now from the sun as well but i'm glad you brought up im i the fact you keep arms exposed if you because in these studies as i mention before looking at sun exposure on skin and increases in other hormonts dossasseron assertion mainly it was it became clear from looking at those daya that the amount of skin that you expose is important which makes perfect sense once you hear that but i think must bep worthing oi'm out in the sun but are you wearing short and a teashirt or you wearing a sweat shirt and it is a headier you are you all covered up out and the sun will thout might be grate for setting your circating wor them by way of a light to through the eyes cossess the primary mechanism for that but seems to me that the the more of your bodyes surface that you can safely and appropriately please folks appropriately exposed to the sun the more vitem indeed you are going to create rit laying out and on your back deck i in short sen a teasher with arms exposing legs exposed is a very different stimulus than walking around ingenes in and a wetcher apsrit ooi'm especial of yhet sunscreen on your face i know it almost seems triveales simple but i mnot sure that people are used to thinking about their skin as a interface to create these hormons yes semfesaria matters and by the way i'm there there've been studies looking at a people that are deficient invite him indee i'm in this case it was a african americans that were given a four thousand i you a day by im mindecupplement to bring them back to sufficient levels and i'm that this was a smaller smaller study than i i would but it reverse their epigenetic aging by three years because again it is a formon it is regulating more than five per cent of your approaching n coating humangeno there was there is been studies looking at vid em indee receptr knock out mice and i i used thi a lo on my presentations when i'm talking about my mendeal in cevity bat i'm if you look at these animals the vitem indee recepter as i mentioned earlier vd em in debinds to the recepter and that it complexes with the retinoyd receptor and they go into t nhe glice of the complex and reg you turn on internoptings welif you get rid of that receptor which is what you can do in animal studies i'm you can you can sort of determine what effects therel be with no bi om ind right ly what hodo you study no no vimity and i'm what was found was that these animals and if in fact i dont think if us a complete nockou or you knox they think it might be in ranicllyful bet som im some hypomyes which is masey geek speak for a genus very is revastly reduced in its function number and function number people know what i mean but abut is not eliminade completely right whell these animals i'm if you look at them after the age of four months i mean the mice look liht i mean the egtheir excelerated aging the wrinkle they have no hair i mean theyjus in their life pand life span shorter i'm they just they you can look at this animal and not know anything about mice or work with them man be that animal looks it is of course mi slife spends aron lmike two to in half years bat five hundred years all right now i ge i when to graduets it wit swice ye i she graduels goes a lot of one i to think i age backwards and gradut school which is no true i look at the photoes i deafling aged forward i you on the other hand look exactly the same way you did ten years ago i'm not saying that flattery but's absolutely true i mean the day ore the daytits it is remarkable i i think it is i'm deffling and trying get my maget three percentage up that i'm not gat it hinge it all on that but feel you are doing a lot of things right if i'm taking vy tem indee three i still need to get out into the sun crress te li look i think a lot of people do not know that or at least i have family members that have been li bit resistess i take my vitemintie i do not need to get outside this much i think people are really afraid of getting out into te sun because they are worried about melonomas and and i'm as out to be os i'm as scared of sunsreen as i am of melonoma li that some of the things in sun screen are really spooky mainly the comp and here i'm not one of these coni drink top water lasn't exidet people cringit i i drink top water i've the occasional crassonor dont at i'm i'm not i'm i'm ninety per centing you per cent f the time i'm doing the right things the right way i think although i'm now going to prove on them with this new knowledge but but i do not what i see in most sunscreens because if you look at these compounds they cross the blood brain barrier i do not want compounds crossing the lood brain barrier he thant im dioxide a di oxide some of the trifles sands that are also in these clensers i mean it is once you no a little bit about nerons folksing realize that ner the nrons you got ar basely the ones you got four entire life there is a reason why the is a blood brain barrier of blood overy and a blood testies barriers because the genetic material resides ind the testes the overies and the brain those narons do not turn over there are few nunerons but not that many unless you are a moute frankly protecting those is very kee and a lot of things in sunscreen ar downright dangerous i think there are sunscreens that are safe but it is very hard to figure out which sunscreens are free of these compounds i'm amazed that theyre still on the market frankly i've always geared towards the ones with it the the minerals that are reflecting it i'm it is it is somewhat difficult to penetrate things alway through the skin into the get into the blood stream i do not but i do not know maybe some of these compounds gettin their easily i have seen the evidence wit some of those things other there is o some of there they go transdurmal and they and they get in t all i know that there i'm of tem reacts with the sun and while they do protect from the ou va and or be they form mass of react of auction species and personage and i mean it is the the very thing you are trying to protect yourself yom might actually cause right we do not now i'm its completely speculation but im there is i thinks some more and more and more evidence comegout with some of those compounds and atic i cannot remember all all of a mouth the top of my head but i'm a lot of high an ones also have have it is the chemical sens streen one right chemical ones i we should i'm proposing that we do a journal club a journal club folks is where icanemics get together and read pap where they read papers when they get together in thy pick a part the papers there is a strong correlation between being an early graduate student and being the most critical cause one youv vasuly publish some papers you realize that most studies people are doing their best within the contacts tof what they can do but t be great to do at journal club at some point about sun streens cause i'd love to really figure out what is in these compounds i people are using them crazy and i'm not one of these people is all i will not use commercial toothbays or anything that i i i' a said i drink tap water i use commercial toothpace whatever but when it comes to sun streen it freaks me out because the some these compounds do go trans turm all and some of them cross the blood rainberry and i'd to ket my nurounds free of that stuff i w we are speculating now were at were hat a but get out in the sun and get your dthree levels up o case we have re touht hat these plant these compounds the o megathrees and dthree unless there is something else at you just absoly must throw into the mex i probably will return us to the conversation i opened up with which is about cold and hea which admittedly i pulled us off that that path i want it i take full responsibility for that but before i do that i just one of for you the opportunity is there or there is there anything that a it to supplemen based or food base compounds that you you think or especially useful for brain and er body hi do think magnesium is immorton in there as well i mean i think again about forty per cent of the est population does not get enough magnesium it is an essential mineral were specivegetting from our diet and involved in everything it is it is invall it is also involved inviteim into metabilis and in fact o being deficient in magnesium ma make it more difficult for you to actually make vide im ind formotn that one twenty five highroxy bitim int one of those other factors again talking we talked about genetics but there is also magnesium status as well considering forty per cent that is a big number i'm now magnesiums also involved in making eit p the the energetic currency of ourselves tar basivly oll of ourselves needay to pee to do anything and i'm they are alse it is also involved in utilizing a t p as well as dna repairensm ceser insims and r involved in repairing damage to our deine i personally think that magnesium insufficiency is e insidious type a causes in insidious type of damage daily that you cannot look in the mere an s when you are deficient by dam in s you are my my gums are falling apart i have scurvy right but you cannot see deand a damage you cannot see a but it is happening it is happening right now and my body ains happening your bodyiets happening normal matabolism is happening every day im but we repaire that damage we have repair ensims in are ebody called denaa parensimes they require magnesium magnesium is a cofactor for them but that means is ou know cofactory means and i'ms need it to function properly and i without that cofactor they are not doing it properly and i the the way i to think about magnsium it is easy se peopical what fushi write naturally tht's a next question well magnesium is that the centere of a chlorfimoth molecule chlor phill is wet gives plants their green color darklyfy greens are high and magnesium im it is one of the and people a basily what is the forty per cent insufficient insufficiency in that you hust tell us people are not eating their greens they are not eating their greens they are eating their package foothering teir process food standard american diet is not really high and darkly fy greens i darklyfy greens are how i to get my magnesium i think it comes along with all these other important i mean you get calcium in them you get that by damin ca one you are getting a lot of other machronetrians and you are getting other compounds that we do not know about and once that we know about sulpher fan ri wa as with brokly do i need to eat the dark leafy greens raw in this case im aml more open to it because i ac shu the taste of deri s cal and kalls a darklyfy grean right start a meat w is ns an a in louding an and i ai comat menium not i'm not coloured blind but but ijus one ma shirit falls under the strict cat yes it is ever once while i you my vetuals a e oe a cados of you os agiable i well vegetables also but kill what er some other examples an hale spanage charred swist charred rainbow charred i romain latic is the bitterness an important component to thes and it arn tenesium kno but for for sulphurofane sulphur phaing for chricipherous vegetables that would be the the the the brassica family im but you'r question about cooking them magnesium is i it is bound of the food matrics and i'm and it can be somewhat less byou available im but cooking it can somewhat releese the the magnesium but it goes into the water to you have to ither stemat or kind of get your water and f you journ with it latertr yah i i personally do not worry about it o cas do not worry i grit if you do not worry i'm not but i alsod ie two supplemen with magnei do take around supplementation with magnesium i mean this we could go on and on let us keep this the shortan sweet because we can get back to the other stuff byt im it can cause g i distress that hidosis i personaly to take around a hundred and thirty hundred thirty five meligrams im that way it is not a a huge bollis to my got ng in depends on the formof manesium to yes ya i mean you can take magnesium a three and eight for example and is not as affect me know it doesnt ffect the got as much i manesium citrate sitrates when i take ya it is the pretty i take pretty learn i got stimulus am a minut if eeu it sillabit harder demat doli take a hundred hundred andthirty five melograms should be pretty good i'm in cituate actually il boy d we won to go here am i mean i i it is up to you and we can i we do not have to i personally i'v been supplemang with maneshim for a long time ya am i've i use three and eight and bisglicenate am and mallate ah for different reason i yes i would love to go there if youre if you were well i would think mallit would be the best and ta that that has to do with the short chain out fatiasads being good for the god and a lot of work done by a former collig of mine and good friend markchigan i go showing that lest short chine fada citurate malite lacktate a but but specifically malle really lac tare th the other major ones that i get into ti to the g apitilial cells and are a energy source for the ma condria in the goblet selfs anyways whole other o gi i take malley because i was told that it would a be helpful ifirst of all it does not make me sleepy some of the other forms of manesium which act is a mild seid it iv tfor me am they do tap into the gabbergic pathway ner neer transmitter folks that in general broad sweepin generalization hereican can have somewhat of a a iof a seid it iv quality which is why i take mag musium three and eight and bor bisglicenate before sleep thirty sixty minutes before sleep definitely enhances my transition time to sleep am an the depth of sleep no question in my it my experience theres some data that threean eihte can be co can be neer protective althoughthose are still the studies are still on going i am getting sense that made be a little more sceptical of tha tha na i ye i know i i i've i've seen the studies with the three and ete a i i think looking at the actual data from t the the the one clinical study im there was not statistical significance until all three of the pieces of day twere pull together but that really could jus be because their samples sies was see small right right yei i mean that that paired with that their sayand worts tha ye yasong lose work on with in the this is getting kind of ininside ball of norsid that the quality of the labs matters folks and that' something that is not accessible to people outside of feelds and y know goson lo and some of the other folks with at that time an dow my teed it i i think very highly of their work and they the animal studies art indeed just animal studies bos pretty impressed by what they did in those studies very pionyearingthing when you think about this being done ten twelve fifteen years ago and then yes we need more human clinical data but i for me i figer that the given the safety profile mag three and a given that t helps me sleep better in sleeping betters is better for everything im frankly a that is why i take it in disglicenate and threeand eight sem to be somewhat interchangeable a but there is i do not know of any reports the bisk licinate can be nor protective but male i take ture in the daytime i i it for me a the gentis is subjective it has a tangible effect and improving the recovery time from exercise it i do not know that i've been sore from a work out since i stary taking malle and i used to get very sore from even cont of trivial work out i do not know what is going on there but i keep taking it malley again the short change fadiacid and im i mean you nat when you do have a when you do intense exerci exercise you really enter tolksin from you are gotten i i'm just going back to the interesting work is the the mallet being the short chane fadiacid and im mark chigan ot ar showing this is all an animal research by the way but i'm i mean it was you feeding these animals malet and yit really protect at the got and your talksigy relese and i'm it effect ed at abolecindrum an all sorts of things but i think me mallets als it en i always try to eat green apples thoroughly hin malic acid o good an and i'm tart cherries tarcheries areally highland as well sels itastes really yon but i i i ways really intereting the magnesium three and eight stuff i take a supplement called magnesiome by moon juce and it is a little powder im it is got a little bit among fruit but it im taste good i i'd do it a little bit before bedtime i'm as well probably several more hours thou be as i doft want to times an times ith flu is if firgoo o bat and i'm it has magnesin three and eigde and a variety aboutheir a versions of magnesium and it as well and ii realy it but i thought the magnesium threeandeight steff was super interesting i you knowi left to see mor clinical data as well but i think once we get it it will probably be oh yo it is getting into the rain in halse thimself righty now by way ri i a what and alon those lines i once put out a a post hat said you kno i i feel their number of different categories of health can health information consumers on line and understanding which one you are in for which topic can alleviate a lot of the strain and stress of finding the informationthat there is some people that a perfectly comfortable with data from amou studyes if it is done in my great i'll try it other people sake no has to be done in humans a do not want posuble control studies you kno randomise clinical trials a et cetera then other people are just you kow what i do not care about any of that just tell me what you do and then other peoplear that yu knot only ma care what you do just tell me what to do and then there is this other category which are if it is in pill former powder form they will take it and i think a lot of the battles of people picking apart people's post one things have to do with factiv that people do not re alize that people are showing up to the table it in one or some commination of those stances a we know people that will try anything non we know people that will not take anything a the idea hereis to creata a an a ray of possibilities for people a and i think the animal date are very impressive a we should have you back on i ta get with the hope of because i rit alike te no it is very promise teyin it r ho i'm it probably is at i not well and obviously you are doing things right a cold and heat converge on some common pathways related to what you called intermittent challenge which i love i i think if a you now't intermen fasting cold heat exercise i mean maybeven intermitn sleep deprivation i keep waiting for the intermittent sleep deprivation movement i will say i pull a few all nighters for year just for work demands and procastination and dead lines in i'm a im the worst commination of of academic aus i'm both a procrastinator an a perfectionist you vend ut pulling small nighters the sleep i get the next night is pretty amazing i must say it is the sleep of gods but i do not recommend any when you sleep deprivation for that but i coan imagine that we also of alve having some sleepless nights this idea of intermiten challenges is a really attractive one and i want to make sure that we credit you with the phrase intermittan challel no night it doctor mark matson okete doctor mar mad litan gotige and he has use that is wort of that yaris oke great will make just doctor david's in claire i love thas or he says i as in one of his publications is soman years an i just lot brilliant f brlliant terms mark mats and gos tardigize or priest marin u it is i meant it it is a good school i guess of of course said said good school a we will credit the appropriate people thank you for that clarification a you have talked a lot aba the use of deliberate cult what i call to lierate cold exposure only to distinguish it from cold that you might just be eccidentally exposed to but it is sort of obvious when we say cold exposure there are some amazing daton cold a the other day i saw post from you and it is you have include this intalks before i did not know this until i learned it from you credit to you that even twenty seconds of immersion in i think at's for degree forty nine to forty nine degree a farenheight o couwas trensling asselsye boft forty nine to refair nheight waters o cold water can lead to long lasting increases in epinafor an a dranaline a and i have to presume other narrow a nermoglayters in neurow chemicals as well a what are some cold protocalls that you find particularly interesting or attractive from the standpoint of ion pic your favorite matabolism nero slash mood effects a brown fat stimulation which of course weaves back to metabolism we could we could do an entire episode all about col but hat id love to knowis o what sort of activity our stimulus you ou think it is a reasonable and particularly potent one i to use in terms of cold to day i did three minutes at forty nine degrees fair and high i have a cold tub to get it up to your neck well i try i keep floating up ti i it is really hard i'm sothe i i i would say oh may be most to my sholder i canming really i'm floating out by was sing i was telling my husband is thi's there' too much water in here for me i cannot too much salt and tereis it the dead sea re fload on top is there saults in there onor he takes care of all the igoug that it is it is it is tha it is the plunge i'm beya they been by the way the pod cast nor i am sponsor aby plunged they did give me one that thing is fantastic al cause it circulates the water which o make sure that you break up the thermmal air in its even cold it is even colder it sox anyways i'm look a'll a'll i'll give i give it a i i'll be honest here i wish i did more cold than i do i do cold when i'm in go on a podcast i definitely dou coll when i me do podcast when i'm going to geve a talk or when i'm anxious i need to make it more of a ritual i'm i love doing this on i'm hate the cold he day unless it is summer time it is a lotties yeare for me to get in the coldnes sommer time but i'm what i do love about the cold is how i feel after and i'm i feel less anxious i feel good i feel more focis which is why i usually do it before any type of public speaking or in just when i'm just anxious i'm aljust getting there and i'm the twenty seconds at forty nine degrees if i think it was forty nine to restarin heigh it wit was really a good number because time and temperature doyo at time a duration i guess would be a better word and temperature do matter i'm but but you can you can do twenty seconds at a colder temperature which as i prefer or you can do a minute or longer at a warmer temperature i think there wis another sheddy showing fifty nine degrees far and high at one hour i was to threefull but who ant's to be one hour yi'm familiar t at study i the i loveis is really reveals just how absolutely merdy i am and maybe why some times and relationships in my life were challenge i love reading the method sections of papers yo people can come aut me with a umber of things about papers and i might miss something for surely i mis certain things anybody is but the methods i sort of i i relish in reading the methods and that paper's really interesting cause they had people sit in long chairs basically inswimming pools for an hour and it was not real it was chilly it was not super cold i min sixties not 's not warm but it is not ice cold obviously but an hour is ridiculous at's some o but the increases in dopening were massive and lasted hours it is it is really the mood enhancing effects that you report ir they are not you are not imagining that thut those are almost certainly a a the consequence of having slowly elevating but significantly elevated dop dopening that goes on for hours that is almost a dream profile for dopening itis most everything else an atter all a riddle in a cup of coffee and a and i work out drank a prework out drink or something is getting veel big spite in a drelin and dopening an a big crash and somehow it creates this really nice contoward profile i whatever your experience in there is very nicely supported by the dat well i i need to get i need to get doing it more i i've i've had a a couple of scare experienceis going from hot to cold arling blood pressure changes i think where i basically went straight from a really hot tocusya was in there for thirty minutes me know was i was doing heat to cosy ok aye a hundred and for degrees fair in height is tosty and then id for thirty minutes and then i went straight in to at the time it was our pool i was in frebruary was if winter time and it was im fifty it was in fifties it is cold and and i was in there and i was listening to simming garfuncle i was a transtayin along time get my cold an i trying to pressd dand to see goes in ther frilic he will stayin there for fifteen minutes but i started to feel really blinky loow blood pressure something and i got scarce by got out and then i could not stand i had vertigo or something and i was scared it scared and and i've i've had a couple of times to where just going straight from the sanna to it a to the cold plunge im where i'm starting to feel my feel little blood pressure change or something and and make sense the sana is causing bas of diolation and the cold plunge is caught ar cold exposures causing vaseof construction it sis a very me know just shock to my system and now i wait i wait a few minutes before going in but im i do need a kind of make it more of the cold more routine because i talk all about the science i'm familin with all the science and that the nore up and efferan o nora gentleman it is effecting brain and moon and way more about that than i do i know i feel and i know it is a narrow transminter and i it is it is released at least in rats they have shown or it was at mice i think it mayh a ben rats but multiple say showing in that it is released from the cold in the brain and a now in humans as well oo doing that ont dudy but tha that is the we wutd a ling to this its a potion two thousand europian journal physiology that big dopening increase they also looke it up in efferand and corisalln sasom really yes at this has been doin de rain i d o no no not fatma not yet yet eve i very hard to measure i doping directly from the brain laseding micr dil sa snowus unfortunately that there is unfortunately their skulls were in tact fortunately for them unfortunately for the research come their skulls were in facts thiy gen measure directly in the brain but i see that there is a correlit there it no its it is a very real effect i think that but do the dvantage ou've not doing it too often is that you are not cold adaften now it is very hard for any one to get truly cold adaften but some people start to look forward to the cold and what i think the're loking forrd to is the feeling afterward that dopeman rush ah but if you get cold adapted than it certainly onts the some of the effect but i want a be cold adapted because that means i have more might a condria in my aniposed tissue and un perhaps even muscle that is been shown the may be this ood opportunity to cold an you see p one if you could educate us on yuc seepo whane i find mister linch and i learned about it from you yah ah well norop anaferan actually release in the plasma does that acts o hormone bays of constrictions one thing it does but it also regulates a variety of molecular functions that have to do with adaption to cold i'm one happing happening to be i'm shivering is a very inefficient way to produce heat which is what your body's trying to do whin it is exposed to cold and your muscles are basically contracting in and and om and producing heat from that bit that just not very efficient a the the more eloquent wy to do it or elegant i guess a way to do it is tobasially have you are might a condria produce tons and tons of heat i'm the way it does this is by activating a gene called you c p one uncoupling proating one or up an eferon is upstream of that activating it im that what that does it is essentially might condria are these little organals inside of yourselves that are responsible for producing energy usually that is in the form of a denising try phosphate a t p an that is what let us everything function inside your body from your nerve transmitt or prodection to your heart beating et cetera im however a you can uncouple you are might a condria basically you are might a condria a theu're a little battery they have it they while they have a double memberang first of all their structure but they have a negative charge on the inside and they have a positive charge on the inner membrane in between the outer emembering and inside the inside part eganer a nuron yas i guess it is a nuron it is a battery negative deposit well basically you can uncouple that that charge and that positive charge procon start leaking out ofthemigta condria anyoure miht a contr free ous this is called uncoupling it and they start to it is maximum respiration as we call it they try to make is much energy o they i got to get thos that that that proton back that radiant y electrocemical radiant and they jes go in san and they 'm in this case it is uncoupled energy that energy they are making is ectually heat not e t peat ah but heat is but you are essentially burning substrate who cares you'r burning you'r burning luclevs you are burning ulipids you are you are basily burning things and making heat and i'm that is what n coupling it does and tat is a much more efficient way of producing heat than shivering as you become more adapted i maybe the the longer duration that you you stayed in the cold or themore times you have done you will no longer shiver any more you will start to than just do this uncoupling type of thermogenisis as it is calld and i'm another type of adaptation that occurs is you actually produce more migta condria in you are adipost tissue and i'm and that actually happens also regulated by nore ap anafrona nora a dornalin through approaching called pe g ce one alpha and what that proaching does is it makes more mighta conjrya in you are atapostcell pur atipocell you are gtting more mita condria it is a beautiful way to basically make more heat when you'r it is it is one of those things worts it is it is your body's going o ca i'm going to be exposed to this cold next time how can i make sure i do not die oh i can have more mighty conjryo and i'm goin to make more heat and you are making more might condria in you'r atipost tissue and and this is often rerefer to us the browning of fat and the reason for that is because if you look under a microscope at a lipid drobit iyou not basically i'm aa fat sell i not a lipit drop it at atpesite 'm you will find tha it looks darker because there is more mita condry in there it is refer to as browning fat and i'm in no woing to get into the whole base fat brown there is is hole i'm sure you have had experts on that talk all about that dont ot yet i'm ean i alwaysing af wife at basat brown fat basios cont of intermediinnert why cannot be converted into bae bray and basn take on thermogenic characteristics essentially and i'm you can activ a base fat that it is thermogenic in the sense that is i'm burning glucose and norar fatiacids and and producing heat i'm the more you expose yourself to cold the more you can brown youre fat to speak and and therefor i'm you can tolerate the cold for longer periods which people do notice and you can then have the thermogenic qualities of having more brown aipost issue or base act ofat te bae adipost issue which is i'm you will get a lot of nasayers out there say o brown fat does not regulate matabolism at all the reality is tere's thousands of researchers trying to bill pill up brown fat and thermogen you'r trying to make it a pill because it does affect matabolism i'm it is not the only thing is certainly if you are obse and trying to loose weight you knock an it do that just by doing cold exposuring ng you to do dietary and exercise i'm changeis is proominently but it does it does affect matabolism and i'm you this is this has been shown in human studies it is a a interesting nother it is another possible mechanism fore i'm affecting matabolism 'm n that is an aipost tissue but you also make more mitacondra and muscle tissue and this is regulated not by a nore apin oferend but it is still peeg to an alpa interestingly i'm not not that any one else rell ly carries but me and maybe you do i ye i i'm eating this up i s o pg se one alpha is is respond is response in orup an afrn an atapos tissue to make more mit a conduria but in a in muscle tissue it is un clear what the regulator is cold exposure does its this is this was shown am at least in a couple of studies i've seen were a i people that were exercising i believe may be made ave ein men only they were exercising that some supper training and thend did cold water imersian something fifty degrees fair an hight fifteen minutes an ped you see an alfa which is af bil marker for mita conjro by ogenesis which is the generation of new mit a cndria by the way that is ossom you want more mita conjure n your muscle it is associated with am improved muscle mass im proved in durance i mean my da condria are essentially either the making energing yourself and we you now we do not make moremita conure an normally you have certain impoets exrhigh intensity nterval tradeing exercise can do it an i should make more mito condure yes ya that is been shown in people and wmy ma training order just i intos the interval train i haven seen wait training i've seen it an in high intensity interval training and durance training but that does not mean that it has not been shown jus have not seen in or that has not been ooked an soutano i'm i'm always looking for reasons to finally do more it ti i intensethy interval training work a do wait training if i do lo intensiy cardio there was a brilliant study by am at the time youse a posttok mathew robinson and am he is now gone on to start his own lab at the university of organ health scienc senter re wy am an and he do the study were a both young and old older people were they had this whole high intensity proto call which i cannot remer what it was but their protocall am for ex amount of time i'm from sure it was at least a month a they then measured bil markers of myta conral by o genesis in their muscle tissue and a the the amount of mita conjral by gensis an old people specifically it happened in both young and old from hit from the hih intensity ineval traning was i mean it was enormous at least fifty per cent i think i beent wisjus wo and why would you want that well m a conjria you are your migt a cot you do not make yoursell yoursells are turning over you make new cells you replace old ones wit your i conjria a you do not really do that for the most part you can mt conjr by jenesis does happen but you have to stimulate it to happen an m the way your mitacolik what happens with your mtconjure as they sentially are bobbing around inside yourselves and th they they fuse with other mita conjure exting exchange all their content mita conjraldinaa than fis back apart and that is how to cont stay young ish but as you age you you eep doing that with the same pool of mita conjuria than you ging to get a monjrabl myta conjura mixing old stuff together right why would not you won i bring up new healthy young miht a conjriat into that pool right in my mind when i hear mita conjra by genesis on my aging that is the first thing nk up a anyways cold exposure does that e a may other things as well no otis i and at please thank you for offering to somehow filter that the level detail but i assure you that listeners of the podcass ar ar familiar with getting im drinking from the firehose of mechanism and that was really helpful and again this is just one example of may before five other things the you said at least that ar gon i inspire made to change my behaveours o most tar doing some hi intensy interal training doctor andy gallopan was on the the outcast recently and he told me that that the subtles on to cardio in the waight tranings grat but that i really should be doing som mas heart rate work per week you going into maxs heart ray for ninety seconds and rasting in repeating that nave even mild repeats i'm just curious as a brief acide before we we talk about heat what what sort of am carty vascular other types of training do you do a dyou do hit imagine you ar doing higintensh ineral training if you coul just give us a sense of the contour of your your week as it relates to exercise and and because youv ben very gracious in sharing some of what you do for supplements and food what about exercise i am it all depends on my week of course and and and what i've got going on with my sun and in my work scendel but i typically i do a lot of hih intensty interval tabadas on a stationary cycle i use palaton because i just that instructor there telling me what to do within e competing with everyone else oyou know i it work you revealing somthing about your sycholog this a we just learn about this spodgas is actually just a decoy for for a sychological sessmen of gesnot getting ah but now we know your competitive good i that it is explains a lot of how you got through graduate school and in i do what you do you are etting on the pelaton and what is it looked for some one who is not familiar with pelaton i know what they are but ive never been on one you are peddling against the instructor for how many seconds i'm youre there is a bunch of people that are on line either doing the class with you at the same time or at all time doing as to can cyou can kind of stogglon what you want you can try to compet agains that was sot i'm realearnpeted oh ye ok and the instructor is just there to whip you e li hong make you there there is there is a part of a the brilliance with palaton is i used to do rush was called rush cycle and i use to go in spacically you go in in group group cycle and have an instructod there and you do all this hinetenseneral traing stuff and i loved at because there was a competitive aspect to it that had me working harder than i would work if it was just me in the without and instructor or anyone there and was just i'm at a gim any gim and i'm dison est stationary cycle listening no pot gess doing some which is fine if that is you group right but there is something about that group sating that kind of make hold you accountable tou riht and and the palaton made it somehow virtual it was amazing im and i remember being back at rush cycle thisis before panatic an people talking about palaton in my class no my ows rediculous thougt to do that likethus never in work i need tha be here r nand the the panamace and i as all over the palaton and im it works for me really well i tend to do that at least three times a week im sometimes i do it more you ol tefore and i do it ten minute just ten abecause it is efficient and i push my ass i push myself really hard that is the tobata it is it is twenty seconds on ten seconds off and it is ten minutes and on means you'r peddling you to put you are mmaxing it and there can ot of resan aly tio ye will said you basi there is a part where you are i always do resistance i'm the power i do the power for there is a part where yu you sitting set cycling yand tryin to really fast but i ways string the resistance up i was go above what they give me and then i'm and then there is a part where you are standing and yreally crying the resistance up which i really don lote you feel it your gluds an going apil ye exactly and they break it up and most h time you willhave those two two two parts and i love the efficiency of it i'm youu just you get it don and people sometimes hear me go ten minutes or really you think you work and look you ma you do max you tavata for ten minutes and it' it is it is intense theamost people cannot sprint for thea for the gat of i irplaing thereabout to miss carrying a a back pack if you thing about if i thing about that and the i just ascribed mywiti a sprinting through the air portant gon i andy gallop when got my ninety second back hart ratein for you carrying this thing a but twenty seconds on ten seconds off repeating that over and over for ten minutes by time you are done you are cooke and then i because i'm competitive during the recovery that they give you at the minute the end i'm pushing it max i trea numberry any times in rick ye three times a week and then i always have my sana on pred reheating up im takes about an hour and a half and i get it to about one eighty nine to respair in height i hop right in the sna after my inmy my a palaton to the elevated hart ray continuese as at the yes i i mean i literally down a bunch of water and then i get in and and then i either im read a science paper prepare for a presentation or potcass or i im passh over things in my mind and it is interesting because something about getting in thi sona i think thi strass the heats tress of it i usedit i star during the sana in to doesan nine in graduate school and i o eally adoptor i stir doing it every da i lived across the straliv in i studio apartment with down with in the small studio part the smallest parmy you never imagine and it is a cross the stee fror ma wams se i as i was poor in ritas very poor very poor i mean im i rego al and regall an o gai i li tin in my lab well but an again i lived in my lab as a postock and is it i admit i lived in my lab with my bulllog as a faculty member a for other reasons a i gai i get it iwouldn yu'r graduet son you are por yases im and i used to iused to go to the the sana befor going in the lab and i'm i would and i wouldn i sart noticing th at i was allof a sudden able to handle stress better thestress of my six month set back because i failed experiment which is crushing on top of the pressure from yor advit my adviser and my own pressure ixim a very competitive it myself an i but a lot pressure myself i was having a hard time i mean i was very stress out n graduousan the sana serti to really noticably effect my anxiety and my ability to handle stress and i was what is going on here i stird looking into the literature i'm and sr to geting interested in thefects on the brain and in fact that the time i had a friend who was i'm not actually experimentally but theoretically looking in to the the wo peoid system and i'm basically when you get in this ona ayou release a lot of indorphans and dorphans are the feel good horm a feel good opiods i'm that make you feel good but o you also release something called dying orphan and dine orphan is an idogenous opioid that binds to a receptor called the capaopioid receptor which a dine orphan is responsible for that disoric feeling when you are in the san on your hot when you are running during exercise and your you feel uncomfortable i'm well i think that is tin orphan i'm speaking nots i no i thinit is it is i mean that thereis evidence in o i'l collics that some of the symptoms withdroll the thixsperience are related to dinorphan and dinorphan is known to negatively impact the dopenin receptor system basily it is the feel garbige bethwi rigt you feel garbige and you think i'm that that would not be good but i' this is wremy my friend that comes in he he was looking at the effects o treating a morphene or heroinadiction and i men of people that are using the drugs they basically the the endorphans or the morphine or heroine they bind youa receptor in the brain called the muopioid receptor and i'm as as they p they take these drugs that muopa receptor i becomes down regulated and you need more and more of the drug to feel as good as you did right well indorphans 'm also bine to that receptor and he was looking into some of the i'm other other drugs that are salvan salsalanoria salvanora marsoming the salvia it is call that a a binds the calpioi opioid receptor it also makes you can afeel uncomfortable anyways i'm he put some sidies in front of me that showed basically binding of the either dinorphan or whatever lie down to the capaopioid receptor basically sensitized is the mu opoid receptor to the feel good andorphns and also changes i think it also i'm upregulates it or something basically there is a lasting effect of feeling good the indorphns at your release later from hugging some one or a joke your laughing out o whatever i'm you feel it for longer right and i'm anyways this is i but the san i with respect o this on its a big sort of hypothesis of mine i did kind of publish that part of a my hypothes is in i re you article but i do i would do wish more people were cont lookin to that than be amasing i'm but but when i was getting out i think was i would use i would use the asana to memorize things this is heway back in the dane i still do it and an whent i to talk to about this because youare you ave youre nearo your nearou scientist that thereis something about being in the son and i think i doft knowif it has to do with the the stress response when you when you have an emotional trigger you remember things better right and absolutely that the there is it clear and non explunation for mechanism for thus yof tho in the sana i mean you also release nor up an ot friend just you do rn the cold there is a lot of overlap you'r relieve youre you what it mean i it is istress or but i lake use it to remember things i'm going through something i want i go through a presentation or a talk or potges or whatever an i go in that sona and i mean yous try if you have not a right youht i have a sonan a cal plunch now and i have not tried prepare i read books in the sana in the evening it is a it is the time i insist on having my phone out of there most because i initially because i thought id cook the phone but also just to get some separation from the phone in screens the evening i read books the only challene sometimes you are dripping sweat on tof the books bun willing to forego a few pages of a book im the a the the idea that being in this semi stress full environment would aid in the learning and and retention of information is is really well substantiate by this beautiful work by guinin james bagaul i noft nof his laghs still active but he was you you see revine for a while and then i think it a you would receive arizona as well they have great memory group at both places very strong in learning memory on both places and he was the one that really defined this kand of i inverted you shaped function for the relationship between a drennaline and memory they sically if you'r to relaxed and not stressd enough you'rn oi can remember any information at peak levels of stress you actually are a memory machine at least within the contect of whatever it is your tring to learn very well ee what you are describing is very well matches with that then of course it tapers off as you really increase a denalin to the point where people are strying to lose out an omic function where they are just do it their panicing vasically but obvious ly your keeping it in range the other thing that i'uld to ask you about its in the son of course thers vase of dilation and profusion of blood to the brain is a wonderful way to enhance cognition there is even some really nice state or showing that during inhales as upposed to exhales people are better at learning information believe are not during the inhale you'r taking in and absorbing and remembering more than during exales and these are beautiful sides done inhumans of course i can imagine tht vase o dilation getting more profusion of blood to the brain plus a little bit of stress or may be a lot of stress from the epan affr m im and yet it is and then of course there is going to be that i do not call it placibo but there is can be the the contact the condition place contact of it we if we if we had a good experience remembering something in the sona once sweet ended the posive association effect of that location is real just if people go to a new city and they get robbed i veoda since ia tat ner innocence tonigt be yet robbed in sensinaity you first has taken your wall gets taken you cannot of hate since in aty as a tourist but that could happen in any number of different cides right the ofpice is also true if it something good happen someptly som imagining that is a commination of those effacts but i'll start it w wbe very hard to to do this in the cold i flike the cold is a very potent a di think it takes you too far down that curve the magacure i have to sing the songs or something when i distract how e i sinks young but afterward you'r very efficient at learn after a am andi yuwith respect to the sona i'm the bays of dilation does occur there is a lot of overlat between moderate intensity erobic exercise and heatstress and as you can imagin when your exercisein your elevin elevating your cobody temperature youare your sweating an i'm when you are actually in the sona blood does get redistributed to the skinned of celitates wedding but much exercise blood flow in general is improved to the brain the muscles everywhere i'm i think generally speaking that and this you kno there' studies showing that sona use is associate with a much lower risk of demention all simersh dis ease ik people me kno people that use it for to seven times a week have greater than sixty per cent reduction in to mentionnd i'll somish as ease visin how ton on a ow sorry i do mean to cut you off you said people w use it ii upon tas ta maybe it tells again people use it four to seven times per week av they have a greater than sixty per cent roduction in dementia risk and all simirsh is ease risk compared to people that use it only one time a week i'm people that use it two to three times a week have something a twentya little greater than twenty per cent roductioneris as a dose dependent effact ondimentur risk and all surmirsh is ese risk i it also has a profound there is there is a big link between the cardy of asculers system and the brain obviousty blood flow a big one right yeu t you need to get blood to your brain im but cardy of ascular mortality mortality from cardy f ascular disease if people use our extural this was men if men use is on a for to seven times a week it is a fifty per cent production cardy of ascul related mortality compared to one time a week again dos dependent manner two tothree times a week is something twenty four per cent lower the di'm dath from card of ascardisease there is also lower sudden cardiacdeths a hartittac that is sixty something greater than sixty per cent lower if if men use it four to seven times a week first is once again a dost epndent thing and the thing that is profound there also to me when again looking at the methods when i look at the data and this is all work from doctor yary lacanen hes in im the yu niversity of eastern finland and just one of t e the the world experts on sona yoush especially with respect to cardy of asku their health what a some of his sdata has also shown is that if you look at the duration the time spent in the sona a lot of the te i mention the temperature i do is about i do one eighty nine degrees faranheiht typically i go in there i'm perty he adapted an am the more you do you the more you do the sana or any sort of heat stress whether's a hot tubberde acusy you you become adapted you are your basely tart to sweat at a lower corbody temperature to cool yourself down all these wort of physiological changes star to happen earlier and and om i stay in for thirty minutes cych i say went e along to that is a lot yet to listen your body im most of the studies a that i just talked about were from the the duration the time spent in the sana when i said fifty percent roduction in cartyvaskdisease related death what was shown was that men that were in the sona for only eleven minutes even if they used at for to seven times a week that production was only eight per cent said fifty yit had to be greater then nineteen minutes leke twenty minutes is the sweet spot at about one seventy four degrees fair in height and and and most most o the sonisan findland by the way ther their their humid to the they they put hot water a hot na ho they put water on hot rocks to crate steam and it is some usually between ten and twenty per cent humidity in the finish shana those those studies were i would say most oe time your in a find that their humidity is also elevated but to me the the dost dependent nature of it and the duration knowing elike to me that is a very strong data that this is more causale than some corelerything because that is always the problem with observational studies in cluding these which they corrected for a whole host of factors collester all exercise just everything the everything n the sun i mean they correct for those and on top of that you have the dost dependent nature of the duration the time spent in the sona and the frequency to me it is some is going on here ouooss there is been studies interventien sudies worts comparing directly head to head moderate a intensiterobic exercise on stationary cycle to twenty minutes in a sana there the're physiologically the same things happen heartriht elevates while you are doing the activity blood pressure increases while you are doing the activity but in after heart wrate decrease is resting heart rate decreases below base line blood pressure is itprove it decreases below base line this is happening the same in moder intensity cycling versis sana again thi sana this heat stress ors something about it that really mimics this moderate intensity erobic exercise which is really great for people that cannot go for a run that cannot even get on a bite m to stable people granted there are some safety concern sir they are pretty mild u but they do exist ayou know people that had a recent heart attack or have some rare kind of heart disease or problem dringing uncle hul never do that elderly people lo ut prone to lowbral blood pressure always talk to physician before do thisonit is it is stressful ppregnant women a ya i defali avoided sonas when i was pregnent but i'm a the th it is i think it is very relevant for disabled people and also people that are sedentary had been sedentarymos or life my mother i i've been able to get her in the sana because she is not i mean i i did get on the pellaton once but it is really much easier she feels its a spaw treatment and and it is she can listen to her music in there and i care about her health but she is she is mostly been a sedentary person and im i find it much easier to convince her to get in the sana than to get on peleton idealy you to both that the question would be well i exercize i run i do by high intensity nerale training why do i neen to get in thisana and and the reality is is and i published all this an an a review in the experimental jerantology last yer i guess early late lastyer and i'm itbasically cardio respiratory fitness which is a marker of it is a marker of health cartyiouno cardia respiratory fitness is improved in people that do exercise and sana compared to exercise alone orsana alone for those be pealthy fit peopled out there already exercising there is a synergestic e fact by also adding a ana into that routine and to me that is gray an im there is many beneficial things happening with th with the heatsdress in addition to mimicking robic exercise theires the heatchuck protinesta we talked about earlier and thos a kind of brings me back to my early days of science when i was at the sulk institu a for by letiful studies doing research on little nemitode worms that we or some one else injected amaloid bate a forty to the peptide the forty to an meano asad peptde that is involved in amalod plaks found in the brain corlaty with alsirmersh is ease and other you kno brain disorders i we injected those into the muscle tissue of worms and basically these worms become paralyze with age because he the the aggregate aggregated protines im this these protines aggregate im well heatchock protings one of the main things they do is they basically make sure the protines inside of yourselves maintain their properter three dimentional structure and are folded right and they do not they are not prone to aggregating and forming these placs in you'r arderies and also in the brain and there is i'm back to my my my worm studies i was doing i would i would elevate heatchock rotings in this worms hand it would totally wou know correct the problem where the the they would no longer become paralyze they would move around their yount im many animal sthadies have been done looking at als harmersh disease i all all a human alsumires es in a rodiant and hea chalk protines protecting from it 'm he chock proaings are robustly activated inhumans an this has been show to a even o fifty percent higher over base line levels after just thirty minutes at one sixty three degrees farenhi nesona i'm and they stay activated at least in road ends for forty eight hours at least i'm having these hea chock protines around making sure ther thei're properly tan care abor ar proachings to the'r ot aggregating in our brains and in ar in our placs could be anotheir potential way that isonis protecting from alsimers disease and i'm other carty of ascular health as well as longgevity i'm there is there is people that have snips in he chock proachine factors seventy that if they have one of them they got one from their parentsfor they have more active he chocke perting seventy they live on average one year longer than people that do not have that snip and if thy have two versions they got one from their mam and one from their dat they live on average two years longer than people that do not have that snip tat's also been essociate with human luctivity as well as in lower organisms you can he chock a worm or fly and they live fifteen per cent longer this istat workd on by gorn li gaw at the buckins to to years and years ago i'm anyways they guess what i was getting at was im the hechock proatines are are part of that strest response pak y tht we talked about earlier and they are also activated by cold as well cold chock does activate hea chock protines not as robust sull for frin act at activates them again it is one of the reasons i think we should get all of these things because they are more robust in pots you knother in pot activating mechanisms are more robust for yeu know different once there is cross talk there is you no i mean i guess i get iu' be more accurate to say there is om overlap but but it is also you one to get the most robust from all of em right i do i mean at that is why i when i do the sona and exercise and eat myself my brockly sprowd in an im all thatsbut it is superinteresting a coupl o couple of questions came up for me em one is a you mention these a snips these em yuclatat repeats busily jemes that somephinople have more over luss of a than others a that can predict longevity in some sense is that the foxo three path w that is one thathan yet i mean foxo three is i'm in fackt if you go back to the worm studies of his talking about thatse they one of the the first things when you see it with your own eyes you can take these worms that i'm you basically decrease there insolen siggling pathway in their ideaf one worms have a what are alled humoligus gene they have a lot of similarities to humans they have an insolen recepter they have an igeef on receptor and they make something fox three which we have and i'm basically if you if you decrease that insolen siggling path we their fot fox o threes always active in those worms and they they live a hundred per cent longer and and not only do they live longer i mean they are lik ke a very young worm i me they are you look at this stang and your this looks the worm that was just born hours ago what is going on the tings that the end of its life im now as a as the side know the thing that always got me on this was am by the waythis was discovered by cintiacanyan and im this was back in the ninties and honestly i'd mot sur that anything as been is exciting in the worm world since then but i thought i mean it was a really big finding im the only the only cabyat there is that the worms go through this dowr it is called a dowr stage when when this happens when yu decrease their insilencs ing ling and stuff and they gointo this metabl ecstasis ar not eating is mantrmoming and and sos the coocale they live a hundred per cent longer but they go into this weird state know i know people thi summ in the longevity community i they know who they are but they will get the last laugh caus i'll be dead well fed but dead and they will well still be going ah in terms of the the many data on sawnand and i also just one acknowledge these finishd groups that did this work is really pioneering ri oen you think twenty years ago lon before chall meet or any of this and there out there up there i should say measuring carters all and grow harm on and all the stuff an in people getting into hav sawna very very interesting u twenty minutes seems the threshold at hundred n seveny degrees fairn height more times per week seems to be better than fewer when you when n terms of all cause mortality carty of ascula risk according to what when i just learn fmor would be a a good i thing men amum effective tivs four times a wek and you combine it with the cold i've also seen a proto call were is a very extreme protocal i do not recommend this to people right off about where they had subject human subjects get in the sana for thirty minutes get out for five thirty minutes get out for five threemetes for a total of two hours of exposure but that was what led to these massive sixteen fold increases in growth harmon i shuo i i and they hade to do it very seldom it tells these protocals you are describing twenty minutes done a four times per week far more reasonable for most people to occess but i i know people are probably desperate to know what if they do not have a san sawnais kind of a unique ot im i've a couple questions can people use hot baths a with the appropriate warning of course that without getting into description of the the mechanics in the underline byolg it is pretty obvious that the testies if they get too warm you will you will killsperm that is the reason why the tesses are housed in a structure calle the scrotum that can move around just to be we are biologis just talking about realities here if you are trying to conceive children where keep your sperm healthy gi shoul pily stay out of warm ah thats a for least six months that is been shon six months setsperm prodo thay sperm motility goes down and perm production goes down but that is completely re correctead i if they stay out ofthe sawna ot for six monsis through six month lighter spectanal great that is a very useful information i'm sure to number of people out there im the're if people do not have access to a sawn a an we get this about cold to you always say what about cold showers and i ways say what the studies ma have mainly been done on immersion because it is hard to keep things controlled in cold showers thsjis does not make for very good experimentas yo get a bigger person the less of them is under the shower and it does not make for a good experiment it is i it is not as god as immersion but with the with hea i could imagine that a hot bath we work almost as well ya there spend some studies looking out for example activation if hea chacked rotines also brain drive ner terifect factore increases with heatstress i'm and i the sat a the the hot bath that around hundred and forty rees far an higt which is to pely what studies will use for temperature which i'm this ecto cooler than what i crick my bath hot it is ot i'm you are very heat adapted i'm very apto yot and i'm it is twenty minutes from the shoulderstown and not is a very robust activation i hea chacked protines and in brain drive ner trifect factor and then he chock crotings are also protecting against musclatrophy that is also having t do wit the protine structure in the muscle tissue was well thissus been studies an animal no animal data i'm as well as om a recent human data as well it was local hiporthermi or local heat treatment but i'm essentially a showed that i protected i mean it was there was a study where i'm they arelooking at muscle disuse and it was it was something the local heat treatment prevented almost forty per cent of the musclatrophy from disy of selike an it is funnix that i used to use this ona whe i was injured and stuff i would go in the sawna i because i i i i did not know at the time ause i was graduate stuinit but i knew just from experiments that i'm not losing as much muscle i feel better i at the time i that was reading all about the growth formin th stuff bact then but i'm and i knew about hea chock rotines an in i kind of new i but that date i was not around yet and i'm now we have the data and i've always felt i was not losing my muscle i should have been when i was doing thi awn and i was doing it litterally seven days a week it as harcor this also tur in graduate school yet now now i'm doing i'm doing the sawna i'm a bare bareman amo mi do three but i tri to defore because of the it it all depends on my schedul i'm i also to do long runs i really it is long being three mo not campains mon i'm but i i really for me and we were talking about this earlier off camera that the runs for me are are for my brain and that i get this mine wandering a fact where i day dreamwhen i think about things i work through problems i get created i come up with ideas and this is all hoppening on the runs and in i i just i i i i miss my runs if i do not do em an i miss it because of the brain ef facts i get from it and when i exercise i it is funny because i'm a female an you think that i'd be exercising di ts tate fitin in shapein caroug i care abut my figure about when i exercise literally what i'm thinking about is my brain and i'm this is the best long jacket lungjappany drog there is hat this is at right here ron a you you are always wandering you arealways wenting to now you arewenting to d us lk if you do not exercise you'r missing that essential deubts i an to that for me is is is notovation the do not being seeking thing i i'm looking for aadmittedly i need to i do not do enough strength raining and i have to do it have to have to have to i i'm just and after the endurance in the head i an i i i really new to av that in im because mustlemass is allso extremely important for aging is wile you knowns to that is that is my that is my fault witha the brain effects areally interesting i also run i try nd get one longer run per week ind a few other runs and i do it without a phone i'd onlestin a pod cass i ocasionally will listen a music but i really try not to a i also find that my mind solves problems it i feel lik ul it we washes out the cob webs to speak some of the most am brilliant and prolific ner a scientistat i know who have had very long careers eric candell nowhle prize whenner it columbia comes to mine fr alli's work on memory used to swim a mile a day and now i think swims half a mile a day but he is in his late ninedies and hes still sharp ch is incredible and his lab has done some work showing that any load bearing exercise repeated itso endurance work unlike the pelaton or cycling that is really load bearing all the yeur cycling really hard with the resistance but am causes the release of ostio calson from the bones which acts in and endicran way sort of a hormone can i shald travel to the hyppocampus and at least in these animal studies induce the preliferation of nurons growth of synnaps is beaty enough a number of downstream things which kind of make sense if you we were to put it just evolutionary story o on this a body that is active can signal to the brain that the body still needs cognition an inactive body in some ways is depriving the brain of any signal abut what the body is doing right this is obvious im making the sup is as as conjecture but we know in ocean and veries ocean animals that they will swim around for some period of their life and then they will have a a completely stationary portion of their life and basically the brain degenerates there you do not neen much of a nervous system if you are not moving i think there is really something there and also jas letting your ideas in mind drift a i love that you and i appreciate you shared your protocalls because i think right now were in an interesting time and public health in formation history where people are just gonding getting bombarded with cold as good heat is cold is it cold is good heat is good excuse me i mast spoke a the're all these my crnutriance and of course mackernutrante r important to and to dayye really a enriched us with the description of the underlying mechanisms and the logic behind the but also shuring what you do is really informative because i think people need a jumping off place and ivays ee they mean to start some place and getting heat adaptit et cetera takes time but i reallyappreciate that you are wlling to share your protocles and that you do the things that you that you teach and educate people about as a final question because i have have have to ask red light sona or no red light sana i've been a little bit vocal about my feelings that none of the red light sonas i've ever been in got hot enough and it was frustrating got i feel it is neither here nor there however i do acknowledge that red light and lelet the light therapies are now known to do a number of interesting things was a no about prize in nineteen o eight for phototherapy for lupus you n it is not a new thing the idea that rit light and light could do things a posiv po hour biology but do you have a red light in your sana do you think it is useful and i mentionless because this is the number one question i get about sana red light or no red light or some some intermediate answer i'm i do not have an infe red sana i'm but i do hat iave a sana that has lights it makes red light but i do not think it is the red light that you are talking ogets not activating it at a specific wave ling which is it is usually the the range that seems to be helpful and i have i confess i use a red light panel for other things im is six hundred and seventy nanameter out to about seven hundred and twonny anameter it looks red and very dim pant ta lights dim red and bright red and the ideas that red light can travel the voton an energy is such that it can travel down through the a deeplayers of the derness of the skin i i i do not have a red light in mysna i'm ido not know if it is ecential or not i do not think basin al the sid ys i've talked about i think that would be s is it that the the potential effect on my t condra is interesting i do think there is i'm a lack of really good solid evidence in humans but i dob that not might only be because it is not studied enough and that is usualy the case perhaps there is the ju fra the ju they have those pant red light panels u van cosier the two ones i know caose and you thither at as far as i know pri can insult both companies at the same time but i'd rather insult them both at the same time than than just compliment oner in sult one a both of them seem excellent for getting the appropriate way of langs of red light and i do not have relationship either f out well i i personally think that the the sana in it avitself it is about the heat stress and i'm tipialy the question i get is inferedsana or regular sana and i'm there are some differences well infe redsanas maybe the inferredsanas of the ones that have the red light that you are talking about inferredsanas only get up to around a hundred and forty degrees fair and height i'm as i mention the studies wheree about one seventy fortyrees fair and hight and i'm you really have to stay in a longer period of time however there have been some studies coming out of japan they they use in for redsana they this whole protocall it is called way on therapy and the they they they get people ind nferretzonas and they raplemin a towel and they stay warm for ex mount that is you the whole proticalands that being an hour long but it' again it is a hundred and forty to resparanizes wits an in for etzana and it is been shown to improve a variety of cornery heart disease in conditions heart related conditions theyve been some improvements im obviously there is there is evidence that inferretzonas can be beneficial for cart yo task their health i do i've used inferretzonaas many times at my might in laws they have a infereton and i have to crank that thing up for a while until it is mased and the i have to sit in there for aan hour at least ii do sweat a lot an that is another thing i would n' talk about you do sweat some havy metals in some some ome heavy metals are excreted prodominantly through sweatn others to yearn i'm for example cadmium there is a hundred and twenty five fold increasin catemium excreation from sweat when you get thesna also led is something seventeen fuld excretions higer another one is illuminum its about forfold higherself iinfor red you do sweat a lot to and nots because the dimandifference is that you'r heating your body up through thermal radiation verses the ambiant hair air an a standard sana i's a heater an the heat orteeting up the airn in that sie you are heating yourself up i'm at is a little bit of at a different mechanism i prefer regular sanas most the date out there from from the heat stress itself the your heart rates elevating when you are in th you are feeling hot you aregetting that carto tat slear men hat such a feeling when you arein hot sona an that for me takes a really long time in the inferretzon i get at the feiry end but i do think the are sion bennerfits from infored and they are more fortable their less of a fire hasard but again hop bats or i think a good alternative modality for heat stress a compared to a regular sona great that is a really helpful answer i iu said i used the red light but not in the san and a and thank you for reminding us of that a hundred seventy for degree fair inhi threshold thats mainly used in all these studies we covered a lot of of territory but i just want o thank you again it was extremely thorough and extremely informative i'd now have a my notes are i always look a little bit them they were drawn out by macac monkey who has no knowledge of the english language but i can decipe for this m to tell you that there are at least ten additions to my current protocalls that i'm go ad and i'll have lots of questions ad i pologize an advance for that but ii behalf of the listeners and a just directly from me thank you much for your time i learn to tone my pleasure thinks for having on it as really ossome conversation i enjoy it at lot let us do it again totally great thank you for joining me for
